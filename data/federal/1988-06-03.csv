0,NA,Unknown,"Friday, 3 June 1988 Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing Orders",8
1,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith a motion in the following terms: That this House condemns the Treasurer for his misleading statements in his May economic statement regarding the impact of taxation changes on superannuation benefits. This House has been brought back for a special one-day sitting today at very considerable expense to the Australian public. The one thing that middle Australia wants an explanation of from this Government at this one-day sitting is why the Treasurer (Mr Keating) misled the Parliament about superannuation when he brought down his mini-Budget statement. On the night the mini-Budget was brought down, everybody will remember-",8
2,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"We will accept the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority. Motion of Condemnation",8
3,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"I move: That this House condemns the Treasurer for his misleading statements in his May economic statement regarding the impact of taxation changes on superannuation benefits. 1 thank the Government for giving the Parliament the opportunity to debate something about which a growing number of people in middle Australia are concerned. What they are really concerned about is the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not have the honesty, when he brought down the mini-Budget last Wednesday week, to tell the Australian public exactly what was involved. He wanted the Australian public to believe that suddenly the undertaker had become Mandrake, that somehow or other a magic pudding of superannuation had been discovered, that no matter what the Government did and no matter what new taxes were imposed, miraculously, everybody would be better off; that miraculously the Government would be able to drag $1 billion out of the superannuation pot and put it towards the election bribing taxation cuts which it will undoubtedly offer in 13 months time, and yet everybody would be left exactly as they were previously. The Treasurer gave guarantee after guarantee in his statement last Wednesday and in television and radio interviews that under no circumstances would anybody be the least bit affected by the changes that would be made by the Government. He said: Tonight's announcements will enhance the integrity of the superannuation system without disturbing the end-benefits of contributors, other than those on exceptionally high incomes. In other words, the value of existing and future lump sums and pensions will not be reduced by these changes. He went on to say: This will ensure no detriment to any lump sum or pension end-benefit. He said that there would be no detriment to any lump sum or pension end benefit. He went on to say: This change will not reduce the related end-benefits but will align the structure of superannuation taxation with other forms of savings. Those were the words of the Treasurer of this country last Wednesday week. Everybody knows that those words were misleading. Everybody knows that last Wednesday week we were sold a bill of goods by the Treasurer of this country. He came into this Parliament and misled it. He said, 'I can make these changes. 1I have found the superannuation magic pudding'. But as the fine print has been analysed, not only by middle management all around the country, but by all of the superannuation funds, the truth is coming out. The reality is that the Treasurer misled this Parliament. His own documents demonstrate that he has done so. Anybody who saw his interview on the Sunday program last week will have seen how embarrassed he was when he was told that, on the basis of a comparison made within his own superannuation document, a person on a starting salary of $15,000 a year would be $2,000 worse off as a result of the changes that have been made by him. Yet this is the man who told us last Wednesday week that nobody would be a cent worse off. He repeated that. He said that nobody would be any worse off. 1 say to the Treasurer, and the Opposition says to the Government, 'If you want to change the superannuation rules, that is okay. Bring them into this Parliament; tell us the changes you are going to make; but be honest about the impact of those changes. Do not try to hoodwink the Australian public and tell people that black is white when quite plainly it is not. Do not try to pretend to people that the undertaker has become Mandrake and that overnight he can find some magic pudding, when in reality he cannot'. If the Treasurer thinks that this is only the complaint of the Opposition, I invite Government members, particularly those in marginal seats, to look at some of the reactions from the superannuation funds.",8
4,Unknown,TREASURER,Government members interjecting,9
5,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"We get a chorus of greatly enthusiastic interjection from honourable members opposite as soon as I mention superannuation funds. Perhaps they have not read what the director of the largest manager of superannuation funds in Australia, Mr Crivelli of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd, had to say the other day. Those opposite ought to listen to this because he was talking about the people that they are supposed to represent: the workers, the people on low incomes, who are the beneficiaries-so those opposite believe-of this great new era of 3 per cent productivity. Honourable members opposite ought to listen to what he had to say: Most people on low incomes tend to go for capital guaranteed or stable capital funds. He then went on to say: In most cases there is a minimal imputation cover available; thus at one stroke the Treasurer has introduced a tax on those least able to afford it. They are the people those opposite are supposed to represent and the people they said this statement was designed to help. What those opposite have done is introduce, on those funds where the great bulk of investment is in capital and not in equities, a tax of a very regressive kind. These are the words of people who have analysed these changes. The reality is that the statement the Treasurer made last Wednesday week was patently dishonest. He made no attempt to tell the Australian public precisely the impact of these changes. Did he tell the Australian public or any of the superannuation fund managers that in most cases the proportion of funds invested in equities would have to be increased from about 30 per cent to over 50 per cent? Did he say that? Of course he did not. If the Treasurer wants superannuation funds to move the level of risk from 30 per cent in equities to 50 per cent in equities, which represents a very significantly more risky portfolio investment by most superannuation funds, why did he not have the honesty to tell the Parliament and the public that? Why did he pretend to us that nobody would be a cent worse off? Why did he come in here with all his smooth-talking nonsense for which he is famous and for which over the years he has time and time again been revealed to be wrong? Why did the Treasurer not come clean about this matter? But that would be too much to expect of the Treasurer. Why did he use an assumption about earnings which is extremely conservative and conducive to his own case? His assumption about earnings was 10 per cent on an inflation rate of 8 per cent, which gives a real return of 2 per cent. But that runs against the experience of superannuation funds over recent years. Why did he not tell the Australian public that many people who have gone into the low income funds will be worse off? It is not surprising that as a result of the changes announced by the Treasurer the Government has had a veritable spate of criticism. This criticism has not so much been about the desire of the Government because nobody would be against the Government wanting to make sensible change in this area, but about why on earth they have been misled? Why did he allow the Secretary of his own Department to be embarrassed at a seminar in Sydney on Friday morning? When Mr Fraser said to 500 people attending a Business Review Weekly seminar that nobody will be any worse off as a result of these changes, about 490 laughed in his face. Why would he allow the permanent head of his Department to be put in that embarrassing situation? It is little wonder, therefore, that there has been a spate of criticism of these changes. The superannuation industry wants the changes delayed. Analyst after analyst has said that the super tax will not help the poor and the workers. Mr Trevally said that the new 15 per cent tax on funds' investment earnings would have its greatest impact on the retirement savings of lower income earners, including those in trade union schemes. The headlines go on: 'The reforms will affect death and disablement benefits', 'Controversy grows over the Treasurer's superannuation tax changes'. According to the analysis of people who know this industry better than anybody in this Parliament and, it appears, certainly better than the Treasurer, it is quite plain that union superannuation funds-the ones Labor believed were going to change the world for the salaried work force of Australia because they have a low proportion or no proportion of their investments at all in Australia equities-will be hit hardest of all. The whole basis of the Treasurer's changes is posited on investment managers making dramatic changes in the portfolio combinations and compositions of their investments. The only way they can do that is to take their funds into a far riskier level of investment. If the Treasurer wanted superannuation funds in Australia to change the investment practices of decades, if he wanted them to partake in more risky forms of investment, if he wanted them to abandon the prudential mix which has been the hallmark of superannuation investment over the years and has been one of the reasons why so many Australians have been attracted into superannuation, he should have had the candour last Wednesday week to come into this Parliament and tell the Australian public that. But instead, typically and true to his form on other issues, he tried to persuade the Australian public that we could literally take $1 billion out of the superannuation area without any impact at all; that we could increase the tax or introduce two new taxes, or three new taxes in the case of certain forms of superannuation benefits, and at the end of the day there would be absolutely no change at all to anybody's end benefit. It is therefore barely surprising that analyst after analyst has complained about the nature of the changes that have been made by the Treasurer. It is barely surprising that we hear the sorts of comments we have from Mr Dillon, a principal of Mercer Campbell Cook and Knight, one of the best known superannuation consultants in Australia. It is worthwhile for those on the opposite side of the Parliament who think that the Treasurer has got away with this deception of the Parliament and the people to listen to these words, because they analyse the dilemma in which many fund managers have been placed by the changes made by the Treasurer. Mr Dillon had this to say: Trustees do have onerous investment responsibilities. However trustees will now have to consider investing heavily over 50 per cent in Australian equities to gain significant benefits from offsetting imputation credits against the new tax on investment income and employer contributions. This may well lead to unsound investment policies, especially but not only for accumulation funds where the volatility of investment returns could hurt members. On the other hand, prudent trustees might tend to incur higher taxes. That represents a moral and financial dilemma. Does anybody on the opposite side think it is satisfactory to force fund managers to make a choice between prudential security for their members and paying a higher level of tax? Mr Robert Brown-It is not the choice.",9
6,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"It is the choice. I say to the honourable member for Charlton-and he is an honest member of the Government Party-that it is the real dilemma that many investment managers of the smaller superannuation funds are going to face. At the moment many of those small funds do not have any money invested in equities. What the Government's changes are going to do-the honourable member is nodding in agreement with what I am saying-is force those fund managers either to incur a higher rate of tax and therefore a lower rate of return for their members or, in order to avoid that, to go into a far riskier box of investments. There is no real alternative. The Treasurer cannot have it both ways. The Treasurer said, 'Oh, you can escape the 15 per cent tax'. In his convoluted language he said, 'You can take the 15 and the 30 at the end and you can up front it and front load it onto the 15 and the 30 at the top and you can take the nought and the 15 and change it all around'. Nobody understands what that means, but what people do understand is that as a result of the Keating changes, which he said would not rob anybody of Ic, that is the only way in which they can avoid paying higher tax. It is not the big fellows; it is a lot of the small guys that the Government is supposed to represent that are going to get it in the neck as a result of these changes. When they analyse the fine print of this even further, when they find out how the Treasurer is going to rob them blind with these changes, they will not be very impressed because they will realise that the only way that they can avoid paying a higher level of tax is to put their hardearned savings into far riskier investments. That is the moral and financial dilemma that will face numerous fund managers all around Australia. Government members can talk here and in the new building as long as they like and it will not alter that simple fact because the Treasurer knows and the honourable member for Charlton knows that the only way people can avoid paying that higher tax is dramatically to increase-Mr Robert Brown-It is not dramatic.",10
7,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,The honourable member is nodding. Mr Robert Brown-It is not dramatic.,10
8,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,The honourable member says it is not dramatic. One has to go from 30 per cent to 50 per cent-Mr Robert Brown-Thirty to 40.,10
9,Madam SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Charlton will cease interjecting.,10
10,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"That is a two-thirds increase, and the honourable members says it is not dramatic! The only way people will avoid the tax is to go to 50 per cent and that will result in putting at risk and throwing to the volatility of the share market-and the honourable member is not saying that the share market is not volatile!-the hard-earned investments of many many low income earners. I would say to all those who sit opposite and who claim to represent-albeit a very hollow claim these days-the interests of blue collar workers and of middle Australia tha(they have seen only the beginnings of a backlash against these changes. What people resent most of all is the fact that they were misled by the Treasurer. If he had come into this Parliament and said, 'I am going to make these changes and they will make superannuation less attractive; I am going to reverse the philosophy of May 1983', perhaps the public, particularly the people who are affected by these changes, would have been a little more willing to accept them. But of course in reality the Treasurer was not candid enough to do that. Let me remind honourable members of what he said: . . . it will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money-now lying superannuation funds-without diminishing any personal end-benefit by one cent. That is the statement he made. Honourable members opposite know that it is wrong. He knew it was wrong when he made it last Wednesday week and fund after fund is now demonstrating that it is wrong. Let me give the example of a small businessman aged 40 earning $35,000 a year-it cannot be said that that is an enormous salary these days-and entering a fund. Projecting forward to age 65 on a decent earnings rate, he will be worse off to the tune of about $124,000 as a result of the changes that have been made by the Treasurer. Now, 124,000 times 100 is an awful lot of cents. Yet the Treasurer said last Wednesday week that that man would not be worse off. How does' he explain away the example in his own documents? How do Government members explain away the example that was put to the Treasurer on the Sunday program last week? They cannot explain it away. There, in black and white, in his own document, is proof that a guy on $15,000 a year will be worse off under the changes that have been made by the Treasurer. If the Treasurer is going to rob people on that level of income of their savings, why did he say to hundreds of thousands of people, on prime time television, that they will not be any worse off when, in reality, they will be worse off? The Opposition brings forward this motion because it is principally concerned at this stage about the way in which the Treasurer has misled the Parliament. We do not object to intelligent changes to the taxation of superannuation, but we do object to a Treasurer who has misled the public. We do object to a Treasurer who says that nobody will lose lc when, firstly, his own documents prove that he has misled the Parliament on that issue and, secondly, any serious analysis by anybody who understands the superannuation industry knows that the only possible way in which the Treasurer's commitment can be met by the great majority of superannuation funds is for the fund managers, particularly those managing the investments of low income earners, dramatically to increase the component of their investment in Australian equities.",10
11,Unknown,TREASURER,Government members interjecting,11
12,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"In many cases what is wrong with that is that one will expose the investments of low income people to a far greater risk. The Minister's interjection confirms that that was the intention of the Government. I am glad that that has been confirmed. What is really being in said is that the only way that the Government can stop Keating being demonstrated to be a liar and to have misled this Parliament is to invite the managers of the savings of low income earners in the community to put those savings at far greater risk. If that is the policy of the Australian Labor Party on that issue, I and my colleagues on this side of the House could not be more delighted. We thank the Minister for confirming that by way of interjection.",11
13,Madam SPEAKER,TREASURER,Is the motion seconded?,11
14,Mr CONNOLLY,TREASURER,"1 second the motion, Madam Speaker. Last Wednesday night the Treasurer (Mr Keating) came into this House and told the Australian people two most important facts. Firstly, he alleged that the reforms he was introducing would take this nation forward into the twenty-first century. In relation to superannuation and long term retirement income planning for the Australian people, he said that no-one's end benefit would be reduced by lc as a result of the changes he was introducing to superannuation planning. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has made it abundantly clear that that statement cannot stand close investigation. Our position is supported across the land by every major superannuation fund. A few days ago there was a meeting in Sydney arranged by the Association of Superannuation Industry of Australia which was attended by over 400 people representing the major banks, the superannuation funds, the insurance industry, and people who are interested in the whole question of superannuation. To a person, they declared absolutely that the changes being introduced, the changes being forced upon the Australian people at this time, will be the death knell of superannuation if, as this Government claims, it is to be seen merely as a supplement and an addition to retirement income planning in Australia. The saddest point about this whole issue is that the Government, once again, after five years of constant change in the area of superannuation, has utterly failed to face the demographic facts that over the next 10 years one-third of Australian people will be over the age of 45 and most of them will be retired, and as we enter the twenty-first century, that halcyon period that was forecast last Wednesday by the Treasurer, there will be more people out of the work force being supported by fewer people in the work force than has been the case this century. We are facing a demographic disaster. It is now, not in the twenty-first century, that our people must be encouraged to plan ahead, that the Australian work force must be encouraged to enter into superannuation arrangements, not get out of them. These fundamental facts have been ignored at this most critical time. For the benefit of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), let us just look at the facts. Only a few weeks ago the Australian Bureau of Statistics tabled figures which showed conclusively that the attraction of superannuation, under the existing taxation arrangements, is not what it was in the past. The figures demonstrated that the growth of superannuants was a mere 3 per cent. We are told by this Government, 'Don't worry, we have got this glorious 3 per cent productivity scheme coming into place. That will bring in another million people'. What rot! Let us look at the facts. Many of those people are already superannuated under employer schemes. Some new people will come in, but the level of coverage which they will have will not be an adequate alternative to retirement income through the age pension. That is the problem and that is the fundamental difference between the Opposition parties and the Government. We want people to be able to go into superannuation with a clear understanding that that will give them independence from government in retirement. The Government's view is to the contrary. Mr Robert Brown-You told them not to.",11
15,Mr CONNOLLY,TREASURER,"The Government which the honourable member for Charlton supports did exactly the opposite. The Government's policy is simply this, and the Treasurer emphasised it last week when he said, 'We don't mind if superannuation is not an alternative to retirement income through the pension. We see superannuation as nothing more than a supplement'. It is a supplement which costs us over $3.2 billion in lost revenue, a supplement which, on his own figures last week, is now extended to over $4 billion. He has utterly failed to put in place, therefore, a policy that is in any sense meaningful. Let it be understood that while this Treasurer is called the undertaker of the Australian Labor Party, these parties in Opposition are not going to stand by and allow the Government to bury superannuation for the Australian people. We are not going to stand by and allow the Government to destroy 30 to 40 years of financial planning by hundreds of thousands of Australians. I am not talking about just the tall poppies that the Government finds so objectionablethose earning over $35,OOO-but ordinary bluecollar workers, the ordinary people going into its 3 per cent productivity schemes, the ordinary people who ask nothing more than that their right to choose how they will live in retirement and what funds they will have for retirement should rest essentially with them. The Government has the gall and the audacity to come in here and say, 'We are introducing a system that will be tax neutral, that is not going to take 1c even from any superannuant'. What rubbish! How can it distort facts to such an extent? How can it lie on a matter such as this? Government members-Withdraw!",12
16,Madam SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,12
17,Mr CONNOLLY,TREASURER,"Since the word 'lie' is obviously objectionable to those opposite, for reasons which they feel very sensitive about, I will withdraw it.",12
18,Madam SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The word is objectionable to the Chair.,12
19,Mr CONNOLLY,TREASURER,"I will withdraw it. Madam Speaker, on page 45-Mr Donald Cameron-Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. What word can the honourable member use instead of 'lie'?",12
20,Madam SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! Let me point out to the honourable member for Moreton that that is a frivolous point of order. He is misusing the forms of the House.,12
21,Mr CONNOLLY,TREASURER,"On page 45 of the Treasurer's grand document entitled Reform of the Taxation of Superannuation, he gave us three examples to show that nobody will be losing. He talked about employer contribution schemes, employee contribution schemes and joint funding schemes. The most extraordinary thing is this: the figures that he quoted were in relation to the first group which I emphasise for the benefit of those listening are covered principally by the NA Years Service 20 Employer Contributions. Existing Super Benefit Proposed Benefit % difference + or 30 Employer Contributions. Existing Super Benefit Proposed Benefit % difference + or 40 Employer Contributions . Existing Super Benefit Proposed Benefit % difference + or ",13
22,Mr CONNOLLY,CONCESSIONS TO SUPERANNUATION UNDER,"These figures are absolutely devastating. They demonstrate that a person with up to 20 years service on an income of 515,000 will lose approximately $2,000 over that period; over 30 years he will lose $13,000 and over 40 years he will lose up to $44,000. Honourable members should remember those words because we were told by the Treasurer last week that no-one would lose I c. We can extend the same exercise to people on incomes between 530,000 and 545,000 using, I emphasise, exactly the same assumptions-not my assumptions but the Treasurer's assumptions. Upon those assumptions he made the outrageous remark that nobody would lose Ic. Yet it is perfectly clear that if one is on an income of $45,000, over 40 years one will lose $188,000. If one is on an income of $30,000, over 40 years one loses $65,000. And we are told, 'Don't worry; everything will be all right'. The Treasurer goes a step further. He says that everything will be all right because the funds, through imputation, now have the opportunity to make different arrangements so they can maximise results. There are a number of key elements in this area which the Government has quite clearly ignored. Under the existing superannuation leg3 per cent productivity schemes and include low income workers on $15,000 a year income. Even on the basis of the Treasurer's own figures, over 20 years those people will lose. I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard. It includes the same figures which I have extrapolated forward to people who have had superannuation for over 40 years. Leave granted. The table read as followsEXISTING & PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS AFTER 20, 30 & 40 YEARS-(ROUNDED FIGURES) Starting Salary $15,000 $30,000 $45,000 6.5% 9.5% 14.5% $88,000 $248,000 $520,000 $86,000 $254,000 $526,000 -2.1% +2.7% +1.0% $-2,(00) 6.5% 9.5% 14.5% $317,000 $837,000 $1,817,000 $304,000 $836,000 $1,796,000 -3.9% -0.1% -1.1% $-13,(00) ($-1,000) ($-21,000) 6.5% 9.5% 14.5% $994,000 $2,587,000 $5,709,000 $950,000 $2,522,000 $5,521,000 -4.4% -2.5% -3.3% $-44,(00) ($-65,000) ($-188,000) islation passed through the Parliament last year and the regulations now in place, it is the primary responsibility of fund managers to look to the protection of their investments. We are told by this Treasurer that plenty of Australian equity will be subject to imputation and that, therefore, fund managers will have no problem. People in the Treasury do not understand the intricacies of superannuation and have not bothered to talk to the industry in recent months about the changes they proposed to introduce. There has been no discussion whatsoever. Yet the boffins of the Treasury have gone ahead on this exercise and built an analysis that plenty of Australian equity will be subject to imputation and, therefore, those who manage funds will have no problem. That is nonsense, and the honourable member for Chariton, who is nodding his head, knows it. There is a finite limit to the amount of equity available in blue chip shares on the Australian stock market. It might be true that in absolute terms there is a much wider range of shares, but that misses the point of protection. It misses the fundamental question as to how much of the protection of their investment the Government is asking managers to give up in return for trying to increase dividends to cover the new tax. The Government has effectively put in place a tax-driven philosophy for superannuation investment, not a philosophy based on protection of the investor. That is a fundamental change of approach. How would one like to be a contributor who had to retire, say, last October or November after the crash? The amount one would have taken out of one's sum would have been substantially less. The Government is now saying to every contributor or beneficiary, to the 2.3 million Australians across this nation who have superannuation, 'Don't worry about security, ladies and gentlemen. We are asking your funds to take out their funds from property investment, from overseas, and from government paper and put it in the stock market, because the stock market will be the safest place to put your money'. The Government is saying to those 2.3 million people, 'Don't worry about superannuation. Go to the races on Saturday and put your money there and you will probably do better'. The Government has taken security from what was meant to be long term planning. The Treasurer, who has now come into the House, makes assertions about a 4O-year planning period, which is what we are talking about with superannuation. He stands up in this House and puts down estimates based on assumptions, perfect assumptions in terms of what the Government wanted to achieve-or that is what it thought, until, as I pointed out, it realised got its numbers wrong on page 45 as well. The Government has now made people's futures absolutely insecure. From now on, fewer people, not more people, will go into viable superannuation. The demand on the public sector for funds to pay adequate pensions will be greater. We now spend $6 billion a year on providing age pensions to approximately 66 per cent of our retired people. What the Government is doing now is preventing the remainder of those retired people, and those in the work force today, from having confidence in the system. There is no reason why they should have confidence in superannuation any more. Over the last five years the Government has decimated this area. In May 1983 it introduced an arrangement which considerably increased its tax take and brought chaos to those who administer superannuation. In May 1988 it has done precisely the same thing. The outcome of all this is simple. In those five years this Government has increased its tax take on superannuation by approximately 1,000 per cent. I believe that there is no government in the Western world that could compete with that-increasing tax on superannuation by 1,000 per cent and then having the gall to say nobody is going to lose Ic. People do not trust the Treasurer. They do not. believe the Treasurer. As I said in my opening remarks, the Treasurer may see himself as the undertaker of the Australian Labor Party. We cannot be responsible and stand by and allow him to bury superannuation. The only long term, viable alternative to forcing people onto the public payroll for old age pensions, when they do not want to be there, is to give an alternative. Rod Atfield in an article in the Australian Financial Review of I June stated quite aptly, and I think most people agree with him: In my opinion, either the Treasurer does not understand the detail and effects of the statement, or he has not been completely truthful in that remark. The fact is that there are very many people whose personal end-benefits will be affected adversely. That is a demonstrable fact. That is becoming evident as more and more people do an in-depth analysis of what these changes in fact add up to. The saddest thing of all is that in five years not one attempt has been made to get even rudimentary bipartisan support for the principles of retirement income planning. The Government ignored its own committee. Although the Government established a committee to talk to the industry on matters that it ought to have been consulted on, the Government did not talk to it. The Government has gone ahead and put these it had changes in place. The Government is worrying the socks off hundreds of thousands of Australians who want to be independent in their retirement. The Government has put in place a set of assumptions which will not stand the test of time. With the failure of those assumptions we will see the failure of the Government's policy objectives. Yes, if the Government's objective was to increase tax, it gets 100 out of 100 for trying. If the Government's objective was to put in place a viable retirement income strategy for present and future generations of Australians, to save for the future to pay for the problems of an ageing population, then the Government gets zero out of 100. The Government is a disaster for Australia. The sooner it changes its policy back to where it was, the better.",13
23,Mr KEATING,CONCESSIONS TO SUPERANNUATION UNDER,"We have just heard a speech by one of the little people of the Opposition. Before we heard the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), we heard the littlest person of them all in the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). The Opposition's role in Australian public life has never been about anything uplifting or good. It has always been concerned with cynical, disparaging, backbiting stuff; that is its game-the spoiling game in Australian economic and social life. That is the game the Opposition has always played. The Opposition has never been interested in decent social or economic policy. Whenever a government has put such policies forward, the Opposition has tried to tear them down. The capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and all the other decent things this Government has done in tax law the Opposition has tried to destroy. For the first time the Commissioner of Taxation and the Australian Taxation Office are saying that we now have a decent background in law; that we have a broad-based system of taxation from which the conceptional holes-the open, gaping holes of capital gains, fringe benefits and massive avoidance opportunities in the company law-have been removed. The Opposition left them there for years when it was in government. It was never prepared to change any of them. In fact, when the Opposition was in office the tax system was like a lump of gruyere cheese with anyone of ability crawling through it. There was also massive criminal avoidance in the tax system from 1975 until 1983. There was massive criminal avoidance on a scale unprecedented. We had losses in this country, in nominal terms, even greater than the United States-a country with an economy 20 times as large-because the then Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition, turned his back on the corruption that was going on in the tax system, undertaken mainly, of course, by supporters of the Liberal Party of Australia. Today the Opposition is back in here on the question of superannuation. I just heard the honourable member for-I even forget the name of his seat; it is somewhere on the North Shoretalking about blue-collar workers, ordinary workers. Here we have the lice of the conservative parties coming in here and talking about working people and working interests. They come in here and talk about benefits for working pebpie. When we came to office four people in 10 had superannuation coverage. By the end of this Parliament it will be eight in 10. We have now given every worker access to occupational superannuation through the 3 per cent schemes. The Opposition left it for all the top slotters. They could get superannuation, but nobody else could. Then those opposite left the tax treatment so outrageously concessionary, with a marginal rate on 5 per cent of the sum, that they knew basically it was put on there only for the big headers and would not last. We changed the tax treatment in 1983 to give superannuation permanence in the Australian tax and social security system, and we have got that. This attack on me is just a mealy-mouthed attack under privilege, the kind of thing I expect from these low-lifes opposite. In the House I said: That is, it will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money . . . because this change has two parts to it: a bringing forward of the 1983 deferred tax arrangements and the tax of 15 per cent on the funds. I repeat what I said: That is, it will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money-now lying in superannuation fundsnot contributors' money, the Government's moneywithout diminishing any personal end-benefit by one cent. That is absolutely true. It is correct. It has been endorsed by every member of the industryNational Mutual, the AMP Society, every actuary. The only person who has got it wrong is the honourable member for Bradfield. I sent him a note yesterday about 10 errors and 10 replies to his errors. I will read them in a moment. This is what I said about the other part, the 15 per cent tax on funds: The Government has therefore decided to bring superannuation funds within the full ambit of the imputation system, giving them access to dividend tax credits. To achieve this a tax of 15 per cent will apply to fund earnings. But his 15 per cent tax can be neutralised or offset by the receipt of dividend tax credits. It can be neutralised or offset. I said further: For most superannuation funds this will mean in practice no tax at all on investment earnings. For others the rate will be minimal,not lc but minimaland can readily be adjusted to zero by including more Australian company shares in their investment portfolios. This will ensure no detriment to any lump sum or pension end-benefit. What the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition have sought to do is to try to use the quotation from the bringing forward about the lc to apply to the 15 per cent tax on funds, where in fact I did not mislead the House at all. What I indicated was the position as it is right this very second; that is, superannuation funds can in practice adjust their tax down by changing the balance of their portfolios. The talk about lc in the speech relates to the bringing forward. That just illustrates again the dishonesty of the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in seeking to get up under privilege and make these points. Let me say a couple of other things about the changes. I have the results from modelling the changes through the National Mutual computers. This is what National Mutual says: National Mutual endorses the basic objectives identified by the Government in maintaining a viable retirement incomes policy which encourages self-provision for retirement. Overall we believe the package achieves this and importantly avoids retrospective impact. It says: Overall we believe the package achieves this and avoids retrospective impact. That is what the second largest of the life offices and superannuation funds in this country had to say. Let me read from Bankers Trust Australia Ltd. The Leader of the Opposition cited this on the Schildberger program the other day when he said that Bankers Trust did not see it the way the Government saw it. Mr Hogan, the Deputy Managing Director of Bankers Trust, in a speech he gave on the Government's economic statement, said: In particular, the changes in the corporate tax rate and taxation of super funds in combination with the previously introduced capital gains tax and dividend imputation will have positive and far-reaching effects on the Australian economy. He goes on: Benefits will flow from the following factors. First, it will force the entrepreneurial takeover class to shift its emphasis from targets offering tax shelter potential to targets offering potential for rationalisation. Second, jor superannuation fund investors will be compelled to take a greater interest in the quality of corporate management. The option of you voting on your feet-that is, selling underperforming assets-has become less attractive. He went on and on with the most glowing assessment of the Government's changes. He is from one of the bodies which the Leader of the Opposition has been prepared to quote. In conclusion, Mr Hogan rightly said: Nothing can be judged to be good or bad except by comparison. If our standard of comparison for the May statement is the economic policy of the last 20 years and policies that are politically feasible in Australia in 1988, then the May economic statement is a fine achievement. If the standard of comparison is what is required to lift Australian living standards as far as possible by the end of the century . . . He went on to talk about a couple of caveats that that body would put on it. In other words, it was a big endorsement. A report in today's Australian on an address by Mr Loton, the Managing Director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, said this: The reduction in the company tax rate from 49 to 39 per cent had removed one of the last big institutional obstacles to Australian companies competing internationally, according to . . . Mr Loton. The article went on to say: . . . corporate tax reform was the most tangible and important affirmation of the Federal Government's commitment to an open economy. He said the tax cut had changed the overall framework for Australian business forever. ""It was always true that, for Australia as a whole, international competitiveness of the major industries has been a long-term necessity."" Mr Loton went on to talk about it as being the style of things to come. The article continued: His strongest praise was for the floating of the Australian dollar. It is hard to overstate the significance of the ending of the regime of fixed exchange rates, under which the dollar was supported at artificially high levels for long periods of time. The head of Australia's largest company is pouring it all over Opposition members, saying basically, by implication, that they are duds-which, of course, we on this side of the House all know. The opposition rails about superannuation changes. The honourable member for Bradfield has appeared on radio programs crying about blue-collar interests. He is a joker from the North Shore. He is from Bradfield, where there would not be a house in any street worth under or $800,000. He does not see workers, except those he passes in his car on his way to the airport. These fops are telling us about workers, the interests of working people and their access to maretirement benefits. Let me run through a few errors. These say more than anything about the abilities of the honourable member for Bradfield. It is no wonder he has never made ministerial rank. He has always moulded on the back bench of the Opposition. If his performance today is any guide, he will be there for a lot longer. The honourable member's first error was his claim that the Government imposes a 16.25 per cent tax on an employer's contribution when it goes into the scheme. Fact: there will be a tax at the rate of 15 per cent on deductable contributions, payable by the fund. This will be more than offset by the reduction in tax on end benefits. Error No. 2 was that the Government then taxes what is left of the dividend, after that, another 16.25 per cent. Fact: the deductable contribution is taxed once and once only, at the rate of 15 per cent. The third error was to state: . . . if you only have $60,000 lump sum at the end of your period of service, you can take that money without further tax. That's provided your income is below $35,000. Fact: the honourable member is completely confused about the impact of the reasonable benefits limits (RBL). As clearly set out in the paper Reform of the Taxation of Superannuation released with the May statement, the changes to the RBLs reduce the maximum allowable lump sum only for people on salaries of $70,000 or more. Error No. 4 was to say: People whose income is more than $35,000 ... will have to pay an additional 16.25 per cent to take their lump sum. Fact: once again, the honourable member has misunderstood the impact of the reasonable benefits limits. In any case, if the RBLs are exceeded the sanction is taxation of the excess at the retiree's marginal rate. It is not at all clear where the figure of 16.25 per cent comes from. He does not understand any of it. Error No. 5 was to say that if a lump sum is taken out of a superannuation fund and put into an approved deposit fund (ADF), that fund will then be subject to yet another 16.25 per cent tax. Fact: no further tax is payable when a lump sum is rolled over into an ADF on the assumption that 15 per cent would have already been paid when the employer contributions were first placed in the fund. The honourable member's sixth error was to say that I was assuming that superannuation funds will pay only 4 per cent tax and that this was a very dubious assumption. Fact: The 4 per cent effective tax rate is not an assumption; it is a Treasury calculation based on the present portfolio structure and income flows of the superannuation industry-that is, it does not rely on any behavioural response. Any such response, such as including more Australian shares in the portfolio, reduces the effective tax rate below the 4 per cent figure. Error No. 7 was to say: I can't find anybody that's better off . . . that is, as a result of these arrangements. Fact: that is an extraordinary statement. The honourable member is ignoring the statements of virtually the entire superannuation industry and, clearly, has no understanding of the tables in the Treasury documents. It goes on. There are' 10 errors and 10 corrections. These are the bunnies representing the Opposition on the public airwaves, on radio. They do not apply themselves to sitting down and understanding the changes and what they really mean; rather, they race around, running off at the mouth and trying to frighten people. The main change here is to the imputation system. This Government has removed the double tax on dividends. That was the major corporate change of 1985. Superannuation funds could not receive imputed dividend credits. Their members could not receive the benefit of buying into the Australian equities market. We cannot have the tail wagging the dog. We have changed the tax treatment of superannuation to receive those imputed credits. Therefore, taxation treatment of superannuation had to adjust. Otherwise, the funds would stream the credits to themselves through tax avoidance opportunities. That is why the change has been made. It will not jeopardise the viability of the funds. It is nonsense to say that they need to take a higher level of ingestion of Australian shares. They need only to marginally adjust their portfolios to make sure that there is no detriment to their contributors. Those are the facts. I know that the Opposition has always hated the equities market, public companies and the share market. It never did anything for the market. It always taxed dividend income 78c in the dollar-that is, 46c and then 60c on the balance-and now that we have a scheme which lets superannuation into the equities market, it wants to stop or injure it. The Opposition should gets its priorities right. It should talk to its supporters and let them say what they think about these changes. Mr Loton has told the Opposition today what he thinks about it. The foreign exchange market and everyone else have told the Opposition. It is about time it learnt a few things. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the question be now put.

Question so resolved in the negative. BROADCASTING (OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL) BILL 1988 Debate resumed from 25 May, on motion by  That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Blunt had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that all television audience reach restrictions should be removed to allow a potential 100% audience reach for all competitors on the conditions that: (1) the Government's moratorium on the introduction of pay and cable television be removed; (2) the existing television licensing procedures be substantially streamlined; (3) cross-media rules between pay and cable television and existing free-to-air broadcasters be introduced subject to 'grandfathering' of existing holdings; and (4) when the process of aggregation has been completed, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal conduct an inquiry into issuing new television licences in metropolitan markets, subject to a final decision being made by the Government'.",14
24,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,"1I have some concluding remarks to make on comments 1 was making in the House last Wednesday evening on the Government's Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill. 1 want to reiterate three points. 1 saw Press comments over the weekend from the group of people called 'Free The Media'. 1 was very pleased to see on comment specifically being made in which it was recognised that the most important part of this legislation, the cross-media bans, are working and are having the effect that was intended. 1 would like to spell out again the aspects of this legislation that I rise to speak strongly in favour of. As 1 mentioned the other evening, I am totally supportive of the Government's attempts to broaden the range of television viewing available to country viewers. Through this legislation we will in time provide for country viewers to have a range of programs available, not only from the Australian Broadcasting CorSnow. J. H. Snowdon. W. E. poration (ABC) and the existing one station that services them at the moment, but also from at least two other major national channels. Whether the Opposition understands it or not, that will be widely welcomed in regional and provincial areas. The other aspect that 1 alluded to the other night is the cross-media bans. Again 1 point out to the House that from my own experience 1I have seen a very real example where management in control of television was prepared to implement editorial bans. The particular case I am alluding to was a trade union that Second Reading 1 worked for. We were in an unpopular position with the manager of one of the network television stations. He told our union secretary that not only would we not get coverage on his television channel but also we would not again see our point of view carried in the newspaper that station controlled, nor would our point of view to view be carried on the radio station which it controlled. Mr Donald Cameron-1 believe that.",18
25,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,That happened; it is a very real example. I am glad that the honourable member opposite acknowledges that it did happen. Mr Donald Cameron-It can happen.,18
26,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,"It can happen. A very real factor in the Government's cross-media bans is that we have now put in place legislation which prohibits ownership across the media in a particular area. That is why we have seen a confusing divesting of interests. This will lead to a mutual independence, which I think is the way to describe it, and in my view the newspapers will run their particular stories for the day, which will be picked up by talkback radio and all the others. They will be running their own themes for the day quite independently, and television will be running its own. There has been a lot of confusion about audience reach. The impression has been created that under our networking proposal a television proprietor could in some way control up to 100 per cent of Australia's television audience. Let me make quite clear what our audience reach proposal means. Having in place a 75 per cent or 60 per cent rule, or whatever, means we can now have networking across Australia not just the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service national channels but also at least three major commercial channels. That means that, at best, any single televiislation sion proprietor or station has a one in four chance of getting 70 per cent of the potential audience reach. If, let us say, the nine network is so wonderful and presents such marvellous programs that everybody switches onto it, of course it will have a massive audience reach, but it will just not happen that way. There will be a block of people who traditionally watch the ABC as there is now-and that will not only continue but in my view expand-there will be a block of people who will, as they have done traditionally, watch Channel 7, Channel 9 or Channel 10; and some will jump stations. So at any stage the potential to reach a certain part of the audience will be limited to roughly 25 per cent of the network's potential reach. As to the final benefit of networking, while we had the two-station rule in place, while a proprietor could operate only two stations across two cities, it was not economically viable to get into film or program production because there was not the audience reach to make that possible. By opening up the networks, by making it possible for programs, via the network, to go right across the nation, we have given the television industry the chance to have sufficient audience and sufficient advertising reach to make it viable to produce Australian programs not only for domestic viewing, for Australian consumption, but also for export. In summary, I have raised three points. In my view by far the most important part of the legislation concerns the cross-media bans. It is now acknowledged even by the group that is running the campaign to 'keep the media free' that the cross-media bans are a key element of the package and a good thing. Secondly, the capacity now to network is an important factor. Thirdly, we have the opening up of television, with a range of choice across the broad provincial and regional networks of Australia. That is very widely welcomed by the people in those areas. For all those reasons, I make it clear that I strongly support the legislation.",18
27,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"lt is my pleasure to speak on the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill on this last day in the old Parliament House. I thought I had the honour last week of asking the last question in this House, but the Australian Labor Party seems to continue to stuff up the governing of Australia and for some reason or another has had to call the Parliament back. I suppose after today's sitting we will be back again next week to discuss some more of the Government's legthat has been bundled, half-done, over to the Senate, as has been the case with the referenda Bills. They are coming back here today, great mistakes having been made in them and the Senate having had to change them this week.",19
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The House is debating the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill. The honourable member will confine his remarks to that Bill.,19
29,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"Of course, the Labor Party also continues to mess around with radio and television broadcasting in this nation. It has been at it ever since it came to office, and we have yet another Bill on this matter to be debated. It is my intention to cover some of the aspects of television in my electorate. We have been battling for years just to get one commercial channel, let alone three or four. The people in the metropolitan areas complain about services, and we hear all about aggregation and equalisation and about Skase wanting to increase his coverage from 60 per cent to 75 per cent and perhaps up to lOOper cent, yet we still battle to get just one commercial television channel in outback Queensland. The National Party of Australia wrung itself dry when it had to support the Labor Party in the Senate some 12 months ago to allow 60 per cent television coverage, and of course Skase went ahead and brought all those stations and expected us to increase coverage to 75 per cent. That is just not on at this time. We believe we had to make a hard decision at the time to go to 60 per cent. In that legislation we were promised all sorts of things, including equalisation and three channels. My Channel 10 station in Toowoomba is expected to bring a couple more channels to the area. As yet I have not seen anything happening in that regard. These channels are meant to come into operation by 1990 but I have not seen any evidence of two extra channels in the rural areas of Queensland. We still have the one channel we have always had. I have not even seen any moves to buy new equipment to provide these extra channels, but let us hope that that happens. The Bill increases the number of radio licences able to be controlled from eight to 16. One of the problems we have with expanding the FM radio band is delays in the Department of Transport and Communications. It seems to take the Department forever to issue licences to community groups who wish to set up an FM broadcasting station. My main concern with the Bill concerns NQTV, the commercial satellite company which is telecasting from Townsville. It is doing an excellent job. It has been on the air only since April. I congratulate David Ashley and his company on making this operation possible at long last. We have been battling for three to four years with a consortium of regional television stations as well as city stations to get this one signal via the satellite. It comes off the satellite's north-eastern footprint. Of course, this all happened with a hefty subsidy from the Queensland National Party Government. That Government put up $2im to get the station operating. Of course this lousy Labor Government down here was not prepared to put a red cent into the operation of the company. Not one dollar did it put up, yet it is prepared to subsidise Imparja in Central Australia. That Aboriginal station is being funded by the Federal Government. NQTV has been in operation for fully six weeks, and now Imparja is putting in its application to take up some of the south-eastern footprint and some of the north-eastern footprint, against the wishes of this company, now operating from Townsville, which is trying to give us a commercial channel. So the Federal Government is allowing Imparja to put in an application, and now the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is to reopen hearings to enable an Aboriginal group in Townsville to make a submission. No doubt that group is backed by the Federal Government. That is the only place from which such groups ever get any funds, although they are not doing much good with the uranium mines of late. No doubt after the big conference coming up, the Labor Party might have to change its mind and allow Aborigines to become self-funding. Perhaps they would not then have to go to the Federal Government for support to set up their television stations; they could do it off their own bat as the rest of us have to. NQTV is up and running. It is giving people of the Maranoa and Kennedy electorates and the rest of inland Queensland a commercial television service for the first time. It serves places such as Charieville, Mitchell, Roma, Cunnamulla and St George. This company has gone out and put rebroadcasting facilities into the area. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) battles continuously for his constituents to try to get more commercial television in his area of outback New South Wales. We have a continuing problem. NQTV has been prepared to get this station operating. The National Party Government in Queensland has been prepared to put up a substantial subsidy-$2im a year. What do we see? A group of Aborigines from Central Australia and from Townsville now wish to take on board some of this operation. They have even requested that they be allowed to have members on the board of NQTV. The station is broadcasting Aboriginal programs as about 20 per cent of its total programming content. After we have battled for years to get the station established this new company has come along and is putting an argument to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that it should be allowed to come on board. I say in no uncertain terms on behalf of the constituents of my electorate of Maranoa that if we are to get some sort of commercial television-Mr Tim Fiscber-And a fair go.",19
30,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"And a fair go, I believe that we should continue to allow NQTV to operate using the licence. To hire a transponder on the satellite costs $4m a year. I believe the company should be allowed to hold a licence and operate at least until it shows a profit. It will have to run at a loss for some years before it can stand on its own two feet. The other matter I would like to refer to is that I have been supporting a retransmission facility at a small place called Yelvacap in southwestern Queensland. The people of Meeandah, Westmar and Glenmorgan will be able to get Australian Broadcasting Corporation television as well as commercial television and maybe the ethnic programs. I was successful in getting the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Gareth Evans) to unencode ethnic television across Australia whereas before the Australian Labor Party encoded it so that the taxpayers of inland Queensland were not able to see the Special Broadcasting Service; now they are. We hope the rebroadcast facility will be on air by Christmas so that people will be able to get some decent television at long last. As this a broadcast day no doubt thousands of my constituents are listening in-Mr Duncan-Send a cheerio to Aunty Flo.",20
31,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"Yes, I send them a cheerio on this the last day in this building. I look forward to making contact with them when we move to the new House. Mr Chynoweth-You are never in your electorate, that is why.",21
32,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"Yes, I am. If people in the area wish to unencode the television signal they should contact RTS Decoder Registration, NQTV, Box 1016, Townsville, 4810. That is the address for people who wish to unencode their receivers and get the commercial television signal for the first time. They will then be very happy with the programs they get. I thank you for your patience, Mr Deputy Speaker.",21
33,Mr SAUNDERSON,NOES,"ln spea-ing in support of the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill I remind honourable members who were speaking a lot about television that the Bill actually covers radio licences and cross-media ownership rules. It does not really have much to do with television. In some ways the Bill completes the Government's activities in bringing television and radio up to date in Australia. For too long conservative governments let them languish with no changes, outmoded rules and no provisions to protect the community or even to extend to the community at large services which it had long been asking for. This Government, as was said earlier, has moved to provide increased television participation. It is now moving to extend radio services throughout the community, in particular in the FM range. I think the Government should be congratulated on this. This achievement has taken quite some time. Of course, other important measures have been introduced in relation to the cross-media rules, which previous speakers have clearly indicated have revolutionised the situation in Australia. No longer can one individual own radio, newspaper and television outlets and therefore decisively control the total editorial content available to the Australian community. There is now a very diverse range of ownership within radio, television and newspapers. I think we have probably reached the point where there is a need for us to have a period of quiet and no change in the industry. Once these new rules come into operation a period should be set aside so that a proper assessment can be made of the changes that have occurred over is the last few years. It has become essential for us to ensure that current new ownership forms that have taken place in both television and radio are allowed to settle down and be examined by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal so that an assessment can be made of how effectively the new changes are working in practice. We need to assess whether there are any shortcomings. For instance, it may well be that we need to look at networking. In the existing law there are no provisions for the control of networking and because it has now become a much more formal process, particularly within television, we have probably reached a point where we should examine whether legislation is needed in that area. More importantly, there is a need to ensure that all the comprehensive changes that have been made are working effectively. I think the Bill is commendable and should be supported. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",21

37,Mr FIFE,URGENT LEGISLATION,"As I indicated a few moments ago, the Opposition will oppose this motion. As I have said on a number of occasions over the past two weeks, the Government has used the guillotine in the most disgraceful way that I can recall during my long period of service as a parliamentarian in both the New South Wales Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliament. Two weeks ago, in two days, 14 Bills were dealt with. Last week, in another two days, another 14 Bills were dealt with. Towards the end of last week, in one day, 11 Bills were dealt with. I have not had an opportunity to count the number of Bills that will be dealt with between now and when the House rises late this afternoon. The House of Representatives has been recalled at great expense to the taxpayers for a one-day sitting, merely to rubber stamp a long list of important legislation, including an amendment to a constitutional Bill-a Bill to provide for a referendum. If this kind of practice continues when we move to the new Parliament House, all we will have is better working facilities for members of parliament and those people who work for us-the Clerks and the other people who work in Parliament House-but the Australian people will not be better off. If this kind of principle is maintained by the Government, parliament will not be on the way up the hill; it will be on the way down the creek. The Australian public will suffer as a result. I lodge the strongest protest that I possibly can, not on my own behalf or on behalf of the Opposition, but on behalf of the Australian pe0ple. It is time that the Government took a hard look at itself and at the practices that it employs in determining the program of the House of Representatives. When parliament resumed at the beginning of this year, the program was light. Indeed, we sometimes adjourned a few minutes earlier than we normally would. Sometimes we could observe that the Government was allowing fill-in debates, important as those debates were. But the real business of the Parliament has been introduced only in the last three weeks. I venture to suggest that members of the 0pposition and members of the Government alike have not had an opportunity to carefully consider those measures. Even Ministers have been caught out. When questions have been put by way of interjection or points of order, Ministers have not been aware of all the details of matters that have come before the Parliament. During the last week of sitting a Minister introduced an amendment to the explanatory memorandum to a Bill. When I took a point of order to ask him why that was necessary, he could not tell me. He said that it had just been given to him. A Minister of the Crown put before the Parliament an amendment that he did not understand. He did not know why it was necessary. I could tell him why it was necessary: it was necessary because the Government was proceeding then, as it is now, in indecent haste. It had not done its homework, and errors occurred. I implore the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and other members of the Government to look at the procedures during the parliamentary recess and to ensure that when we move to the new Parliament House we do not have just a new exterior view, but that we change our practices in the Parliament and take it seriously. We should take it seriously not only for our own sakes, but on behalf of the people whom we represent. Let them be able to see that we are taking the business of this country seriously. The biggest undertaking in Australia is the Commonwealth of Australia. If boards of directors carried on like we have carried on in the last three weeks, I am sure that the shareholders would sack them. This Parliament has been treated as a rubber stamp, particularly over the last three weeks. We oppose the motion to apply a guillotine today to a large number of Bills and to have the Parliament not only seen as, but acting as, a rubber stamp.",22

39,Mr FIFE,NOES," I am not going to repeat what 1 said a few minutes ago other than to confirm what 1 said, but the House might be interested in a conversation that 1 had with a Soviet Minister a few years ago. On that occasion he asked me to explain the workings of the Australian Parliament. 1 went through it in detail. Part of the detail referred to the fact that we had two sessions of parliament each year. At the conclusion of my long explanation he said to me, 'You know, there is a similarity between your system and our system'. 1 said, 'That surprises me. What is the similarity'. He said, 'We have two sessions of our Presidium each year. The one difference is that each session is of three days duration'. That is what we are heading for in this country under this Government. We oppose the motion. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Ronald Edwards) Ayes Noes Majority NA Baldwin, P. J. JOhlll, O. T.

40,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CASH TRANSACTION REPORTS BILL,I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Because we have very few minutes left 1 make the point that this is the same Bill that was introduced 12 months ago. It has been before the Senate for some eight months. We agree with the amendments the Senate has recommended. The Bill is of great significance in dealing with the underground cash economy. welcome the cooperation we have received from the banks and others in their commitment to this program. I present the explanatory memorandum.,24
41,Mr REITH,CASH TRANSACTION REPORTS BILL,"Unfortunately, today the debate on this important measure has been guillotined, so I am prevented from putting down a major statement of the Opposition's views about this legislation. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has stated, the Bill has been around for a considerable period-in fact, since prior to the last election. Our starting point in considering this Bill-we have looked at it carefully-is that a number of significant royal commissioners have made recommendations to the Parliament about what we need to do to deal with the threat of organised crime. Whilst not wanting to exaggerate that threat, it would be a poor reflection on the Parliament if we failed to take note of those recommendations or if we failed to take measures to deal with the insidious threat of organised crime. The Opposition supports this measure because, on our careful assessment and weighing up of its advantages and disadvantages, we believe that it is worthy of support. But we have been very careful, very cautious about it. We welcome the Attorney-General's commitment to a careful and close monitoring of how the Bill works. To those who want to tie it into the ID card debate, I say that if they look at it carefully, as we have, they would be wrong to tie it into the ID card debate, because it is not a matter which raises the universal concerns we had about the ID card. I say to the people who have that concern: when was the last time they had $10,000 cash actually in their hands? Basically that is what the Bill is addressing, the large movements of cash in people's hands. At the Opposition's initiative, we have had the Bill considered by a Senate committee. We have had this Bill before us for over a year. There have been amendments to it which we have encouraged. There has been careful consideration of each and every matter. We support the Bill. We are aware of the concerns. Having taken those concerns into account, we have a very strong commitment to maintain a very careful and watchful eye on the implementation of this Bill and a commitment to move for legislative amendment, or any other measure which needs to be taken, as we have the benefit of experience.",25

47,Mr HOLDING,IMMIGRATION POLICIES,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)-For the information of honourable members, I table the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP) entitled Immigration-a Commitment to Australia. I seek leave to make a statement on the report. Leave granted.",25
48,Mr HOLDING,IMMIGRATION POLICIES,"The Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies was established by my predecessor, the Hon. Michael J. Young, in September 1987, in response to a commitment by the Government during the last election for a review of immigration policies, including the points system. There had been no major review of immigration policies for 10 years. The terms of reference asked the Committee to address all pertinent matters including, in broad terms, the following: the relationship between immigration and the economy, including the effects on the labour market and economic development; the relationship between immigration and Australia's social and cultural development as a multicultural society; the relationship between immigration and key population issues; the overall capacity of Australia to receive significant immigration intakes; and the relationship between immigration policies, including compliance, and the administrative and legislative processes involved. In carrying out its work, the Committee was asked to: have regard to the principles that Australia's immigration policies are non-discriminatory in respect of national or ethnic origin, race, sex and religion and that it is a sovereign right of the Australian Government to determine who should enter; have regard to Australia's continuing commitment to play its part in providing international humanitarian assistance to those in need; note that the Government has ruled out an amnesty for illegal immigrants; bear in mind settlement experiences insofar as they are relevant to the framing of immigration policies, noting that the Government is separately developing a national agenda for a multicultural Australia; and undertake full consultation with interested parties through written and oral submissions and other appropriate means; and to report on: the guiding principles which should shape Australia's immigration policies, looking ahead to the end of this century; the balance of objectives which should be reflected in policies in terms of composition and levels of immigration; and administrative and legislative mechanisms necessary for the implementation of immigration policies. The Committee was chaired by Dr Stephen FitzGerald, a well-known academic and businessman, our first Ambassador to China, currently a consultant on relations and trade with China, Chairman of the Asian Studies Council and a member of the Advisory Council on Languages and Multicultural Education. Members of the Committee included Mr Tony Bonnici, AM, Melbourne barrister and Chairman of the Victorian Ethnics Communities Council; Professor Helen Hughes, Professor of Economics and Executive Director of the National Centre for Development Studies, Australian National University; Mr Jim Hullick, Secretary-General of the South Australian Local Government Association; Mr Alan Matheson, Ethnic Liaison Officer with the Australian Council of Trade Unions; Dr Alessandra Pucci, Managing Director of Australian Monoclonal Development Pty Ltd, Qantas businesswoman of the Year 1985. The  then a senior official with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. CAAIP submitted its final report on 16 May 1988. The report consists of three volumes. Volume I is the report proper. It consists of eight chapters and makes 73 recommendations. Volumes II and III are the companion volumes. Volume II contains reports of the 11 consultancies commissioned by the Committee as well as summaries of workshop proceedings. Volume III includes proposals for a model migration Bill. In the preparation of its report, the Committee undertook an extensive process of consultations. To maximise access to these consultations, CAAIP established a toll-free telephone line. More than 900 calls were received and comments were recorded. It advertised widely through local, national and specialist media outlets and distributed 5,000 copies of a specially prepared booklet Understanding Immigration. The Chairman and Secretary wrote to about 1,200 organisations and individuals, inviting them to lodge submissions. Face-to-face consultations were conducted in all capital cities and four regional centres, with 587 people representing 162 ethnic community groups; employer, business and unions, 110; service deliverers, churches and community groups, 103; government, 98; academics, 32; legal-advocacy, 15; political, 5; Aboriginals, 13; and others, including the Returned Services League, arts and culture, opinion makers and students, 45. The Committee received 970 written submissions, from 570 individuals, and from 400 organisations, including 40 businesses; ethnic communities, 100; church and refugee groups, 50; bureaucracy, 30; service providers, 35; community groups, 25; government-politics, 25; legal-advocacy, 25; professional associations, 20; unions, 10; and others, including academic and conservationists, 40. In addition, four workshops were held to begin trialling and analysing options. These were attended by over 150 individuals and organisations. I now turn to the report. Overall, it provides support for much of the present direction of our immigration and multicultural policies. A number of its recommendations already are in place and CAAIP merely seeks their continuation or reaffirmation. We are on the right track. We have been gradually adjusting and modifying our policies over the years in line with rapid economic and social change. I anticipate and welcome broad community participation in discussion of the report's recommendations. However, without pre-empting community discussion of the report, I wish to say at the outset that the Government remains committed to certain basic principles in the development of its immigration policies. These are: immigration policy will continue to be based on the national interest; immigration policy will remain non-discriminatory in terms of national or ethnic origin, race, sex or religion; family migration will remain component; economic considerations-including domestic training and retraining requirements-will feature prominently in any expansion of the immigration program; policy will continue to take proper account of Australia's human resources. The Government's commitment to the fostering and development of a multicultural society remains within the Australian culture a cornerstone of its social justice policies and an important element of its economic strategy by creating a climate in which we can make full and effective use of all our human resources, irrespective of linguistic and cultural background. It is thus an essential domestic policy to complement our non-discriminatory immigration policy. There are many elements of the Committee's report which offer constructive opportunities for debate. For example, the Government remains concerned that so many permanent residents fail to take up the option of citizenship. We believe that citizenship is a legitimate expression of national commitment and wish to provide positive encouragement to immigrants to take up Australian citizenship. We would welcome community views on this question. The report raises a wide range of other issues which provide legitimate ground for debate and discussion. This includes a 'model migration' Bill which contains radical proposals in relation to the role of the Minister, enforcement, external review and determination of refugee status procedures. The policy and administrative implications of these proposals are substantial. They require careful examination and appropriate consultation, especially with State governments on all matters raised in the report which affect their functions. In commissioning this review the Government was conscious that there was a level of concern in the community about immigration policies, numbers, composition of the intake and the immigrant's role in a changing Australian society. The Committee's report identifies many of these concerns and sets them in a broader national context. We share the Committee's view that immigration should occupy a central place in national policy formulation and that its essential contribution to Australia's social and economic development should be more strongly promoted. It argues that immigration policy must be for all Australians and must be in the mainstream of a vital government decision-making, that immigration policies must be identified with public interest, be based on a coherent philosophy and be given a convincing rationale. The report identifies this rationale as principally an economic one, but one that must be in harmony with social and humanitarian objectives. Immigration in itself cannot be a tool for economic adjustment. Its value is that it can contribute to structural adjustment by having a positive impact on economic growth and living standards, contributing to improvements in productivity and maintaining an appropriate balance in the age profile of the community. Arising from this, the Committee argues for a sharper economic focus through an increase in the size of the program to accommodate a larger new open category where the selection process would favour skilled, entrepreneurial and youthful immigrants. Language skills and kinship or other links with Australia would also weigh in selection. Procedures and barriers in the labour market which discourage skilled immigrants from fulfilling their potential must also be removed. The report also makes recommendations in regard to settlement policy, the administration of the program and proposals for new legislative requirements. While the Committee encountered widespread misunderstanding of the concept of multiculturalism, it observed that there is an indisputable need of structures for multicultural support within Australian society. This is due to a past failure to accord proper esteem to migrant cultures and languages, or to provide proper access by migrants to our systems, services and institutions. The Government emphasises that it has made no decision in relation to CAAIP's proposals. It intends that a period of some three months should be set aside for public evaluation and comment. During that time State governments, major ethnic bodies, local government, the trade union movement, key industry organisations and Australians with an interest in this issue will be able to contribute their views on the report and the future direction of immigration policy. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will monitor and evaluate the comments made, and report to me. The Government will also establish an interdepartmental committee to commence an evaluation of the report's proposals, and I have asked the National Population Council to advise me on some of the important issues that arise. Following on these processes, I shall put to Cabinet my recommendations regarding the report, with the intention that I would announce the Government's decisions on the main policy issues during the forthcoming Budget sittings. At that time. I would also indicate the Government's attitude towards the Committee's proposals for legislative and administrative change, and a timetable for implementation of agreed reforms. The Committee has undertaken a far-reaching review of our immigration policies and programs. Its proposals deserve, and will receive, thorough and careful consideration. As the timetable I have announced makes clear, there will be neither rush to decide nor unnecessary delay. I might mention here that earlier this week the Government announced its proposals for the 1988-89 immigration intake. Clearly, in respect of 1988-89, there has been only very limited opportunity to take account of the Committee's proposals, many of which will require a significant lead time if they are to be implemented. I wish to express the Government's thanks to the members of the Committee for this significant and forthright report, which may well be considered as the most far-reaching review of Australia's immigration policies ever undertaken. I commend the CAAIP report for the consideration of the House. I present the following paper: Immigration Policies-Ministerial Statement, 3 June 1988. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Mitchell speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes.",25
49,Mr CADMAN,IMMIGRATION POLICIES,"What a disgusting way the Government has chosen to treat a debate as important as this. I should have had at least the equivalent time of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Holding). This is one of the most important statements to come from the Government and yet it has been delayed for daysthere is some cloud over its presentation to the Parliament. The Minister in goodwill offered me a week to look at this report in confidence so that a comprehensive consideration could be made before presentation at this stage. Yet we have been reduced to having two hours to look at a comprehensive and significant report, and we are then given 10 minutes to reply to it. That is not a good start for good relationships on Australia's immigration program, the settlement of migrants, multiculturalism and all of those other factors that are related to this important public issue. Those opposite can snigger, but let me tell the Government that if it wants bipartisanship, if it wants us to come together as Opposition and Government with a program that is going to suit all Australians, it will have to mend its ways. We are incensed at the approach the Government has adopted in regard to this significant report. One has only to look at the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies to understand why the Government does not want too much public debate at this stage. Let me put a few quotes on the record. On page 1 the Committee says: We have a serious problem. But we also have an even bigger problem than the failure of selection policies and mechanisms. Community attitudes to immigration, even those of its many supporters, reflect confusion, anxiety, criticism and scepticism. . . . Public support in some quarters is faltering and community consensus in favour of immigration is at risk. On page 3 of the report the Committee says: . . . the common factor is that immigration policies are not related in the public mind to clearly identified and articulated national interests. On page 14 of the report it states: The sharper economic focus for which the Government has called is the most central issue in immigration reform. Page 15 states: It is of critical importance to the consensus on gration and to immigrants themselves that what we demand of the rest of the populace we demand also of immigrants. And in current economic strategy this means entrepreneurship, skills and multi-skills, and some sacrifice. Page 19 of the report states: . . . the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has at very least a serious image problem. Going on to page 27 of the report, we read: Immigrants value the societythe Australian societyas relaxed, informal friendly, full of opportunity, employment and education potential, free, spacious and environmentally unique. The Government has a lot of criticism in that report and it has to cope with it. The fact is that this Government has a program of immigration which lacks rationale and a philosophy. In order to maintain the flow of people into Australia the Government has thrown over many principles. It has in fact sought to placate the major claimant, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in this area. The people who should be in Australia are not, and there are people in Australia who should not be here, and the huge increase in illegal immigrants proves that there are many who should never have come. Citizenship under this Government has become demeaned and devalued. Instead of Australians granting their greatest gift with a sense of respect and pride in the acknowledgment of the worthiness of the recipients, it appears that the more quickly the insignificant oath can be mumbled after the date of arrival, the better it suits this Government. The Government has consistently reduced the size of its refugee program. It has reduced its overall size by failing to exercise its conscience towards the remaining Indo-Chinese refugees who have close family ties in Australia. Instead, the Government has turned more to Central America for refugees, purely for the sake of the figures. Even the World Council of Churches disapproves of the refugee priorities. The only area that the Government has not been able to ruin with its incompetence has been the program for the reunion of immediate family members. We are thankful that that program continues in its current form. There are some eye-catching comments in the Committee's report. I compliment the Committee. I would not have thought that a group of people-no matter what excellent qualifications they have-could, in the time they had been given, produce a report of this type. The Oppoimmisition will consider the details at length and will respond in full at a later time. It is not possible to reply to the complex matters put forward by self- - r FitzGerald and his Committee. For instance, In regard to the settlement program one thing that strikes my eye really needs careful consideration. That recommendatio!1 appears on page 121 of the report: That in public spending, priority be given to four areas which the Committee identifies as critical to the settlement process: English, skills recognition and bridging and upgrading, support for women immigrants and interpreting and translation services. Those are worthy objectives, but they need to be seen in the total context. In regard to the Government's own program of multiculturalism there is a serious question raised about whether it has been perceived as it was intended by the community. The Parliament and the Government need to give serious consideration to that. I will quote from the report a statement from the Office of Multicultural Affairs: A recent small scale private study showing that not only Anglo Celtic Australians but also immigrants of many years standing are very angry about multicultural policy. That needs to be investigated. Are people who are concerned and needy missing out because the multiculturalism policy is not working? It needs to be examined. I compliment the Committee for having the courage to draw out some contentious matters and face them fairly. This is what Australia needs. As I said, the Opposition will be considering the report in detail and will be making its views known. The Government has had this report for many days. I believe that the overall result that Australians are looking for, and migrants themselves are looking for, is an equality of opportunity once they arrive here. All barriers to that process should be removed. It is not of concern to me what we call that process as long as the fairness and openness that people regard Australia as having are maintained. They should be maintained and encouraged. The way to do that is to ensure that there are adequate opportunities for achieving equality and the potential of the arriving migrant. Discussions of this type cannot be taken in isolation. The total population of Australia cannot be considered the only immigration factor. We must have a policy and a program that have something for all Australians. The terrorist economics of the current Government and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in particular are not conducive to the good of Australian families or to an increase in the Australian population. While the Government belts Aussies around and continues to have a large immigration program, there is that continuing chance of resentment. What is needed is a more balanced approach to the well-being of Australian families. Then we can all argue for a strong, dynamic and economically sensible immigration program. In discussions on immigration the needs of young Australians should not be neglected. Their needs for training and opportunity must also be at the forefront of the Government's policy making. The Liberal and National parties believe that Australia's immigration policy should reflect a number of fundamental considerations. It should reflect Australia's national interest, and that must always be the overriding consideration in deciding upon the level and composition of the migration intake. The prime influence on all post-arrival policies must be that all Australians have a common destiny transcending other loyalties. The capacity of Australian society to accept and absorb change must be a factor determining our migration intake. Continuing high levels of migration are essential to sustain economic growth and expansion. As a member of the international community, we believe, Australia has an obligation to play her part in the humanitarian resettlement of refugees. Debate (on motion by Dr Tbeopbanous) adjourned.

53,Dr BLEWETT,COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH,"I will explain briefly, for the benefit of the honourable member for Kooyong. Honourable members will recall that the major purpose of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 is to introduce new nursing and personal care staffing and reIn Committee lated funding arrangements as well as improve respite care in nursing homes. The Bill also provides for increased freedom of choice for members of health insurance funds currently locked into a single health benefits organisation through the imposition of additional waiting periods by other organisations when a contributor transfers. These portability provisions enable contributors to a health benefits organisation to transfer their membership to another organisation without the imposition of a waiting period or with reduced waiting periods where the waiting period has been served in whole or in part. However, the Bill also sought to prohibit an organisation dumping heavy benefit-drawing contributors on other organisations. At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) moved an amendment aimed at strengthening those anti-dumping provisions in the Bill. I indicated, in response to those proposals, that while I could not accept them at that point, the Government would look sympathetically at them because we wished to make these anti-dumping provisions effective. As a result of this examination, the Government moved an amendment in the Senate, along the lines suggested by the honourable member for O'Connor, to strengthen those anti-dumping provisions.",32
54,Mr TUCKEY,COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH,"The 0pposition thanks the Government for its consideration of these matters. I am sure that the result will benefit everybody in the health insurance industry and, most importantly, contributors, or consumers, who will now have the option of choice. The improper practices that occurred prior to 1984 have been properly addressed by the amendments. We concur with the proposals.",32

58,Mr TUCKEY,REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION,"This matter is of great concern to the Opposition. We did not support the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill in the first instance. It is amazing that the sort of amendment that is coming back here was necessary. It identifies the deficiencies in the drafting of this legislation. Four referendum proposals are going to be put to the people on account of this legislation. The first means that we will have more elections, not fewer, because the Government is proposing to create simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate-a four-year term, which will only improve the opportunities for opportunistic Prime Ministers of the future to take both Houses out and go to the people. The people want fewer elections. The Bill makes no provision for fixed terms. By removing the fixed term of the Senate this only enhances the opportunities. The second proposal deals in a most remarkable way with one vote one value. The Commonwealth through its Constitution proposes to put one vote one value upon the States whilst ignoring, if we like to put it this way, the huge constitutional gerrymander that exists in our Senate-a gerrymander of which I approve wholeheartedly-which says that every State has the same number of members, irrespective of its population. It is most astounding that the Commonwealth is prepared to say to the people on this issue, 'We want a set of rules for us but, through our Constitution, we should impose a different set of rules on individual States'. I remind honourable senators that if one vote one value were applied in the Senate we would have something like two or three senators for Tasmania and 25 or 26 for New South Walessomething that none of the minority States would agree to. The matter would be defeated in a second, so we are avoiding thaL It is most remarkable. After 16 years in local government I am astounded to discover that my colleagues in local government are prepared to accept less than even the Aboriginal community will accept. The Aboriginals see the compact proposals or resolutions of that nature as tokenism. They sayirrespective of whether I approve-that they want more. My colleagues in local government apparently are prepared to accept a constitutional reference that goes no further than to recognise their existence. It does not take away any of the powers of State government and, in particular, does not take away the power of a State government to dismiss a group of people who have been elected by the people. Clearly we have to have rules for the operation of local government, the same as we have for every other parliament but, just as clearly, as occurs in other parliaments, the only people who can dismiss a parliament should be the electors. We hold to that view in every other case but, suddenly, we are not prepared to extend that protection to local government. So that proposal is pure tokenism and should not be supported because, in the long term, it is the last opportunity for local government. The public, the Parliament and everybody else will just say, 'You have got what you asked for; do not come back again'. Local government is throwing away its only opportunity for proper recognition. The Opposition recognises that and, consequently, is not prepared to support that position. Fourthly, we have the muddying of the water with three questions all being put in one proposal. They concern trial by jury, religion and the resumption of property under just terms. The latter is already a constitutional measure for the Commonwealth. Quite clearly, State governments could take similar steps if they thought it appropriate. They have failed to do so and should be answerable to their electors on that matter. It should not be forced upon State governments by the Constitution. My principal concern in that area is the very clever way in which the rephrasing of the Constitution has been done in regard to religion. Presently, the Constitution is a constraint on government in regard to any attempt to bring forward a state religion. That is all the protection of freedom that the people need. What we are now being confronted with is an arrangement which forbids the Government to be involved in religions. That is very dangerous. It is amazing what comes under the definition of religion. We are opening the door for some outrageous types of religions. Furthermore, and only time will tell, I expect that in this place as a result of that question being carried someone will argue the case that it is improper under the Constitution for this Parliament to commence each day with the Lord's Prayer. Whether that will succeed, I do not know, but the argument can follow from the proposal being successful. The people of Australia have to consider clearly whether they will approve a change in that area which could deny a State government, for instance-or even the Commonwealth in some circumstances-the right to outlaw a religion which clearly is outrageous and is not a proper religion as we understand it, that is that it is not an instrument of good but could be justified on the grounds that it is religion and certain people have a status. These are the problems the Opposition had with the Bill in general. The amendment to which we are speaking has been made primarily to overcome all the drafting deficiencies that exist. We think that that is not a very satisfactory arrangement, either. Since we have a guillotine operating, I will conclude my remarks at that point. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1988 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Barry Jones, and read a first time. Second Reading",36
59,Mr BARRY JONES,REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (12.41)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The legislative changes made by the Patents Amendment Bill 1988 relate to the duration of a patentee's right to take legal action against infringers of the patent. The Bill abolishes the present complex procedures for extending the term of a patent and replaces them with more straightforward procedures applicable only to pharmaceuticals. On 28 November 1986 I tabled in this House the Government's response to the Indilstrial Property Advisory Committee's report, Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia. This Bill implements the Government's response to recommendation 11 of the report. Recommendation 11 proposed, by a majority, that the present standard patent term of 16 years be retained, but that the procedures for granting of extensions of the terms of standard patents be eliminated in to to. The majority of the Committee believed that there was no evidence that the social benefits of the extension procedure outweighed its social costs, particularly those costs arising from the uncertainty faced by competitors who are unsure when rights in patented inventions will terminate. The Government responded by approving recommendation 11 in principle, but stated that it would announce a decision at an appropriate time on pharmaceuticals and agricultural and veterinary chemicals for which effective patent life is eroded by regulatory delays. The Government's policy on patent term for those special cases was announced on 13 September 1987 in a joint media statement by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). The statement announced a number of new policies aimed at encouraging the growth of the pharmaceutical products industry in Australia. The changes included the Government's decision to provide for extensions to patent life on pharmaceuticals for human use. This Bill includes the arrangements needed to implement that decision. These arrangements will allow the holder of a pharmaceutical patent to apply to the Commissioner of Patents for an extension of term of four years, rather than having to go through the courts under the existing provisions. Extensions under the existing procedures must be based on the grounds of inadequate remuneration or, rarely in practice, of war loss. Those procedures require complicated evidence and argument to be presented in lengthy court proceedings which are costly to industry and government, and the eventual outcome remains uncertain for years. The new procedures will be simpler, less costly to use and offer greater certainty to patent holders and others. The arrangements acknowledge that the effective patent life for pharmaceuticals for human use is reduced by the stringent and time-consuming evaluation procedures that the Department of Community Services and Health is required to conduct to ensure both the safety of patients and the efficacy of drugs. An extension of four years will be available for a patent so far as it claims a pharmaceutical substance which is subject for the first time to importation and general marketing approval by that Department. This provision recognises that subsequent marketing approvals for different forms, formulations or strengths of a pharmaceutical substance, or for the substance made by a different process, are invariably granted more rapidly than the original approval. During the final two years of an extension, a competing company will be allowed to gear up to be in a position to enter the market immediately on expiry of the extension. The transitional arrangements in the Bill raise the drawbridge-in effect, from today-on the seeking of extensions of term under the present provisions. That move will avoid a rash of speculative applications for extensions under the old procedures, and will come as no surprise to users of the patent system who have been aware for some time that the system would be changing. A detailed explanation of the changes made by the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. Under the existing legislation, pharmaceutical companies regularly seek patent extensions of up to 10 years through the courts. The time taken - y the present complex proceedings, partiCUlarly In cases where the extension is opposed, means that several years elapse before a decision is handed down. During that period, the patentee enjoys monopoly prices under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, whether or not an extension is subsequently granted. The more straightforward arrangements made by this Bill will result in earlier determination and substantially shorter extensions than may be granted at present. It is likely that patent extensions will be sought for more drugs than is the case at present. However, any increase in costs which may flow from an increase in numbers of extensions will be significantly offset by the more rapid introduction of competitor products after patent extensions expire, as a result of the provision which permits the testing of products by other manufacturers in the last two years of an extension. Administration of the new scheme set up by the Bill may involve a small number of additional staff in the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office and the Department of Community Services and Health. I commend this Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned. NA",38
60,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SELECTION COMMITTEE,"I wish to make a report on behalf of the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee has deferred its consideration of items of private members' business to be accorded priority on the first sitting Thursday of the Budget period of sittings 1988. The Committee proposes to report its determinations to the House in relation to that day, which is expected to be 25 August 1988, on 23 August 1988. NA",39
61,Mr BEAZLEY,SALES TAX BILLS,"I move: That, in relation to the proceedings on any Sales Tax Bills, so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent: (I) the presentation and the first readings together; (2) one motion being moved and one question being put in regard to, respectively, the second readings, the committee's report stage, and the third readings, of all the Bills together; and (3) the consideration of all the Bills as a whole together in a committee of the whole. This motion is purely procedural and no immediate introduction of sales tax legislation is contemplated. It has been normal for similar motions to be passed early in the life of a parliament but to date such action has not been taken in this Parliament. Alteration of sales tax rates usually involves the introduction of a number of Bills, and in the past the House has found it convenient for the Bills to be taken together. Standing order 291 permits these Bills to be introduced without notice, but it is necessary to suspend Standing Orders to enable the Bills to be presented and dealt with together. When passed, the motion will remain effective for the remainder of this session. Question resolved in the affirmative.",39

64,Mr HOWARD,IMMIGRATION,"I refer the Prime Minister to the FitzGerald report, the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policy, which says that the Government's migrant polices and mechanisms are a failure, that immigration policies are not related in the public's mind to clearly identified and articulated national interests, and that not only Australians of Anglo-Celtic descent but many others are 'very angry about the multicultural policy'. Does the Prime Minister agree with these judgments on of the Bills his Government's immigration policies?",39
65,Mr HAWKE,IMMIGRATION,"I do not specifically agree with those judgments and I would say that a fair reading of the whole report leads to the conclusion that it broadly endorses the current direction of Government policy. But let me say this: we do not claim, in an area which is as sensitive and as open to as many impressions and points of view as is this area, that we have necessarily got it absolutely right in every respect. We do not make such a claim. I repeat, however, that I think that in broad terms the report supports the Government's position. The report was in fact commissioned precisely because we recognised that certain aspects of the established system did need an overhaul. As a result of the work ·of the FitzGerald Committee we expect that there will be a community debate and discussion, which we will certainly encourage and which we will follow very closely. While we have made no decisions on specific recommendations pending that consideration of the report in the community, I say in response to the honourable gentleman's question that there are certain principles in this area which, as far as we are concerned, are non-negotiable. They are that immigration should be based on the Australian national interest; that it will remain non-discriminatory; that family reunion will remain a vital component; that economic considerations, including domestic training, will feature prominently in any expansion; and finally that the policy will continue to take proper account of Australia's human resources. Those considerations, I repeat, are non-negotiable. They will be foundational to the policies we adopt. We welcome the report. May I say that I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will join with me in expressing the hope that there will be vigorous and considered discussion and debate in the community on this issue. We will certainly encourage that. We hope to make appropriate policy decisions in the light of that debate. NA",39
66,Mr LAVARCH,MOSCOW SUMMIT,I ask the Prime Minister: How does the Government assess the outcome of the Moscow summit between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev?,40
67,Mr HAWKE,MOSCOW SUMMIT,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The fourth meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, held in Moscow from 29 May to 2 June, confirmed in all our minds that the relations between the two major super-powers are being put on a more stable and constructive footing. It appears-and we are pleased about this-that these two leaders are building the foundations for a sustainable improvement in relations. That has profoundly important implications for the future of the whole world. Having said that, it is not realistic to expect the political and military consequences of decades of deep suspicion and rivalry to be swept away in a few quick steps; nor should we forget that widely differing perceptions of national interest are likely to endure for a considerable period. Nevertheless, the accomplishments of the last two to three years of renewed dialogue are already very impressive. In Moscow the two leaders were able to continue to build on those accomplishments. They exchanged instruments of ratification for the intermediate-range nuclear force agreement, signed agreements of prior notification of strategic ballistic missile tests, made technical arrangements for experimental on-site monitoring of nuclear tests, and also considered a number of strictly bilateral matters. The Australian Government congratulates the two leaders on engineering this change in the relationship and on their obvious determination to address the deep differences between their countries in a realistic and pragmatic manner. Their achievement has the potential to have a long term positive impact on the international system. The Government looks forward to receiving detailed briefing on what transpired in Moscow and, as is now the established practice, a senior American participant in the summit will travel to Australia for this purpose. We also expect a briefing from the Soviet side. In conclusion, I believe that these developments in Moscow are a vindication of the Government's approach to East-West relations, of the intense dialogue that we have maintained with our United States friends and allies, and of the open-minded communication which we have established with the Soviet Union. NA  the Treasurer. I refer him to recent media reports of a $6.5m public relations campaign by the Government to sell its new tax file numbering system. I also refer him to further statements in the media that a select group of government officials briefed the organisations tendering for the contract, stating that the door remained open for an upgrading of the tax file numbering system. They also allegedly referred to it as being stage one of the scheme. Are such reports correct? If so, what is meant by the terms 'stage one of the scheme' and 'future upgrading'?",40
68,Mr KEATING,TAX FILE NUMBERING SYSTEM,"When the Government looked at design issues in regard to the tax file numbering system in the debate which ensued during the Australia Card discussion, there were to be objects and purposes of the Australia Card and, to some extent, the tax file number beyond those information systems which the Australian Taxation Office already has in place or beyond the information reach which the Tax Office already has, by way of other, less effective instruments. In discussing these issues, stage one was to be simply the existing information system but more effectively provided by using computer technology to match information rather than the manual matching of information, but essentially using the same information source. Stage two was the extension beyond that to other uses. The Government, at Cabinet level, rejected any proposal to move the tax file number beyond existing uses. The Government in its statement announced its position-that is, that the tax file number will be there simply to do what it is doing now. It is used at the moment in the prescribed payments system. All that happens in that system is that those people in various industries use the tax file number in relation to the payment of income, and that number is fed through a computer to match that income to their file. At the moment, when the Tax Office receives interest and dividend information from banks and companies, it simply has the name and address of the taxpayer but no tax number. So it is not possible to match properly or effectively, without a lot of manual effort, the names and addresses to the particular tax file or the particular tax basis of the person involved. All that happens with the number is simply that the computer does it if the number is attached to those payments. So it is the same information system basically built around the technical capacity 'of the computer to match around a common number. That is what we have in place. That is why I think the Opposition to date has indicated its support for that concept and that support we appreciate. We have no intention now or in the future of extending the basis of the tax file number to do anything like some of the Australia Card tasks. NA",40
69,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION,Will the Attorney General inform the House as to the level of public consultation undertaken by the Constitutional Commission?,41
70,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As is well known, the Commission has sought opinions from a number of people and organisations in the course of formulating its recommendations for constitutional change. As a matter of interest, it has met on many occasions throughout the length and breadth of the land; it has had the advice of five advisory committees which also travelled across Australia; it has received more than 4,000 written and oral submissions; it has distributed the booklet Time to Update to 160,000 people; and it has, most importantly, a mailing list of 40,000 people who are interested in constitutional reform. It is on that particular matter that I might advert to what has happened in respect of that mailing list. It is of interest to note that the shadow Attorney-General has sought from the Commission the names and addresses of the 40,000 people. Not satisfied with that, he is objecting to the fact that the Commission is not prepared to give him the names and addresses of those people-nor would it give them to the Government. On that basis let me make it clear that the Commission offered to distribute to them the information from the honourable member for Flinders provided that it did not have party-political content, and he objected to that. The Government has not sought the names and addresses of the people, but the honourable member has. It is on that basis that the Commission then asked the people on the mailing list whether they would have any objection to their names and addresses being disclosed. More than 4,000 people have objected to having their names and addresses disclosed to the honourable member. The reason the honourable member for Newcastle raises the issue is that one of his constituents has expressed concern. It is quite reasonable that people want to have some information about the Constitution. It is quite appropriate that the Constitutional Commission has a mailing list of people to whom it can impart information. But it is not in a position of imparting party-political information, nor is it in the position of imparting information as to the names and addresses of individuals. If the honourable member for Flinders is not concerned about it, one might ask why is he now appealing against the decision? He already has the matter before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on this bases, for which he has got no concern. I would think it be appropriate for the Opposition to be more concerned about its own ranks than worrying about who is on the mailing list of the Commission. Today I am reminded that Mr Jeff Kennett has come out and said that the Liberal Party of Victoria fully supports the recognition of local government. The long list of people who are now supporting what I say are very fair and reasonable questions for a referendum includes the Queensland Liberal Party Leader, Mr Angus Innes, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson, the 830 local government bodies and local government associations, and, I might even add, even some people in the party room opposite, who, by their silence, might well indicate the position. I notice also that there has been a deafening silence from the Tasmanian Premier, Robin Gray. What we want to say is: we are doing pretty well from the point of view of public interest. The interest has mainly been in the attitude of the Opposition. It is so divided on the issue that it really has not got a case to answer. The questions that are to be put to the Australian people are for them to judge. They are not very interested in the assessment made by the Opposition. When I look at the disarray in the ranks of the Opposition-whether it be Senator Peter Baume, the honourable member for Lyons, the honourable member for Franklin, the honourable member for Moncrieff, or the honourable member for Boothby-is it any wonder that the people are interested in the question because they know now that within the Opposition's own ranks people are being dragged along by the National Party of Australia as to what they should do? The shadow Cabinet was split. So we have the peculiar situation today whereby an extraordinary number of people who have had all sorts of different political affiliations in past are now looking at this issue on the basis of national interest. That means that they support the four propositions. NA",41
71,Mr MACKELLAR,SUPERANNUATION,"Is the Treasurer aware that his new taxation arrangements on superannuation funds will require those funds to have all real estate and property holdings officially valued at 30 June 1988 to determine their capital gains liability at 30 June 19891 Will the Treasurer acknowledge that for the industry to arrange such valuations at four weeks notice, given the limited availability of licensed valuers, is impractical and unreasonable? Will he undertake to defer the commencement of this tax requirement?",42
72,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"Under the existing superannuation arrangements, superannuation funds report profits on an unrealised and a realised basis. They take their gains on a realised basis. They also report their earnings for the year on an unrealised basis. As far as I understand it, they have a total awareness of the capital costs of their assets. Mr MACKellar-I do not think you are right.",42
73,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"It is simply a fact of life. Superannuation funds impute to their earnings, earnings on capital profits on an accruing basis. When they make a capital profit obviously it is accounted for in their annual return. We are going to give superannuation funds a benefit in terms of the tax arrangements by taxing only the real gain on those capital profits. Mr MACKellar-How will you know what the real gain is?",42
74,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"The real gain is without inflation. 'Real' means above the inflation rate. Therefore, there is a benefit to the funds. The superannuation industry has made it clear that this marginal increase in the tax rate, on a standstill basis, on the funds is not a particular problem for the funds to handle. I have two tables here which have been published by National Mutual Trustees Ltd from its portfolio. The first table shows an employee contribution of 5 per cent of salary and an employer contribution of 10 per cent of salary, that is, on a one for two basis, about the average of most people in superannuation. The second table shows an employee contribution of 7.5 per cent of salary and 10 per cent of salary employer contributions-in other words, a ratio of 1.5 : 2. So the tables show a 1: 2 basis and a 1.5: 2 the basis of employer-employee contributions-about the average of most superannuation funds. These tables show net benefits throughout the income ranges-I.7 per cent at $20,000 running up to 1.1 per cent at $120,000; and 0.8 per cent at $20,000 running up to 0.1 per cent at $120,000. This is the result of the National Mutual's computer analysis, but with a tax of 4 per cent on the funds there will still be net benefits in the typical superannuation arrangement. In other words, all of the scaremongering which honourable members opposite have undertaken to try to disturb people about their retirement savings is wrong. National Mutual Life publishes tables for the typical superannuation contributor based on a typical mix between employee and employer contributions, but even with a 4 per cent tax-that is, even before any of the portfolios are changed-there will still be net benefits. If members of the Opposition do not think that is right they should give Eric Mayer a ring and tell him. I have the figures here and the Opposition can look at them. Mr MACKellar-What about the valuation of the properties?",42
75,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"I answered that for the honourable member. Superannuation funds understand the value of their assets, otherwise they would not be keeping their current portfolios. The worse line that has been put about by the Opposition is that these tax changes will mean that if funds have to engorge more equities it will destabilise the funds and put them at risk. I would simply like to incorporate in Hansard a table-I will table it in a moment-which shows that in the five-year periods 1973 to 1978, 1978 to 1983 and 1983 to 1988 we have had a much superior performance from equities as compared to fixed interest securities. From 1973 to 1978, the rate of return was 5 per cent for equities and 9.5 per cent for bonds; from 1978 to 1983, 20.8 per cent for equities and 12.3 per cent for bonds; from 1983 to 1988, including the period of the stock market crash, 23.4 per cent for equities and only 13.4 per cent for bonds. In other words, the line that Opposition members have been irresponsibly prattling about in this place to the effect that we will destabilise superannuation funds by making them ingest a higher level of corporate shares is, of course, bunkum, designed only to frighten people, when in fact the opposite is the case. I table that document for later incorporation, Madam Speaker. What we have said has been confirmed by the major players in the industry. A newspaper article which quoted Mr Eric Mayer of National Mutual Life said: . . . overall the effects of the tax would be marginally advantageous for superannuation fund members. 'The marginal effect is slightly positive but the Government will get the tax now instead of later . . . In other words, he has endorsed what we have said. I might add that Mr Mayer also has the carriage of taxation policy for the Business Council of Australia. The fact is that the Opposition has been left high and dry with its miserable, small-minded approach to every major issue.",42

79,Madam SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION,I did not tell the Treasurer to return to his answer as I found the Treasurer in order.,43
80,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"I will finish off, Madam Speaker, because I would not want Clarence over there to be upset. I simply say that in these changes we will have a proper basis of taxation for the superannuation industry. Superannuation will now remain entrenched in the Australian savings and retirement incomes system. It will be spread to all the work force, whereas those opposite basically kept it in the public sector and for people on higher incomes. Of course, the result will be a beneficial tax change for the whole of the savings structure of this economy. Everyone in industry knows that, and that is why those people are not going to have a bar of the comments of those opposite and they will relegate them to the negative, carping political scrapheap where they belong.",43

83,Mr SAUNDERSON,PROVISIONAL PARLIAMENT HOUSE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. What will be the future shape and use of this old Parliament House?,44
84,Mr WEST,PROVISIONAL PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"The Government is now considering the future external configuration and the future use of this the provisional Parliament House. As far as the external shape is concerned, we favour a return as far as practicable to the 1927 configuration. That would involve, of course, the demolition of the south-eastern and south-western extensions. This demolition is preferred because if we were to keep those wings they would represent a significant structural limitation on the future use of the building. There would be a very large maintenance cost involved over time if we were to keep these two wings on the current Parliament House. Many proposals have been put forward for possible future use, including use as parliamentary exhibition and education facilities. We have also considered a portrait gallery and an international conference centre. The building will then continue to perform an important role in the traditional political history of Australia. When the future use is specifically determined, bearing in mind that I have said we have virtually decided what the outside configuration will be, and in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of the Parliament Act, each House of parliament will be asked separately to approve any works necessary and then, of course, they will be informed of the proposed final shape and permanent use. NA",44
85,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. In introduction may I say that the best way to describe the superannuation package is to compare it to a Rubik's cube. All the blocks must interlock and all assumptions must be absolutely consistent. Any variation of any of those assumptions will give a very different result. In view of that, I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that a worker in an average superannuation fund, with a salary of, say, $30,000 per annum, would receive four times final salary at retirement or death under existing taxation arrangements? Will he agree that the widow beneficiary under this arrangement would receive a tax free lump sum of $120,OOO? Is it also correct that under the new arrangements a widow would receive no more than $102,000, which represents a loss of $18,000 because of the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions? In addition, there would also be a further loss due to the tax on fund income, which would obviously vary depending on the level of that income. Will he assure the House that under the new taxation arrangements any widow will not lose a cent?",44
86,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"Death arrangements have always depended on the timing of tax treatment. Someone could receive a lump sum and pay tax on it and then die. The family could then have a benefit in that respect. The converse would apply if the point of death were at a different time. I am at the moment analysing these aspects in relation to the tax on funds, that is, in the hands of a widow after the death of her spouse. This is only for the period when the funds will be taxed; otherwise the benefit could come from the fact that the lump sum was not to be applied. That is something I am currently examining. I repeat what I said this morning: I had to send to the newspapers 10 examples of claims made by the honourable member for Bradfield about superannuation-I also sent him a copywhich were wrong. I would like to make it clear-Mr Connolly-I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. I am prepared to debate this package with the Treasurer anywhere at any time. He knows as well as I do that-",44
87,Madam SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. He is not putting forward a point of order. Mr Connolly-He can come in here and have the protection of Question Time.,44
88,Madam SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. He is not only totally out of order, but knows he is out of order.",44
89,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"I will not take up the time of the House. I seek to table the correspondence which I produced and directed to the honourable member for Bradfield in relation to those errors and the factual replies to those claims, part of which I read out in the debate this morning, for inclusion in Hansard.",44
90,Madam SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION,Order! The papers will not be included in Hansard. There are special guidelines covering such papers. The Treasurer can table them. Unless they are actual tables they will not be incorporated in Hansard.,44
91,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"I will table them, Madam Speaker.",44
92,Madam SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION,"I call the honourable member for Robertson, by popular demand, I think.",45
93,Mr COHEN,SUPERANNUATION,"As this is my last question in this House, I address my question to the Prime Minister. He would be aware of the recent upsurge in anti-Asian sentiment in this country created in part by adverse publicity given to Asian immigration and investment. The Prime Minister will no doubt have had his attention drawn to an unsavoury anti-Japanese meeting held on the Gold Coast recently, attended unfortunately by a prominent Labor member of parliament. Will the Prime Minister, first of all, publicly reject this racist outburst and point to the people of Australia the damage it will do to our diplomatic and trading relations with Will he also call upon political leaders throughout Australia, including the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia, to support him and to publicly disown this covert racism hiding under the blanket of protecting Australia from foreign ownership? Will he recognise, as other Australian governments in the past have failed to do, that racism in all its forms can be ended only by a positive program of education? Will he take steps to initiate such a program through the schools system and the media?",45
94,Mr HAWKE,SUPERANNUATION,"I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. In addition to thanking him for his question, I believe that he deserves great credit for the consistent way in which he has shown his support for tolerance in this community and his consistent opposition to racism in any form. I identify myself with him completely in that respect. The honourable member asked his question on a day that my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs tabled the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which, as I said in answer to an earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition, is calculated to enable and indeed encourage debate in the community on Australia's immigration policy. It is entirely propriate that this should be a matter of discussion in this community. We should not be afraid of it. We should be a mature enough society to face up to these issues. We should not seek to silence anyone in the community who wishes to speak; but, as a community, we should be able to do this without resort to labels, rancour or racist-type overtones. RACISM I have made it clear, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, that while we seek to encourage debate in the community, there are certain elements of our immigration policy which are non-negotiable. It is appropriate, in answer to the honourable gentleman, that I state unequivocally, and I say it unashamedly, that among those principles is the principle that our immigration policy must remain entirely uncontaminated by any hint of unfair discrimination which is sought to be based on national or ethnic origin, race, colour, gender or religion. I know that the honourable gentleman would associate himself with that position. I believe that Australians should, and in fact do, take enormous pride in their record of acout cepting into this country people from diverse backgrounds. The figures are quite remarkable Asia? and I remind the House of them. Since 1945, Australia has provided home to some 4t million people from some 130 countries. Almost half of Australia's postwar population increase has been the result of immigration. As a result of all those factors, today four out of every 10 Australians are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, and half of them are from non-English speaking backgrounds. Once those facts are appreciated-that Australia is unalterably an ethnically and culturally diverse nation-the need for a policy of multiculturalism becomes quite clear. Specifically in terms of the honourable gentleman's question, it should be absolutely apparent why any overtones of racism in any debate in this country should be repudiated by Australians. What multiculturalism means in this country should be clear. It is simple. It means an acceptance and an appreciation of diversity and a fair go for everyone in Australia, irrespective of their background. As I had reason to say earlier this year when we began the celebrations of our Bicentenary, it is not the way a person looks, dresses or talks that makes him an Australian today; nor is it the form of religious practice or social life a person follows; nor is it related to when a person's family arrived in this country; nor is it the colour of a person's skin. What apmakes a person an Australian in this country today is quite simply a clear commitment to the future of our nation. It is that commitment to Australia which overrides every other consideration. In response to the question from the honourable member for Robertson, it is also relevant to say, as I have said on many occasions, that Australia's capacity to survive in the years ahead as a prosperous and viable society, one in which all our kids will have a chance of employment and a secure job, will depend upon the preparedness of this country to enmesh itself with the dynamism of our region, the Asian-Pacific region. That is indisputably true. Quite apart from any considerations of morality, which should be overwhelming, it should be clear that in our own self-interest, if we are looking to the future of this country, it is an absurdity to allow, engage in or permit any suggestion of anti-Asian discrimination or racism in this country. As to the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question, I believe that great strides are being taken in spreading this message around this country. I believe that the present generation of young Australians are the best informed of any generation in this country about the realities of our region and the realities of the world environment in which they live. The honourable member is right to emphasise in his question the necessity for further education and public information about these matters. They are priorities which are being taken up by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. These things are fundamentally important. It is a credit to the honourable member that in his last question in this place he should go to the issues which, as I say, go to the very heart of the nature of this society and what sort of future it is going to have. If we in this country allow any suggestion of discrimination to occur and, particularly in regard to the question he asked, if there emerges in this country any suggestion of anti-Asian discrimination, not only will we be acting in a way which is morally repugnant, but we will certainly be acting in a way which is against the future interests of the young people of this country and future generations. So I thank the honourable member for his question and certainly hope that the leaders of the Opposition parties will join me in these sentiments. NA",45
95,Mr TIM FISCHER,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,"I refer the Treasurer to his claim that his reforms to preservation arrangements will encourage people to leave their benefits in superannuation funds or approved deposit funds (ADFs). In view of his decision to allow beneficiaries to take their benefits prior to the minimum retirement age of 55 and reduce the current tax from 31.25 per cent at present to 21.25 per cent, how can the Treasurer guarantee that such a measure will not encourage further double dipping?",46
96,Mr KEATING,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,"That question is predicated on the view that people should invest in superannuation to lose the sum that they may accrue from their pension. I ask: Who would say, 'I will pay for my own pension by investing in superannuation and therefore the nation will not have to pay for it.'? As an industrial and investment policy, that would be an enormous lemon. That is why we have said in the document that we do not wish to see and will not see retirement incomes through superannuation withdrawn dollar for dollar through the assets test on the pension. In other words, we regard it as an addition to income in retirement to the pension, to be moderated by the income and assets test arrangements. Those opposite would take the pension from people because they think the pe0ple are double dipping. They would snatch it back. Those opposite are saying that as a savings policy they would encourage people to invest in superannuation but would rip it off their pension. Who is going to invest his after tax income and, particularly with families, lose the daily and weekly income to invest in superannuation, and then lose it all, dollar for dollar, off the pension? Nobody would do it. That is why we have rejected that-but those opposite apparently do not hold that view. They would take it out of the pension. That is the position of the Liberal Party of Australia; it is not our position. Mr Connolly-You have been complaining about the tax laws.",46
97,Madam SPEAKER,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,I call the honourable member for Bradfield to order.,46
98,Mr KEATING,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,The honourable member does not have a clue. Mr Connolly-You know the money that is involved and it is-,46
99,Mr KEATING,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,He should just go quietly away. Mr Connolly-Don't you worry about the taxpayers?,46
100,Madam SPEAKER,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,I warn the honourable member for Bradfield.,46
101,Mr KEATING,RETIREMENT BENEFITS,"Those are the facts of life. It is only this Government that has insisted upon preservation to age 55 under the 3 per cent arrangement. It is only this Government which put in the approved deposit fund structure. Before the approved deposit fund structure, people had to take their money out, and that was the end of it. Now the majority of people do not take the money out at age 55; they preserve it to age 60 or 65 by leaving it in an ADF, the funds that we established in 1983. Now we have full preservation and full vesting through age 55 for the 3 per cent schemes. So on what basis did the honourable member ask that puerile question? NA",46
102,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,Can the Treasurer inform the House what action the Government is taking to improve Australia's competitiveness and the performance of Australian business? Will these policies improve our long run balance of payments position?,47
103,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,"The very essence of the Government's policy framework over the last five years has been to achieve each of the objectives mentioned in the question. Last week's May statement was a further instalment of this Government's comprehensive agenda. Support for the May statement in the Press was evidenced by the leaders written the next day. An article in the Courier-Mail headed 'The triumph of rationality' states: However, when a Labor Government proposes such radical measures, it is both a measure of its determinamanaged tion for economic reform and an indication of how the ALP has changed in Government. This May economic statement is an impressive document . . . It reveals that hard decisions can be made by confident governments, that lessons can be learned and that economic rationality will triumph over politics, given half a chance.",47
104,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,"Ha, hal",47
105,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,"The Leader of the Opposition should laugh; he takes every opportunity to make sure cynicism triumphs over rationality. The leader in the Age is headed, 'Complex, but shrewd and rational'. The Australian states: The Government is entitled to expect the market to welcome last night's economic reforms. They are at the forefront of anything that has been done in any developed country in the world. Indeed, it has taken a Labor government to unwind completely the spending excesses of both the Whitlam and Fraser yearsneed I say the Howard yearsThe public sector is today smaller than it was before the Whitlam government assumed office. The Canberra Times editorial is headed, 'A laudable strategy'. There are a whole lot of endorsements from around the world. The remarks made yesterday by the Chief Executive Officer of Australia's biggest industrial company, Mr Loton, were reported in today's Press as follows: the corporate tax reform was the most tangible and important affirmation of the Federal Government's commitment to an open economy. He said the tax cut had changed the overall framework for Australian business forever. No wonder honourable members opposite are looking glum; they have good cause to. Mr Loton said: What is new is that for the individual Australian company, international competitiveness is rapidly being transformed from a 'management option' into a necessity as well. In other words, we have opened Australia up to the rest of the world and Australian companies are going to go out to trade in that world. But Mr Loton's strongest praise was for the floating of the Australian dollar. He said: It is hard to overstate the ending of the significance of the regime of fixed exchange rates, under which the dollar was supported at artificially high levels for long periods of time. If we want an implicit and total condemnation of everything the coalition stood for in office-a regulated, hidebound and closeted economy, exchange rates, an overvalued dollar, floods of imports, diminished incomes for rural producers, an uncompetitive tax system, double tax on dividends, a 60 per cent marginal rate and a 46 per cent company rate-it is all there in Mr Loton's statement. It is a most solid endorsement of the Government's strategy from the leading executive of the largest industrial company in the country. So the praise is not simply coming from the leader writers; it is coming from business, from the markets. It is coming from the foreign exchange market and from all the other markets in the Australian economy. But most of all it is coming from the opinion polls, from the ordinary working people of this country who understand that a stronger economy means more jobs and higher real incomes over time. They understand what these structural changes really mean for their well-being as a nation and as individuals. The fact is that the Liberal and National parties today must look at those polls and wonder about their negativism, their aggressive retrograde view of the world, and ponder the fact that, even though they might have been the Government for most of the life of this building, the whole notion of squatting which they had has been well and truly imparted to us over the years. Now we are squatting. We are here to squat not just in this building but also in the next one, and we will go to the new building in the strongest political position we have been in.",47
106,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,You're an arrogant lot.,47
107,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN COMPETITIVENESS,"Yes, and we have a bit to be arrogant about when it comes to people like the honourable member. We have a strong and restructured economy, the support of the populace, the support of the trade unions and the support of business, and if there is any squatting to be done it is we who will be squatting in the new Parliament House for a very long time.

111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,49
112,Mr LINDSAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,49
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,49
114,Mr LINDSAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article on page 1 of the Townsville Bulletin of 28 May 1988 it is stated, inter alia: The member for Herbert, Mr Ted Lindsay, a former chairman of the water board, said he expected the Federal Government to provide assistance for the line in the August Budget. I did not make that statement attributed to me.",49
115,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I wish to make a personal explanation, Mr Deputy Speaker.",49
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,49
117,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,49
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,49
119,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Treasurer (Mr Keating), both in his speech this morning and again in Question Time, referred to a statement he issued dated 30 May. He claims that a copy was sent to my office. That is a somewhat dubious interpretation of events. In the statement he claims I made a number of errors. In fact, the errors were not exclusively by me but also by him in his explanations. I draw attention· to the facts. On the first point, on page 12 of the Government's document Reform of the Taxation Superannuation, it is clear that the Medicare levy does apply to lump sums over $60,000. Consequently, beneficiaries above that amount will pay the 16.25 per cent tax, which includes the Medicare levy. In point 2 I was referring to investment earnings. They are taxed in the hands of the funds on an annual basis at the rate of 15 per cent. In relation to points 3 and 4 I was referring to the fact that a person taking up to $60,000 in a lump sum receives that sum tax free. It is also true that a person earning over $35,000 will have his retirement benefit multiple reduced.",49
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Bradfield can say where he was misrepresented but this is not supposed to become a long debate.,49
121,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I understand the difficulty you face, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the point is that the Treasurer made a clear statement detailing where I had allegedly made errors. The Treasurer claimed there were 10 points. I am simply identifying the key points. I am not even bothering about the 10 of them; I am covering just the main ones. A person earning over $35,000 will have his retirement benefit multiple reduced from seven times the final salary; that is, for people who receive up to $35,000, it is seven times final average salary, for people on $35,000 to $65,000 it is five times F AS and for people on over $65,000 it is three times F AS. Therefore, there has clearly been a reduction. In relation to point 5, earnings on funds in approved deposit pipefunds will be taxed annually at 15 per cent. This is yet another new tax.",49
122,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member is quite clearly debating the issue. He is way out of order on a personal explanation.",49
123,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am not debating the issue.,49
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have asked the honourable member to come very succinctly to the point. If the honourable member wants to launch into a lengthy personal explanation, the adjournment debate is normally considered the best place to do that. The honourable member might draw his remarks pretty quickly to a close.",49
125,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"As I said, there are clear explanations. Under the Standing Orders I cannot ask that the document be incorporated in Hansard. Therefore, I will seek to table the document. My final concern is in regard to the ninth point. I stated that industry sources had led me to state that the actual amount of funds which would have to be returned from overseas would be significant-about $7 billion to $8 billion. The Treasurer's response was that that was wrong and that, in fact, only $2.9 billion would be involved. I have checked with the AMP Society, the Westpac Banking Corporation, BT Australia Ltd, the National Mutual Life Association and MLC Ltd. Their funds alone which are invested overseas total $4.5 billion. Consequently, what I said was absolutely right and what the Treasurer claimed was absolutely wrong.",49
126,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",50

129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,50
130,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During Question Time today the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) answered a dorothy dix question on a matter relating to the Constitutional Commission. The facts are as follows: last year the Constitutional Commission gave its mailing list to a private mailing firm to allow it to send out material to promote a book written by a member of one of the advisory committees. In response, I asked the Attorney General, on notice, whether the Opposition might also be able to have use of the mailing list to send out the No case. I put that to him on the basis that the Constitutional Commission was sending out the Yes case. I approached the Constitutional Commission-",50
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Could the honourable member get to where he was misrepresented.,50
132,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am nearly finished, Mr Deputy Speaker. I approached the Constitutional Commission. I advised it that my material would include quotes from prominent members of the Australian Labor Party. I said that that material would indicate the views of those members. I was told by the Constitutional Commission that that material would be inappropriate and that it would not distribute it. I said to the Constitutional Commission that I was not prepared to be censored.",50
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think we are reaching the stage of finishing this matter.,50
134,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I have two or three more points.,50
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do not think we are going to have two or three more points.,50

138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I want you to tell the House precisely where somebody has misrepresented your position. I would like you to do that expeditiously.,50
139,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The misrepresentation was that I had sought access to a mailing list so that I could have the benefit of having in my possession lists of names and addresses of people currently with the Constitutional Commission. As I explained to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a misrepresentation of the position that I have adopted.",50
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member has now explained to the House where he was misrepresented and he should resume his seat.,50
141,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I have not been given an opportunity properly to explain the manner in which I have been misrepresented.,50
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! There is no real provision to do that. One is allowed to say where one was misrepresented. One is not allowed to debate the matter. You have pointed out to the House where you were misrepresented, and that has gone on the record. I suggest that you now resume your seat, unless there is another area where you were misrepresented.",50
143,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"With great respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can fully explain the manner in which I have been misrepresented only if you allow me to finish my remarks, which I will do expeditiously.",50
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,If there is another area where you were misrepresented; you may proceed.,50
145,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Thank you; I will proceed. I then sought access under the Freedom of Information Act on the basis that I wanted the list made available to me. It was not made available on the basis that the Constitutional Commission wished to censor the material that we sought it to distribute.,50
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,That has nothing to do with where you mayor may not have been misrepresented. The honourable member will resume his seat.,50
147,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I conclude by saying that all we have asked for is a fair go. The Attorney has agreed-,50
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member will resume his seat.,50
149,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make an explanation.,50

152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The Attorney-General and the honourable member for Flinders will resume their seats. I am still not aware of what the Attorney-General wishes to bring to my attention. When he says something, I will then make a decision about whether it is relevant or not, and we can then deal with points of order if others wish to do so. Mr Reith-I have a point of order now.",51
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member cannot have a point of order before someone has started; he just cannot do that. Mr Reith-The Attorney-General has started and I rise on a point of order.,51

159,Mr WEST,CORNER OF EXHIBITION AND,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of an office building, corner of Exhibition and Lonsdale Streets, Melbourne. I table a copy of my speech and a photograph of the model of the proposed work. I commend my motion to the House.  posal for a reference to the Standing Committee on Public Works of the construction of an office building on the corner of Exhibition and Lonsdale Streets for Telecom Australia. I will also be very brief because I understand that the Government is in a mad rush to guillotine 16 Bills through this House today in an outrageous fashion. I will just make one comment: The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is referring this matter to the Public Works Committee on the basis that as a trial it will examine the proposal on conceptual design information inherent in the revised contractual system intended to be employed with this project. I draw to the attention of the Public Works Committee the serious concern which the Opposition has about past bungling by Telecom Australia in the construction of its office buildings. In one case in Adelaide, for example, the ceiling on 23 floors of the new Telecom Centre had to be reworked, at a cost of $500,000, because of a mistake made in the construction of that building. I urge the Public Works Committee to look very closely at this proposal to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not wasted again by Telecom. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA FACTORY TO MULWALA, NEW SOUTH NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",51
160,Mr WEST,WALES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on ,which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Relocation of Albion Explosives Factory to Mulwala, New South Wales. I commend the motion to the House and table a copy of my speech.  be very brief. I seek your indulgence for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I will not be speaking on the valedictories later. I have served in this House for six years in government and 5+ years on the front bench of the Opposition. Very briefly, I thank present and past officers of this House-a number of whom are present today. A number of present and past officers of transport are present today who have also assisted us. I thank them. I also thank the attendants and other staff in the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence. Very briefly, this is a request for the approval of the House for the relocation of the Albion Explosives Factory in Melbourne to Mulwala in New South Wales. Mulwala is some 90 kilometres out of Albury. The cost of the project is $78.4m-that is in 1987 dollars. It involves a substantial upgrading and expansion of the facilities which are currently at Mulwala. There are just a couple of issues I want to raise on behalf of the Opposition and on behalf of the people in that district. My colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) will also speak very briefly on this motion. Two matters have been raised by the Public Works Committee. One is that there should be negotiations between the Shire of Corowa and the Commonwealth to resolve the issue of the Commonwealth's contribution to the annual maintenance of roads which access this Commonwealth establishment. The onus is on the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) to ensure that there is a positive outcome to those negotiations. Secondly, we again ask the Minister to pursue the Committee's recommendation that consultations be taken between Commonwealth, State and local government authorities to ensure that a reasonable amount of surplus land currently owned by the Commonwealth is made available for the urban expansion of Mulwala. This proposal will improve the waste management of effluent which is currently being dumped in the River Murray. I exhort the Minister again to pursue the waste management proposal in this plan to improve the quality and to reduce the amount of effluent being dumped in the River Murray. As downstream users of the River Murray, all South Australians will be pleased if there is an improvement in the water quality. Finally, there is an onus on the Government to look closely at the management of this plant. Obviously, there is low morale or some other serious problem with the safety of working conditions at the plant. If we look at the annual report of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation we see that an extraordinarily large number of sick days were taken at the Mulwala explosives ractory for the year 1986-87. There was 61 new cases of compensation, 33 continuing cases and there were only 254 people working there. We on this side of the chamber want to see a substantial improvement, either in the management or in the industrial relations at the plant to overcome what appears to me to be a morale problem. I cannot believe that all those people were injured in the undertakings of the plant. Again, I exhort the Minister to concentrate his attention on the work to be undertaken in the plant in the production of ammunition and other Defence Force requirements.",51
161,Mr TIM FISCHER,WALES,"As local member for the area involved I signify my support for this key project and indicate that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) has also had an involvement over the years in the building up of the Mulwala explosives factory. It is a case of classic decentralisation. Greater efficiency will be conferred on explosives production by this move from Albion in Melbourne to the new Greenfields site immediately to the west of and adjoining the existing explosives factory. I believe that the project will work successfully. It will boost employment and the economy in the local sub-region. I will certainly be working closely to ensure that adequate safeguards are maintained so that there is no environmental pollution of the area. I take this opportunity to say that I hope the mace will have a safe journey up to the top of the hill. I am confident that we will avoid the shemozzle which took place in the Senate last night in the closing stages of our proceedings in this wonderful House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In fact, it was part of an amendment moved by me in the committee stage of this Bill when it was passed through this chamber under the guillotine. An indication of the farce of the guillotine in this place is that what we had to say at that time was not even considered by the Government in this chamber. The legislation had to go to the Senate and come back here after that unwieldy procedure for agreement to an amendment that could have been made in this chamber in the first place. Once again we left it to the Senate to do the legislative work of this chamber. The amendment will have the effect of preventing employees of the Australian Taxation Office being chairmen of the newly constituted tax agents registration boards. This is entirely desirable. We sought to go one step further to remove any employee of the Australian Taxation Office from these boards, to be constituted on proclamation of this legislation. The Government did not see fit to go all that way. However, the fact that employees of the Australian Taxation Office may not be chairmen of the newly constituted boards, is at least-",54

167,Mr REITH,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"We are considering very briefly the amendments which the Senate has made to the Constitution Alteration (Fair Elections) Bill and other Bills which the Government wants the people to approve of when we have a referendum later this year. I must register on behalf of the Opposition the strongest possible protest at the way this Government is ramming these Bills through the chamber today. The reality is that this is not just some ordinary law that the Government can turn around and change. Today we are talking about our Constitution and we are talking about the Australian Labor Party wanting to meddle with people's constitutional rights. To try to deal with a complex set of questions in six or seven minutes is just a disgrace. The Government is not only not prepared to have a fair debate today, but is not even prepared to have fair questions, nor is it prepared to allow the Opposition and people throughout the community some opportunity to read the fine print. I say to the people of Australia that there is more to these proposals coming from the Labor Party than meets the eye. The House of Representatives has received three amendments back from the Senate because the Government, in preparing in undue haste these proposals to change our Constitution, made some mistakes, and we had to point them out to the Government. These are very complex Bills. I warn the Australian public that if in just a couple of weeks we have been able to find some major mistakes, some major unintended consequences, in just one of the Bills, they can rest assured that many more unintended consequences will be found as we sift through the fine print of Labor's constitutional Bills. It was not just that someone forgot to dot the i's and cross the t's; the Government had in one of these Bills a proposal which would have invalidated the electoral system that the Government itself was proposing for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). What irony! A few weeks ago the Government said, 'We have this great plan for a legislature in the Australian Capital Territory'. When we read the fine print we find that its own plan would, in fact, never have been able to come into force because of its own constitutional referendum proposals. That applies not just to the ACT; it could have knocked out the New South Wales upper House and maybe had some effect on South Australia. There are many complex issues to be found in this Bill. Let me give the Committee one example. This Government tells us that our constitutional right to vote will be protected by these Bills if we vote yes. I was amazed when legal experts told us that it might well be the case that this Bill did not give us a constitutional right to vote in respect of the Senate but in fact removed it. The reality is that the Labor Party wants to meddle with people's rights. The only good news is that in the end it is the people who decide what shall and shall not be changed in our Constitution. There are many hidden traps in Labor's four constitutional referendum questions. The questions themselves are misleading. It is not just the Opposition saying this. Mr Gary Morgan, probably the most professional pollster, the person with the most experience in asking questions of people in Australia, described the four questions as blatantly biased. We know why they are blatantly biased: because the Labor Party wants to kid people into voting yes on these four proposals. The Government tells us, 'There is nothing in it for the politicians'. Anybody who believes that needs his head read. There is much in these four Bills of great political advantage to the Government. Any politician who tells us otherwise is not telling the full truth. I say to people: beware the Labor Party when it wants to start meddling with our Constitution. It is always complaining how hard it is to get referendum proposals through. It is one of its favourite complaints. It has put up 21 proposals and, thank heaven, the Australian electorate knocked back 20 of them, and with very good reason. The public has a very healthy scepticism and cynicism about politicians who say, 'I'm from the Government. I've come to help you'. So the public should have a healthy cynicism. When people read the fine print, they will find that their rights are not enhanced. These proposals, in fact, restrict their rights. We have loud, constitutional lawyers on the Government back bench. Let us take the question of trial by jury. Both sides of the chamberin fact everybody-support trial by jury. Let me tell the Committee what I think about trial by jury. I am sure the people in the gallery will agree with me that trial by jury is 12 people making a decision as to whether a person is innocent or guilty. That is my idea of trial by jury. When we read the fine print of the Government's proposal for trial by jury, we find, as did the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, that people would be convicted of serious offences on the say so of a majority of two people out of a jury of three.",55

174,Mr FIFE,SITTING,"I wish to indicate the Opposition's support for this motion, which sets down the arrangements to be followed on the first sitting day of the Parliament in the new Parliament House. They are eminently suitable arrangements. With your indulgence, Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my thanks to the Clerks and to all employees in this building, regardless of whether they work for the Parliament, for the Government or for the Opposition. I thank them, as indeed I record our appreciation for those who preceded them. They have all made a tremendous contribution towards the smooth running of this Parliament. Like all members, I leave this place with mixed feelings. I realise on the one hand that this building has outlived its usefulness as a home for Australia's Parliament; on the other hand, it harbours many happy memories for me. I first came into the building at the age of 14 as a guest of a very eminent member of the Chifley Government, Herbert Claude Barnard, whose son later became Deputy Prime Minister. Some two or three years later I was interviewed by Sir Robert Menzies, when he was Leader of the Opposition, and subsequently obtained my first position with the Federal secretariat. Honourable members might be interested to know-they may in a lighthearted way wonder why-that I used to bring Marcia here when I was courting her. I found it cheaper entertainment than the Capitol Theatre in Canberra. I came back years later as State Minister, attending numerous ministerial conferences and many Premiers Conferences. Of course, in recent years I have had the privilege of representing first the electorate of Farrer and, after the enlargement of parliament and the redistribution, the electorate of Hume. I hope that when we move into the new Parliament House not only will we have a new building and wonderful facilities in which to work but also, as a result, members on both sides of the House, under your guidance, Madam Speaker, will be able to demonstrate to the Australian public that we have achieved not just improved conditions, but a corresponding rise in the standard of this Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",57
175,Mr HAWKE,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"I move: That this House extends its thanks to all those and present Members and staff who have contributed to the work of the House of Representatives in this place since 9 May 1927 and places on record its appreciation of their contribution to parliamentary democracy in Australia. The Federal Parliament has occupied two homes since Federation and will soon move to its third and permanent home. In this building's 61 years as the provisional Parliament House, 36 Commonwealth ministries have served the nation here in the course of 26 parliaments. Madam Speaker, 61 years is a short time for so much history. Yet there can be no doubt that, measured by the importance of the events which have taken place here and the stature of the Australians who have worked here, this chamber is the most historic room in Australia. At the opening of our new and permanent home I referred to the ghosts and spirits of our parliamentary past. There is no doubt, here in these closing moments, how closely so many of them seem to crowd in upon us. It is in this room, more than anywhere else in Australia, that the process of our nationhood has developed during the past 61 years. Australia now stands as a mature, diverse, independent nation and we have reached that stage not least because of the work that has been done within these walls. They have been years of tremendous and accelerating change. Yet it is a remarkable tribute to the continuity and the stability of the Australian democracy that this institution of Parliament remains, I believe, as strong as ever and as central as ever to the fabric of our national life. This chamber-the House of Representatives, the House from which the elected governments of this nation derive that authority, the people's House-remains at the very heart of that national life. I give this striking illustration of the remarkable continuity of this institution and, because of it, the continuity of our nation's history. The father of this present House, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), served in this place during eight years-almost half-of the second prime ministership of Sir Robert Menzies. When we reflect that the honourable member for Reid was a Minister until 1987 in the Hawke Ministry and a Minister throughout the Whitlam Ministry; when we reflect that in his own person he represents a continuum with Menzies and MCEwen, Evatt and Calwell; and when we reflect that they, in turn, represent a larger and a longer continuum through to ChiSTAFF fley, Curtin, Lyons, Scullin and Bruce, with Hughes providing a link with the first Parliament itself, surely we gain a deep and poignant former sense of the long and continuing past of which we are all privileged to be a living part. Yet, for all its fundamental continuity and stability, this institution-and this chamber in particular-has never lacked its capacity for drama, for the unexpected, for turbulence and even, dare I say it, the occasional unruliness and even the odd larrikinism.",57
176,Unknown,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,Honourable members interjecting,58
177,Mr HAWKE,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"But not often, as you can see, Madam Speaker. Importantly, that is really just another way of saying that this has always been an authentically Australian chamber. In more than one sense we are the representatives of our nation. Each of us will have our individual memories and experiences but we also share collective memories not only of our own times but of this House and the events which have taken place in it. That is all part of the collective memory of the nation itself-the history of modem Australia. In the first five years in this chamber two governments were defeated on the floor of the House-Bruce in 1929 and Scullin in 1932. Here took place the agonising debates of a nation grappling with the Great Depression, the secret sessions of the War, the tremendous debates on bank nationalisation and on the Communist Party dissolution Bills, the Browne-Fitzpatrick debate, the Suez debate, the Voyager debates, the Vietnam debates, the VIP affair debates, the loans debates, the epic debates on the constitutional crisis of 1975. There have been tremendous personal confrontations such as Page's philippic against Menzies in 1939, Menzies and Evatt, Ward and Menzies, Fraser and Gorton, Whitlam and Holt, Gorton and MCMahon, and Snedden and Fraser. This has been the setting for three score Premiers Conferences and the historic National Economic Summit Conference of April 1983. One event and one period stand above all else not only for their historic importance but also as an assertion of the power and 'the authority of this Parliament and this House of Representatives. I refer to the events of October 1941 which made John Curtin Prime Minister of Australia. It was the decision of this House, and House alone, by which the Curtin Government replaced the Fadden Government. It was the will of this House, and this House alone, that sustained John Curtin and the Labor Government until the elections of 1943. With the barest possible majority in this House that greatest of Prime Ministers guided this nation through its years of maximum peril. Of all those momentous 61 years, surely this was the finest hour. The work in the service of this House has never, as we know, been limited to its elected members. Down through the years scores of men and women have contributed to the work-the servants of this House, the servants of this nation. In these final moments I want to pay tribute, on behalf of past and present members, to all those who have served us here and to those who will move with us to the new Parliament House. Madam Speaker, you have carried out a most difficult task with distinction. You will carry the distinction of having been not only the first woman appointed to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives but also, of course, the first person to hold that position in the new building. You have been, and will continue to be, ably assisted by the Chairman of Committees and by those members who serve as Deputy Chairmen of Committees. I also express our gratitude to the Clerk of the House, the Deputy Clerk and the Serjeantat-Arms-another who will carry the dual distinction of being the first woman appointed to that position and the first person to hold the position in the new Parliament House. We should also thank the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and the Hansard staff, the Parliamentary Librarian and the staff of the Library, the Secretary to the Joint House Department and his staff, John May and his team, the Table Office, and the attendants. I note in particular the retirement of John Crisp on 14 April after 17 years of service as an attendant, and John Rowan, who will not seek to extend his 19t years of service in the new Parliament House. We greatly appreciate the work of all staff involved in the provision of these services on which we all rely. We also thank the Whips of each party and their staff, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, and all staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. These are the behind-the-scenes people without whom the business of the House could not be conducted and on whom the Leader of the House and his counterparts in the Opposition parties rely. Last, but by no means least, I this thank the members of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast team and members of the Press Gallery, without whom the people of Australia would be much less informed about the operations of parliament and the decisions taken here which affect our lives. At the end of the first era of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne in 1927, the then Prime Minister Bruce commented in these words: This Parliament first met here when no man knew would be the result of the experiment in government that was then being entered upon. At the close of the second era we can proclaim the success of the experiment embarked upon by our forebears-the building of a nation founded on parliamentary democracy. In these last moments here we can look back with pride and with affection. But now we go forward, not just to a new home but to a new era of achievement in the service of democracy, in the service of a great people and a great nation and in the service of one of the truly great parliaments of the world. HODourable members-Hear, hear!",58
178,Mr HOWARD,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"Members of the Liberal and National parties wish to associate themselves very warmly with the way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has traversed, over the past few minutes, the historic importance to our nation of this great building. People will have different sentiments and a different sense of nostalgia as they leave the building. Some will do it with great alacrity; most will welcome the enhanced facilities of the new building. We would be poor historians if we did not reflect for a moment on the way in which this building has been at the very heart of our national life and our history over the last 61 years. I share with the Prime Minister a recollection of the giants who have trod this building in the past. One is always a captive of one's own personal experiences. I came here in 1974 in the middle of the Whitlam Government. In the 14 years that I have been a member of this Parliament I have been fortunate enough to participate in some of the more interesting, on occasions tense and dramatic, events during that period. But from a very early stage, like many others who followed the parliamentary scene, whatever our politics, with great keenness, I listened to radio broadcasts, and I join the Prime Minister in thanking the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The earliest voice that I remember in Parliament was the very strident voice of Archie Cameron, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives through a long period of the Menzies Government. Over those years many people have left a mark on the parliamentary life of this nation. It is impossible in a short period to pay justice to the contribution of all but, naturally, so far as the Liberal Party of Australia is concerned, the person who stands pre-eminent amongst all and is a giant in anybody's language in terms of his what parliamentary contribution-not only to the history of this building, but to the history of our nation-is Robert Gordon Menzies, the longest serving Prime Minister that this nation has had. He made an enormous contribution to the institutions of our country. On behalf of my Party, I also pay tribute to the contribution-particularly during the 14 years that I have been a member of this Parliamentof Malcolm Fraser, the second longest serving Prime Minister in Australia's history. He has contributed not only to the government of this country but to the upholding.. of the traditions and the values that he held very dear. Without doubt the most significant and certainly the most dramatic day that I can recall in the time that I have been in this building was the drama surrounding the events of 11 November 1975. I mention that in the interests of historically acknowledging the drama and the importance of that day. I do not mention it in any sense of reopening debate on the events surrounding it. I give no apology; I expect none in return. But I think it would be a very strange reflection on the last 14 years not to make some reference to that. The Prime Minister has, quite properly, talked about the contribution of many people. I acknowledge as Leader of the Liberal Party the debt owed by all Australians to the contribution of people on both sides of the House in positions of leadership. No student of Australian history, having acknowledged the contribution of Menzies, could fail to acknowledge the contribution of John Curtin as Leader of the Australian Labor Party during wartime. He was a very esteemed Prime Minister of this country. In the same sense, as this is a parliamentary occasion, let me, in the time that I have been a member, acknowledge the skills of Gough Whitlam as a performer in this Parliament. Whatever one's personal politics, he was certainly a person very capable of comporting himself in a parliamentary arena. But more important, perhaps, even than the people of whom the Prime Minister has spoken are the changes that have passed through Australia over the last 61 years. Australia's population has increased enormously. Our attitudes have changed; our allies have changed; our interests have changed; our values, in some sense, have changed; and we are a different nation from what we were 61 years ago. We have gone through different ages. Sixty-one years ago we still lived very much in an age of colonialism. Subsequently to that, we lived in what I think some would call an age of uncertainty and exuberance. Over the last few years we have been living through another age. I hope that if there is resolve that we all might jointly have as move to the new building-hoping, in that new building, to blend new traditions that will itably emerge with some of the old traditions this building-it is to put behind us what I think is the age of apology through which I believe this country has unfortunately tended to pass recent years. We have spent a little too much time over the last few years-I assure my friends opposite that this is not offered as a partisan comment-apologising a little too too many things about our past. A nation that spends too much time apologising about its past, a nation that is not enough, and game enough, and self-confident enough to talk more stridently about its past a nation that is never going to be certain about its present or purposeful about its future. - n be said that we have passed through ages, In recent years it has, regrettably, been the age of apology. If we could have one great resolve as the elected representatives of all the Austraas lian people we might, in our new parliamentary building, commit ourselves to ending forever des-ructi-e and negative age of apology through which thIS country has passed in recent years.",59

I might say that he stole some of my thunder as well. have served in 13 parliaments. I have served under eight Prime Ministers, from Menzies on the future. wards, five leaders of the Australian Labor Party, and I have lost count in regard to leaders of the Liberal Party of Australia. They change more often than ours. They are more ruthless on their side than we are on ours. Come 22 November will have served 30 years in this Parliament I will serve until the Prime Minister decides there will be an election. I want to mention that there has been ge.neral erosion of the rights of backbenchers mIght I say, to keep balance, both sides of House. That is a sad thing. The Executive taken over. But there has been one positive aspect for backbenchers-the committee system. The committees can get into the bureaucracy. Having been a Minister administering my desolid partment, I can tell honourable members that one has to watch the bureaucracy. .It . would be appropriate at this time-again, thIS IS a sentimental moment-if I were to menretired. tion that, II prisoners of war of the Japanese served in this Parliament, three in the Senate and eight in the House of Representatives. The some only one who did not serve with me was Adair we Macalister Blain. He served between 1934 and 1949: He was serving here, he joined up, became ineva prisoner of war and then came back and of served in this Parliament. Those I did serve with were Charlie Anderson, Bi1ly Kent Hughes, Tom Pearsall, Reg Swartz, Winton Turnbull and Alec in Downer. I am quite sure that Alec Downer w-uld b- proud that his son is now serving in thIS Parliament. The three who served in the Senate were Ken Anderson, George Branson and much for far myoid friend John Carrick. I am glad that the Prime Minister is in the House. The two prisoners of war held by the brave Germans were Malcolm MCColm from the Liberal Party and Justin O'Byrne from our Party. is Eight thousand prisoners of war were taken by the Germans and Italians and 7,700 came home. If it Twenty-two thousand prisoners of war were taken by the Japanese and only 14,000 got home. I think that this Parliament should watch over and give special consideration to those who served Japanese prisoners of war because they served in conditions that no-one could ever imagine the unless they had experienced them themselves. It is not much good telling honourable members stories because they would just say, 'You're just stretching the story a bit', so I just say that. it is wonderful to know that, of those 14,000 who survived, II served their nation in Parliament-and half of those, of course served I in a ministry. But they need special consideration of this Government and of governments in In my view the two most dominating characters in my time in this Parliament-there is one such character here now but I am talking about I the past-were Menzies and Whitlam. Menzies a-d rarely raised his voice, but he always comthat manded the respect and attention of the House. I interjected on him only once; that was the last time and I never led with my chin again. He led a a disciplined Liberal-Country Party-I stress, on, Country Party. There were consistent rumours the on the Government benches that there would be has a split and a break. But Ming would walk through the door and stroll down the passageway with a smile here and a smile there. When the vote was taken the numbers would stand and the Liberal and Country parties would cast a full vote. He was an old disciplinarian and he certainly held his Party together. But the Liberal Party disintegrated shortly after he Whitlam was a different character altogether, but he was just as commanding. He loved the Parliament; he loved its theatre and he loved cutting his opponents down. He was so good he cut Holt, MCMahon and Billy Snedden down, and Snedden at the wrong time. I had my differences with Whitlam in the late 19505 and right through the 19605 but I always respected his courageous advocacy against the white Australia policy. It is ironic that today the Prime Minister had some comments to make on immigration and the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies was brought down. Few people in this Parliament spoke out against the white Australia policy in the 19505 and 19605. Whitlam played a magnificent role. So did Billy Hayden. So did myoid comrade Jim Cairns and, I repeat, the Left of the Party. We always had our line and we were against racial discrimination. We were thrilled that others joined us. For me, Whitlam's other impressive moment was when he delivered the policy speech of the Australian Labor Party in November 1969. When he said that he would have every Australian serving in Vietnam home by 1 July 1970, he won me. From that time on the Labor Party was united. We went forward to become the Government in 1972. I wish now to say something about the present day. I was going to talk about two present day parliamentarians but I do not think that I can steal the time of the House. I do not think that would be fair because planes do not wait for us. However, I will say this of our Prime Minister: he gets the forces together and holds them together. Under Hawke we are a coalition of forces. The thing that mystifies me about John Howard, whom I admire as a parliamentarian, is that he allows men such as Ian Macphee and Peter Baume to remain out of the Liberal Party leadership. That is a mystery to me. Honourable members opposite are a coalition of forces, just as we are on this side. Hawke at least accepts that. Mr Saunderson-Do not give them too much good advice, Tom.",60
180,Mr UREN,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"I am for progress. I fight for progress because I want men and women of goodwill, tolerance and patience to lead this country. I am pro-Gorbachev and pro-Reagan. When they come together in the name of international peace, I am for such progress. Mr Macphee and Senator Peter Baume are men of progress on the Opposition side, and I am for them. I want a better world. That is what we should be fighting for in this Parliament. I cannot talk much longer, but I want to say a few words about John MCEwen. MCEwen was a magnificent parliamentarian. Comparing MCEwen with Holt and MCMahon is like comparing chalk with cheese. I wrote Jack a letter saying that I hoped he would be Prime Minister, because he was a great Australian and a great Australianism. But poor old Jack had to stand aside after a short period as Prime Minister. We have to stand up for men and women of goodwill, wherever they are. Let us seek them out. MCEwen was such a person. He was magnificent. The only other person from the other side I want to mention is Peter Nixon. Peter Nixon was a great Minister. He was not much on the back bench, but he had the right connections to get into the Ministry and he was a first class Minister. I must say that the people of this country owe him a lot for what has been achieved in urban public transport. Even after we were struck down on 11 November 1975, for five years he kept our urban public transport system going-and he was a Country Party Minister! The cities of this country owe him a great deal, as they do the Whitlam Government. I place on record my great respect for Peter Nixon. I could talk at length about people such as Doc Evatt, Reggie Pollard, Eddie Ward, Leslie Haylen, Jim Cairns, Kim Beazley Sr and Clyde Cameron, but I will talk about them at some other time. The only thing I want to say, because Kim Beazley Jr is here, is that Kim Beazley Sr was one of the great orators of this Parliament.",61
181,Mr COHEN,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,The best.,61
182,Mr UREN,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"If he did not feel like it, if his heart was not in it, he was not so good, but on his day he was first class. He was not easily convinced on opposition to the Vietnam war. I could tell a few stories about how difficult he was. But when he came good, boy oh boy did he make a contribution in his speeches in this House. He coined the phrase 'Vietnam, the bottomless pit of human suffering'. He said it with such conviction. The whole momentum of this country changed over that period because of people such as him. I would like to say a few words about Jim Cairns, because I think it would be wrong of me not to do so on behalf of those who were here between 1955 and December 1972. Whatever judgment people may make about Jim Cairns as a Federal Minister from 1972 to 1975, there can be no doubt that he made an enormous impact on this House in the years leading up to 1972. He is remembered not only for his leadership in the struggle against the war in Vietnam, but also for his impressive capacity for logical debate over an enormous field of political matters. Next to Whitlam on our side he was the most impressive person leading up to our election to government in 1972. He was a man of goodwill. He was a very human man. He wanted to be an educator and not a politician, and he probably should have stayed an educator. I have said some words about Cairns in my contribution to the oral history records at the National Library of Australia. I was probably a bit tough on him, but people do not realise that, even though he was my best friend, and still is today, I was his strongest critic leading up to 1972 and during the time he was a Minister. I have a deep love for him and I want to place that on the record. I thank the House for its patience. It is a great place. I say to the younger members, 'This is a kind of ring and there is what you can call the Marquess of Queensberry rule: if you want to get into the gutter, you will be given the gutter treatment. On the other hand, if you get off personalities and stay on policy, in the long term you will bring the best out in people'. Policy not personalities. Stick to policies, seek out men and women of goodwill within this Parliament. I understand that that is what the committee system is helping to do. It is breaking down the barriers to fraternisation. That is how we have to go forward to make this a better Australia and a better world.",61
183,Mr LWYD,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"In the absence of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), who is in China on an official visit, am very honoured to speak on behalf of the National Party and to associate it with the comments of the previous speakers, in particular those of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). The history of the National Party closely approximates the life of this Parliament. In the election of December 1919, the Party, in a loose affiliation, first contested a Federal election the Australian Farmers Federal Organisation but actually sat in the original Parliament in 1920 the Australian Country Party. I think it will come as a surprise to most people that the first Leader of that Party was not Earle Page but William MCWilliams, the member for Franklin, Tasmania. He was succeeded 12 months later by Earle Page, who took the Country Party into the first of many coalitions with the then Nationalists, or Liberal Party, in 1923. He was the Leader of our Party when this Parliament opened in 1927. In the 61 years that this provisional Parliament House has been in place, the National Party, or Country Party, has been part of the government for well over half of those years. The 14 members of the Party who originally occupied this place were told then, as we have been told ever since, that the Party would not last. I assure the House on behalf of the National Party that the Party will last-Mr Tim Fischer-Even if your voice won't.",62
184,Mr LLOYD,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"and will be here for the next 61 years, even though my voice may not last. Earle Page, after a long leadership, finally resigned in 1939. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others have referred to those tumultuous times. Next came Archie Cameron, the member for Barker. Then came Artie Fadden in 1941. He contributed very much to the early years of the Menzies Government before he retired in 1958. My predecessor in Murray, John MCEwen, played a dominant role in the latter period, the two-thirds of that time remaining in the great years of the Liberal and Country parties in government. I thank the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) for the very honest and gracious comments he made about my predecessor, John MCEwen. I share his regard. I came into this place 17 years ago when John MCEwen retired. I am now about the twentieth longest serving member of this House of 148 members. I think that indicates the uncertainty of employment in this place and the turnover that comes as the political pendulum moves one way or the other. Since John MCEwen retired in 1971 we have I continued with some strong leadership, with Doug Anthony to 1984 and now with Ian Sinclair. I want to praise Ian Sinclair because he has been through one of the most difficult times for the Party leadership since the late 1930s. I believe that he will continue as a great and strong leader in the next Government in the new Parliament House after the next election, with John Howard as as Prime Minister. Part of the feeling about Ian Sinclair is indicated by the fact that in the most as difficult election last year the National Party achieved its highest percentage vote since 1943. That indicates that we are here and are staying here in the future. On behalf of the National Party I pay tribute to all my colleagues who have gone before us in this House. They have been stable, they have been loyal, they have been great members of parliament, and they have served rural and regional Australia well. The continuing dominant role of agriculture and mining in our exports indicates that they have served these parts of Australia well. I also recognise, on behalf of the National Party, the great contribution of members of all parties, and the Labor and Liberal Prime Ministers-for a fleeting time Artie Fadden and John MCEwen-the leaders of the parties when they were not in government and the characters who have made up this Parliament over the years. I commend to everybody who may have certain views about this place the continuing, positive and friendly relationships that exist across party boundaries in this place. I acknowledge the strong and enduring relationship the Country or National Party has had with the Liberal Party, in and out of government, and with John Howard, its present Leader. I commend the staff of members of parliament who work in either Canberra or the electorates, and all those who work in this place. All have contributed just as genuinely to parliamentary democracy as we have as members of parliament. I include the media representatives, who represent both the good and bad of this place each day. I want to say, on behalf of the National Party, what a privilege and an honour it has been for all of us to serve Australia from this place. Madam Speaker, I wish you well in the new and permanent Parliament House. But it is a pity that you will not be taking your chair with you, because it would provide some symbolic and physical continuity with this place.",62
185,Madam SPEAKER,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"You will like the new one, Bruce.",63
186,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I will not mention all the people who should be mentioned because they have already been mentioned. I will not forget the Press because, at times, we are very frightened that they will forget us. It has been a great joy for me to be a member of the Australian Labor Party and to be in government. It has always been recognised that that Party of ours has made a great contribution to this nation. When it was formed in the 18905 it was basically trade union organised. However, it had the wit and the wisdom to recognise that that would not count for everything if we did not have elected representatives in parliament. I look at the Prime Minister and I see a shining example of somebody who has come up through the trade union movement and is able to make a great contribution to the leadership of this nation. Going back to the First World War, the Depression and the Second World War, Labor was in government on those occasions. It is significant that the nation always had to be in a crisis before we could get into government. I am not suggesting that we are in that position now. It is interesting to think of those people of Australia, particularly those who are interested in us-those in the branches who take an interest in politics and work for us for nothing-who have an ideal about what this country should be. Often when we are at home we think too much about its weaknesses; it is only when we are overseas that we recognise its strengths. The strength comes from democracy and people being interested. When I think of what Labor governments have to do, and have done, it is with some pride that I remember one aspect of the Whitlam period-the 1972 era-which was to recognise the need to provide more money in areas of most need, for those who were disadvantaged, especially in education. For the first time, we recognised the needs of children at a Federal level. In the old days it would have been argued that we were being unconstitutional; that we could not do it. It was argued eloquently on those occasions to guarantee that we would avoid any responsibility in that area. The disaster of 1975 should never be repeated, but, of course, it could be-until such time as we can get an understanding of what the Constitution is about. Our forefathers knew that there could be no two Houses of finance. Therefore, the word 'reject' was not put into the Constitution. However, the position and the power of politics have to be recognised. The important thing is that in this place we are doing the best we can with the problems of the differences that always divide us. Probably they should not continue to divide us as continually as they do. As long as there is a recognition of poverty, a recognition of the disadvantaged and a recognition of the need to lead this nation in the world from the point of view of a fair and democratic country, we all have a responsibility. People look to us as being able to do a lot for them and we should be expected to do it. They are being educated to the fact that there are a lot of problems in the world. Radio and television interviews and world news broadcasts give them a perspective of how difficult the world is and always has been. The significant thing about the world at the present time is that it is becoming more interdependent. The world just cannot be divided into sections that are isolated from each other. We are in a very volatile and progressive region, the Pacific. It is said it is the area future. We have an opportunity to give a lot good examples, not only to our own people but also to the nations around us. In the 19 years have been here those debates have always been basically aimed at that issue. I must admit Federal politics basically relates to economicsgoing that is the big issue-but there are many other issues that we devote a lot of time to here. I want to thank my Party for the opportunity be able to say these few words. I recognise that we have a lot more work to do and we will be going to a new establishment in which to do it. I thank all members for their support for what we have been able to do in terms of this present Hawke regime of some duration. It is really record for us. I know it will continue and that will be to the advantage of all of us.  the House (Mr Beazley) has pressed me to elements speak-it is amazing-not just as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia but also as longest serving Liberal. There is another degree of pressure and that is that members need catch flights. For all that we love this place, there is no place like home, so what I say will be very brief. I was struck by some words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) when will he felt that in recent times this nation was apologising too much for its history. I do not want to dwell on that point. He is correct, but it is worse than that. Too frequently, this nation is forgetting its history. We can drive ahead only if we are free and free to learn from history. much has emanated from this chamber since 1927, from the Depression to wars, declared undeclared, that ought to be a lesson for that. I am very pleased that I can point to one portfolio I held in this building in the long I have been here which was associated with building of the nation; that was the external territories portfolio. At a subsequent time, of the leaders of Papua New Guinea, now Sir Albert Maori Kiki, wrote a book which he entito tled Ten Thousand Years in a Lifetime. Subseachieve quent to our arriving in this building in 1927, Papua New Guinea was asked to travel more than that period in that time. In many ways this nation of ours has travelled centuries in the short time we have been in this Parliament. I was moved by some points the Deputy Prime Minbers ister (Mr Lionel Bowen) made about the sort democracy we have and the associations we need to develop within our region. Had this been longer debate, I would have touched upon that. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has correctly of the taken this country into the international comof munity. I join issue with him as to who can do it better in the future in terms of what we must I do, but the move has been made to have Australia participating in a global economic environthat ment. The only test for the future is: are we to do it better?-for better we must, if all that transpires in the new Parliament is to count for anything. Otherwise, it will be a bit like that to old Chinese proverb which more or less said: There is a lot of noise on the stairs, but nobody comes into the room. So if our work is to count for anything it will have to focus centrally on economic debates and what we seek to achieve in lifting the living standards of our nation, not a forgetting in this great democracy that it took thousands of years of human civilisation, if not longer, to get to the point where the sorts of civil liberties we take for granted are just thatfor granted. Every time we strike at those of justice and liberty that have developed over time we take a retrograde step. I said the I will be brief. I wish honourable members on both sides of the House well in transferring to to the new Parliament. May it be for all of us while we remain here an endless adventure.",63
187,Mr SCHOLES,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"At this late hour I be brief. The motion is that we thank those who have worked and served in this Parliament House. I have had the opportunity, as a oncer, to have been here for a third of the time the building has been used, and the bridge goes from Dorothy Tangney, Pat Kennelly and Arthur Calwell to the present. The bridge goes from the So start of the building of the Australian Labor Party to today when for the first time since or Federation we have an established long term Labor government. I have had the opportunity to take part in time many of the dramas of the last 20 years, and the there have been a few. But in speaking to a motion such as this it is appropriate to mention one that this Parliament functions because people are willing to spend short periods here to seek achieve the things they believe they should on behalf of those they represent. This Parliament functions because people are dedicated to the work that has to be done here. I make brief mention of the fact that in the gallery opposite are four of those people-three Clerks and Gordon Pike, whom some honourable memmight know, who used to make our plane of reservations 10 years ago, and make sure that we caught them. The Clerks at the end of this a Parliament must have had a much easier life than they did when this building was first used, because while the last four Clerks are all in the chamber at the moment the first two in 1927 lasted only six weeks. To everyone, to the staff and the membersand there have been 300 members through this place in the 20 years I have been here-and all of those who have supported people in their coming to this place and while they have been here, I express regret that we leave and pride that after 61 years we are going to the permanent home of the Australian Parliament.",64
188,Mr DONALD CAMERON,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"Moreton)Madam Speaker, I am struck by the fact that this could well be the last speech in this Parliament House. Mr Katter-What?",65
189,Mr DONALD CAMERON,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"It is the second last speech, I am told.",65
190,Madam SPEAKER,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,The third last.,65
191,Mr DONALD CAMERON,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"In fact it is one of the last speeches, Madam Speaker, as you are also to speak. I have been here during the term of seven Australian Prime Ministers. I was elected in the 1966 election when Harold Holt swept the country in what was regarded as a Vietnam war election. Looking back on that election and Australia's involvement in Vietnam, one should consider that the Vietnamese are still occupying Kampuchea. Maybe the aspirations of the then Opposition were not quite as it stated they were. Maybe it was the impossible war. To look back on the Prime Ministers I have known, if a man is allowed to love another man, the Prime Minister I loved most of all was John Gorton. I noted that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) in referring to Prime Ministers mentioned John Gorton in a very special wayby exclusion. Billy MCMahon was a great Treasurer and had the sad lot of becoming the first Liberal Prime Minister to lose an election. Of all the Prime Ministers I have been privileged to serve, from either side of the House, the most impressive of all would be Gough Whitlam. He was probably the most naturally gifted of all. My early impressions of him are of him coming straight through the door, when Harold Holt was Prime Minister, sitting in the Leader of the Opposition's position at the table and looking at Harold Holt as if to say, 'Right, let's go'. When Harold Holt was unfortunately drowned and John Gorton replaced him, Edward Gough Whitlam lost much of that confidence. It, is often said that many people had difficulty in quite understanding the Prime Minister for whom I personally had the highest regard. I have one confession to make, and I will happily hand over the relevant document to this place when a proper museum is established here. I refer to the events of 1975. The notices that were posted on the doors of the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1975 which gave notification that the then Governor General, Sir John Kerr, had sent the Parliament and the nation to an election I still have in my possession and I will happily hand them oyer at the appropriate time. Prime Minister Fraser was Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister. I have been here a long time-not as long as Tom Uren-and I would like to say that Prime Minister Fraser, Prime Minister Hawke and the other five Prime Ministers that I have been privileged to serve with have all had one thing in common with every member of this chamber: every man and woman who has worked here has done so to the best of his or her ability. The motivation of honourable members, despite the questioning which sometimes takes place, is generally the highest. We have all been privileged to experience the service that has been given to us by the long list of people mentioned by the Prime Minister during his speech-whether they be the Clerks of the House, the transport officers or the people in the printing room. In this closing of a chapter of Australia's history might I say that I hope that the nation continues in the new Parliament House as strongly as it has in the last 61 years.",65
192,Mrs KELLY,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak briefly about the contribution that women have made to this House. I can remember as if it were yesterday my first time in this chamber. I can remember feeling nervous and proud. We came into the chamber to the Opposition benches. I sat alongside you, Madam Speaker. You were then just the honourable member for Henty. I can remember Charlie Jones, that longlived elder statesman from Newcastle, saying to you, 'Gees, it's bad enough having you sheilas here, but I've got to sit next to one of youse'. I thought, 'Welcome to the Parliament'. What it was like for Enid Lyons when she arrived here at the end of World War II we can only guess. She was the first woman to sit in this chamber. Since then there have not been very many more. Most of the women who have served in the Parliament are presently here, and I pay tribute to them. I pay particular tribute to Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker was a woman who showed she was made of very stern stuff. She ran for office in 1972, was undaunted by her defeat in 1975, stood again in 1977 but broke back in 1980. It is that kind of fighting spirit that has made Joan the role model for the rest of the women in this House. Nearly all of the women who have been members of the House have been under Joan's assistance. We do not admire her just because she is here. In 1985 Joan was asked when Australia would have its first woman Prime Minister. She answered, 'We will have our first woman Prime Minister when people no longer ask that question. Until then the consciousness is not there. We do not need a Thatcher but I am sure we need someone with strength, understanding and compassion'. The person she described turned out to be our first woman Speaker. Madam Speaker, we thank you very much for that contribution and also for the great example that you have set for all of us. I have talked only about women, and particularly one woman, in this House. But the battle to get here has not been fought in isolation; it has been fought through party organisations, in local government, State legislatures and the Senate. To the women who have fought those battles, our thanks, and to the men in this place, such as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and elsewhere who have supported us and fought for us, our thanks. To those who have resisted and begrudged us this long journey out of the kitchen and the other room, a warning: we are here, we are staying and there are reinforcements on the way. On behalf of all the women who have sat and who are sitting in this chamber, I thank the House.",65
193,Mr KATTER,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"We are about to disband. One or two little thoughts occur to me. The first is that when the locks on these doors are turned there will permeate this House a very rare commodity-silence; although I am led to believe that eventually there could be the rattle of roulette Wheels. I am not quite sure about that. Another thought that occurred to me during the day-and I am sure that it has struck quite a number of my colleagues on both sides of the House-is what will happen when we move up the hill. I refer to the togetherness that we have shared. Perhaps we should contemplate for a moment that the very disadvantages and congestion that we have had here for so many years may have produced that closeness on all sides of the House that we so cherish. We are moving into a grand new Parliament House. Another quality we have enjoyed is a sort of family environment with our staff at all levels. I refer to John May and Paul Felsman. Of course, I do not forget Brian and, in earlier days, Gordon Pike. I wonder whether the intimacy, understanding and family environment will dissipate. I join Ros Kelly in congratulating the achievers among the women in this place. I refer to Lyn, with whom I had the great advantage of working when she served as secretary to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. And, Madam Speaker, there is your own very wonderful and courageous record, quite apart from anything else that has happened in this place. I conclude by talking about people-that is, the people who had the rare talent of expressing to us, particularly when we first came to this place, an understanding of the pressures felt away from the building. I think immediately of people such as Arthur Calwell, Jim Cope, Charlie Adermann and Kim Beazley senior. Any of us could go to those people for guidance, understanding and an appreciation of some of the difficulties which we may have had away from this House. One of the most cherished things that we will remember with regard to this place is the people. I, like everyone else, have rather a scary anticipation of what will happen in the new Parliament House. Firstly, are we to be provided with a compass and a guide to get around the place? Secondly-and it is up to us, I guess-will that togetherness which we have so cherished continue?",66
194,Madam SPEAKER,FORMER AND PRESENT MEMBERS AND,"As we prepare to leave the provisional Parliament House I think it would be proper for me to make reference to some of those people, still living, who have played a major role in the preservation of the institution of Parliament and have served the House of Representatives well over the last 50 or 60 years. I refer, of course, to those who have served the House in the past as Speaker, Chairman of Committees, Clerk of the House or as an officer of the House. First, I mention four previous Speakers- Sir William Aston, who served the House in that position from 1967 to 1972; Jim Cope from 1973 to 1975; Gordon Scholes in 1975; and Harry Jenkins from 1983 to 1985. Former Chairmen of Committees are Joe Clark, who held that position from 1946 to 1949; Phil Lucock from 1961 to 1972 and again-a second bite of the cherryduring 1976 and 1977; Gordon Scholes from 1973 to 1975; Joe Berinson and Harry Jenkins, both during 1975; our good friend Clarrie Millar from 1978 to 1983; Les Johnson during 1983; and myself from 1984 to 1986. Norman Parkes, who served the Parliament for 42 years from 1934 to 1976, was Clerk of the House from 1971 to 1976; Jack PeUifer, who served us for 43 years from 1939 to 1982, was Clerk of the House from 1976 to 1982; and Doug Blake, who was Clerk of the House from 1982 to 1985, gave 35 years service to the House, commencing in 1950. They all displayed enormous stamina. As the honourable member for Kennedy pointed out, those are the people to whom one went when looking for advice. Each of these Clerks will be remembered for the part he played in making this House what it is today and for the work he performed in planning for the new building. While I am mentioning names there is a danger of overlooking someone, I feel I should mention several other officers who will be remembered in the history of this place: for example, Professor Gordon Reid, now Governor of Western Australia, who joined the staff in 1946 and resigned in 1958 when he was Serjeantat-Arms; Gordon Pike, who was a friend of so many of us as Transport Officer from 1951 to 1982; and Fred Johnson, who was Senior Chamber Attendant from the 1940s through to the late 1960s. Fred had an amazing ability to meet a request for a particular piece of furnitureeven if it had to be borrowed from the Senate during the middle of the night. And finally, Sid Riddle, badly wounded during World War II, who served successive Speakers as a personal attendant and who retired from the position of Principal Attendant in 1976 after 20 years service to the House. There are others who have been a part of the history of this building over a significant period. For instance, Alan Browning, Clerk of the House at the moment, and Lyn Barlin, Deputy Clerk, will both have served this chamber for 34 years by the time we first meet in the new Parliament House. It is a remarkable history of loyalty and service. As I said earlier, these are some of the people who are still living who have played a significant institutional role over the last 50 years of our parliamentary history. We owe them a considerable debt, and as we leave this building I extend to them on behalf of all members our grateful thanks for their contribution. In conclusion, I would like to mention three officers who will be retiring before we next meet: Marion Lambert, who has been secretary to Alan Browning and more recently to Lyn Barlin and has been an officer since 1969; John Rowan, mentioned by the Prime Minister, who has served as a chamber attendant over many years and has been with the House since 1965; and John Crisp, who has also been a chamber attendant and has served the House since 1970. I extend my thanks for their service to the House and wish them well in their retirement. I also give my good wishes to Pat Norris and his staff in the Printing Office, and I give the House's best wishes for Pat's health. I thank present officers and personal staff. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Hawke) agreed to: That the next sitting of the House of Representatives take place in the new Parliament House.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Mr Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 8 October 1987: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the publication of Dr D. J. Byrne, Regional Director of Veterinary Services in Gunnedah for the NSW Department of Agriculture entitled Pesticide residues in milk: Region 2 investigation and advisory guidelines, dated 24 December 1986. (2) Has his attention been drawn in particular to section 14 of the publication which states that land treated with organochlorines (a) between August 1982 and November 1985 cannot be used for the production of food for livestock for all time and (b) after November 1985 cannot be used for the production of food for livestock or humans for all time. (3) Is he able to say whether the prohibition applies to all agricultural regions in NSW and to agricultural regions in other States. (4) If the restriction only applies to a limited number of agricultural regions, will he approach the Australian Agricultural Council with a proposal to have the prohibition made uniform throughout Australia; if not, why not. (5) Why can food for human consumption, including turnips or potatoes, be grown on land that was treated with organochlorines between August 1982 and November 1985, but the same crops cannot be used for food for livestock. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) I have been advised that the particular Section, Section 14, referred to has been amended by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture as the interpretation of the meaning of the Pesticide Orders referred to was incorrect. Restrictions imposed under New South Wales Pesticide Orders are in force only in the area(s) covered by the Orders and for the duration of the Orders. Pesticide Orders cease to be operative either by removal of authorised use or by expiry of the order. They do not apply to other States or Territories. (4) This could only be done if the proposal is appropriate and relevant to other agricultural regions. (5) As I have indicated this statement was incorrect and has since been amended by the NSW Department of Agriculture. However, uptake of organochlorine residues in turnips and potatoes may be small and below acceptable levels if the chemicals had been applied at the recommeded rates and timing. Stock grazing on such crops, simultaneously ingest treated soil and can accumulate residues in meat and milk to the point where they may exceed maximum residue limits. NA Organochlorine Explosives: Storage (Question No. 235) (QuestioD No. 350) Dr Woods asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 October 1987: (1) Is he aware of a Defence Department decision upheld by Mr Justice Wilcox in the Federal Court on 26 October 1987, to evict sea cadets from Snapper Island in Sydney Harbour. (2) Is the eviction based on the Navy's acceptance of new NATO and UN safety standards and the application of those standards to explosives stored on nearby Spectacle Island. (3) Did Mr Justice Wilcox express the view, when deciding this matter, that although the risk of the munitions exploding was small, the consequences of such an explosion to persons on Snapper Island would be grave. (4) Would similar application of the new standards discourage occupation of the densely populated foreshore of Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point. (5) Does he agree no citizens should have their lives or property endangered no matter how small the risk; if so, will he have all munitions removed from the vicinity. (6) If he will not have all munitions removed from the vicinity in the interests of public safety (a) what steps does he propose to take to protect the residents of Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point and (b) will he recommend to the relevant NSW authorities that all ferries and commercial and pleasure craft be refused access to the waterways in the danger zone.",66
195,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The eviction was the result of Defence adopting revised Explosive Ordnance Storage Principles based on those used by NATO. These principles govern the determination of safety distances required between explosive facilities and developments such as occupied buildings, houses and shopping centres. They therefore limit the continuation of activities which have occurred at Snapper Island. Although ammunition is not stored on Spectacle Island, it is staged temporarily in barges moored in the Naval Waters surrounding the Island. The safety distances associated with the barges traverse Snapper Island and have led to the requirement that it be vacated. (3) Yes. However Mr Justice Wilcox in his summary went on to say ""Whilst the current activities continue, a large proportion of the people on Snapper Island at any particular time will be likely to be children and young people who cannot be expected to make an informed decision as to the risk which they run. I think that it is no answer to say that other risks will remain. The respondents concede that the whole situation is unsatisfactory and that it is important that alternative arrangements be put into effect at the earliest possible moment. But, in the meantime, I think that this separate and identifiable risk ought to be eliminated"". (4) The Navy has taken action to reduce the number of moorings around Spectacle Island and also to reduce the quantity of the ammunition stored in individual barges. These actions have the result that the safety areas which previously encroached onto the adjacent Harbour foreshores at Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point no longer do so. Thus, there is no reason why the application of the storage principles should discourage occupation of the foreshores around Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point. (5) A prime consideration in the development and application of the revised Explosive Ordnance Storage principles, has been the requirement that citizens should not be needlessly put at risk. The implementation of the principles has required substantial modification to Navy ammunitioning procedures in Sydney Harbour which have the effect of removing 'hazard zones' from all inhabited areas of the Harbour foreshore, including of course, Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point. Under the existing arrangements the moorings at Spectacle Island are an integral aspect in the ammunitioning of Navy ships in Sydney Harbour and there are no suitable alternative moorings. Nevertheless, an urgent, critical and thorough assessment is being undertaken to explore additional options for improvement and change. (6) (a) The following modifications have been made to the staging arrangements at Spectacle Island: a restriction on the amount of ammunition staged in individual barges and the removal of five barge moorings from the Naval Waters at Spectacle Island; a restriction on the time that loaded barges are staged at the Spectacle Island moorings; the introduction of a system of priority use of the moorings; and the installation of warning lights on all barges stored at the Spectacle Island moorings. Previously, only those barges containing ammunition carried lights. The following initiatives are in train: the installation of eight bow and stern piles for those barges used to stage the highest classifications of explosive. This will prevent these barges from swinging, facilitating a safer transit of private vessels around them; and the review mentioned at (5) above. (b) Although certain of the waterways fall within the specified safety distances, there is no requirement to refuse access to the affected waterways as the associated risk is of a transitory nature and is allowable under the NATO principles. In addition, the authorised navigation charts for this area carry a warning about the existence of Navy's arnmunitioning activities in the Naval Waters around Spectacle Island. Director of Public Prosecutions Mr Reith asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 February 1988: (1) Do the appropriations approved for his portfolio for 1987-88 include funds to establish an office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in Adelaide; if so, (a) when will the office be opened, (b) where will the office be situated and (c) what is the proposed staffing establishment. (2) If funds have not been appropriated to establish the office, (a) at what stage of the budgetary process was the bid for resources referred to on page 9 of the DPP's annual report for 1986-87 rejected, (b) who made the decision to reject that bid and (c) why has the Government failed to establish a DPP office in Adelaide since the Director of Public Prosecutions Act came into operation in 1984.",69
196,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) As prosecution work has been performed, and performed well, by the existing South Australian Office of the Australian Government Solicitor the Government did not allocate additional resources in the 1987-88 Budget to establish a separate office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia. Electoral Rolls (Question No. 746) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (1) When did the rolls close for the 1987 general election. (2) Was a printed roll for each electoral division prepared. (3) When did enrolments for the printed roll close. (4) Was a supplementary roll prepared. (5) Were copies of both the main roll and the supplementary roll printed and available to the public; if so, (a) at what cost was it available and (b) how many copies of each roll were available. (6) Are copies of these rolls still available; if so, to whom and at what cost are they available. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (6) The close of rolls was on 12 June 1987. A printed roll was not prepared at the time of the 1987 election. However, a reference copy of the certified list of voters used for the Division at the 1987 election is available for viewing at the relevant Divisional office and copies of all divisional lists for a State are available for viewing at State Head Offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. Under the Freedom of Information Act members of the public are able to obtain copies of the reference certified lists of voters. The FOI application fee is $30 and each divisional list is copied at an approximate charge of $30 (lOc per page). (Question No. 598) Divisional Returning Officers (Question No. 768) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (1) Are original copies of the electoral roll, against which claims for a vote are recorded on polling day, available to Divisional Returning Officers once the count has been completed. (2) Are Divisional Returning Officers required to prepare a consolidated master copy of the electoral roll using individual rolls from all polling places within the Division to determine if any multiple voting has occurred; if so, is there a check or audit of its accuracy. (3) If there is no consolidation undertaken by the Divisional Returning Officer, what arrangements are made to check for multiple voting. (4) Does the Divisional Returning Officer send the rolls, marked to indicate a claim for a vote having been made, to another office; if so (a) to which office and for what purpose are they sent and (b) is a check made beforehand to determine multiple voting or the number of names for which no vote has been made. (5) Is any check made to see if votes have been made in the names of those provisionally enrolled. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (4) The original certified lists of voters used at polling places are returned to the Divisional Returning Officers after polling. In 1987 the Divisional Returning Officers forwarded the lists to the Australian Electoral Commission's Electronic Scanning Centres in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The lists were electronically scanned and apparent nonvoter and apparent multiple voter reports were produced for each Division. Following processing the lists were returned to the Divisional Returning Officers who checked the apparent mUltiple voter reports against the specific lists upon which electors were indicated to have been marked. The actual number of non-voters identified by the scanning reports was reconciled with the number of non-voters independently calculated by subtracting the number of ballot papers issued to electors from the number of electors enrolled for the respective Divisions. (5) See the answer to House of Representatives Question on Notice No. 740. Electoral Review (Question No. 769) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (1) What data is maintained on computer when enrolment details are altered on the electoral roll. (2) Is an audit trail maintained that identifies who initiated the change, what the previous enrolment details were and the date of the change. (3) What arrangements are made to spot-check the accuracy and the validity of these changes. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Under the COM II system used for roll maintenance for all Divisions except those in South Australia, enrolment details can be varied individually or in bulk. An amendment to an individual enrolment is applied by deleting the previous record, and substituting a new record with altered particulars. All the particulars of the previous record are stored in a deletions history file, which is output on microfiche at election time for use by Divisional Returning Officers, specifically in the admission or rejection of declaration votes at the preliminary scrutiny. Particulars of the new record are stored on the current elector file, and are output on the monthly State consolidated microfiche supplied to Divisions in the relevant State. Bulk changes are made under COM II only when the name of a street or locality is changed. In such cases, a record of the changes made is not retained on the computer, but a printout is produced which identifies all records which have been altered. The South Australian rolls are maintained on an online system which runs on the South Australian Government Computing Centre's mainframe. Where an elector's particulars are changed only the new data and the date of change are stored electronically. Daily printouts provide a perpetual record indicating: to which new subdivision (by code number) each named elector has moved; the old and new details relating to an elector who has moved within a subdivision; the name, address, and former address of incoming transferees; the name and former address of electors transferred interstate; the name and last address of deceased electors; all old and new particulars, including address, for changes to or corrections of names; the last enrolment details of those electors removed by objection; and the details deleted from the data base of an entry deemed to be a perfect duplicate of another. Hard copy histories are stored in divisional offices and go to archives periodically. (2) Under COM II, the coding card which gives rise to an amendment to an individual elector's enrolment is microfilmed, and the microfilm record is retained permanently. The card is dated, indicates who generated it, and carries an identifier number which enables the previous enrolment details of the elector in question to be ascertained. Under the South Australian on-line system, changes to the data base are made under the authority of: electoral enrolment forms; letters from electors who have changed address within a subdivision; notifications of interstate transfers; form 10, used for the correction of enrolments in the case of electors enrolled for the wrong Division; death notices; objection notices; and the provisions of section 105 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 relating to certain corrections to the rolls. The initiating officer/person can be identified from the source documents and to a degree from the user ID code printed following each transaction on the printout. This identifies whether the change was made by the DRO or a key punch operator. The date of change is kept electronically; an on-line enquiry on the VDU will show the elector details sought plus the date of the last transaction. (3) Under COM II, all amendments to individual enrolments give rise to entries on additions lists, and every one of those entries is checked for validity against the source document which generated it, a copy of that document, or a consolidated list of transactions submitted for processing. The South Australian on-line system has built-in safeguards against many keying errors. Documents from which transactions are keyed are called back to the daily printout as a means of checking interpretation and keying accuracy. The issue of an acknowledgment card for addition transactions provides a further means for any incorrectly recorded details to be identified. Electoral Enrolments (Question No. 770) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (I) Did the rolls used in polling booths during the 1987 general election contain the names and addresses of 17 year olds who had provisional enrolment; if so, how were these enrolments identified. (2) If the rolls did not contain details relating to provisional enrolments, how did the Polling Clerks prevent a person who was not the enrollee and not 17 years of age from actually casting a vote in that name. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) See the answer to House of Representatives Question No. 740. Dung Beetle Program (Question No. 794) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 16 March 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the National Farmer of 12 February 1988 entitled ""Kill-all Parasiticals Could Also Kill off Bio-Control Scheme""? (2) Does this report state that A vomec, the revolutionary internal and external cattle parasite treatment, is threatening Australia's famous dung beetle program? (3) Has the dung beetle program been hailed as one of the world's most successful experiments in biological control? (4) Does the dung beetle program involve beetles rapidly breaking down cow pats to boost pasture productivity and remove the breeding ground for flies? (5) Is he able to give a figure as to the cost of the dung beetle program, including the development program? (6) Were the possible consequences of the use of these new parasite treatment chemicals fully assessed by the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs before registration was permitted? (7) Will he make available all information and documentation considered by the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs in their assessment for registration? (8) Is he aware of the reported public concern of CSIRO scientists; if so, what steps, if any, has he taken to assure himself on these concerns? (9) Will he consider a review or reappraisal of the chemicals in the light of CSIRO concerns; if not, why not? (10) Will he accept the potential for this new parasite chemical treatment to be equated to another ecological time bomb, Dieldrin; if not, why not? Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have seen the report in the National Farmer of 12 February 1988 to which Mr Scott referred. (2) The report does indeed make the statement that Avomec, the revolutionary internal and external cattle parasite treatment, is threatening Australia's famous dung beetle program. (3) In the popular sense, Australia's dung beetle program may be regarded as one of the world's most successful experiments in biological control, although the scientific data to substantiate such a claim are not available. In the opinion of CSIRO workers it has not achieved the total success of other biological control programs such as bio-control of weeds (salvinia, skeleton weed, prickly pear), sirex wasp, lucerne aphid, diamond back moth, green vegetable bug, spider mites or rabbits. In terms of dung burial, the program is perceived as having been highly successful and the extent of burial is expected to increase each year as the beetles become better established and more widely distributed. (4) The breakdown of cow pats by the beetles is believed to increase pasture productivity althol,lgh this has not been quantified. There is evidence from Western Australia and Queensland however, to show that dung burial can cause reductions in fly populations. (5) Expenditure on the dung beetle program to 1986 has been estimated at $12.9 million. Apart from planned work on the cropping and redistribution of dung beetles, for which funds have been requested from Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation and the Dairy Research Council, all dung beetle research in the CSIRO Division of Entomology has now ceased. (6) The Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs was aware of CSIRO concern over the possible effects of that ivermectin usage on the fauna of cattle dung pads before evaluation began on this family of drugs. The potential consequences were regarded seriously and the manufacturer was required to produce scientific data to demonstrate that use of the product would not cause significant reductions in dung beetle populations. (7) and (8) The information submitted to the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs by applicants for clearance is classified ""commercial-in-confidence"" and is not available for release into the public domain. I am advised that adult survival of most species of dung beetles is not affected by the dung of cattle treated with Avomec. Egg laying is reduced however, and the survival of immature beetles is zero in dung produced for about one week after treatment of the animal. 'From that point onwards, beetle breeding improves and has returned to normal in dung passed by animals eight weeks after treatment. Dung from cattle treated with Avomec in summer and autumn would have little impact on dung beetles because most beetles are not breeding at that time. The Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs was satisfied that the conditions governing the use of Avomec in Australia ensure that sufficient faeces from untreated cattle would be available to sustain dung beetle populations. (9) Parasitologists concur that Avomec has already made a valuable contribution to the control of cattle parasites in Australia and Ivomec promises to do likewise for the sheep industry. The continued availability of these products is of considerable importance. I agree however, that there is a need for additional research to devise use patterns which will minimise the effects on dung beetles and other valuable components of the environment. (10) I cannot agree that there is any great similarity between the avermectins and dieldrin. Fijian Women Working in Australia (Question No. 839) Mr Milton asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1988: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article which appeared in the February 1988 edition of Fiji Voice and in the Australian on 20 February 1988 alleging that up to 300 wives of Fijian army and government employed personnel are in Australia working to supplement their husbands' wages. (2) Is he able to say whether there is any substance to these allegations; if so, what are the details. (3) Were the wives of army personnel and police officers initially refused visas and was that decision reversed after a personal submission from Brigadier Rabuka to the Australian High Commission in Suva.",70
197,Mr HOLDING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes (2) On the basis of its enquiries my Department believes there is no substance in the allegation. (3) All visa applicants are screened through normal procedures. There have been no known visa applications from groups of wives of Fijian army or police personnel. Cbristmas Island: Rainfall (Question No. 840) Mr Braitbwaite asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 23 March 1988: (I) What are the daily rainfall figures for Christmas Island for March 1988?  member's question is as follows: (1) Christmas Island Daily Rainfall Figures (in millimetres) March 1988 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1.4 7. 49.0 8. 39.2 9. 0.6 10. 0.6 II. 0.4 12. 13. 14. IS. 14.6 16. 0.2 17. 15.6 18. 2.2 19. 20. 1.2 21. 3.6 22. 158.8 23. 21.6 24. 102.4 25. 63.2 26. 33.8 27. 25.6 28. 1.2 29. 30. 31. Total 535.2 Navy Helicopters (Question No. 856) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 April 1988: (1) What are the roles to be performed by the Role Adaptive Weapons System (RAWS) to be mounted on the Sikorsky S-708-2 helicopters currently being procured for the RAN. (2) Is the RAWS being developed specifically for the requirements of the RAN and is it a unique system, differing from the LAMPS III of UN Seahawk helicopters. (3) In what (a) roles and (b) operational procedures does RAWS differ from LAMPS III, and in particular, to what extent does the latter rely on processing of data passed via datalink (LINK II) on board the parent vessel. (4) Is Anti-Surface Ship Targeting (ASST) amongst the roles to be performed by the RAWS and does this role require the transmission of data from the vessel's helicopter to its Harpoon fire control systems; if so, what is the difference in (a) reaction time, and (b) overall operational effectiveness, in having ASST data transmitted by (i) helicopter crew to ship's crew via radio and (ii) LINK II. (5) Was the estimated cost of the (a) first 8 RAN Seahawks given on 9 October 1984 as $317m in April prices and (b) subsequent order for an additional 8 given on 1 May 1986 as $187.51m in December 1985 prices. (6) Was the then current project approved cost at the time of the presentation of the 1987-88 Budget, $601.5m. (7) On a comparable price base, what degree of cost inflation occurred in the RAN helicopter tween May 1986 and May 1987. (8) What was the estimated cost of (a) the helicopsought ter platforms, (b) surface surveillance radar, (c) ASW systems, (d) electronic warfare systems, (e) systems integration, (f) software development, (g) buildings works and (h) other programs support at (a) 9 October 1984, (b) 1 May 1986 and (c) the time of presentation of the 1987-88 Budget. (9) - What is the current estimated cost of the total RAN Seahawk program and of each of the elements listed in part (8). (10) What is the current estimated cost of the II datalink system and what is the estimated cost of fitting it to the RAN's eventual fleet of 6 FFG frigates.",73
198,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The role of the Role Adaptable Weapons System (RAWS) is to process sensor of Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti Surface Surveillance and Targeting (ASST). The RAWS is also removable to allow utility and trooplift missions to be accommodated. (2) Yes to both questions (3) The roles of RAWS and similar however operational procedures differ. The RAWS has an autonomous capability enabling the Sinformation 708-2 to operate without assistance whereas the LAMPS MK III weapons system requires that the aircraft system is constantly in radio contact, via a datalink, with the parent ship if the full capability of the system is to be utilised. The LAMPS MK III does not have a LINK II data link but - is fitted with a unique data link relays unprocessed sensor data to the parent ship for processing. This link is not compatible with LINK II. (4) ASST is a role of the S-70B-2. The Harpoon fire control system is not integrated into the Tactical Data System. The helicopter will relay target position to parent, or other vessel, using normal munications or the RAWS data link and related shipboard terminal. In regard to reaction time and operational effectiveness, the data link method is superior to voice communication as it allows information to be passed from a comprehensive, updated dual redundant tactical data base. LINK II is not fitted MK III or the S-70B-2 due to size, weight and power considerations. (5) (a) Yes (b) The order for the second 8 Seahawks was valued at $185.79m in May 1986 after Commonwealth accepted a price discount in exchange for a down payment on order. (6) At the time the presentation of the 1987-88 Budget two separate project approvals existed: (a) the first 8 aircraft: $424.43m at April 1985 prices and exchange rate. (b) the second 8 aircraft: SI85.79m at December 1985 prices and exchange rates. (7) On a comparable price basis, between May 1986 and May 1987 cost inflation on the contract amounted to 0.52%. Changes to the SA/SUS exchange rate caused a further 0.25% increase. These increases were absorbed project bewithin the project approval limits. (8) Tenders for the RAN helicopter project were and received on a ""flyaway cost"" basis and, as such, the level of detail requested was not sought. Further, the contract for supply of helicopters and associand ated equipment was negotiated on a total price basis. Information on the costs of the individual subsystems referred to in the question is therefore not available, except for the cost of buildings and works which was initially estimated at S4.Om (April 1984 prices), was - increased in May 1986 to $4.lm (December 1985 prices) program and remains the current estimate. (9) The current estimated cost of the total RAN LINK Seahawk Program is as shown in (6). A separate but concurrent project for provision of a Seahawk simulator facility is estimated to cost S47.89m. (10) The current estimated cost of fitting the LINK II datalink system is approximately SO. 350m per ship. Four RAN FFGs have already been fitted with LINK data for the prime missions II. Progress of Count-House of Representatives (Question No. 900) Mr Hawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on LAMPS MK III are 20 April 1988: What was the full cost of compiling and printing the used in the publication by the Australian Electoral Commission Research Report Number 1 entitled ""Progress of Count-House of Representatives 1987"". Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has which provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The cost of printing 550 copies of the report, which was distributed to Members and Senators, Australian Electoral Commission Head Offices and Divisional Ofthe fices, academics as well as members of the public upon tactical radio comrequest was S4,001.17. The information set out in the report was compiled from the Commission's election night computer system off by two officers of the Commission as part of their normal duties. Therefore, cost of compiling the figures to either the LAMPS' cannot be given. Home and Community Care Program (Question No. 902) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Housing and the Aged Care, upon notice, on 20 April 1988: (I) Have national guidelines for the Home and Community Care (HACC) program been developed; if so, how and by whom were these guidelines developed. (2) Have these guidelines been published. (3) Will he provide a copy of the guidelines. (4) Are there specific guidelines for sub-programs of HACC. (5) Is there a current review of the operations of the HACC program; if so, (a) when and why was this review established; (b) who is conducting it; and (c) what progress has been made. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The guidelines were developed by the Commonwealth in consultation with State and Territory Governments and community groups. (2) Not yet. Publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and for general distribution is in process. (3) Yes. (4) No. (5) Yes. (a) Under the terms of the Home and Community Care (HACC) Agreements, there is provision for review of the program during at least every third grant year (Clause 31)-1987-88 is the third year of the triennium. (b) Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers agreed on 14 November 1987 to establish a senior group of Commonwealth/State/Territory officials with an independent Chairman. The Chairman of the Review is Dr Peter Saunders, Director of the Social Welfare Research Centre of the University of New South Wales. The HACC Review Working Group convened for the first time on 14 January 1988, and has met regularly since. (c) The HACC review is being undertaken in two stages, the first focusing on the administration of the HACC program and the second on services not permitted to grow under the program or services excluded from it; linkages with residential care and disability programs; the impact of changes in other programs upon HACC and the basis for future review. The first stage is largely complete. Ministers have approved a streamlined project approval process. Commonwealth/State responsibilities in the program have been more clearly defined. States/ Territories have agreed to producing annual strategic plans and are co-operating on the collection of data for the program. Department of Social Security Senior Officers (Question No. 963) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 10 May 1988: (1) Did senior officers of his Department attend a seminar, conference or other meeting in Sydney on or about 7-11 March 1988; if so, (a) how many officers attended, (b) from where did they come, (c) what was the purpose of the meeting and (d) what was the total (i) travel and (ii) accommodation cost to his Department. (2) Did he encounter any difficulty in communicating with officers of his Department and in undertaking his responsibilities as Minister during this period as a result of this meeting. (3) Was it necessary to have junior officers acting in more senior positions as a result of the absence of officers at this meeting; if so, what was the cost of the higher duties allowances paid.",74
199,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Several meetings were held in Sydney during the period 7-11 March. (i) Management Workshop on Restructuring and Job Design. (ii) Stratplan Release of Unemployment and Sickness Benefits. (iii) Regional and Area Management (Hunter Area North) New South Wales. (a) (i) 23 travelled (ii) 6 travelled (iii) 26 travelled. These figures cover all those who travelled to the meetings from outside Sydney regardless of their seniority. (b) (i) New South Wales, Canberra, South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria. (ii) Canberra (iii) New South Wales (c) (i) Discussion of proposed changes from 2nd Tier Wage Agreement and Departmental Restructuring. (ii) System issues on Unemployment Benefits Program. (iii) Management issues particularly relating to Family Allowance Supplement. (d) (i) $14,878.00 (ii) Officers travelling are entitled to Travelling Allowance depending on the duration of the travel. (2) No. (3) No. Poverty Line (Question No. 967) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 May 1988: (1) What is the definition of the term ""poverty line"" when applied to various groups in Australia. (2) Is he to say whether other countries define the term in absolute or relative terms. (3) Has the Government found the definition to be the most appropriate definition to use.",75
200,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ""poverty line"" most commonly referred to in Australia originates from a concept adopted by Professor Ronald Henderson in 1966. A poverty line for a ""standard family"" of a married couple and two children was derived from the sum of the basic wage in Melbourne plus the value of child endowment for two children. Professor Henderson then used a set of equivalence scales based on a 1954 New York study to derive poverty lines for different family types. The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne uses a set of simplified Henderson equivalence scales to produce poverty lines for a range of family compositions updated quarterly on the basis of seasonally adjusted household disposable income per head. (2) Various measures of poverty are used in overseas countries for a number of purposes. The available information indicates that, except for the Orshansky poverty line in the United States, poverty lines are not officially endorsed. The ""absolute"" Orshansky approach broadly defines any family which has an income of less than three times the cost of a subsistence food plan as poor. (3) The Henderson poverty line has never been officially endorsed by any Australian Government although it has gained some acceptance in the community as a measure of poverty. Pension Indexation Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 May 1988: (I) Is he able to say whether the British Government (a) refuses to index pensions paid to its former residents living in Australia and (b) indexes its pensions to its former residents throughout the world except for Australia. (2) Does Australia index pensions to its former citizens now living in Britain. (3) Is he able to say how many other countries do not index pensions to former residents of Australia who now reside within their boundaries. (4) Did the Prime Minister write to the British Prime Minister in September 1986 expressing Australia's concern at the continuing imbalance in the present social security agreement. (5) Did he recommend in May 1987 that the Attorney-General provide legal aid to a British pensioner so that an opinion could be obtained on the legality of the British position. (6) Has the Attorney-General refused to grant legal aid; if so, what reasons have been given for this decision. (7) How many meetings have taken place between the British and Australian Governments on the issue of non-indexation of pensions for former residents (a) before and (b) since 1983 and what were the outcomes of each of those meetings. (8) Do the outcomes of those meetings give any indication of the possible resolution of this issue or any time scale in regard to when the matter can be resolved. (9) Did he say that the British treatment of nonindexation of pensions for its former residents now living in Australia is very discriminatory and unfair? (10) What further action will he take in regard to the British Government's non-indexation of pensions to its former residents now living in Australia.",75
201,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Despite numerous approaches from successive Australian Governments, the United Kingdom Government still refuses to index its pensions paid into Australia. (b) British pensions are indexed in 27 other countries under the provisions of reciprocal agreements. The most notable exceptions are Australia, Canada and New Zealand. (2) Australia pays full cost of living increases to its pensioners in all countries including Britain. (3) Most countries including Britain, pay cost of living increases to their pensioners residing within their borders. Apart from Britain, I am not aware of any major country which withholds these increases from pensioners residing abroad. (4) Yes. (5) I supported that application. (6) In answer to a question in the House of Representatives on 25 May 1988, the Attorney-General said that his department would arrange for Australia's agents (Question No. 1004) in Britain to obtain counsel's advice as to whether any legal action can be taken in that country to guarantee justice for its pensioners in Australia. (7) (a) At the four meetings of officials held between 1980 and 1982, the British authorities advised that they could not consider amendments to the Agreement which involved further expenditure for the United Kingdom. (b) At the three meeting of officials held since 1983 the advice has been that indexation was not possible on the ground of cost. Earlier this year I raised the matter with Mr Nicholas Scott, British Minister for Social Security and the Disabled. As a result the British have agreed to give further thought to specific proposals. (8) Given the United Kingdom's reluctance to discuss in detail ways of resolving this problem, it is difficult to predict the outcomes or time-frames with any certainty. (9) Yes, in my statement to the House of Representatives on 14 February 1986 and in my reply to a Question without Notice on 17 October 1986. (10) See answer to (6). In addition, I intend to make further representations and to pursue the approach in 7(b) above, pointing out the strong view of members of the Parliament and of the Australian Government that the unfair treatment of British pensioners in Australia by the British Government should be remedied without delay. Social, Welfare and Community Workers (Question No. 255) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 20 October 1987: How many (a) qualified social workers, and (b) welfare or community workers (i) had positions funded by the Commonwealth in (A) 1980-81 and (B) 1986-87 and (ii) were employed in those years by the Minister's portfolio or its appropriate predecessor. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (i) Community Programs-Qualified social welfare or community workers may have been employed on projects funded through the following programs: Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) Community Volunteer Program (CVP) Community Training Program (CTP) Community Employment Program (CEP). No records are kept of qualifications of persons employed on such projects and the responsibility for recruitment of staff rests solely with the respective project managements. In the case of CYSS and CVP, program funding is made available for the employment of project officers. There are no pre-requisites for formal qualifications for these positions. CTP project staff are employed to deliver appropriate combinations of structured labour market oriented training and personal support services. Training skills for project staff are paramount and, while some CTP staff possess qualifications in social welfare, less than ten are Parole Officer . employed as social workers against an estimated 240 full-time, 120 part-time and ISO sessional staff employed on CTP projects in 1986/87. CEP was introduced in August 1983. Data from the CEP Management Information System shows that 444 persons were employed in social, welfare and community work positions on CEP projects in 1986/87 as per the attached list. It should be noted, however, that no information is available on the formal qualifications of the persons placed in these positions. No such information is available for 1980/81. Disadvantaged Schools Program Funds are made available to the States and Catholic school systems for expenditure in relation to declared disadvantaged schools and within Commonwealth policy guidelines for the Program. There is no requirement on these States and systems to report the occupational classifications of staff they engage with Program funds. Information available to the Department suggests that: at least four qualified social workers and one welfare/ community worker were funded under the Program in 1987 (no information was provided by Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory Government sector for 1987). Information in relation to the Program is not readily available for 1980/81 and 1986. Young Homeless Allowance With the introduction of the Young Homeless Allowance for students, on 1 July 1986, the student assistance area of the former Department of Education began to be involved in the use of social workers. Qualified social workers were engaged on several occasions during 1986-87 to examine the circumstances of some applicants for homeless status. These social workers were engaged as consultants on a sessional basis. Detailed records were not kept but it is estimated that social workers were engaged on this basis on approximately ISO occasions. Youth Programs The former Office of Youth Affairs administered programs which provided funds to youth organisations. Although many of the projects undertaken by these organisations would have involved the employment of staff, departmental records for 1980/81 and 1986/87 do not indicate the qualifications of persons employed on such projects. (ii) The former Departments of Employment and Industrial Relations and Education did not have positions designated as Social Workers, Community Workers or Welfare Workers.

Social, Welfare and Community Workers (Question No_ 256) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 20 October 1987: How many (a) qualified social workers and (b) welfare or community workers (i) had positions funded by the Commonwealth in (A) 1980-81 and (8) 1986-87 and (ii) were employed in those years by the Minister's portfolio or it's appropriate predecessor.  the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Social Workers (i) (A) 1980-81 52, (8) 1986-87 67. (ii) (A) 1980-81 Not available·, (8) 1986-87 Not available·. (b) Welfare/Community Workers (i) (A) 1980-81 18, (8) 1986-87 10. (ii) (A) 1980-81 Not available·, (8) 1986-87 Not available·. - Actual staff numbers varied considerably against funded positions during the years specified and are not readily available. Because Social and Welfare workers are employed under varying conditions eg: temporary, casual, part time and permanent full time, substantial resources would be required to extract the data to provide an average and would not give a true indication of the resources at hand during the years specified. Elections: Multiple Voting (Question No. 530) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs. upon notice, on 26 November 1987: (1) Which 10 federal divisions recorded the greatest number of votes cast by people voting more than once during the general elections of (a) 1984 and (b) 1987. (2) How many electors were recorded as having voted (a) twice and (b) more than twice in those Divisions in those elections. (3) How many votes were cast by voters having voted more than once in those Divisions in those elections. Division Forde (Queensland) Lilley (Queensland) . . Grayndler (New South Wales) .

(5) How docs the Australian Electoral Commission decide when to prosecute an elector whose name has been crossed off the electoral roll during the same election. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (4) The answers to parts (I) to (4) are contained in tables I and 2. (5) The Divisional Returning Officer investigates possible cases of multiple voting. Cases of deliberate multiple voting are rare. More often than not Divisional Returning Officers conclude that no further action is necessary. Such cases may include elderly and confused people, people of unsound mind, people of ethnic origin with communication difficulties, and people who inadvertently voted both postal and ordinary. Cases where investigation suggests further action is warranted are referred to the Australian Federal Police or to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Arbitrators: Commercial Arbitration Ordinance (Question No. 600) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 16 February 1988: (1) What qualifications are required of arbitrators acting under the ACT Commercial Arbitration Ordinance 1986. (2) Mayan undischarged bankrupt be appointed an arbitrator or expert witness under this ordinance. (3) Do criminal convictions prevent persons from being appointed under the ordinance as arbitrators or expert witnesses. (4) Does the registrar of any Commonwealth court maintain a register of arbitrators or expert witnesses.  member's question is as follows: (1) No formal qualifications are required of arbitrators acting under the ACT Commercial Arbitration Ordinance 1986. (2) An undischarged bankrupt is not disqualified from appointment as an arbitrator or from giving expert evidence in proceedings under the Ordinance. (3) Criminal convictions do not prevent persons from being appointed under the Ordinance as arbitrators or giving expert evidence in proceedings under the Ordinance. I should add that the Ordinance implements uniform law developed by the Standing Committee of the Attorneys-General over a period of 10 years. Similar legislation has been enacted in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. (4) No registrar of any Commonwealth Court maintains a register of arbitrators or expert witnesses for the purpose of the Ordinance. Electoral Enrolments (Question No. 618) Mr Hawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 18 February 1988: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 370 (Hansard, 10 December 1987, page 3297), is the Minister able to say, for each federal and State electoral division, how many enrolment were there between (a) 25 January 1984 and 8 October 1986 and (b) 9 October 1986 and 18 February 1988. (2) How many applications to enrol between 9 October 1986 and 18 February 1988 were rejected because Voters voted AFP Advise Voters voted more than Referred AFP Advice No Prose- Referred twice twice No. of to AFP Pending cution to DPP votes 7 14 6 12 6 12 6 12 the applicants were British subjects, despite being Australian residents. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) The number of enrolment and rejections are set out in the following tables. However, it should be noted that the enrolment statistics for State electoral districts, other than in Tasmania which are the same as the Federal Divisions, are not available as the redistributions for 1984 Divisional statistics commenced in December 1984. As statistics of transactions do not have a cut-off point at 8-9 October 1986, statistics for the second half of 1986 have been disaggregated pro rata to Statewide monthly transactions for July-September and OctoberDecember to approximate the desired off-cut date. The cut-off dates for 1988 are for New South Wales 25 February; Victoria 26 February; Queensland 23 February; Western Australia 26 February; South Australia 11 February; Tasmania 19 February; Australian Capital Territory 24 February; Northern Territory 19 February. In examining the number of rejections it should be noted that: the records for the Division of Kalgoorlie date from June 1987 for the suiKIivision of Dampier; records for the Division of Tangney are incomplete. Records for the Divisions of Boothby date from December 1986; for the Divisions of Barker, Bonython, Hindmarsh, Makin, Port Adelaide and Sturt from February 1987.

(2) Is the Minister able to say whether any action has been taken by federal authorities to investigate an alleged offer made by Messrs N. Evans and G. Harris of Steinwell Commodities (UK) to the German hides and skins importer Louis Breuninger Lederfa.brik (GMBH) to sell a large amount of kangaroo skins in 1985 and 1986. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether any further offers have been made since 1986; if so, will the Government take any action.  the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (3) Claims that Steinwell Commodities (UK) was commissioned by the Government to sell kangaroo skins have been investigated thoroughly. No evidence has come to light to substantiate the claims. The alleged offer by Stein well Commodities to the German importer Louis Breuninger Lederfabrik was investigated by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in conApplications for British sultation with the Australian Customs Service, trade enrolment subjects officials in Bonn and the United Kingdom authority rejected responsible for the Convention on International Trade Dec. '84- Oct. '859 Oct. 86- in Endangered Species (CITES). The UK authorities Sept. '85 Feb. '88 18 Feb. 88 could find no record of Steinwell Commodities (UK). Nothing further has been heard of Steinwell Commodities. 5,645 63 4,184 48 5,548 281 Electoral Enrolments 4,801 38 (Question No. 740) 3,785 55 Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the 4,319 62 5,183 109 Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 24 4,564 108 February 1988: 4,943 197 (1) What is the entitlement for a 17 year old to enrol 4,331 160 and vote and is this enrolment recorded on the main 4,821 85 electoral roll. 5,338 64 3,296 76 (2) Is there any indication on the roll of a 17 year old's provisional enrolment. TASMANIA (3) What checks are made to ensure that a provision5,717 38 ally enrolled elector does not vote at an election occur5,569 20 ring before the person's 18th birthday. 6,322 60 5,538 39 (4) What was the total 17 year old provisional enrol5,461 61 ment during the 1987 general election. (5) Did the Australian Electoral Commission undertake a reconciliation of that enrolment against recorded 12,567 44 votes cast; if so, what was the result. 13,725 108 Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable 17,712 62 member's question: (1) to (2) Under section 100 of the Commonwealth Kangaroo Skins Electoral Act 1918, any person who is 17 years of age, and who, if he or she were 18 years of age, would be entitled to enrol under section 93 of the Act, may enrol provisionally. A provisional enrollee is not entitled to vote unless he or she attains the age of 18 on or before polling day. Provisional enrolments are recorded on the main electoral roll. The main electoral roll, maintained on computer, does not specifically identify provisional enrolments. However, the birthdate of any individual will indicate his or her provisional status. The Official Roll, available for public inspection at any Divisional Office, does not show birthdates but is annotated by the Divisional Returning Officer to indicate provisional enrolment status. (3) In the production of the Certified Lists of Voters for an election a computer program is run on the main electoral roll to exclude all enrolments that have not matured. Only the names of those electors who are 18 years of age or over will appear on the Certified List of Voters used on polling day. Any absent, section or postal votes issued in the name of an age 17 enrollee are disallowed at the preliminary scrutiny of declarations and thus are not included in the count. (4) and (5) The total number of provisional enrolments at the close of rolls for the 1987 election was 16,842. No reconciliation of provisional enrolments to votes cast was undertaken. The number of provisionals who matured to age 18 after the close of rolls and who were therefore able to vote as ordinary electors was 6,537. Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (1) When would the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) have prepared printed rolls, had the 1987 general election not occurred when it did. (2) When will the AEC prepare and make available updated printed copies of the rolls. (3) To whom and at what cost will these rolls be available. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (3) It had been the Commission's intention to print a new set of rolls following completion of the roll up-date (habitation review) in mid-1987. The Commission intends to comply with the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform (Report No.2, December 1986), subsequently accepted by the Government, that a roll print should take place approximately 2 years into the life of a new Parliament which will make it the second half of 1989. Printed rolls will be made available for free inspection and/or purchase in Divisional Offices under the provisions of section 90 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A purchase price for printed rolls has not yet been established. Under section 91 of the Act copies of the roll will be made available free of charge to each registered political party, to each Senator (the roll for the State or Territory) and to each Member of the House of Representatives (the roll for the Division for which the member was elected). In the meantime, the Electoral Commission is producing, for public inspection and sale, microfiche copies of divisional rolls containing the enrolment data which would appear on printed rolls. Each Divisional Office will hold for public inspection a full State set of fiche copies of divisional rolls and each Commission State Head Office will hold an Australia wide set. Each division will have fiche copies of its own roll available for sale and will take orders for purchase of copies of other divisional rolls. The cost of purchase will be 57.50 per set per division. On request, each member will receive a free set of fiche for his/her own division and each Senator will receive a free State-wide set of divisional fiche. As at the end of April, fiche copies of rolls for Queensland and Western Australian divisions had been produced. (Question No. 743) Mr Blunt asked the Minister r.epresenting the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 24 February 1988: (1) What procedures have been undertaken, as a result of the 1987 general election, to check the accuracy of the rolls and verify the entitlement of electors, including those not having recorded their vote or those Electoral Rolls who have sought a vote in an electoral division other than the one in which they were enrolled. (Question No. 742) (2) If this procedure has not been completed, which divisions in which States remain unverified. (3) Have habitation surveys been undertaken for each division in all States; if not, which divisions in each State have not been verified. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2) Following the 1987 general election, electors who appeared not to have voted were notified by mail and requested to show cause why proceedings should not have been instituted against them. Objection action to remove electors from the roll was instituted where response to non-voter procedures, either by mail returned to sender or otherwise, indicated that an elector may no longer be entitled to enrolment at his/her current enrolled address. Electors who sought a vote in a division other than a division in which they were enrolled, and who indicated a new current address, were sent electoral enrolment forms to facilitate their correct enrolment should this not already have been done. These procedures have not yet been completed in the New South Wales Divisions of: Chiftey, Cowper, Cunningham, Dundas, Greenway, Gwydir, Kingsford-Smith, Macarthur, Macquarie, North Sydney, Parkes, Phillip, Sydney and Wentworth. (3) Electoral roll review (formerly habitation reviews) were undertaken in all States and Territories, excepting Western Australia, during 1986/87. The last review in Western Australia was completed in 1985 and a new review which is still in progress commenced on 7 April 1988. Polling Booths (Question No. 765) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (1) What are the guidelines for the employment of casual workers to staff polling booths. (2) Is any attempt made to ensure that individuals with overt and publicly well-known party political affiliations are not employed. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) It is the Electoral Commission's policy to reengage experienced polling booth casual workers whose Electoral Rolls services have been satisfactory. This is in keeping with Recommendation 10 of the First Report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform (September 1983). New staff are selected on the basis of merit. (2) The Electoral Commission advises all intending applicants of the Commission's requirement for strict neutrality. Any person who is an active member of a political party or who is seen to be active in political or electoral affairs and intends to publicly carry on this activity, may compromise the strict neutrality of the Australian Electoral Commission and cannot be considered for employment. Cardboard Ballot Boxes Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (I) Did the usc of cardboard ballot boxes during the 1987 general election create any difficulties or threaten the security of votes or the integrity of the count. (2) Was there any enlargement of the opening in the cardboard ballot boxes which would enable the withdrawal of votes without completely opening the box. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. The usc of seals on each corner of the lid and the appointment of a polling official at each polling booth to guard the ballot boxes ensures the security of votes during the polling hours. In a very few cases a manufacturing fault resulted in the scam of heavily laden ballot boxes splitting. Polling officials repaired these with masking tape. The manufacturing problem has been identified and remedied. (2) While the dimensions of the opening in the lid of the cardboard ballot box are ISO mm x 20 mm, compared with 100 mm x IS mm in the old style metal boxes, the opening docs not allow any more than the fingers of an adult hand into the box. Moreover, a polling official is appointed to guard the ballot boxes. Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1988: (I) Is the officer-in-charge of each polling booth at the close of polling required to balance ballot papers received, ballot papers issued and spoilt ballot papers. (2) Is there a requirement to reconcile ballot paper numbers both issued and spoilt with the number of votes actually cast and counted; if so, are returns available to Divisional Returning Officers and to State offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2) Yes. The Assistant Returning Officer for each polling place is required, at the completion of the scrutiny, to fill out a return showing the number of ballot papers received, the number of ballot papers issued to electors, the number of ballot papers spoilt, found discarded in the polling place and unused ballot papers. Some small differences may occur between the number issued and the number accounted for at the end of the scrutiny, as electors cannot be totally prevented from leaving the polling place with their ballot papers. All polling place returns are forwarded, with the ballot papers and other polling place equipment, to the DRO after polling night. Returns are subsequently checked by the DRO. (Question No. 766) Disposal of Solid Waste (Question No. 805) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) What is the nature of the solid waste to be disposed of by Rhone Poulenc Chimie Pty Ltd at a site in Western Australia? (2) What will be the origin of the solid waste to be disposed? (3) How is the solid waste to be disposed? (4) What are the proposed environmental management procedures? (5) What is the likely environmental impact of the disposal? Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (5) Rhone Poulenc Chimie Australia Pty Ltd propose establishing a rare earths processing plant at Pinjarra, approximately 90 kilometres south of Perth. On behalf of the proponents Dames and Moore have prepared an Environment Review and Management Programme (ERMP) /Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) entitled 'Proposed Rare earths ProcessPolling Booths ing Plant Pinjarra Western Australia', dated February 1988. The report was released for public comment for (Question No. 767) ten weeks commencing February 22 1988. As set out in the ERMP/draft EIS, the plant is expected to produce a range of waste products the majority of which are intended to be disposed of into evaporation ponds adjacent to the plant. However, the· radioactive uranium/thorium hydroxide waste is, I understand, to be disposed of at an integrated hazardous waste disposal facility proposed to be established by the Western Australian Government in the Eastern Goldfields region of the State. For further details I refer the honourable member to the ERMP/draft EIS available in the Parliamentary Library. In addition I am advised that the Western Australian Government has commissioned a Public Environmental Review report, prepared under the WA Environmental Protection Act, 1986, dealing with environmental aspects of the State's proposed hazardous waste facility. The report, entitled 'Public Environmental Review: Proposed Integrated Waste Disposal Facility', was released for public comment for a four week period from 20 May 1988. This proposed rare earths project is currently going through a process of assessment by the relevant authorities in the light of public submissions received following release of the ERMP/draft EIS. This assessment is expected to review all aspects of the project including waste management. Voting Figures, 1987 Election Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 22 March 1988: (1) Did Australian Labor Party (ALP) or coalition party candidates receive the most votes at the last federal election for the House of Representatives. (2) What were the total number of votes cast for ALP and coalition party candidates and what was the difference. (3) In the light of the figures given in reply to part (2) why has the ALP increased its majority in the House to the extent that it has and (b) what is the statistical probability of this eventuality. (4) what were the total number of votes cast for ALP and coalition party candidates in the 1983 and 1984 elections and what was the majority of seats held by the Government after these elections. Mr West-The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The coalition (Liberal, National, Country Liberal) parties combined received more primary votes (first preferences) than the Australian Labor Party at the 1987 election for the House of Representatives. NA ALP Coalition. NA ALP Coalition . NA ALP Coalition. NA ALP Coalition. NA ALP Coalition. NA ALP Coalition. NA ALP Coalition. * Percentage of total primary votes for Australian The Australian Labor Party was more successful than the coalition parties in securing second and subsequent preferences from other parties and indeJ?Cndent candilian dates, and in 'three-cornered contest' Divisions it also received a 'leakage' of preferences from the excluded coalition candidate. (2) The Australian Labor Party received 4,232,563 primary votes and the coalition parties combined (Question No. 811) 4,255,289 primary votes. The coalition parties combined received 22,267 more primary votes than the Australian Labor Party. (3) Where one candidate has not secured an absolute majority of primary votes the result in a House of Representatives Division is determined not after the count of the primary votes but only after the distribution of second and subsequent preferences. Consequently to establish why a particular party or group of parties has secured a majority of seats, or a particular number of seats, it is necessary to examine the distribution of preferences as well as the numbers of primary votes. At the 1987 election for the House of Representatives after the distribution of all preferences to either the Australian Labor Party candidate or the leading coalition candidate (the two-party preferred vote), the Australian Labor Party candidates had received a total of 4,692,999 votes and the coalition parties candidates 4,540,001 votes. The Australian Labor Party had thereby increased its total votes received over its primary votes totals by 460,436 votes and the coalition parties over theirs by 284,712 votes. On a State/Territory by State/Territory total in those Divisions in which preferences had to be distributed to produce an absolute majority, the aggregate figures at the 1987 election were: Primary Two-party Number of votes %* votes % Divisions 10 302,753 51.73 334,715 52.38 282,479 48.27 304,327 47.63 18 503,485 47.01 559,043 48.27 567,429 52.99 599,220 51.73 15 402,913 44.92 446,515 46.69 494,042 55.08 509,877 53.31 4 101,194 43.34 112,326 45.69 132,319 56.66 133,511 54.31 5 151,413 53.19 171,152 54.21 133,256 46.81 144,595 45.79 26,732 48.27 29,787 53.79 24,590 44.41 25,587 46.21 28,195 46.89 31,386 52.22 31,941 53.11 28,723 47.78 Labor Party and coalition parties combined. In addition to its receiving a larger proportion of twoparty preferred votes than of primary votes, the AustraLabor Party was more successful in marainal Divi"". sions, and particularly its own marginal Divisions, than in other categories of Divisions. Division Category ALP Marginal . . Coalition Marginal Fairly safe/safe - Marginal if 1984 winner had 55% or less of two-party It is not possible to speak of a statistica- pr<?bability of particular electoral outcomes unless votmg IS to be regarded as a random process. However in the 17 House of Representatives - ene-al el-tions since 1949 t--re have been four elections m which the party or coalition parties winning a majority of seats polled fewer primary votes than the other principal party: 1954 when the Australian Labor Party polled 50.03 per cent of primary votes to t e coa Ilion parties. per cent but won 57 seats to their 64; 1961 when the Australian Labor Party polled 47.90 per cent of primary votes to the coalition parties' 42.09 per cent but won 60 seats to their 62; 1969 when the Australian Labor Party polled 46.95 per cent of primary votes to the coalition parties' 43.33 per cent but won 59 seats to their 66; and 1987 when the Australian Labor Party polled 45.83 per cent of primary votes to the coalition parties' 46.07 per cent but won 86 seats to their 62.

Smokeless Tobacco (Question No. 816) Mr Moore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 March 1988: (I) Does he support the Government's ban on smokeless tobacco announced by the previous Minister for Consumer Affairs at the time of the most recent visit to Australia of the US Trade Representative, Mr C. Yeutter. (2) Did Mr Yeutter raise the matter during trade talks in Canberra and did he question whether the ban constituted a restrictive trade practice on the part of the Government.

202,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honbl be ' t"" - II . oura e mem r s ques Ion IS as 0 ows. (I) I support the proposed ban on oral smokeless tobacco products which is subject to recommendations hr' . , 47 11 by the Trade Practices Commission. The Commission will submit its recommendations following a conference currently being conducted in respect of the proposed ban. (2) I am advised that Mr Yeutter raised this matter during recent trade talks in Australia. However, I am also advised that after examination of the issues Mr Yeutter was satisfied that the proposed ban is a health matter and is consistent with internationally accepted trade practice. The proposed ban is based exclusively on health considerations. (3) The US Tobacco Co has initiated action challenging the constitutional validity of Division IA of Part V of the Trade Practices Act and the meaning of 'injury' Seats under Division lA, Part V of the Act. 4,127,392 4,622,717 (4) My colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs, 75 in deciding whether or not to proceed with the ban, will 50 5\0,111 consider the recommendations arising from a conference 25 into the proposed ban before the Trade Practices Commission. The proposed ban does not include nasal snuff. 82 Plant Variety Rights 66 16 (Question No. 874) Mr Milton asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 14 April 1988: (I) Why was a period of only 6 weeks allowed for public response to the advertisement placed in national newspapers on 28 November 1987 requesting comments on 4 matters relating to the inclusion of certain genera or species under section 13 of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. (2) Was consideration given to granting an extension of time for responses, particularly in view of the omission of a contact telephone number in the advertisement; if not, why not. (3) Is he able to give details of instances where overseas interests have taken native species from the wild in Australia and obtained protection under plant variety rights legislation in other countries. (4) How will the inclusion of native plants under plant variety rights legislation discourage overseas interests from continuing the practice outlined in part (3). (5) As a significant number of native species are as yet undescribed, what resources have been set aside to ensure the establishment of as complete a list as possible of Australia's native plant species, and for the continual Updating of this list as new species are discovered. (6) Why is there no representative of conservation interests on the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee, in view of the Government's recognition of the importance of ensuring that no patents are granted for discoveries of native plant species. (7) Is the Plant Variety Rights Journal, at a cost of $30 per subscription, prohibitive to interested persons who are not in a position to peruse copies held in regional departmental offices. (8) Will he direct the Advisory Committee to advertise further procedures for plant variety rights in national newspapers and relevant magazines to allow the maximum public response; if not, why not. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A period of 6 weeks was specified in the advertisement of 28 November 1987 to give interested parties adequate time to comment on the proposed inclusion of the first 8 genera/species in the plant variety rights (PVR) legislation and to provide input on areas where there was need for inclusion of other plant types. Comment was then sought on 5 March 1988 on a proposed program for the coverage of all species by March 1990. A further 7 weeks was provided for comment. These periods were specified to ensure that comment was received in time for consideration by the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee while still giving people time to adequately consider their submissions. (2) Any requests for extension of time were considered and submissions from the advertisement of 28 November 1987 were accepted up to the time of the Advisory Committee meeting on 19 February (an additional 5 weeks). Submissions from the advertisement of 5 March 1988 are being accepted until 17 May if extensions are sought. Although there was not a contact number in the first advertisement, the department's number is freely available through Telecom advisory services. The second advertisement did contain a contact number. (3) There are many instances of overseas interests obtaining plant variety rights protection outside Australia on varieties of Australian native plants. These include kangaroo paw, waratah, boronia, and grevillea, in New Zealand and the USA. Other countries have genera with species native to Australia scheduled as eligible for protection. These include the genera Acacia, Anigozanthos, Leptospermum and Olearia to name but a few. Submissions, to the 1984 Senate Standing Committee investigation of PVR, highlighted the growing interest and development of Australian native species overseas: 'Because of Australia's failure to exploit the export potential of its native flora a number of other nations have moved to satisfy the needs of world markets for new varieties. Israel and Hawaii have collected Australian native flora for a number of years and are deeply involved in research into their propagation and development. Australian flora grown in Israel and Hawaii are extensively marketed as cut flowers in Europe and the USA.' (4) The inclusion of native plants under PVR legislation will not discourage these practices but it will provide incentive for Australians also to develop Australian native species in cultivation, thereby competing with the overseas interests and returning some of the commercial gain to this country rather than to outsiders. PVR legislation will encourage the development of Australian native species in cultivation and will contribute therefore, to species survival if it is endangered in its native habitat. Australian people will become more aware of their heritage if the native species are readily available to them as cultivars rather than being restricted to remote bush locations. (5) The task of developing a database of Australian native species is ongoing and could span several lifetimes. To be eligible for PVR, a variety must have been originated by a person (as defined by the Act), have not been previously sold (it has to be new) and it must differ from all other known varieties. Descriptions of varieties submitted for PVR will be published in the Plant Varieties Journal and will be distributed to recognised experts in the field for comment. If it is considered that the new variety is similar to an existing known variety, the applicant will be required to prove the difference. If a right is granted to a variety which is later shown to be the same as another variety that was known to exist at the time the right was granted, the PVR will be revoked. (6) Plant variety rights are only granted for the development of cultivated varieties. development work must have taken place in cultivation before a variety is eligible. This in itself ensures that PVR is not in conflict with conservation interests. In fact PVR encourages the preservation of species in cultivation. Nominations for the PVR Advisory Committee were therefore sought widely from organisations interested in the development of cultivated plants. Consumer interests are represented by the member nominated by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO). The Registrar (who chairs the Advisory Committee) has a Masters Degree in Environmental Studies. Consultation is occurring with many interested organisations. Anyone wanting to be involved should contact the Registrar. (7) The cost of $30 per year for the Plant Varieties Journal is not prohibitive. Most people spend more than that on newspapers each year. A subscription to the Commonwealth Gazette is over ten times that amount. If people are unable to obtain a copy of the journal through regional departmental offices or state public libraries they can direct specific inquiries, by phone or in writing, to the Registrar. (8) The cost of using national newspapers to advertise all descriptions of new varieties is prohibitively high and of limited value because interested people would need to buy and read a paper each day to ensure they did not miss PVR advertisements. By having all the PVR information in a single publication, available on SUbscription, everyone knows where to find it. Many libraries will have the Journal and any organisation is free to extract information and reprint it in its own publication. (Question No. 876) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 14 April 1988: (I) How many telephones are connected in Australia, including the number connected to (a) private and (b) business subscribers. (2) What is the average connection fee for a telephone, including the fee for (a) private and (b) business subscribers. (3) Does this fee vary according to factors including the wiring already in place; if not, why not. (4) Why are different connection fees charged for private and business subscribers. (5) What is the average annual telephone bill for (a) all subscribers, (b) private subscribers, (c) business scribers, (d) subscribers in scribers who live outside major capital cities but who are not classified as rural and (f) subscribers in rural areas. (6) What proportion of revenue is collected from (a) local and (b) STD calls. (7) What proportion of telephone bills is made up of (a) local and (b) STD calls for those living in (i) cities and (ii) rural areas.  port and Communications has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia: (I) As at 31 March 1988 there were 7,035,031 telephone services in operation in Australia; comprising (a) 5,080,845 non business customers; and (b) 1,954,186 business customers. (2) The following standard fees apply for the connection of both non-business and business customers: New Service-New Customer-5210 New Service-Former Customer-5170 (i.e. 81% of the new customer charge) For new customers located in rural and remote areas beyond 16km radial distance from automatic telephone exchanges and manual exchange areas programmed to be converted to automatic, the standard new service connection fee of 5210 applies, plus 525 per radial tkm beyond 16km, with the maximum fee payable at 40km and beyond being 51410. (For removal or former customers relocating to a new address where a new telephone service is required, 81% of these charges apply.) For new customers located in rural and remote areas beyond 8km radial distance from manual telephone exchanges not programmed for conversion to automatic, the standard new service connection fee of 5210 applies, plus 525 per radial tkm beyond 8km, with the maximum fee payable at 40km and beyond being 51810. (For removal or former customers relocating to a new address where a new telephone service is required, 81% of these charges apply.) Telephones (3) Yes. (4) There is no differentiation between the connection fees charged for non-business and business customers, with the exception of business customers occupying buildings requiring permanent backbone cabling. In these cases, a connection fee surcharge is made because of the costs of providing this cabling. (5) It is not possible to obtain these figures as Telecom has not yet implemented systems which provide customer segmented billing information. However, the estimated average value of all Telecom customer telephone bills issued in 1986/87 was 5230. (6) Precise figures are not available but Telecom estimates prepared for 1987-88 indicated as follows: (a) approximately 22 per cent. (b) approximately 28 per cent. (7) Telecom advises that this information is unavailsub- able from its present management information systems. major capital cities, (e) subAborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (Question No. 935) Mr Miles asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1988: (I) What is the working definition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. (2) Is he able to say how each element of the definition is established by each Commonwealth agency in the administration of Commonwealth programs. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Commonwealth has adopted the following working definition: An Aboriginal is a person of Aboriginal descent who identifies as an Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the Aboriginal community in which the person lives. (2) The Commonwealth's definition of Aboriginals is accepted by all Commonwealth agencies administering programs for the benefit of Aboriginals. As to how that definition is established and on what programs it is used is a matter for each agency to determine in the context of program conditions. These criteria can be obtained from the agencies by the honourable member. Aboriginal Properties, Redfern, New South Wales (Question No. 944) Mr Tuckey asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 26 April 1988: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the correspondence between Mr G. Wotherspoon and his Department concerning the condition of properties held by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission located at 31-33 Cope Street, Redfern, N.S.W., which have been occupied for many months by squatters, with a subsequent build-up of rubbish? (2) What is he doing about the situation? (3) When is Mr Wotherspoon likely to receive a satisfactory reply to his inquiries? (4) When are the properties likely to be cleaned up?",85
203,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There has been no correspondence between Mr G. Wotherspoon and my Department. There has been correspondence and telephone conversations between Mr Wotherspoon and my electorate office. (2), (3) and (4) Mr Wotherspoon lives in Cope Street, Redfern in the same street as a property administered by the Aboriginal Development Commission. Apparently the property is occupied by squatters. Mr Wotherspoon complained about the building being occupied by squatters and the vast build-up of rubbish in the building and grounds. the problem of garbage is the responsibility of the Sydney City Council Health Department. Following Mr Wotherspoon's complaint to me in January last, my office contacted an officer at the Aboriginal Development Commission who advised that efforts were being made to remove the garbage and that the problem of occupancy required legal proceedings. On 29 January, Mr Wotherspoon was advised of the position. On 3 February, Mr Wotherspoon wrote that nothing had been done. The garbage had not been removed and that he was dissatisfied with the administration of the properties 31-33 Cope Street, Redfern. My office made further representations to the ADC and Mr Wotherspoon's correspondence to me was forwarded to them with a request that they answer that letter direct and Mr Wotherspoon was so advised by letter. On 2 May, Mr Wotherspoon wrote saying that he was dissatisfied with the indifference and that he planned a delegation to the City Commissioners who administer the Sydney City Council. On 5 May, my office again contacted the ADC who advised that the ADC was working with the N.S.W. Department of Housing as to how to resolve the problem of the occupants and that they had written to Mr Wotherspoon direct about the matter. I attach a copy of the latter from the Branch Manager of the ADC to Mr Wotherspoon dated 2 May. On 11 May, my office telephoned Mr Wotherspoon to advise him further as to what information we had obtained. .1 understand the present position is as follows: The properties 31-33 Cope Street, Redfern are occupied by three groups: the Black Theatre, Radio Redfern and individual occupants. As a result of co-operation between the ADC and the N.S.W. Department of Housing, it is expected that the occupants will be offered alternative housing. It is then expected that the building will be adequately secured while its future is determined. Mr Garry Wotherspoon 73 Cope Street REDFERN, N.S.W. 2016 Dear Mr Wotherspoon We refer to your recent correspondence with Mr Lionel Bowen, Attorney General and Deputy Prime Minister, with respect to rubbish accumulation at 31-33 Cope Street, Redfern. Let us assure you that the Aboriginal Development Commission shares your concern in this matter. For your information, the Commission has expended in excess of $20,000 in the past two years in an effort to improve the overall appearance and security of this property. In addition some $2,000 has been incurred in expenses specifically related to clean up of this site during the past eight weeks. You will be aware that since December, at our direction, large collectable litter bins were strategically placed on site to reduce unsightly stockpile of rubbish. More recently the Aboriginal Housing Company conducted a general ""clean up"" during the week ended 15 April 1988. In an effort to resolve the ""squatters"" situation the Commission, in liaison with local Aboriginal organisations and the Department of Housing is addressing the need to consider rehousing these people elsewhere and you will be informed of any final decisions in this regard. Also, please note that the Commission, at the request of local organisations, will shortly be negotiating with outside consultants as to future use of the Cope Street property site. It is sincerely hoped that these matters will be resolved at an early date. Please feel free to draw any matters to our attention which you feel appropriate. However, we reiterate our commitment to ensure that the problems associated with this property and which affect nearby residents are brought to an early resolution.
