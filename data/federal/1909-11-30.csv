1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs if he has obtained from the Minister of Trade and Customs, whom he represents in this Chamber, an answer to the question which I asked a few days ago respecting a patent medicine which is sold for 2s. 6d., though supposed to be worth only the one-fortieth part of a penny.",14
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have just received from the Department of Trade and Customs, the following memorandum on the subjectIn regard to this matter it is pointed out that the Department is taking every possible action allowed by law to properly control the importation of patent medicine. Every effort is made to see tnat all claims in regard to the medicines imported are not in any particular extravagant or misleading, and in this way the public are protected as much as possible. There are, however, grave objections to complying with the suggestion made to inform the House of the name of the patent medicine referred to in the accompanying slip. As a fundamental principle, it would be highly inadvisable to single out any particular item for special treatment in this way, seeing that the estimated cost of ingredients in manufactured articles is in many instances much less than the price at which the article is retailed; nor are patent medicines the only goods affected-the difference in price being pronounced also in many other lines. So long, then, as the Department sees, as f ar as.possible, that the article is properly described, it does not appear desirable that information which may have been obtained confidentially, or in the course of official inquiry, should be made public, more especially in any one particular instance only. LAND SETTLEMENT.",14
3,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It is stated in Saturday's Age, in regard to a debate in the House of Lords on the Budget proposals, that in dealing with Socialistic remedies for rural depopulation, Lord Lamington said the settlements set up by Australian Governments in the country districts had been unsuccessful, though the conditions were favourable and the land was given free. As land settlement in this country is conducted on more or less Socialistic lines, land in some of the States being given free to farmers, does the Prime Minister not think it necessary to take steps to correct the misapprehensions which may arise in the Old Country from statements such as this?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The noble lord was formerly Governor of one of the States.,14
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hi s remark does not apply to that State. "" Mr DEAKIN - I have been told that there were some experiments regarding village settlements",14
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I should like to know who gave the honourable member the information.,14
7,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,I did.,14
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is not true. t,14
9,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,I rise to order.,14
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I withdraw my remark. It was an indirect statement.,14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I was unaware what justification the noble lord might have for what he said,' and questioned my colleague, who replied that he remembered certain experiments in-'connection with village settlements during Lord Lamington's term of office in Queensland, which probably supplied material for the remark. There have been artificial attempts at land settlement in other States, which have not succeeded. I remember one in Victoria. But a general statement of this nature would be unwarranted in regard to any one of the States, and, of course, quite contrary to the experience of Australia as a whole.",14
12,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,What does the honorary Minister think of that?,14
13,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,-I agree with it. COINAGE.,14
14,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"When the Coinage Bill was being considered, and proposals were made for certain amendments in the schedule to provide for decimal coinage, the Treasurer promised to try to provide for it by means of regulations. ' The newspapers now report that he is not disposed to bring about decimal coinage. As that is contrary to his promise, I ask if he poses to provide for it by regulation ?",15
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I expressed the opinion that, by abolishing the halfcrown, we could make it more convenient to institute decimal coinage, but I did not promise to introduce the system. Nickel coinage was provided for in the Bill, but the Government are not doing more than to keep the supply of bronze coinage equal to the demand. They do not propose at once to substitute new bronze coinage for that now in currency.",15
16,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the fact that copper coin is simply a token,, its intrinsic value being less than its nominal value, will the Treasurer take into consideration the advisability of making it smaller, so that it may be more conveniently - carried about ?",15
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"All that is proposed in regard to bronze coinage is to import ;Â£io,ooo to meet the demands of the banks. The new coinage will be stamped similarly to the silver coinage. The question of substituting nickel for bronze has not been dealt with. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ' COOMA MAIL SERVICE-TELEPHONE CHARGES-POSTA L NOTES.",15
18,Mr HALL,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the coal strike has caused the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales to reduce the train service between Goulburn and Cooma to three days a week, whereas formerly it was a daily one, will the Postmaster-General have the mails conveyed from Goulburn to Cooma by motor car on the days when a train does not run?",15
19,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The claims of each district for a substituted service where, as in this instance, the Railways Commissioners are not able to carry their contracts for the carriage of mails, will receive consideration.",15
20,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Can the Postmaster General state whether there is any possithink bility of the Committee appointed to inState quire into the telephone charges reporting before the end of the session ?,15
21,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I have sent a communication to the Committee, asking them to expedite their labours. I cannot control their operations any more than I have done. I have done my best to expedite the work, but they say it is so immense in its complexity and so difficult, pro- that they cannot carry' it on any faster than they are doing. They also say that the accounts that have been kept in the various post offices of the State are so imperfect and confused that they I'annot arrive at a fair and reasonable estimate without examining the accounts in a systematic manner. I have asked them to make a short cut to a conclusion, if possible, but they decline to do it. .",15
22,Mr WISE,Unknown,"the Postmaster General,- upon notice- : If he will make arrangements whereby postal notes can be purchased at receiving offices, which are usually situated in outlying districts fat removed from facilities for transmitting moneys ? Sir'JOH N QUICK - The matter is receiving consideration, with a view to making such arrangements, if generally practicable. HIGH COMMISSIONER BILL.",15
23,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister tell the House why the High Commissioner Bill, which might have been passed into law in two minutes on Friday has, apparently purposely, been further delayed, and put down as No. 4 on the notice-paper for today? Is it the intention of the Government to pass the measure during this sea-, sion? If so, can the Prime Minister state the approximate date?",15
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The only reason why the Bill did not leave this House last week was through the action of my honourable friend and one or two others. There has been no alteration in the position of the Bill on the notice-paper, except that, as usual, the two new items have been put on first in order that they may be launched. I have every hope that within a comparatively short period this afternoon we shall find ourselves again there, and further. out INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL. NEW PROTECTION.",15
25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister there is any possibility of the InterCommission Bill, which is before ahother place, and has not been dealt with for nearly two months, being passed this session ?",15
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I necessarily watch the notice-paper of another place. The honourable member is quite aware that the only reason why the Bill referred to has not been further proceeded with is that measures- I will not say of greater importance, for no question is of greater importance than some of those involved in the Inter-State Commission Bill-bu t of greater urgency, as having a financial character, have lately occupied the time. I fear now that the chances of so extensive a Bill as the Inter-State Commission Bill being passed this session are growing very small.",16
27,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Are we to understand from the Prime Minister's statement regarding the prospects of the Inter-State Commission Bill that it is not the intention of the Government to proceed this session with any proposal to grant the new Protection to those engaged in manufacturing industries ?,16
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If honourable members in either House are agreeable to pass a measure embodying the new Protection portion of the Inter-State Commission Bill, I am prepared to consider the possibility of severing it from the rest ",16
29,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I shall fight it, anyhow, because it is only an apology. AN Honorable MEMBER - So will I .",16
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I thought the Prime Minister was the Government. What has become of responsible government? It appears that it is now a question of getting a majority.,16
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is a question, not of majorities, but of time, and the time at our disposal is now very limited. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL.",16
32,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"As honourable members opposite seem to have forgotten the particular measure, I wish to ask the Prime Minister at what date the Government propose to proceed with the Land Tax Assessment Bill that appears at the foot of the notice-paper ?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think the Greek kalends is a sufficiently definite date. SUGAR COMMISSION.,16
34,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Does the Prime Minfollowing ister purpose giving the House any infor- - questionsmation before the close of the session as to the personnel of the proposed Sugar Commission ?,16
35,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , if it be determined. The pressure of business has been so great that for the last ten days or more I have not been able even to look at the matter. SEAMEN'S COMPENSATION BILL.",16
36,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Hav e the Government any intention to proceed with the Seamen's Compensation Bill during the present session ? Mr DEAKIN!- I regard the passage of that measure as a certainty. It is very short, and I think both sides are agreed upon it. TEMPORARY EMPLOYES : CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT.",16
37,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Was the pay of temporary employees in the Customs Department, North Queensland, reduced from ios. to 7s. a day in December and January last? 2. What was the rate per day previously piaid ? 3. Was Charles Severin, Acting Storekeeper, Government Bond, Cairns, reduced from ios. to 7s. daily from 19th December, 1908, to 19th January, 1909? 4. By whose direction was this reduction made ?",16
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Minister is making inquiry into this matter, and the honourable member vvill be informed of the result."" DEFENCE. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN ARTILLERY : LEAVE SENIOR CADETS, VICTORIA-MILITAR Y TATTOO.",16
39,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Has the O.C.R.A.A., New South Wales, issued a recent order stopping all leave till ioth January, because Lord Kitchener's Camp is on from 3rd to ioth January? 2. Will this not prohibit members of the corps from having any holidays during Christmas, and taking advantage of the reduced December railway fares? 3. Will the Minister see that this order does not operate till ist January?",16
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The District Commandant has furnished me with the reply to the honourable member's 1 and 2. No. Holidays will be allowed, the Commandant adds, as far as the exigencies of the service will permit.",16
41,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister ot Defence, upon notice I. Is it proposed to create five battalions of Senior Cadets in Victoria? 2. When will these be recruited? 3. Have requests been frequently made to increase the four companies at Geelong to a battalion ? 4. Will he make the Geelong half-battalion into a battalion?",17
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1 and 2. Five battalions of Senior Cadets are already raised in Victoria, three with headquarters in Melbourne, one in Bendigo, and one in Geelong. 3 and 4. Requests have been received, but, as no funds were available to cover such increase, it was not recommended by the District Commandant. The matter will, however, be noted for future consideration. /",17
43,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether he has made inquiries in reference to the complaints as to the want of proper supervision and suitable refreshments for the Cadets and Scouts at the recent Military Tattoo? 2. If so, is he satisfied there was good ground for the complaints, and will he take effective steps to prevent a similar state of things occurring at any future demonstration that may be held under the auspices of any branch of his Department ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. Yes. Steps will be taken, as far as possible, to prevent a recurrence. TRADE MARKS CASES.",17
44,Mr HALL,Unknown,"for Mr SPENCE) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Will the Minister ascertain whether it is a fact that the written judgment of the Registrar of Trade Marks in the opposed Trade Mark case, La Societi Anonyme Le Ferment v. The Australian Milk Ferment Proprietary, contains the two following findings :(a) "" I decide that the right to the exclusive use of the word ' Lactobacillus' respect of goods of the description of milk ferments belongs to La Sociiti Anonyme Le Ferment."" [b) "" I am not prepared to accept the word ' Lactobacilline' as an essential particular under the Act, the word being descriptive in its application, and the prefixing of the word ' Bacillus' by ' Lacto ' and the changing of the final letters ' us' into ' ine' not constituting it an invented word within the meaning of the Act"" ? 2. Will the Minister obtain from the Registrar of Trade Marks some explanation as to how he can give to any one ""the exclusive use"" of a word which he decides is not registerable as a Trade Mark?",17
45,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions an*1. The findings mentioned are contained in a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks on the cases referred to. 2. The Registrar of Trade Marks reports that the findings are consistent in law. The effect of the finding (a) is not against all parties, but solely against the unsuccessful party in the above mentioned case-that is, The Australian Milk Ferment Proprietary. It is not necessary under the Act that a trade mark, to be capable of exclusive appropriation, must be a registerable trade mark. The honourable member for Hindmarsh a few days ago asked the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon, notice I. Will he ascertain whether it is a fact that the Registrar of Trade Marks refused to accept the word ""Dudley,"" application No. 6191, on the ground that it is a name of a person and that its use was not authorized by Lord Dudley? 2. Is it a fact that subsequently the Registrar accepted the word "" Chelmsford"" as a trade: mark, application No. 7483 ? 3. Was the word ""Chelmsford"" printed is "" a particular and distinctive manner,"" and was. the use of the word as a trade mark authorized by Lord Chelmsford? 4. If the reply to the preceding question is in> the negative, will the Minister ascertain on what grounds the word "" Dudley"" was refused and! the word "" Chelmsford"" was accepted as a. trade mark? The answers to the honourable member's, questions are1. The Examiner reported under section 33of the Trade Marks Act 1905, that the word "" Dudley"" was not a registerable trade mark being the name of a person not printed in a particular and distinctive manner, and its use being unauthorized by Lord Dudley. The application was abandoned by the applicant, and not refused by the Registrar. 2. Application No. 7483 for the word "" Chelmsford "" was accepted by the Deputy Registrar. 3. No. in 4. In regard to the word "" Dudley,"" see answer to question 1. The word "" Chelmsford "" was accepted as a word primarily being a geographical name not used or likely to be under, stood in a geographical sense, and not beinglikely to deceive. PAPER. Mr FULLER iaid upon the table the following paper:. Public Service Act-Recommendatio n in connection with the promotion of W. A. Maguire,. Clerk, Public Service Commissioner's Office. NAVAL LOAN BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message):",17
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.18] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenues and moneys be made for the purposes - of a Bill for an Act to authorize the raising and expending of the sum of ^3,500,000 for the purposes of naval defence.",18
47,Mr FRAZEK,Unknown,The seventh borrower - come to light!,18
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Is the honourable member going to make my speech ? I regret that the Bill has not yet come to me from the printer. I hope to have it later in .the day, and propose then to make my speech on the second reading, as is customary. The practice which we are falling into of making speeches on the preliminary motion in Committee is quite foreign to my experience. I see no advantage in it. l t simply means making two speeches instead - of one. I am not prepared to make my speech without the Bill, and, therefore, I simply submit the motion.",18
49,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide . Bay) [3.19] This is certainly a most extraordinary proceeding on the part of the Government. They have no mandate, nor are there halfa-dozen members on the Ministerial side who have a mandate from the people, for a loan policy. It is evident that the Gov-ernment are desirous of putting the Commonwealth in pawn, so that they may be in the same position as the States.",18
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why not wait for the second reading?,18
51,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Because I ' have no certainty that I shall be heard on that motion. On three different occasions when I might have intervened the Government have taken a step which prevented my making any remarks at all. The Prime' Minister shakes ""his head, but that is an absolute fact.",18
52,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The fact that a debate is stopped does not mean that it is intended - to stop the honourable member personally.,18
53,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On two of these occasions I desired to assist the Government. In inaugurating a policy of this kind, the Government should make a statement of the - conditions relating to it. They should tell us why they propose to enter upon a borrowing policy which is contrary, not only to the policy put .before the people at the last general election, but to the policy of the present Government, and that of thf Labour party. The whole of the members of the Labour party are pledged to a restriction of public borrowing. In inaugurating a loan policy for the Commonwealth at the present time the Government are taking up, not only a strange, but an exceedingly degrading position. I am able to say that as late as fourteen or fifteen months ago, the Prime Minister himself was absolutely opposed to the policy of borrowing. What has brought about the change? What need is there for it? We have no statement of the reasons from the Treasurer; he simply says that the Government desire to raise .Â£3,500,000.",18
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member knows that we want it.,18
55,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not. Beyond the mere statement of the Treasurer that the Government desire to raise'^3,500,000 by means of a loan, I do not know what the Government want. I know of nothing that calls upon them to borrow before an appeal is made to the electors. The course that they have proposed to take is without precedent. The Prime Minister said that the Government were following the usual procedure. I admit that they are, so far as the Standing Orders are concerned, but, if he thought that ' I was referring to a technical breach of the rules of procedure, he is more innocent than most of us imagine him to be. The procedure is all right; the policy is all wrong. What is this money required for?",18
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The resolution of which we gave notice has been carried. We require the money for naval defence.,18
57,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the money is required entirely for naval defence purposes; then it is not necessary to take this action until after the next general election. If , 0.1 the other hand, the money is required for any other purpose, that fact should be stated.",18
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member will not .give us an opportunity to speak.,18
59,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The right honourable member had his chance. We wished him to go on.,18
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"What the honourable member wishes, and what I wish, are two different matters.",18
61,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Quite so. The object of this Government is to cover up everything.,18
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is very good, after the application of the closure on the naval defence motion.",18
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Who moved the application of the closure?,18
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You did.,19
65,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the Leader of the Opposition moved the application of the closure ?,19
66,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence is capable of saying anything. Motions were submitted that the honourable member be no further heard, but they were disapproved of by me, and 1, and other members of my party, voted against them. The application of the closure to the question was moved by the Minister of Defence himself, so that his interjection is quite beside the mark. I am not going, however, to be side-tracked. As I understand the position, the Government see that the six States are increasing their indebtedcharge ness to financiei-s in other parts of the world, and they, too, are extremelyanxious to borrow. An article in a recent issue of one of the financial journals published in the Old Country contains the statement that Australia is practically in pawn to the money lenders. A great naval policy, following on the lines endorsed practically by all parties in the House, has been announced by the Government, but they desire to inaugurate that policy by resorting to borrowing. Surely that is not in keeping with the spirit or desire of those who have advocated the principle of Australian defence? understand the Minister of Defence and those associated with him in the Government being in favour of borrowing, because they have always said that we should be protected by the Mother Country. the speech made by him on this subject last week, the honourable gentleman had always declared that the defence of Australia could be best carried out in the North Sea, but those who think that it can be more effectively secured by Australian people and Australian money, and who are willing to find both men and money, take a very different view from that of the Government, who would appeal to financiers in other countries to finance their defence scheme. Their action will do injury to the spirit and fibre of our young Australians. The whole force and effect of an Australian defence policy lies in its inculcation of the idea that we must provide, not only the defenders from among ourselves, but the money for our defence. From the meagre statement that has been made, I understand that the Government propose, by means of borrowing, to raise every penny of the money required to provide, the new flotilla. I do not know whether they desire in that way to provide for the cost of military as well as of naval defence.",19
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's Government did not leave us anything on which we could put our hands.,19
68,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence is in error. The present Government were left a larger nest-egg than.my predecessor general said would be in the Treasury at the end of the financial year. The amount to the credit of the old-age pension fund was also larger than was anticipated. When I left the Treasury it was in a better position financially than it was when I took of it, so that, while the Minister of Defence may jeer, it is evident that he knows nothing about the matter.",19
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But the honourable member knows that his Government starved every Department.,19
70,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is far better for a Government to economize and pay its way than to clamour for a loan from a so called poorer people and country. We produce more wealth per head than anycountry in the world; and vet we have a Fusion Government of all the talents, whose first act of finance, four months I can after taking office, is to submit a proposal which humiliates this Parliament in the same manner, and in the same degree, as, did the borrowing, boom Governments of the States the State Parliaments a few Until years ago. We are enjoying unexampled prosperity; and, at a time when the bounties of nature are greater than ever before - when the people are ready and willing to contribute the money to enable us to effectively defend these shores-the Government, instead of manfully facing the situation, seek to inaugurate a mischievous policy, and, as has been said, create a seventh borrower in Australia. This is a dangerous policy to initiate. Had it not been for the action of the Labour party when Sir GeorgeTurner proposed to borrow Â£500,000, in 1902-ha d it not been, as I say, for the Labour party and others",19
71,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Includin g the honourable member for Parramatta.,19
72,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Whoeve r opposed the policy deserves credit. Had it not beenfor the action of the Labour party and others at that time, the Commonwealth by this time would have borrowed Â£20,000,000, and the people would have been, not better, - but worse off. What purports to be a desire to borrowfor the defence of the country is simply a desire to, on the part of the Government, adopt any means at hand, except that of raising taxation, to get over their difficulties. If we were to adopt the present proposal, it would be the inauguration of a principle which would prove disastrous in the present and in the future.",19
73,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Sa y that more slowly, and it will be more effective !",20
74,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I must admit that I feel strongly, because I. regard this proposal as something as near a betrayal of the confidence of the people as I can conceive of.",20
75,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Many honourable members on this side felt strongly when Sir George Turner submitted his proposal!,20
76,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am speaking of the Government- I take care to charge only the Government. The first I heard of this proposal was late on Friday night. I had no suspicion previously; and, had I been asked whether I thought the Government would introduce a loan policy in this Parliament, I should unhesitatingly have replied in the negative. Yet, on the eve of closing Parliament, when we are not in a position to give the matter full consideration, we have introduced a principle of the greatest importance connected with our financial arrangements. Further, it is against the undoubted constitutional practice, in a dying Parliament-and , I hope, with a dying Government-to seek to involve the Commonwealth in a policy on which the people have never been consulted. It is quite possible that .;he Government hope to induce the people to enter on a loan policy, seeing that it is connected with the patriotic purpose of defence, although such a policy has been expressly declared against at two general elections. Even if the Government thought they could induce the majority of the people to defend their action, the more straightforward and constitutional course would have been to hold their hand until the people had been consulted. The Prime Minister cannot say that the defence policy will be endangered if we have to wait until next session; it cannot be successfully contended that this matter is so urgent that it will not wait for confirmation by the electors. As I understood the Minister of Defence, when he outlined the policy of the Government, the principal expenditure-that on the armoured cruiser-wil l not have to be met until two years hence. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did not say that at all. I said it would be two years before the vessel was completed.",20
77,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Exactly . Does the Minister say that the money has to be laid down at once?,20
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,20
79,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"There is no necessity for the whole of the amount to be raised by loan, even if it has to be paid at once. If two years are to be occupied in construction, and we have that period in which to pay, it would not be an extraordinary demand on the part of the Government if they asked for an annual contribution from the people to enable the payments to be made as soon as the vessel was constructed, or a year or two afterwards. After all, we come back to the main point, namely, that the people ought to be consulted before we alter the policy declared for by the people at two different elections. I shall be compelled to vote against the proposal, not because this is money to provide for the defence of Australia, but because it is the inauguration of a loan policy which has been condemned by the people, and which, in my opinion, would be against their wish at the present time. I am surprised that even this Government should so flout the people as to introduce a proposition of this kind, so near the end of the Parliament. I hope that every member who considers his pledges will see that the motion is defeated. In case there is any misunderstanding, I may say that this matter has not even been discussed by myself and my friends; but, seeing that the Labour party are practically all pledged against a loan policy, I feel I am speaking largely, if not wholly, for them. I hope that the Government will be thwarted, and I appeal to honourable members opposite, as much as to honourable members on this side, to give the electors an opportunity to express their opinion before they are committed to a loan policy, which is likely to injure the financial future of the Commonwealth.",20
80,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [3.39] - I regret that the Leader of the Opposition has made the speech he has at this stage of the Government proposal. It would have been fairer had the Governor General's Message been allowed to pass on the voices, and we had an opportunity to examine and discuss the Bill that is bound to follow.",20
81,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member is the champion apologist for the Government !,21
82,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I listened with great patience to the illucid exposition of the Leader of the Opposition and I hope that I shall have the same consideration from honourable members opposite.,21
83,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member shall if he is equally lucid !,21
84,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If I am equally lucid, honourable members opposite can interrupt as much as they like. I feel that all honourable members would view with great concern public borrowing for what we are agreed should be regarded as an insurance proposition, but neither on this side nor on the other have honourable members yet considered the emergent necessities of the Government position. I fhould like to hear the proposal of the Government before being asked to divide on lines of party antagonism in the manner suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. One phrase - used by him seemed to me fo have a peculiar significance. He said, "" These are the dying hours of a dying Parliament, and, I hope, of a dying Government."" I do not share that hope. I hope that the Government will continue to exist; and I hope that such considerations will not be allowed to interfere with our deliberations regarding defences and provision for them. To pay to this great subject the - attention which it needs, we should deal with the message of the Governor General as we have dealt with previous messages, and permit the proposals of the Government to come before us as a Bill before we discuss them.",21
85,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"On the last occasion of the kind, we discussed the proposals of - the Government at this stage.",21
86,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I think that the Minister left it to the Leader of the Opposition to - say at what stage the debate should take place.,21
87,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member is in error.,21
88,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I thought the Opposition - on that occasion signified its desire to debate the question at the message stage. It would be perfectly ludicrous for us now to discuss the merits - or demerits of a loan policy for naval purposes, because we have not before us the proposals of the Government. In - the case referred to, we were acquainted with the text of the Premiers' agreement. I shall vote to allow the Government to place its measure before Parliament, and I hope that honourable members generally will do the same. If they wish to closure debate, either by voting that a Minister be not further heard, or by preventing the introduction of this Bill, I shall be happy - bein g opposed to them-to see them adopt that line of attack.",21
89,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition was closured.,21
90,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not think that any individual honourable member was closured before the Minister of Defence rose to make what should have been the most important speech of the session, though there had been the closuring of a question two days earlier, without any personal significance. If we are to be swayed by revengeful and personal considerations, the sooner we go to the country the better. We owe it to those who sent us here to give an opportunity for - the ventilation of Ministerial proposals, and I hope that my honourable friends will allow the Government to put this measure before the House.",21
91,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,We shall give blow for blow.,21
92,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My honourable friend would meet the rapier of Ministers with a bludgeon. Personally I am only concerned that the people of Australia shall know absolutely what we are doing in regard to defence. If my honourable friends, because of 'memories of the past, and from a desire to obtain possession of the Treasury bench, try to prevent Ministers from placing their views before the country, I shall vote against them, and those who put defence before party will do the same.",21
93,Mr HAL L,Unknown," What we are now considering is a message of His Excellency the Governor General regarding the Naval Loan Bill. That is the order of the day. Can we be said to consider the matter if we give it no consideration? It is absurd for honourable members to say that we know nothing of the proposals of the Government. They are clearly labelled "" Naval Loan Bill . "" If the order of the day does not mean that a loan for naval purposes is to be proposed, I do not understand the English language. What is proposed is evidently to imitate the Mother Country by obtaining a Dreadnouglit and other vessels; I regret that we are not to imitate her by paying for vvhat we get. Instead, we are going to imitate Germany, and other countries which borrow the money expended on naval preparations.",21
94,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does Germany borrow to build her navy?,22
95,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Yes. In Germany, that course has led to a financial crisis and the resignation of a trusted Chancellor. It would not be too much to expect the people of Australia to imitate the people in Great Britain in providing for naval defence out of revenue. Although in Great Britain there are not more than about 40,000,000' persons, about 4,000,000 of them are on the verge of starvation, and many more have very little to tax. Yet Great Britain, in addition to creating and maintaining a fleet twice as large as that ot any two other countries, has within the last seven years paid Â£60,000,000 off her National Debt. We, when faced with the need for naval defence, at once propose to borrow. Honourable members opposite have taken the names of English parties. The honourable member for Parramatta has boasted of being a Liberal. Would a Liberal like Lloyd-George propose to borrow to pay for a Dreadnought} The British Liberals do not borrow for these purposes. They have not shrunk from proposing taxation which is almost revolutionary in its consequences. The Australian Liberals, since the Fusion, at any rate, have no idea of providing for naval defence except by borrowing. Were it necessary for the Commonwealth to borrow, I should like it to be wholly for reproductive works, not to pay for war-ships which, at the end of fifteen or sixteen years, and probably at the end of ten years, would be obsolete.",22
96,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The German newspapers say that their Dreadnoughts are already obsolete.,22
97,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I do not accept that view; but long before we have paid off the proposed debt, and probably before we have made arrangements for paying it off, the vessels in respect to which it is incurred will be obsolete. We shall have had the use of them, and posterity will have to pay for them. A policy of that kind does not require much statesmanship, and the man in the street could propound one just as original. This Government will be remembered, not. only for its extraordinary changes of policy, to enable its individual Ministers to work together, but also as being the first to borrow to meet public expenditure, and the people will realise in time to come that "" He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing.""",22
98,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson> [3-5 l--The Leader of the Opposition took 2 the course which he might have been expected to take, knowing that the proposal before us foreshadows the Government policy. His remarks made it evident that he advocates a policy very different from that of the Government. The naval policy of Great Britain is not so ambitious as that of Australia, seeing that we have a population of only 4,000,000, while her population is over 40,000,000. To enable usto find the money for an Australian Navv, some such scheme as that which the honourable member for Wide Bay sees foreshadowed is necessary. But until a Bill is brought in, and we know definitely what the Government propose, I do not think we should block the measure. In mv opinion this is not the stage which we should make the battle-ground of our fight as to whether the money necessary for naval construction should or should not be obtained by borrowing. We should wait until the Bill has been introduced. I hope that the scheme embodied in the measure will meet with the hearty approval of those sitting on this side. Of course, if it should be a scheme which will lead to waste and ruin, instead of building up art efficient defence, it must be opposed. But the continental European Powers, and even the South American Republics, have schemes by which their people are. fortified against such waste. I take it that it is the policy of this Government to bring forward such a scheme. Anything else would undoubtedly be financial suicide, and lead to ultimate ruin. However, if the Leader of the Opposition intends to make this the battle-ground on which to test the question of whether the naval policy foreshadowed' by the present Government shall be accepted in preference to his own, it will be impossible for us to finish this business at the end of next week. It is the greatest question that we have yet had to deal with this session, and I have been looking forward to it with an immense amount of concern, because our future depends to such a great extent upon what the Government's scheme really is. I think I have read as much about it as most honourable members have. One can read between the lines of the speeches delivered by those who are responsible for the policy of the Government. It will be seen that they have thought the matter out carefully, and are not going to propose a policy of waste, ruin, and financial imbecility. I take it that they have a properly-considered scheme, because it is undoubtedly most bitious on their part to bring forward proposal to build in the beginning Dreadnought, a number of first and third class cruisers, a fleet of submarines, suppose, also of submersibles, which all have to be replaced from time to It is a great and ambitious scheme, I take it that the exposition which we shall naval defence. have when the second reading is moved will be worthy of a great Treasurer. I not think there is much to cavil at at juncture. The Governor General's sage should be respectfully received, no one can object to the speech Leader of the Opposition. It is his business to see that the Government are not reckless, and to put in a word for his at every opportunity. I look forward to tion. the Treasurer's second-reading speech with a good deal of interest, and hope it be delivered soon; but if the matter going to be fought, as the speech Leader of the Opposition would indicate, I fear we shall not get through it this not Sirhere. session. I would much sooner have seen the matter submitted to the electors before it was put before the House, but the rethat? sponsibility rests with the Government, and they are prepared to shoulder always the strong Government that commands the most respect, and the present Government have taken on a very big thing. I hope, 'therefore, that the Treasurer be able to give a good account of himself, and bring forward a scheme that will meet with general approbation. Mr J7RAZER (Kalgoorlie) [3.58] take it that the honourable member for Robertson has not been intentionally to the Leader of the Opposition, but has not thoroughly appreciated that honAustralia, orable member's attitude. The tenor of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition was in opposition to a proposal to borrow money to establish a navy of description - It does not necessarily follow that the honourable member is opposed the establishment of a navy; but he is posed to borrowing money for that pose, and he sought to justify his attitude by giving several opinions dealing with various aspects of naval defence. I would tell the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the Opposition cannot be charged with taking any unfair advantage of them over this Question. not responsible for arranging business-paper or for the fact that frequently when the Treasurer rises in this amHouse to push forward a Bill he has not a got the Bill ready. He always wants to a get a certain stage of a Bill passed before the members of the House are in posand, I session of any facts to justify its being will tabled at all. He wishes now to push fortime. ward a Loan Bill, in order to bring into and existence certain ships for the purposes of Those ships, I believe, will be an asset, but not by any means an do asset which will increase in value, or which this will not depreciate. When we are opposed mesto raising money by means of a loan for but such a purpose, is it not our duty to opof the pose it at every stage?",22
99,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This is the stage that enscheme ables the Treasurer to make an explana,23
100,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It is the stage that will would have given the Treasurer all the is latitude that he required to explain the of the necessity for a Loan Bill. JOHN FORREST - But the Bill was,23
101,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Who is to blame for,23
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We cannot do it. It is things like a steam engine.,23
103,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman might have allowed this notice of motion to stand over until tomorrow, or will until such time as.he obtained copies of the Bill. He seems to think that he can come into this House and say, "" I have not got the Bill, but let it go up to a certain - I stage. I do not want to make a speech today, and I do not want you to make a unfair speech."" Although the right honourable he gentleman happens to be the Treasurer of and, in some circumstances, has whole a majority behind him, he is not going to conduct the, business entirely as he wishes. This is a proposal to plunge the country any into a new financial scheme which was never once mooted to the electors prior to to the last election. I challenge the Prime opMinister or any of his Ministers to say purthat they advocated during the last Federal campaign a proposal to borrow money in order to establish a navy. T challenge them to show where they even indicated to the electors that thevwere going to raise money for the purpose by means of a loan. The Minister of Defence has folWe are lowed the advice of his late leader and the turned a complete somersault cn this question.

104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I never did.,24
105,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member deny that he believed in increasing the subsidy to the Imperial Navy in order to strengthen it , rather than in establishing an Australian Navy ?",24
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is correct that believed in increasing the subsidy, but "" rather than in establishing an Australian Navy.""",24
107,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Did the honourable member propose to do both?,24
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,24
109,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Did he propose to a subsidy of a million pounds to the I m perial Navy and establish an Australian Navy also?,24
110,Mr JOSEPH,Unknown,COOK - The member might make it three or four million pounds while he is at it .,24
111,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"My honourable friend is talking of three or four million pounds now, but he knows that at that particular time members on his side openly stated that the then subsidy of Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to the Imperial Navy was not one-quarter enough for the services that were being rendered. Does he deny that that statement was made at that time from this side of the House?",24
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I said it was not enough. ' Mr Frazer - We will not argue about the amount, but when he was in opposition did the honourable member ever make any statement that would indicate that he favoured the establishment of an Australian Navy in preference to the payment of an increased subsidy?",24

His late leader, the right honourable member for East Sydto raise ney, was one of them. The transformation that has taken place on the Ministerial side of the House on this question during the last few months, has been simply astounding. The Government sent a representative off to London; they had to explain his statements for several weeks after he left, and the honourable member for Robertson used to ask who he was, but I he came back with a scheme, and the Gonot vernment seem to have accepted it .",24
119,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Oh no. We do not know what it is yet.,24
120,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is a lovely admission, seeing that the honourable member voted the other day for the gag, give and also for a motion approving of - the scheme as entered into between the Imperial Government and the self-governing Dominions. honourable Mr HENRY WILLIS - I was not here.",24

122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Misse d again !,24
123,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"But that does not apply to the Minister of Defence. He voted to "" gag "" the scheme through.",24
124,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,What would the honourable member for Robertson have done if he had been here? Mr HEN RY WILLIS - I was very indignant that the matter was disposed of in that way.,24
125,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It is refreshing to know that there is at least a little liberty left on the Ministerial side of the House still.,24
126,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"If the honourable member will let this motion go through, we shall have a chance of learning what the scheme is.",24
127,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member on must remember that I am opposed to the was borrowing of money for the establishment of a Navy. In the prosperous condition this country, in view of the resources available for ta.xation, if more taxation is necessary, and seeing the new service that is going to be rendered to those who own landed estates, and possess the wealth of country, those people are fair subjects for taxation, in order to provide in I am absolutely opposed to any proposal to borrow money a from the Old Country to build ships which vvill be obsolete in a few years' time.

129,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If it is necessary, I am prepared to see that amount of taxation levied upon the people of Australia which will give effective defence. If it is necessary that the amount of money specified in the motion should be raised within two years, then I am in favour of raising it ; but I do not think it is necessary. Only a little while ago, the Minister of Defence did not think it necessary, either.",25
130,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They were all against a loan a few years ago.,25
131,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Every one of them was against it.,25
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This Fleet has to be built in about two years.,25
133,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Of course, the Minister of Defence says "" This is the scheme that has to be accepted."" The Ministerial delegate to the Imperial Naval Conference has approved of it, and notwithstanding that some supporters of the Government professed not to know who he was, the agreement to which he became a party has been accepted. Apparently we are now going to be told, "" If you do not vote for this motion you are opposed to an effective system of defence.""",25
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I raised no such point.,25
135,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then why did the honourable member ask whether I was in favour of Australian defence? If this proposal were not preceded with we should have authority within twelve months to take from the revenues of Australia sufficient to provide for effective defence.,25
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the honourable member proposes tofinanceour naval policy out of the money that now goes to the States? ',25
137,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I would providefirstof all for the necessities of the Commonwealth out of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth. The Minister of Defence seems to be anxious to raise against the Opposition the cry, "" You would rob the States,"" but all that-1 say is that I believe in our meeting the liabilities of the Commonwealth before making a definite payment to the States. I propose now to quote from the Hansard report of the debate which took place on the first Loan Bill submitted to this Parliament.",25
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That was a long way back. - Mr Frazer - I propose to quote from the report of the proceedings of this House on 17th June, 1902. Surely, the surer, who used to say to his constituents, "" I knew your grandfathers,"" does not think that this is very ancient.",25
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is there any harm in my making such a statement?,25
140,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Not the least. Does the right honourable member say that it is wrong for a man to hold today opinions that he held in June, 1902? On the occasion in question Sir George Turner, who was then Treasurer, saidVictoria could not possibly construct out of revenue the works proposed to be undertaken in this State unless additional taxation were imposed. That seems to be a reasonable statement, but the Minister of Defence who was then sitting on this side of the House, saidIs that an absolutely insuperable objection? Are there no resources in Victoria which can be drawn upon for this particular purpose? The honourable gentleman has now adopted a different attitude. The resources of the country which, in ordinary circumstances, would be drawn upon for this purpose, are in the hands of gentlemen who will be the political friends of the Ministry at the next general election, and that is why they do not wish to touch them. They think it far better to raise a loan and let posterity pay for it.",25
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member surely sees the difference between this proposal, and that to which he has just referred.",25
142,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The difference is that the honourable member was then in Opposition, whereas he is now on the Treasury bench.",25
143,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,There is also another important difference.,25
144,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The first Loan Bill was to provide for reproductive works.,25
145,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That is so. It was to provide for necessary reproductive works in Australia.,25
146,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And that is the only possible justification for a loan.,25
147,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I agree with the honourable member.,25
148,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And even then the proposal should be accompanied by one to make provision for a sinking fund.,25
149,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That is an important matter.,25
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There was no justification for a loan at that time.,25
151,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Was the prosperity of Australia in 1902 equal to its prosperity today? Was the tax-bearing capacity of Trea- the people greater then than it is now?,25
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is better now, I believe, thanks to this Government. - Mr Frazer - I am not going to be led away from my argument by such an interjection. I hold that the tax-bearing capacity of the people today is much greater than it was in 1902.",26
153,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,I am very doubtful as to that.,26
154,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am not. The Australian States have already incurred an indebtedness amounting to over Â£250,000,000, the interest on which, amounting to about Â£9,000,000 per annum, has to be made good by the taxpayers. We have six State borrowers who have raised by way of loan Â£50,000,000 since the inauguration of Federation, and the Government propose that the Commonwealth shall enter the market as the seventh Australian borrower. Whilst the States may have been justified in borrowing to provide for great national developmental works, the Commonwealth Government propose to borrow by way of insurance against invasion. They will bring into existence by means of this borrowed money a doubtful asset. It may be blown to pieces at any time, but the liability will remain. That is the worse possible object for which we could borrow.",26
155,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,But we do not know what the scheme is.,26
156,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"We know that the vernment propose t'o raise Â£3,500,000 for naval defence purposes, and when the kind. Bill itself is before us, we shall not have make. an elaboration of the defence policy of the Government.",26
157,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Do not let us have a divitwo sion 'on this motion. Let us take a divithe sion at another stage.,26
158,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am for a division at every stage of this Bill. I am opposed borrowing to provide for the cost of constructing a Navy, and am prepared to vote against such a proposal at any stage. Let me make another quotation from Hansard, wealth necessities. showing how the Minister of Defence if viewed the policy of borrowing Jon 17 th June, 1902.",26
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member for Barrier, who has handed the quotation to the honourable member, seems to sleep on Hansard.",26
160,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member the for Barrier knows the Minister of Defence better than does any other honourable ber. The Minister of Defence said, on that occasionIt is not at all a popular policy-as the Treasurer has discovered before to-dayThe honourable gentleman always keeps his eye on the question ""of popularityto discontinue borrowing and endeavour to bring our expenditure within reasonable dimensions. The old couplet applies to nations equally with individualsThe devil was sick, the devil a monk would be; The devil grew well, the devil a monk was he. We do not think of the consequences of borrowing. How different is the position to day. When the Minister of Defence was on this side of the House, 'he led an attack against a proposal to involve the Commonwealth in a borrowing policy. He was then fighting for the people.",26
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I believed that what I said was perfectly sound. I think so still.,26
162,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable mem- ' ber thinks that it is dangerous to borrow, how can he persuade himself that it is wise for the Commonwealth to borrow for one of the most doubtful of assets ?",26
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Circumstance s alter. For instance, the honourable.member said a few moments ago that he wjould be in favour of the Commonwealth returning to the States only Â£3,500,000 instead of Â£5,000,000 per annum, as was proposed Goat the Brisbane Labour Conference.",26
164,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I said nothing of the That is an unfair statement to,26

181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that under no circumstances is borrowing justified?,28
182,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"There is no more acute interjector than the honourable gentleman; and I shall reply to him at a proper time. From 1902 until now it has been laid to the credit of the Commonwealth that, in the exercise of its powers, it has lived upon its revenue. The honourable member for Robertson made an appeal, which, for a time, had an effect upon me. He pointed out that to resist this message was a needless insult to the Government of the day, seeing that the struggle should really lake place on the second reading of the Bill. Whether or not that would be a diplomatic suggestion to follow, I do not know; but I am invited by this message to do a certain thing, and that invitation I have to accept or refuse. I have listened carefully to honourable members who have already spoken, and I must say that I think they introduced a good deal of party warfare into the discussion. Whether my time here be long or short, I think I can at least claim that I have always endeavoured to indicate, without pretence or qualification, how I intended to vote. If I appear to constantly differ from the opinions of others, that may be regarded as my mental attitude; but, in what I do, I believe I am preserving the rights of those who sent me here. My desire is to show that the masses Of the community will not be well served by entering upon a loan policy for the purpose of naval expenditure. By this motion I am invited to say that it is expedient that an appropriation be made for a Bill which will authorize the raising of Â£3,500,000 by loan for the purpose of naval defence. I do not deem it expedient that such an appropriation should ""be made; and I may as well resist the proposal now as later on. If there are degrees of justification for borrowing, there was greater justification ln 1902 than there is in 1909. Sir George Turner, as Treasurer, asked for a loan authorization on the grounds that certain reproductive and developmental works in the Postal and other Departments could not otherwise be carried out; and it must be remembered that the Treasurer at that time was restricted in revenue to 5s. in the Â£ 1 , whereas the amount available now is, or will be in the near future, ios. in the Â£ 1 .

188,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Quite so; the skies were gloomy and the outlook was dark, the revenue from Customs and Excise being on the decline. In fact, I remember the present Minister of Home Affairs pleading foi a remission of the fodder duties; and his plea was rejected for the reason, amongst others, that there was a shortage of revenue. A little while ago the Minister of Defence asked me whether I could conceive of no occasion on which a loan may be justifiable. There are times when, for purely developmental work, a loan is justified, but only when the Treasury is in a more depleted condition than the forecast now shows it is likely to be for some years to come. With the growth of population anticipated by the Prime Minister under the policy which he and the Premiers have inaugurated, any shortage in the revenue will be made up in the near future. The object of the proposed loan is naval expenditure, and it has been intimated that we are to borrow Â£3,500,000. If that was to be all, if there would be no succeeding loans, the position would not be serious; but the Minister of Defence has told us that the proposed expenditure is only for an instalment of the navy. He, or his successors, will be compelled to go further. What we do now will not stand for all time.",28
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In one year we paid to the States Â£880,000 out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. We should be in a better position to do without borrowing then than now.",28
190,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If we had not returned to the States anything over the three-fourths to which they were entitled, we should today have Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000 to our credit.",29
191,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is it not our duty to defend the people of the States ?,29
192,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I shall come to that matter directly. The money returned to the States over and above their three-fourths would, had it been retained and saved by the Commonwealth, have enabled us to pay for a navy without borrowing. The States haye received millions more than they were entitled to. But there has been no admission of that fact from their Premiers and Treasurers. As I have said, this will not be the only loan. It is now proposed to establish borrowing as our policy in connection with naval construction, a proposition so serious that I agree with honourable members opposite that the matter should be referred to the electors. This loan must be followed by others, if the navy is to be kept efficient. The expenditure of Â£3>5Â°Â°>ooo will not do more than maintain the present auxiliary squadron. not do away with the need for British assistance. There will be the British navy plus what we provide. Honourable members who resist the proposal are resisting more than a proposal to borrow ^3,500,000; they are resisting the introduction of a borrowing policy which is far-reaching in its character. Whatever Ministry may be in power in the future will be bound by our action in this matter. All future Governments will be tied by the financial agreement, and bound by any policy that we may lay down now for defence purposes. From whatever party any future Ministry may be chosen, the policy adopted now must be continued, and further borrowing undertaken.",29
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that the whole of the capital expenditure on defence must be borrowed ?,29
194,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No man more greatly desires effective naval defence than I do. I think that the bulk of our expenditure on defence should be in connection with the navy. Our insular situation will require us to maintain a strong navy. The proposed' unit will not be sufficient for all time. This or some future Ministry will have to strengthen and develop it. For that, money will be necessary, so that in the future we shall have further .borrowing Should we today endorse the Government's proposal to borrow for naval expenditure, we shall endorse a loan policy for all time. I have a few words to say as to the equity of that. In my opinion, it is unjust to ask the Commonwealth to borrow for purposes of defence. If there is one thing for which borrowing is not right, it is defence. Money spent on defence is spent for the purposes of today, and should be provided by the people of today. I suppose that the Minister will not propose to borrow for the upkeep of the navy. He will surely provide for that out of revenue ? The Commonwealth's main source of revenue is Customs and Excise taxation, which falls chiefly on the masses of the community, in taxes on their food supplies, wearing apparel, and other necessaries. Direct taxation of any kind has not been suggested. Apparently the money required for the upkeep of the navy will have to be found by the masses, while it is by the masses that the manning of the vessels will be done. Should we borrow, the interest charges will be met.out of current revenue, and will thus also be paid It will by the masses. #",29
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There will be interest and a heavy sinking fund to be provided for.,29
196,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We come of a race which does not repudiate its debts. Therefore we shall have fo repay what we borrow, but as revenue does not fall from heaven like rain, and as practically our Only source is Customs and Excise taxation, it means that the people will have to bear the burden of these payments. The proposed expenditure has been referred to as a form of insurance. But we are insuring, not only the interests of the people at large, but also the wealth and property of the community, and those who own that wealth and property are not asked to contribute specially towards its defence. Our propertied classes vvill not be laid under contribution for the upkeep and maintenance of our defence policy. It is astounding that the masses should be asked to provide for an effective defence scheme. We certainly require effective naval defence, but we should provide for it by means of ""taxation of an equitable character. We know that some of the party newspaper organs will make it appear that those who vote against the Government's proposal do so because they are opposed to the provision of naval defence. This may frighten some, but I hope that others will be prepared to fight the matter out on the platform. Money should not be borrowed to provide for naval defence. The Minister of Defence has indicated that a sinking fund is to be provided. He desires to gild the pill.",29
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is simply an honest provision for the repayment of the loan.,30
198,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Dalley would be the last to oppose anything of that sort. He does not object to the repayment of debts. British communities have never repudiated liabilities of this kind. But I would remind the Minister of the experience of New South Wales and Western Australia in regard to sinking funds. Some years back, when New South Wales had a heavy deficit, it established a sinking fund into which payments were made for several years, but, after a time, Governments neglected to comply with the law in that respect, and Sir William MCMillan took possession of the money at the credit of this fund for the purpose of the Government of which he was then Treasurer. The experience in Western Australia was the same. A sinking fund was started, but, when I was over there, the Ministry of the day were struggling to abolish it.",30
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That was for future loans, not for existing loans.",30
200,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"At any rate, the Government wanted to get rid of the sinking fund. A sinking fund is all right if it is carried out properly, but after a few years it is disregarded, and the first Ministry that get themselves into a financial corner forget all about it,, or evade it. I am asked now whether I am in favour of a loan policy for the navy. I distinctly say "" no.'' I should vote against the Bill on the second reading, but why should I wait until the second reading is moved ? This message conveys a straight out invitation, and I have to give a straight out answer to it. Of all things that Australia should not borrow for. defence is the most prominent. I am asked what sources of revenue can be tapped for the purpose. On many occasions during the last nine years it has been my pleasure to indicate that direct taxation is the source from which revenue for defence purposes should be obtained. That is a just and fair course. Great Britain to her honour and credit does nought ? not build her navy out of loan. Germanv does, and Germany is loading herself with of a fizzle. a debt which will saddle posterity with an almost insupportable burden of interest charges. Great Britain builds her 'navy out of current revenue, and her Liberal party is now engaged in a fight, on which they will be appealing to the people directly on the question of the just and proper incidence of taxation. Mr ""WISE - Is not Canada proposing to provide her defence in the same way?",30
201,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland is quite correct. To adopt a loan policy for defence purposes is an ancient way of doing things. We have, already a public debt of Â£.25o',ooo,ooo, a lot of which I admit has been borrowed for the development of Australia, and so has been for the good of Australia. T do not often agree with the right honourable member for Swan, but when he was Premier of Western Australia he took the only course open to him and: did the correct thing by his broad policy of borrowing for local development. He did well for Western Australia then, but there is an immense difference between borrowing for reproductive works and protecting the loan by means of a sinking fund, and borrowing to construct a navy which becomes obsolete within ten years, especially when we know that once we start to build a navy it will mean an expenditure of not only three and a half million pounds, but many million pounds more as the years go by. We do not start a navy for the purpose of dropping it when it is worn out. The proper ideal of an Australian navy is one which will be kept efficient and strengthened, so that in years to come we may have a fleet which is honestly"" effective and powerful enough to protect our shores. If this proposal is adopted it means the inception of a borrowing policy to build not only the navy of today but the rtaw of the future. I am opposed to that. If I am asked what people should pay for it, I say, ""The people of today."" If I am further asked, "" What source is the money to come from?"" I reply, "" If the Customs and Excise revenue supplies the cost of upkeep and the expenditure on our land forces, surely the least that this Parliament can do is to ask the wealthy people of Australia, to pay a direct tax, with which to purchase a navy.""",30
202,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Did they not nearly subscribe the money voluntarily for a Dread,30
203,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No , that fund was a bit",30
204,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,About tenpence in the was paid up.,31
205,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member rivers. for Yarra ridicules the amount subscribed, but it was a bad policy to ask the people of Australia to provide defence by tary subscription.",31
206,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Not a single penny was given in Victoria.,31
207,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Perhaps the Victorian people could not afford it, but we should dead. not send round a subscription list for a navy, like a collection for a church. It is General. a matter of policy, and that policy should be of a direct character. The wealthy should pay their fair and just share towith wards the cost of a navy. I do not them to pay any more, but if the navy purchased by means of a loan they will allowed to escape their responsibility, cause the interest on the loan will be met, not by them, but by the masses of Ausvote tralia out of the Customs and Excise which they pay. It will be only an couragement to retain high revenue duties. I said years ago that I would resist the ception ot a loan policy, and that the of defence should be levied by means of Federal income tax, a copy of the British income tax, which is levied distinctly for war purposts. In time of war or financial necessity it is increased, but in time lessening expenditure it is reduced.' system could be followed in Australia. are often told to be obedient imitators the Motherland, and in this matter we a borrowing system. could not imitate her too closely. ought to take the bold step of saying the wealthy and propertied classes, "" An income tax for defence purposes is required of you."" When the demand is strong, the screw on; when it is not so strong, the screw off, as they do in Great Britain.",31
208,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,It is very hard get it off.,31
209,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The income tax is duced at times in Gieat Britain. Even if it were not reduced here, the wealthy would not feel the screw half so badly as would the people who paid the monev through Customs and Excise duties. am absolutely adverse to the Government proposal in this matter. It may be due my want of perception, or my lack of ability to see things in their true perspecit? tive, but I cannot understand how the ister of Defence, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Attorney-General, who 1902 were such stout ODponents of loan policy, can today ask the House Â£ adopt it, especially for naval purposes. Statesmen, we know, are like navigable They make bends and concessions to get round their turns, and, as Lowell once said, "" Only the dead and volunthe ignorant never change."". Therefore, I suppose that on this question of a loan policy, as between 1902 and 1909, I am dead or ignorant, and those three honourable gentlemen are neither ignorant nor",31
210,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And the Postmaster,31
211,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I do not want to bring him into the question. I have no concern him politically, but I was associated ask with .the Minister of Defence and the is Minister of Home Affairs for years, not be only in this House, but in New South beWales. Apparently they see no inconsistency in their conduct, but if I were to for a loan policy for naval defence, duties and allow the wealthy and propertied enclasses' to escape their fair share of the cost, I should not be doing a fair thing infor the working classes and the masses of cost Australia. With the Commonwealth in its a present position, with Customs and Excise as its only source of revenue, it is criminal to introduce a loan policy, which will have to be followed up by loan after loan. If of only one loan were necessary the position That might be met, but this is the beginning We of a policy which will plunge the of people of Australia for all time into The question has We never to my knowledge been pu<- before to the electors. To those who say that members on' this side are breaking their pledges. I reply that I am not aware that they have put made any. I do not know whether antitake borrowing is still in the platform of the Labour party or not, but I myself have to never mentioned it on the platform. I vvill, however, take to the electors reat the next election no issue with greater pleasure and greater earnestness than this one. I could not conceive of a better cause, even if I were defeated at the polT, than that of fighting I upon the platforms of New South Wales against the initiation of a loan policy to to meet naval expenditure, whilst allowing the wealth and property of Australia to escape fair share of taxation. The loan policy Minrejected in 15)02 did stand to some extent for the people's good. It could be claimed in for it that it was to develop Australia, a and to improve and build up certain into dustries, requirements, and agencies from which the people could expect a return. It was resisted, but the resistance offered on that occasion ought to be as nothing compared with the resistance offered now to the inauguration of a loan policy for naval defence. And how will Australia, appear before the outside world? We are now stepping into nationhood and national life. A few years ago we were an honoured dependency of Great Britain. We were the youngest daughter of the British Empire, and glad to be associated with the Motherland, which looked after our protection ; but in a strong, and sometimes in a flaunting manner, we said that we intended to take the first step towards nationhood on our own account. We took it, but are we to take it like a nation of robust and strong men, or are we to take it as paupers and mendicants, going to the Motherland for a loan for the purposes of defence ?",31
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Nonsense . the honourable member think there is no money in this country ?,32
213,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We have money here, but will the loan be floated here or on the London market? If the money is in this country why borrow it and pay interest on it for the purpose of protecting the very people who lend it to us ? The Treasurer's interjection involves a state of affairs worse than the original position. If we have to go to the Australian edition of Isaac Cohen and Company to borrow three and a-half million pounds, the people of Australia will have to pay interest to Isaac Cohen, to protect whom ?-to protect themselves, and Isaac Cohen also. For a young nation like this, which has rightly determined to put all its young men under arms for its own defence, to determine to borrow money tofinanceits defence policy is not in accord with my idea of what is fitting. If we want to relieve the Motherland, we shall not do it by going to the money lenders of Great Britain. They are not known for their patriotism, or love of national life. They will lend to any country if the bonds are good enough. > bitterest opponent that England ever had. They would lend tomorrow to Russia or France, and they will even lend on the TOtten bonds of Turkey in order to get a - certain amount by way of interest. I as an Australian citizen and native do not care for feeding the maw of the money lending class of Great Britain, but I do - care about relieving the Mother Country of the responsibility of defending the Aus[235] tralian nation. All I ask is that the wealthy and propertied classes of Australia shall take their fair share of the burden. I do not want them to meet all the expenditure of the Government. To-day the only way in which the Commonwealth taxes the wealthy is by means of Customs and Excise, but under that heading every one is in the one category, with the exception that the wealthy may pay a. little more on alcoholic liquors and stimulants. But the average of Â£ 2 ios. per head stands, and the head of a working-class family of six pays Â£ 1 5 per year in Customs and Excise duties. He also gives his sons to the military forces, and will give them to the navy. He will provide for the upkeep of the navy, and now we are asked to adopt a loan policy and to let him also bear the interest charges on the loans. It is a monstrous proposal. I say "" Pay the charge out of current revenue."" If we have not sufficient money Does available for the purpose, we should say to the States to whom we are returning so freely 25s. per annum, "" Here is an honest charge for the protection of the States as an integral part of the Commonwealth. This money is required to provide not only for the protection of the people, but for the protection of the property in each State, and we ask you to make a special grant for the purpose."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - We should say to them, "" You do the borrowing.""",32
214,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I do not say that. What harm can there be in imposing direct taxation? The battle will have to be fought at the next general election, and I suppose that I shall be found fighting as strongly as any one against this loan policy. At the same time, there will be a Labour man in my electorate fighting me, and also declaring himself in opposition to such a policy. I shall receive from the well-to-do in my electorate no credit for my attitude. They will not vote for me. I do not expect them to do so, but I shall know that I am acting wisely, and I trust that those who join with me in resisting the introducThey will lend to the tion of a loan policy for the Commonwealth will be successful. We must fight in the interests of our children. We must see that they are not called upon to carry this unjust burden. In their ordinary walks of Mfe they will have quite sufficient to pay by way of Customs and Excise taxation, without being called upon to bear these additional charges. I would remind honourable members of the battle for freedom which is being fought by Lloyd George, who comes from the country of my ancestors. What cares he for the "" snobocracy "" or the wealthy classes of Great Britain? He says, "" I am fighting those who are . drawn from the ranks of the unemployed."" ' That was his reference to the House of Lords, and no better phrase was ever coined in respect of the personnel of that Chamber. He was born in the purple and has lived in the purple, 'but he talked to the purple as the purple ought to be talked to. The principle of noblesse oblige prevails today with the true aristocrats of Great Britain, as I hope it prevails with the aristocrats of Australia. They do not wish to escape their rightful burdens. They are prepared to carry their proper share of the cost of defence, and the Government are taking up a miserable position in proposing a loan policy for naval defence- a policy which means placing an extra charge upon the poor, while the wealthy are allowed to escape. I do not know whether or not the Government intend to submit direct taxation proposals. If they do, I should be glad to see them submit them now. I am compelled to take this stand at the present stage, because I feel that if I voted for this motion merely for the sake of conveniencing the Government, they would be justified in expecting me to vote for the second reading of the Bill. I put my position to them frankly and honourably. I refuse their invitation to vote for this motion for the reason that by voting for this motion I should really endorse a policy of which I do not approve. To my mind, the policy is a most dangerous one, and I know of nothing that I shall have greater pleasure in opposing on the public platforms in my electorate than this proposition to inaugurate, a loan policy for naval purposes.",32
215,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [5.15] - Al though my attitude may . be misunderstood, I sincerely and honestly regret, from a national stand-point, that the Ministry should have introduced a loan policy for naval purposes. From a party stand-point, I am certainly glad, because there is no question on which I should rather go to the people than that of a non-borrowing policy; but from a national stand-point, I honestly regret the course that is now being taken by the Government. Those who were members of the first Parliament find some occasion for surprise when they compare the attitude of certain honourable members today with the stand which they took up when the first Loan Bill was submitted in this House in 1902."" There has .been a lively controversy in Australia on the question of whether or not the Commonwealth should borrow for any purpose. There is something to be said for the policy of raising money by loans to provide for reproductive works, although personally I am opposed to such a policy. It may be open to question whether money should not be borrowed for works which will yield sufficient to pay interest on the cost of construction and provide for a sinking fund; but I have never heard any one on a public platform in Australia approve of the policy of borrowing money for military or naval purposes. When the Minister of Defence moved the second reading of the Defence Bill he stated that the great object of that measure was to secure efficiency, and he concluded by saying that he proposed to ask Parliament to vote Â£1,000,000, which he anticipated would be sufficient to provide for an effective defence force. I said at the time by way of interjection that it would be cheap at the price, and I do not ""hesitate to say now that if we could secure an efficient naval and military defence system for Â£10,000,000 it would be cheap. It must be recognised that the Defence Department is the most difficult of all in which to secure efficiency, and that we are more likely to obtain it when the cost of the service is provided out of revenue than we should be if it were provided out of loan money. So soon as a loan policy is initiated even in connection with the construction of reproductive works, there sets in a certain measure of extravagance, and I am convinced that if we launched upon a policy of borrowing for naval and military purposes we could safely say "" Good-bye "" to anything in the way of efficiency. So far as I am aware, it has never been contended in Australia that we should borrow for avowedly non-productive purposes. When we. find that certain honourable members a few years ago declared their opposition to a proposal to borrow to provide for reproductive works, I think we may safely assume that their opposition would have been much stronger had the proposal been one to raise money to provide for unproductive undertakings. . When the Loan Bill of 1902 was before this House the honourable member for Bourke, who is now the Government Whip, saidThere must be some limit, and I believe that, like the South American and North American States, we have reached the limit of our borrowing powers, and the sooner we realise our position the better it will be for us. We ought toderive a lesson from our experiences during the boom period. By a system of excessive borrowing, we induced people to suppose that they would become rich, not by production, but by a system of exchange. That was wrong, for we have been told on the best authority that quite one-third of our population were living upon the result of public borrowing. We can only be truly solvent when our population lives on the results of their own efforts in production, and when we cease to borrow year after year in order to pay the interest upon our loans, and, in some cases, even the principal, and for the purpose of carrying out works which are wrongly called reproductive. I do not think that any one will say that a loan for naval and defence purposes will be reproductive. The Minister of Defence, who was then on this side of the House, also had something to say with regard to the Loan Bill, and I propose to put before honourable members a quotation from a speech made by him, giving one reason why he objected to a loan policyI should not have so much hesitation in voting for the Government proposals if I could see the slightest intention to economize on the part of the States. But New South Wales continues to borrow at an alarming rate. The simple question which I put to myself is- "" Ought I to pile up the Commonwealth indebtedness, concurrently with the piling up of State obligations?"" I have come to the conclusion that I ought not to do so, particularly in regard to the State which I represent, where there is a huge surplus of revenue which ought to be drawn upon for the construction of necessary public works. It is possible that the States in the interval have learnt to economize.",33
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They certainly have as compared with that period. If I recollect rightly the O'Sullivan boom was then on in New South Wales.,34
217,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It is an open question whether Mr O'Sullivan spent more borrowed money than did other Ministers, but if at that time the Minster of Defence objected to the Commonwealth borrowing for reproductive purposes because the States were not economizing, he would be_ consistent in saying now, if the States are economizing, that that objection has been removed. He could advocate now what he was not prepared to advocate then. We may be wrong in our suspicion; but there are some of us who feel that the honourable member for Parramatta, if he were on this side of the House, and the Government introduced a loan policy for military and naval purposes; would be its strong opponent. The Postmaster-General seems to have held very sound opinions a few years ago, because, on the question of borrowing, he saidWe are asked where we are to obtain the money; but, in reply to that question I ask, [2351- 2 "" Where is the borrowing for such purposes as are now indicated to cease ?"" We on this side have a perfect right to ask where the policy is going to end, if once we start to borrow for military and naval purposes ? The honourable member for Bendigo on that occasion quoted some figures.",34
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,This is good sport for the honourable member-to quote the Postmaster-General!,34
219,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Why better sport to me than to anybody else? I presume that when representatives state their opinions in this House, those opinions are honest? Does the right honourable gentleman object to have his honest opinions quoted ?",34
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not.,34
221,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does anybody else?,34
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not know.,34
223,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the right honourable member more honest than anybody else?,34
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not say so.,34
225,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That could almost be inferred. While the right honourable member would not object to have his opinions quoted, he thinks that other people svould object to have theirs quoted.",34
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not.,34
227,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then why did the right honourable member interject?,34
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Because the honourable member is always talking about the Post and Telegraph Department-h e seems, to pick it our specially.",34
229,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Surely I am doingnothing wrong in quoting from Hansard. The present Postmaster-General, referringto a statement issued by some society, whichshowed the indebtedness of Victoria, saidVictoria is indebted to the extent of ^96 per adult of her population] Tasmania, ^98; New South Wales, ^ioo; Western Australia, -Â£u$;. Queensland, ,^141; and South Australia, Â£142. In any case, the figures show that there isalready a very big loan bill against Australia, and it ought to make us pause before we launch merrily into any further borrowing. If works of the character indicated in the papers before us. could be constructed out of revenue or out of savings, or by means of levying a little extra taxation, the people of Australia would gladly acquiesce. In my opinion, the people of Australia are prepared to tax themselves in order to defend themselves-if we are not, we are not worthy of the heritage we possess. I shall not hesitate to vote against this motion. Some may think that if they vote against it, they will be open to the taunt that they are not prepared to provide proper naval and military defence for Australia. I shall - run that risk unhesitatingly, because I . think that, from the very stait, we should oppose borrowing for this purpose.

Some honourable members then voted against a loan are Fusionist candidates today. The ex-member for Mr Conroy, is a candidate for a another seat, and no doubt will.be pleased to have to advocate a loan policy against the present member for Macquarie. With the honourable member for the Barrier, I can say that the Government could not have done anything better for the Labour party right than introduce this proposal.",35

Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Dalley has said, I think that nearly every member in the Houpe has at some time or other laid stress on the fact that this is a non-borrowing Parliament-that it has not followed the bad example of the States. At the last election 1, for one, said that I had opposed, and would always oppose, a borrowing policy, except in a case of grave national emergency.",35

259,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have never said that.,36
260,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,What does the honourable member think a land tax would bring in?,36
261,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"You , Mr Temporary Chairman, would not allow me to discuss that question. Some of the States have not even made valuations for taxation purposes. Ft is strange that this proposal should be sprung upon us within ten days of the close of the session. It is certain that we shall not continue our sittings beyond the end of next week. agree to the Government proposal, it will be impossible for the succeeding Government to go back on it, should the electors displace this Administration with another. I desire to keep the slate clean. The electors could be asked whether defence should be paid for out of revenue or byloan. Some honourable members have in the past suggested that money might advantageously be borrowed for reproductive works, such as railways ancl irrigation schemes ; but a navy is not a reproductive work. To borrow for the purposes of defence would make us the laughing stock of other nations. In discussing an earlier loan proposal, the honourable member for Bourke made a very long speech, which I shall not quote. The Prime Minister, who was at the time Attorney-General, and acting Prime Minister, said that the GoI vernment contended that its policy was justified by consideration for the position the States, but the honourable member Which is the more noble policy-for the Goto intervene with a loan, or for the States to levy taxation to make good their depresent Attorney-General said on that occasionFor the last five or six years there were several of us who, in the local Parliament, were determined to put a stop to the borrowing which has beeu too frequently resorted to during the last fifteen 01 twenty years. It remains for us now to be somewhat consisteht with the policy to which we gave expression in the local' Legislature. He wound up with these wordsI ask honourable members once and for all to put their foot down and say- "" Unless the loan is one that is needed for conserving our finances or debts, or cannot possibly be avoided, we decline in the very first session of the Federal Parliament to set an example against which we have all been crying out in the States for Ihe last five or ten years."" I ask the honourable member to put down his foot now, to declare' once and for all that there shall be no borrowing by the Commonwealth. What would he say, vvere he now in Opposition, to this proposal to borrow Â£3,500,000 'to create a naval unit which will be obsolete within ten years. Should an accident happen,"" we may lose these vessels, and, with them, our asset, while the loan will still remain.",36
262,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"At the time to which the honourable member refers^ there was a surplus of Â£888,000. and* it was proposed to borrow Â£571,000 for petty items. If we Mr TUDOR - There was not a surplus in all the States.",36
263,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Ne w South Wales had a surplus of Â£1,300,000, and it was proposed to borrow Â£221,000 to be expended on her account.",36
264,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In that year Queensland did not receive her three-fourths, but was in debit Â£20,188. The trouble was that we could not construct works in one State with borrowed money, and in another State out of revenue.",36
265,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Many of the items for which it was proposed to borrow were petty. There was an amount of Â£5,000 for a new telephone switchboard.",36
266,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The present Prime Minister, in defending the loan proposals tc which I am referring, said that to borrow was the best thing that the Commonwealth could do. The Minister of Defence, who was as fond of interjecting then as he is now, saidThe_honorable gentleman advises us to to this without prejudice. To that the Prime Minister repliedNo. For five, or possibly for ten years, shall be called upon to regard the interests of our constituents, not merely as members of Commonwealth, but as citizens of their respecPerth, tive Stales, and in connection with the latter capacity, we shall be bound to consider the dition of, the State Treasuries, and to consult State policies. When the Commonwealth attained its majority in matters of finance, obligation, will be no longer imposed upon The citizens of Australia will then be treated alike, without distinction of State, in our financial administration. But we anticipate events we at once cast that full responsibility upon the' State Governments,' and shape our policy without regard to their difficulties, particularly a time of depression like the present.",37
267,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Is to borrow on loan to anticipate the true Federal policy?,37
268,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is, to my mind, contrary to what will be the true Federal policy we shall have shaken off the obligations of the present intervening period and have obtained full command of our resources. We have yet an opportunity to obtain full command of our resources, though honorfollow able members opposite desire to give it away. I am glad that I looked up the report of the debate, because it shows the Prime Minister was then opposed policy such as that which he fathered few week's ago. The present Minister Defence denounced the policv of borrowthe ing, saying that the more honest course would have been to refrain from borrowing altogether. I understand that the Attorneyhad General is still opposed to borrowing.",37
269,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I believe in the general principles stated in my speech.,37
270,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The other night the spoken honourable gentleman voted against his colleague's proposal regarding the Western taken up. Australian electoral redistribution, and I hope he wiil act similarly to-night. honourable members opposite were given free hand, they would vote against the Government proposals. Mr Justice Higgins, who was a member of the House time, said that the argument of the sent Prime Minister was very nice and pleasant, as usual, but really came this, "" Borrowing is a very bad thing. Let us do it now, and possibly not do it again."" As usual, the Prime Minister was very nice and pleasant, but he advised the House to do what he .said ought not to be done. None of those who voted against the first borrowing proposals lost their seats on that account, though some were displaced by Labour members who were also opposed to borrowing. Fifteen of the sixagree teen members of the Labour party of the day voted against the proposal, including the leader of the party. Others who voted we against it were the present Minister of Dethe fence, the honourable members for Corio and the present Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, Speaker, and the Minister conof Home Affairs, and the right honourable has member for East Sydney. The honourable this member for Maribyrnong paired against us. it. Should these honourable members vote again in accordance with their convictions, if the Government will not have a majority.",37
271,Mr WISE,Unknown,The honourable member at ought not to expect them to do that. They have not hitherto been allowed to do it.,37
272,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know that; but as we are getting near the time of the election some of them will not want to pile up when a. bigger burden than they will be able to carry. Men who throughout their political, careers have opposed borrowing except for reproductive works are going now, if they the Government as they have done in many divisions this session, to vote for a loan of Â£3,500,000 for a naval defence that policy which no member in this House to a knows anything about. The Minister bf a Defence rose to make his speech on the of subject the other day, and I voted against application of the closure to him; but honourable members' opposite must remember that many honourable members on this side suffered in the same way, and thought they would give the Ministry a taste of their own physic. I do not forget that on the third reading of the Finance Bill only one member of the Opposition had",37
273,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The whole day was,37
274,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member If is wrong. The member of the Opposition a to whom I refer occupied only one hour.,37

I have not yet voted for to applying the closure to any one. I do not say that the majority should not rule, the minority have rights, and I trust that the minority on this proposal vvill show they intend to stand up for those rights debate the question thoroughly. It is of the biggest proposals ever submitted this Parliament, and the people should told that the Government want to bring the Commonwealth into the field as seventh borrower for Australia, to compete with the six there already. The Treasurer interjected when the honourable member Dalley was speaking to the effect that was not necessary to borrow in England abroad. He said, "" Let us borrow in this country.""",37
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not say that.,38
277,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The right honourable member said there was plenty of money this country.,38
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member for Dalley was talking about going to the Mother Land, and I said there ,money here.",38
279,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the Treasurer is fortunate enough to get this proposal through, I trust that he will borrow locally, and not hurry abroad for the money.",38
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I made no statement bn that point.,38
281,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Treasurer is too cunning to admit that the Government not intend to borrow here, but his own mission is that there is plenty of money this country if we like to use it. I with the honourable member for Dalley the votes of all those who are opposed the proposal should be cast against it every stage, not only on the motion for leave to introduce, but on the second ing, and right through Committee. I shall do my best to see that the Bill is blocked, in order that the people may have an opporAustralian tunity of saying at the elections whether they favour the Commonwealth becoming a seventh borrower in addition to the six already in existence.",38
282,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [S-S9]-- I expected that the present vernment would, at some stage in this Pardo liament, bring down a Bill for permission to.borrow money, but I hardly thought it would take this shape. We were advised early in ""the session with regard to amounts that would have to be secured square the ledger, and the Treasurer that short-dated bonds would be issued, we see now that that was simply the shadow before the substance came into view. have now learned what the Government velop but really intend to do, and I should like to show the House the possibilities of their in that tentions within the next ten years, once they and make a start. I will point out what the one Government have undertaken, and what they to have promised to do, for I suppose they be will keep their promises. It may be said that they never intended to keep them, but a they have passed certain Bills through the House, and I take it that they mean to give effect to them. I recognise that the for Â£3,500,000 now asked for is not wanted it immediately. I do not suppose that there or will be a cent of it spent for two years.",38
283,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Nonsense ; of course there will.,38
284,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Some of it may be spent; but my opinion is that the operation in will be protracted. It is evident, however, that during the next ten years large sums of money will have to be found, and, if the Government follow out their present was practice of not making those who benefit most pay taxation, they will borrow. unThe Government have given us no hint or suggestion as to how they intend to raise money in the future, although they have depleted the revenues of the Commonwealth. If this Government, or those of the same kidney, remain in power for the next ten years, and carry out their obligado tions so far as the Northern Territory is adconcerned, they will have to take over an in indebtedness of Â£3,250,000 incurred by agree the South Australian Government on the that Territory. They will have to pay the into terest on that money, and become responat sible for the debt itself. There is another Â£2,000,000 already borrowed for the railreadway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. If we take over the Territory, we must also take over that indebtedness from the South Government. Then there is the projected railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, which the House has agreed to construct. That will cost, at .the very least, another Â£5,000,000; and we know that the Government will make no attempt to Goraise that sum by means of taxation; nor I know that it would be advisable to do so. If that Bill is passed in another place, and the Territory is taken over, the agreement will have to be carried out, and the certain railway will have to be built, beto cause it was on that point that the fold us question of the acquisition of the but Territory was fought in this Chamber. Then, having acquired the TerWe ritory, the .Commonwealth must deit, or it will be useless to take it ; over. South Australia has spent up to the present Â£3,250,000 upon its development, with very little to show for it. We must develop the Territory, and that will cost another Â£5,000,000 in the next ten years; and if the Tanami field and the Roper River country are to be opened up, it' be necessary to expend still more on railassisted way construction. Again, there is the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway, which will cost another Â£5,000,000. Treasurer intends that something shall be done in that direction during the next ten years ?",38
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It will not cost Â£5,000,000. It is estimated to cost less than Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",39
286,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Does the Treasurer mean to say that that line can be built for under Â£5,000,000 ? Does he not, as a presentative of Western Australia, wish see it undertaken during the next ten years",39
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Certainly .,39
288,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Then I can add Western another Â£5,000,000 to the list. We have passed a Bill enabling the Commonwealth to take over the Federal Territory from New South Wales, and build the Capital Surely that is to be attempted there. during the next ten j'ears. If it is not, I. can imagine what the "" Ma State "" will say. Judging by the fight the representavoting tives of that State have put up inside outside this House to have the matter settled, they surely intend to have some sort of a city there during the next years. Another Â£5,000,000 will have be borrowed for that purpose. We talk millions nowadays; but I suppose this list vernment of borrowings must come to an end some loan of Â£3,500,000 would time.",39
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I heard the wail for ten years in Western Australia.,39
290,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I know what the Treasurer would do if he had the power. they obtained it. If he could make himself the Dictator Australia, and thought it was demanded warranted, he would think nothing of launching a loan of Â£50,000,000 or Â£100,000,000.",39
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I should not stick in the mud like the honourable member would do.,39
292,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The Treasurer they would throw the onus of paying the money on the great masses of the people, instead of on those who benefited most from it. There - is' no doubt that he .would borrow"" the money, and raise the interest by hook or by crook from the masses, and not from those who could best afford to pay it.",39
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The great masses of the people are better off under my plan than under that of the honourable member.,39
294,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I have grave doubts will about it. The right honourable gentleman the development of Western Australia, but he did it under favourable and unique circumstances, with the earth yieldSurely the ing gold to pay for it.",39
295,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,He did it very successfully.,39
296,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I admit if, and we might do the same here if we could discover a few more Coolgardies and Kalgoorlies; but they do not grow like plums on a tree. If we could look forward with any certainty to that sort of thing, I should jump reat the chance, as the Treasurer did-that to is, so long as we could throw the burden ? on those who made the money. The Treasurer made some sort of an attempt in Australia, although not a proper one, to make those who benefited pay, but they have gone, and it is left for the people who remain to continue the payment. Then, again, we have the proposed naval loan of Â£ 3 Â» 5 > - I m in favour of an Aus00 000 a tialian Navy, and I shall probably be told that in voting against this proposal I am against that Navy; but' those who and sav so wil] know that the statement is not coirect, although they will make it' for party purposes. I am not afraid of their ten saying .that I am against an Australian to Navy, because it is known that I am not. in The general idea was that it would' come gradually. No one expected that the Goimmediately undertake a for the purpose. We know the money cannot all be spent at same once; and the 'Government should have proceeded somewhat on the lines of the Fisher Government, using the money as The Fisher ' Goof vernment had an idea of raising the or money required, and of using the Commonwealth revenue for the benefit of the whole people. Will the Treasurer or the Minister of Defence tell me that during the next ten years it will not be necessary for them to go on the money market for another loan for naval purposes? Most decidedly it will be necessary. If adopt this system of providing for the cost of the navy they will proceed further on the same lines) and possiblv, during the next ten years, they will seek to raise another Â£3;5oo,ooo for the same purpose. As has been said during this debate, a navy built today may be obsolete three years hence. It has been said that some of the new supei-Dreadnoughls built by Germany are really obsolete at the present moment.",39
297,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,They are built.,40
298,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"At all events, it has been said that some of the Dreadnoughts just constructed by Germany have been built on obsolete lines. These facts go to show that vessels that we build today may be obsolete two or three years hence.",40
299,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Apar t from improvements or scientific alterations, they will be scrap iron in fifteen years' time.",40
300,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Quite so. I do not think I am going too far when I say that within the next ten years we shall probably be asked to agree to the flotation of another loan of Â£3,500,000 for naval purposes. I am not going to say that I should approve of a proposal to borrow money for reproductive works in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department, but I should give such a project due consideration. We are told that we shall require shortly to expend an additional sum of Â£2,000,000 in connection with that Department. We have the authority of the Treasurer for that statement, but I believe that it will be necessary to find an even larger surri. Every honourable member, I am sure, could add to the list of undertakings which I have sketched, and, assuming that the Government are going to provide for all of them by borrowing, I am convinced that we shall be called upon to agree to the flotation of loans amounting to Â£35,000,000 in the next ten years. The yearly interest on that indebtedness would amount to Â£1,400,000. Is there one undertaking that I have mentioned with which the Government do not intend to proceed? Are they fooling the people of New South Wales in regard to the establishment of the Federal Capital? Is the Treasurer in favour of fooling the people of Western Australia in regard to the construction of the transcontinental railway, or do the Government wish to fool the people of South Australia with respect to the development of ""the Northern Territory? If they are going to proceed with these and other undertakings to which they are committed, then they must admit that I ' have not inflated the borrowing necessities of the near future. Have Ministers made any provision for special taxation in connection with this proposal? had, they would have taken to some extent the sting out of the criticism of the Opposition. I listened this afternoon with interest to the splendid speech made by the honourable member for Dalley, and was sorry that more members of the Ministerial not yet party were not present to hear it. The Government have agreed to return to the States at least one-half of our revenue, and when the honourable member for Yarra referred to that fact, the honourable member for Wilmot interjected, "" Would you rob the States?""",40
301,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I said nothing of the kind.,40
302,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member used words to that effect. I ask. him to remember that the people of the States are the people of the Commonwealth. - Mr ATKINSON - I do, and that is why I say that the Commonwealth should bear its fair share of the cost.",40
303,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"If the people are called upon to pay, what does it matter whether they have to pay through the Commonwealth or through the States?",40
304,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"If that is the honourable member's view, why is he not prepared to support the proposal that the Commonwealth shall raise its own loans to provide for its own works? ",40
305,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"My contention is that the States have exhausted every avenue of taxation except that of Customs and Excise. If the Commonwealth proceeded to obtain revenue from other sources, we should have a duplication of taxation. The Victorian Government have a Land Tax Bill before the State Parliament, and other States are following their example. We should also have, in that way, a duplication of the income tax. The States own the great revenue-producing sources of Australia, so that the honourable member for Wilmot's argument will not bear a moment's consideration. I shall have no more to say at this stage; but I shall certainly reflect, as the people will, on the possibilty of loans amounting to Â£35,000,000 being raised during the next ten years by the present Government, and their successors who endorse their views with respect to the policy of borrowing. We have already six State borrowers rushing into the London money market, all trying to outdo each other in selecting the most opportune time for floating a loan. I take it that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, if this proposal be agreed to, will also endeavour to If they ' select the best time for going on the money. market, and this project, after all, prove an unmixed blessing. By their opportunities, it may have the effect of preventing the States from borrowing so freely as they do now. In any event, if this proposal be agreed to, we shall a seventh Australian borrower. I am satismay fied that the people of Australia feel that a statement. we have enough borrowers at the present time, and I hope that if this proposal carried, they will not lose sight of it they go to the polls.

325,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"But I am afraid that we shall then be told that the provisions of the Bill cannot be altered, that, therefore, some deserving cases be left unprovided for. Judging from a report I . saw in a newspaper there are quite a number of deserving cases which ought to receive consideration, but which are not covered by the Bill . For instance, for in the Post and Telegraph Department of New South Wales an officer, on retiring after of a certain number of years' service, is entitled to a gratuity; but, if he die in harness, nothing is paid to his relatives. Representations in regard fo some cases which appeared deserving were made to the Postmaster-General by the honourable member for West Sydney and myself some time ago, with a view to something being done to bring about a more equitable arrangement. It appears, however, from the newspaper paragraph referred to, that it is not proposed to deal with I those cases in the Bill ; and I should like to know what the intentions of the Government are. Unless some provision is made in this Bill it will not be possible to consider the cases to which I have referred, and, consequently, injustice will be done, not to living men, but to unfortunate widows and orphans.",42
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Most bf the State Civil Service Pensions Acts do not provide for widows and orphans. Mr THOMA S BROWN - We are asking that some consideration should be shown to those who are left behind by a deceased public servant. We had a notable case some time ago in that of the Chief Clerk of the Inland Mail Branch of New South Wales. That officer was entitled to retire, and wished to do so. But the Department needed his services, and induced him to continue at work, with the result that he died in harness, largely hecause of over strain, thus forfeiting a retiring, allowance which would otherwise have been paid to him. The Minister of the day recognised the justice of the widow's claim, and provided accordingly. But that is not the only case of the kind which has come under my notice. I recently brought before the Minister one which appealed to me very strongly. A (Calare) Mr Wakelv was for forty years in the service of the Post Office, and died while in charge of the Edgecliffe office. H a d He retired 'prior to his death, he would have been entitled to a gratuity of about Â£ 5 0 0 , but, as it was, his widow and family got nothing. Cases of this kind should be provided for in a measure like that which the Treasurer wishes to introduce. A general scheme should be provided. Without such a scheme great injustice may be done to deserving persons. I wish to know whether all the cases investigated have been provided for, and, if not, whether it is in*tended to provide for them. This is the stage at which we have a right to such information. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [7.58] - In my opinion we should have an accident, a compensation, and an insurance fund for public servants, connected with the national postal banking system. Every public .servant could be called upon to con tribute something, as is done in Germany. Cases such as those referred to could then be met. Persons sometimes fail to receive what they are entitled to because of the risk of setting an undesirable precedent.",42
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We have this matter in handMr KING O'MALLEY - Has the Government money to meet these claims?,43
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We hope to deal with them next session. Mr KING O'MALLEY - As I do not expect to be Treasurer for some time to come, I hope that the right honourable member for Swan will look into these matters. However, I shall not discuss the subject just now, as there is no Bill before the House. the Committee.",43
329,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [8.1] - In my opinion, the Government should have formulated before this some scheme to meet cases like those which have been' brought forward. I have brought several cases under the notice of various Administrations which, from the Departmental point of view, perhaps, were fairly well treated, but, from my point of view, were not very well treated. I was told that the Government had in contemplation a scheme for providing for cases like that of Mr . Wakely, referred to by the honourable member for Caiare, who died in harness after serving the Government for forty years. Had he retired, he would have received compensation, but on his death nothing was. paid to his widow. ' I am wholly in favour of the Seamen's Compensation Bill , but if it is a good thing to provide compensation for seamen, it should also be a good thing to provide compensation, where necessary, for public servants. The matter has been talked of for a long time, but nothing has been done. With all the actuaries that we have in our employment, there should be no difficulty in framing a scheme which would meet the case. At the present time no system is observed. Some time ago the Prime Minister obtained a vote of Â£ 5 0 0 for an officer of the Defence Department, really against the wishes of honourable members, by bringing the proposal forward on a second occasion, after we had once refused to agree to it. It is a reflection on the Government and those in charge of Departments that no scheme has yet been adopted.",43
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We propose to do something, but we cannot do anything this session.",43
331,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,We always hear that said.,43
332,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We did not find any measure ready when we came into office.,43
333,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The last Government was not in power long enough to be able to do anything... One of its Bills, however, is on the notice-paper--the last in the list, I believe. What is the Government doing with that?",43

It must be remembered, however, that in many of the cases we are bound by the laws of the States. In the present instance, precedent has been strictly followed. We do not intend to proceed with the Bill to-night, but wish to bring it before honourable members. It establishes no new precedent, but the Government recognise that individual cases should not be dealt with, even according to precedent, until Parliament has laid down the principles to be followed.",43
335,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,There should be a precedent for the case which I mentioned.,43

Resolution reported and adopted. Ordered That Sir John Forrest and Mr Glynn do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Sir JOHN FORREST, and read a first time. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL. SECOND READING.",44
348,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [8.10] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill, as the title explains, relates to the salary of the Public Service Commissioner, long-service increments in the fifth class pf the Clerical .Division, and the employment of telegraph messengers. It will be remembered that when the first Public Service Bill was framed it was intended that the Public Service Commissioner should have a salary of Â£1,500 per annum. When the Commissioner applied for the position it was understood that that salary would be paid, but it was reduced by Parliament to Â£1,200 per annum. The work and responsibilities attached to the office have grown considerably during the last three years. When the Commissioner was appointed he had a stupendous task in classifying, grading and regulating the service, and the experience of his first term of office shows that the work was carried out to the complete satisfaction of the various Governments which have been in power, and of the public, and to the general satisfaction of the service itself. The Commissioner practically has control of the expenditure of about Â£2,000,000 per annum in salaries and in other directions in connection with the service, and from that point of view the salary paid to him up to the present has been a very small one indeed. Every. Government must largely depend on the efficiency of the Public Service Commissioner, and the judgment which he exercises in carrying out his duties in supervising the enormous expenditure on the service, and also in safeguarding the privileges of the 14,000 officers whom he now has under his control. I am informed that since the present Commissioner accepted office his work has increased to the extent of about 50 per cent., owing to the natural development of the Departments, I wish and the new officers who have been taken over by legislative authority, while the Departments which we are now about to take over, will also largely increase the staffs under his control. The task of keeping the different Departments supplied with recruits and conducting the various examinations has also largely increased the Commissioner's work. The term of his office expired in May last, and he asked the late Government, in reviewing the appointment, to consider the question of increasing his salary. That Government agreed to increase it to Â£1,500. .In accordance with an agreement entered into with him, they undertook to submit to Parliament a Bill increasing his salary to that amount, the increase to date from the time of his reappointment. This Bill therefore provides that the increase shall be deemed to have commenced on the fifth day of May, 1909. The Bill is submitted, apart from what I have said regarding the increase of the Commissioner's duties and responsibilities, in accordance with that agreement. ' Mr CHANTER - What extra Departments does the Minister refer to as taken over?",44
349,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Quarantine Deand partment is an instance. All those officers are coming over, and will be under the conby trol of the Commissioner. Other Departvotes ments have also come into his hands in adof dition to those placed under his when he first took office. The second part of the Bill refers to long-service increthird ments. This question was the late Attorney-General for his opinion in connection with the application for inyears crease of salary of an officer in the fifth class of the Clerical Division of the service. That officer, having risen to the highest by salary of the fifth class of the Clerical Diviand sion, applied for an increase by way of long-service increment. Provision not havthe ing been made in the Public Service Act for that position of affairs, so far as officers crease of salary in the fifth class of the clerical division annum. were concerned, the matter was submitted . officers for the opinion of the then Attorneymencement General. He pointed out that the Comhave monwealth Public Service Act of 1902 proThe vides for the division of the Clerical Divialready sion into five classes, and divides each those classes into subdivisions. It provides also that the rate of salary of any officer in a subdivision shall be that that subdivision in the third schedule. So far as the Clerical Division is the scheme of classification and promotion is based on the divisions and subdivisions of salaries as laid down in the Act, and there is no provision for a long-service increment for the fifth class. The. Attorneythree General further said I am of opinion therefore that the additional Â£10 could not legally form a part of the salary under the Public Service Act. The question then arises whether the amount could be legally paid as an allowance or payment other than for salary. There is nothing in the Act to preclude allowance being granted to an officer in consideration of long service in any particular class. 4 of this Bill. The Department, recognising apparently that the money could not be paid as salary, obtained an Order in Council authorizing the payment by way of allowance under section 78 of the Act. This, I think, was the proper procedure, because Parliament by voting the money for the purpose of a long-service increment in Class five autho-' rized the Governor General to apply it to that purpose, and it could only be so applied by way of allowance. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Â£10 could be legally paid by way of allowance. The matter was subsequently referred to the present Attorney-General, who' pointed out thatThe conditions of the Public Service are prehaving been scribed by that Act, - the Act of 1902include principles applicable to status and remuneration which it is undesirable to modify the somewhat inconsistent method of special, in an Appropriation Act. An amendment the Public Service Act is the proper method charge of effecting a change of policy. In accordance with those two opinions the clause of this Bill is introduced. submitted to It provides thatWhere an officer has for a period of three been in receipt of a salary of one hundred and sixty pounds per annum, he may on the certificate of the Commissioner be granted' way of long-service increment an' increase of salary at the rate of ten pounds per annum, at the expiration of a period of two years from the granting of the increase he may on certificate of the Commissioner be granted by way of long-service increment a further inat the rate of ten pounds per All long-service increments provided for in any Appropriation Act and granted to in the Clerical Division before' - the comof this section shall be deemed to been granted in pursuance of this section. last paragraph is to legalize what has been done under the opinion given by the previous Attorney-General and inof dorsed by the present Attorney-General.",45
350,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,What about the assigned to General Division?,45
351,Mr FULLER,Unknown,This Bill does not deal concerned with the General Division ?,45
352,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Is there to Ibe no increase in the General Division?,45
353,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Bill deals with specific subjects-the salary of the Commissioner, long-service increments inclass five of the Clerical Division, and the employment of telegraph messengers- a matter in which the honourable member for Calare has taken a special interest, seeing as a that he introduced in this Parliament a Bill in almost exactly the same terms and an having practically the same effect as clause That clause provides(1.) Every person employed as a telegraph messenger shall, on attaining the age of eighteen years, cease to be employed in the Public Service unless he has passed the prescribed examination before attaining"" that age. (2.) Every person employed as a telegraph messenger who has passed the prescribed examination before attaining the age of eighteen years may be allowed to continue in the Public Service as a telegraph messenger until he attains the age of twenty years, but he shall cease to be employed in the Public Service on attaining. that age unless he has been previously transferred or promoted to some other office or position in the Public Service. The object of that provision is to extend the age during which telegraph messengers can remain in the service, to give them an opportunity of promotion and advancement in the .service, from eighteen to twenty.",45
354,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the Bill prevent lads from entering the service at the present age? My idea is that the age of admission is too low.,46
355,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That is not dealt with in the Bill. Honourable members who have read the report of the Public Service Commissioner will realise that there is a great need for the extension of the time in the way provided for. Cn page 22 of his second report the matter is fully and completely dealt with in these wordsAPPOINTMENT, PROMOTION, AND RETIREMENT OF TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS. This subject calls for special consideration view of the criticisms that have been offered both in and out of Parliament with regard to the compulsory retirement of boys on reaching the age of eighteen years, although some of them had passed the examination rendering them eligible for promotion to a higher position in the General Division. In order lhat the position may be clearly understood, it is necessary to explain what was the State law and practice in this regard and to state the policy adopted in the Commonwealth. The Commissioner then points out the position as it existed in Victoria prior to the passing of the Victorian Post Office Act of 1897. A youth when once appointed as a telegraph messenger continued in the service until he reached the age of retirement applicable to all other omcers, namely, sixty years. The result was that, owing to the' great number of telegraph messengers, there was no room in the Departments for their promotion, and a large number of boys who started as telegraph messengers remained in that position to a very advanced age. The Victorian Postal Department had consequently to meet serious accusations of sweating, these men in many instances being married and having large families to provide for. They had given considerable periods of service, and were being paid merely boys' wages. The New South Wales Government followed the Victorian example by providing by regulation for the retirement at the age of twenty of telegraph messengers for whom higher positions could not be found. A similar step was taken in Queensland, South Australia. Western Australia, and Tasmania. The Commissioner points out thatProfiting by the experiences of the States, the Commonwealth Legislature provided for the compulsory retirement of telegraph messengers at the age of eighteen years unless previously promoted, to some other position; and, in order that applicants for employment might fully understand and appreciate the conditions under which they are engaged, they are required, prior to enrolling as candidates for employment, to subscribe their names to the following conditions :I understand that under the provisions of section 10 of the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Act 1901 I must retire from the Public Service immediately on attaining the age of eighteen years, unless I am previously appointed to some other position. In determining which boys shall retire at the prescribed age, the policy has been to retain only the most efficient for whom vacancies caa be found. To this end the regulations prescribe an examination in handwriting, spelling, and arithmetic, in each of which subjects a boy must secure half marks before being eligible for promotion to a higher position in the General Division ; but in order that one who enters for this in examination may not be misled, he is required to sign his name to the following :I understand that if I pass the examination I merely become eligible for promotion, and that promotion is not thereby necessarily assured to me before reaching the age of retirement. It will be' seen that every boy appointed as a telegraph messenger, or seeking to qualify for promotion before reaching the statutory age, has the position made perfectly clear to him, and it is difficult to appreciate any force in arguments which have been repeatedly alleged that boys enter the service under a misapprehension as to their tenure. It will thus be seen that boys entering the service as telegraph messengers have to retire under the present Act when they reach the age of eighteen years. It is proposed under this Bill, however, that the retiring age shall be extended to twenty years, so that those who have qualified ' by examination will have a further period of two years in which to secure a higher position in the service. The Commissioner informs me that up to the present time he has been able practically to provide for all the telegraph messengers who, under the present conditions, have to retire at eighteen years of age unless an opportunity offers to appoint them to higher positions for which they have qualified. He fears, however, that having regard to the present conditions of the service, and those which are likely to prevail for the next year or two, it will be impossible for him to provide for all of them unless this extension of two years be granted.",46
356,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Will two years be long' enough ?,46
357,Mr FULLER,Unknown,The Public Service Commissioner thinks so.,47
358,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Then what is the reason for having in this Bill a clause providing that on reaching the age of twenty years these youths shall retire unless they have been appointed to higher positions?,47
359,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If they are not appointed to higher positions they will have to retire; but the Commissioner thinks that if this extension is granted he will be able to provide for nearly all, if not all, of those, who qualify themselves by examination for promotion.",47
360,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,If they do not qualify for promotion they must retire at eighteen years of age?,47
361,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That is so, but if they do qualify they will be able to continue in the service for a further period of two years, and during that time will be eligible for promotion. These are the three features of the Bill which I have the. honour to submit. In the first place it provides for increasing the salary of the Public Service Commissioner; secondly, it provides for the payment of two long service increments to officers in the fifth class of the Clerical Division increasing their salaries from Â£160 to Â£170. and then to Â£180 per annum, and finally it provides for a two years' extension of the time of service of boys who enter the Department as telegraph messengers and who qualify by examination for higher positions in the service.",47
362,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Will the Minister explain why the increase is limited to the Clerical, and not extended to the General Division ?",47
363,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Bill has been introduced on the advice of the Public Service Commissioner, who has to deal with these matters, and, so far as the payment of long service increments to officers of the Clerical Division is concerned, on the advice of the ex-Attorney-General. It was under an opinion given by him that these increments were' paid, and the present Attorney-General says that to put the matter into proper legal form the clause in the Bill referring to such payments is absolutely necessary.",47
364,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Will the member tell us whether the increments are to continue after the two years' period provided for?,47
365,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"They will continue until the salary of Â£180 is reached. Under the Act the maximum salary is Â£160, but Bill. under this Bill there will be two increments of Â£ 1 0 each, increasing the maximum to Â£180. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [8.32]. - I do not object to the salary of the Public Service Commissioner being increased, because it cannot be denied that he is worth a good deal more than Â£1,500 per annum; but since the Government propose to borrow money to establish a navy, since we have no system, such as any business firm would have, to enable us to finance our Departments, it seems to me to be wrong to increase the Commissioner's - salary by Â£300 until that state of affairs is remedied.",47
366,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"So far as that part of the Bill is concerned, it merely carries out an agreement made by the late Ministry. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If they made such an agreement,' they did so without consulting me in the caucus, and I take no responsibility for their outside acts. I am speaking as a caucus man just as honourable members opposite now speak as caucus men. The sum of Â£300 by which.it is proposed to increase the salary of the Public Service Commissioner if distributed by way of Â£ 5 increments amongst sixty of the lower-paid men, would do a lot of good. I recognise the Commissioner's great ability, but whilst the Commonwealth is in a state of financial flux I must oppose any increases of salary except in the case of the lower-paid men. This Bill provides for. the payment of long-service increments to men in the fifth class of the Clerical division, and not to those in the General division. If the ex-Attornev-General agreed that they should be paid only to men in the Clerical division, he must have overlooked his duty.",47
367,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That was merely the ""opinion given by him on the case submitted to him. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then it is not the fault of the ex-Attorney-General that provision was not made for increments to men in the General division. The matter was not brought before him. Had it been, no doubt he would have ordered a honourable slight increase in their case.",47
368,Mr FULLER,Unknown,He was not asked to do that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Quite so; but there is a wrong on the face of this,47
369,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The ex-Attorney-General - did not introduce this Bill. Why did not the present Minister make inquiries about the matter? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not - going to blame either side. Our own party hope. - ought to have hunted up this matter. A salary of Â£1,500 per annum is not a large - one, but Â£1,200 a year is a reasonable jnent to make to the Commissioner until the twenty. Commonwealth adopts something like a 'business system. When the affairs of the - Commonwealth are placed on a business (basis it will be time enough for us to pose a general increase of salaries; but - must have an increase in the case of the <lower-paid men. Whilst a man receiving Â£1,200 a year can obtain everything that he requires, the man receiving Â£ 1 1 0 not. I am reminded of a story told the late William Vanderbilt, who was Avorth Â£60,000,000 or Â£70,000,000. One .evening he accepted an invitation to ner extended to him by a friend who was less than Â£160? worth only about Â£200,000, and he had as - good a dinner as he could have obtained home. When he returned home that - he cried and said, "" There is nothing to live for; my friend, who - couple of hundred thousand pounds, can have as good a dinner as I my millions."" There is no difference between the position of a man receiving Â£1,200 a year and that of a man receiving Division. Â£1,500 a year so far as food and clothing -.go. If a man eats more than his nature steps in and he is sick; i he wears more than one suit of additional this year. - clothes at a time he looks foolish. ' I urge the Minister to bring down plementary Bill providing for an increment - of Â£ 5 all round in the General Division, and I guarantee there would be no oppopay? sition from this side. Turning to another - provision of the Bill, I wonder if it good thing to discharge the boys, who been temporarily employed, at the twenty.",48
370,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Commissioner, has had charge for nine or ten years?, - recommends the provision contained Bill. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The chances - are that at twenty a boy is unfitted for other calling.",48
371,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If a boy is kept on the age of twenty, he has a better chance of being continued in .the service. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But I cannot think it wise or considerate to throw [236] youth on the world at that age, when, as I say, he is, in all probability, unfitted for any other business. It would be far better to discharge him at eighteen, when he is full of energy, determination, and",48
372,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"A boy may leave at eighteen if he likes, but this Bill is to give payhim an opportunity to continue till he is Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am merely pointing out that there is another side to the question. In my own electorate there prowere smart willing boys employed, and, we although they gave every satisfaction, they had to be discharged for the simple reason that there was no room for them. If a boy is kept on until he is twenty, there is cana possibility of his getting married, and of then, in the event of his being discharged, he is placed in a very serious position. As to the long-service increments, are there dinno men in the clerical branch who receive",48
373,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"They start at Â£ 4 0 and at rise to Â£160, beyond which they would night not advance without this Bill. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is there no is worth only a rise after Â£160.",48
374,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Beyon d that they get into can get with all another division. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am sorry this Bill does not deal with the General,48
375,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"This Bill was brought in fill to deal with three specific matters, and f will mean the payment of about Â£20,000 Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why should a supclerks, who are receiving fair pay now, have a privilege over those men in the General Division who receive only ordinary",48
376,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"There is no provision in is a the Public Service Act for the Clerical have Division in the respect mentioned, while age of there is for the General Division. Mr KING O'MALLEY-Is justice who being done to the General Division?",48
377,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I understand so; I have in the heard no complaints. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The evidence given before the Postal Commission does any not bear out the suggestion that there are no complaints; but, on the other hand, till shows that the Public Service is on the crater of a volcano. I am sure there are no honourable members here who would not like to see iustice done to the General a Division. The Minister spoke about the Commissioner having had considerable labour in placing the Public Service on a systematic foundation, and I admit that he had great work, which he performed for Â£1,200 a year. Now that all the hard work is done, all he has to do is to sit in an office and push a bell; and I ask whether it would not be better to distribute the extra Â£300 among the poorer-paid public servants, and thus enable them to buy a good Christmas dinner and a few additional comforts? However, I suppose that ""the numbers are up.""",48
378,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.53] This Bill is interesting in many aspects; first, as showing how responsibility changes the point of view and the opinions of men. I can remember my friends of the Labour party, when they sat in the corner, opposing most bitterly a proposal, not to increase salaries by Â£300, but to give an increment of Â£ 1 00 to the heads of three Departments. With office, however, they realized the responsible work these omcers have to perform, and they out-Deakined Deakin in their proposal to raise the salaries of what the honourable member for Darwin calls the "" top-notchers."" I do not cavil at that, but congratulate them upon the effect of responsibility.",49

381,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Did ""I object to the increments ?",49
382,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Member s of the Labour party persistently opposed the proposal; but the moment they got into office they proposed an increment, not of Â£100, but of Â£300 a year for the best-paid official.",49

387,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Some of those sitting with the honourable member are cavilling at it. I consider the Public Service Commissioner one of the ablest and most conscientious men in the Public Service, but he is absolutely overpowered by his work.

388,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"If he is overworked, how will an increase of salary help him ?",49
389,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not know that it will help him. The work ""is too much for one man, whatever his abilities, knowledge, and experience may be. The Public Service Commissioner has not anything like mastered the details of the Department of the Postmaster-General, as every one who has administered it must be aware. It is impossible for one who is not in the Department to obtain a complete mastery of all its ramifications, since the service extends from the Northern Territory to Southern Tasmania, and employs between 13,000 and 14,000 persons.

399,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That is not a matter which I can go into now. No doubt the report of the Postal Commission will give us an opportunity to consider it. There will have to be changes on the lines suggested. I agree with the honourable member for Calare that consideration should be given to officers of the General Division. We are employing a number of skilled joiners, picked artisans who have to pass a very difficult examination. I was recently Re- informed that they received 8d. a day less than the ordinary artisan outside; that is, less than the average skilled man who is not required to pass an examination.",49

406,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"About Â£30,000 was tent given in increments to some of the most poorly-paid public servants, largely cause of the influence exerted by Mincial isters. I am sure that if the Minister inquired into these matters, he would make a recommendation. The Government should be an exemplary employer. Whilst I do not begrudge officers the earned by the competent discharge of duties, I think that skilled labourers and artisans should be treated similarly. With sioner's report. regard to messengers, I am of opinion that we shall soon be compelled to change our system of admitting omcers into the Public Service. If we do not, we shall have too many youths in the Service. When I was aminations.

In one country town which I crease visited, at an office with a turnover exceedsary â¢ g Â£10,000 a year, the officer in charge forty years of age, the next officer twenty-one years of age, and all the others still younger. It is continually being pointed out to me that the Post' Office is being worked by boy labour, and there is a great deal of truth in the statement. I know that to alter the present system will create ficulties, and increase expense; but that the school age of boys is being raised by some of the States, we ought to refuse to take lads until they are fourteen fifteen years of age.",50

But it will by no means solve the problem, and I urge the Minister to look into the points which I have indicated, and to see whether he cannot devise some scheme for having our post-offices especially manned with more experienced public servants.",50
415,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [9.11] - It is somewhat surprising that a measure of this kind is brought on at this period of the session and of this Parliament. It touches just a few in the service, and leaves the untouched. Whether it is doing it rightly or wrongly we should be in a better position to know when we received the report of Postal Commission which has now, for many months, been investigating the affairs of the largest portion of the service. thought it was understood that Parliament whole of their days at such salaries as would await that report, and then attempt on the basis of the Commission's investigations to put the whole Service on something like a fair footing. I acimit that it fair that officers who give their best service to the management of the public affairs of they have to stop at that. the country should have nothing to look forprotest ward to except a salary that is only a ing, but my great objection - to the measure is one which I have found it necessary to raise in regard to the whole management of the Service, whether by the States or Commonwealth-that is, the unfair discrimfiner ination between the man who uses tools, as the pick, or shovel, or other instruments, and the man who uses only the pen. The latter, who has the most comfortable set conditions under which to work, much less wear and tear upon his clothing and his health, and with absolutely no risk to or limb, always meets with the greatest sideration. I admit that in outside pations his pay is much worse, but gard to the Public Service of the Commonnotwithstanding wealth, and it used to be much the same the various States, the General Division always considered to be one that need be bothered about. I enter my protest against that system being continued. Throughout the Service it is much the as in the world generally, with the upsidedown social system under which we live Society, jumps on the poor fellow that most help, and boosts up the man who does increments begin again. not need any. We should reverse that cess, and deal fairly with the worse paid and worse circumstanced. I do not that the proposal in this Bill is unfair, cause there are men in the service who do much better with their abilities outside, and we ought to recognise their work. As they qualify themselves and get older they should be entitled to definite increments, which should not be left to thesweet will of the Government that happens to be in power. On the principleof having some definite advance made,. I am with the Bill, but my complaint is that it selects a few for advancement, andi is introduced at a stage of the session when we cannot do justice to the whole Service. There are in the General Division numbersrest of men doing very skilled and risky work,, ljut I presume because they wear blue dungarees and get their hands and faces dirtythe they count as nobodies, although they are just as important as, and generally moreimportant than, some of those in the CleriI cal Division. They have to stand for the Â£120 or Â£126. In some branches some of ' them cannot rise even to Â£132, to say nothing of ios. a day or Â£ 1 5 6 a year. There is not are a few who, with promotions, may after twenty years' service reach Â£138, but I enter myagainst this differentiation between< : livclasses of employee's. The world is beginning to recognise that a man as such hascertain rights, that he has his duties as a: citizen to fulfil, and his family to keep, just, the the same as another man who may wear clothes and wield a pen while sitting such comfortably at a desk. I should like to know why the Commissioner or the Government are making this differentiation.. of The Minister said the Commissioner recommended it, but that is no answer. I havelife the highest opinion of the Commissioner, I conbelieve we were fortunate in securing a occuvery able man in him, and I have not ar in reword to say against his judgment; but all his ability we are here into take the responsibility of legislation. is There has been unfair treatment of the not whole General Division, especially in some of its branches. There is not a word about them in this Bill, but it is proposed that same those in the Clerical Division who reachÂ£16.0 shall three years afterwards get an. - increase of Â£ 1 0 a year until they obtainneeds Â£180, and then wait two years, when theHas the Minproister any information to show how many officers are affected, and what their work say is? The Bill is sprung on us at this late behour of the session, and is a bigger matter could than appears on the surface. It is spoken of as an instalment of a good thing, but it is not fair to do these things in instalments.",51
416,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am told that it will amount to an additional expenditure of Â£20,000 this year; it amounted to Â£11,000 last year.",51
417,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That shows that a good many omcers are to receive the increments. I have no doubt they deserve them.,52
418,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Long-servic e increments are provided for in the General Division. The classification stops at Â£138, and then there are long-service increments up to Â£150.",52
419,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"But the officers would have to remain in the service to about the age of 150 to get them. In the Postal Service especially, owing to the way in which the heads of the Department try to keep the expenses down, and through the manner in which the officers are classified, there is very little chance of a man in the General Division getting a long-service increment. He becomes too old for service before he has a chance to obtain it. It is not a fixed arrangement. To obtain an increment a man has to secure promotion, and he is often kept doing work worth a higher salary than he is paid. The omcers in charge of the Departments are very careful to protect the public purse, which is, perhaps, to their credit, and many of the heads of Departments protect it to such an extent that injustice is done to the lower paid, for it is always the lower paid that suffer. Some men stay a long time at Â£110, and yet Parliament passed an Act providing that those who were twenty-one years of age, and had been three years in the Service, should receive Â£110. not intended that that should be the maximum. Parliament anticipated that increases would be provided as ihe men grew older. It is too late this session to go into these matters .as fully as we ought to; and we must accept the Bill, although it is a partial provision, doing justice to only a few officers; but we are entitled to ask the Government to mete out equal treatment to all persons in the Service. Reference has been made to the action of the Government in reverting to what was the law in New South Wales, allowing telegraph messengers to have a chance of promotion up to the age of twenty-one. We passed the original Act providing a limit of eighteen years of age, largely because the New South Wales provision had been found to work unsatisfactorily. When Federation was inaugurated, I found, as the result of personal investigation, that in New South Wales there were 400 telegraph messengers on the list for promotion, and that there would be room found for only about twenty-five a year. I have often advised parents against entering their boys as telegraph messengers on account of the small chance of openings being found for them. I am looking forward to the report of the Postal. Commission on that matter. The present arrangement is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the boys themselves, who expect to secure positions with some degree of permanency. In spite of the papers which they fill up telling them differently, they think when they are appointed that they have a guarantee of permanency. While it may suit those running the Department to get this form of labour, we are entitled to consider whether it is a good thing for the lads themselves. It would be wise to have some other system; though I cannot say exactly what would be the best.. I understand that appointments are now given if possible in some other branches under the eighteen years of age provision, and the extension of the age to twenty is to give greater opportunities to provide openings for the lads. I am confident that the Commissioner will do his best for them.",52
420,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Commissioner hopes, by getting this extension of age, to give the boys an opportunity of promotion.",52
421,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The openings in New South Wales were very few, and all those who did not get other positions were thrown on to the labour market, unfitted for other work, beyond the age at which they could start to learn a trade. Some of them had It was taken pains to make themselves proficient,, and had passed examinations. It was, therefore, a - loss to the Department for them to have to go out. Some had qualified in telegraphic work, and yet there were no appointments for them. That systemis satisfactory neither to the youths concerned nor to the Department. If it can be remedied, the matter ought to have fullest consideration from both points of view. This is the kind of measure that one cannot vote against. It is only a partial advance; but I hope it will be understood that something similar will be done for the General Division. There is nothing about the work of the Clerical! Division requiring greater skill than is necessary in connection with the work of the General Division. Indeed, much of the work of the Clerical Division requires less skill than does some of the work of the General Division, and I protest against this partial method of dealing with the question, r hope that an early opportunitywill be taken to do justice to the omcers of the General Division. We shall have to deal with the whole question on the report of the Postal Commission, and shall be able then to give to it much more time than we can at this stage of the session.",52
422,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.26] - This purports to be a Bill to amend the Public Service Act, but it is actually a validating measure. In the first place, it is designed to validate the action of the Fisher 'Government who engaged the Public Service Commissioner for a further period of seven years, and agreed to increase his salary from Â£1,200 to Â£1,500 per annum. The second portion of the Bill again is not to grant an increase to the officers of the fifth class of the Clerical Division, but validate an act on the part of the Public Service Commissioner himself in paying certain increments to them. Upon examining the Bill honourable members will find that the Public Service Commissioner has been paying certain increments to officers in the fifth class of the Clerical Division, and has. discovered, apparently, that in doing so fie has placed himself in a doubtful legal position. He therefore asks Parliament to endorse his action. I am astonished that the Labour party are not attacking the action of the Fisher Government in renewing the Public Service Commissoner's engagement for a perod of - seven years, and agreeing to increase his salary by Â£300 per annum.",53
423,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,They know a good man when they see one.,53
424,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Honourable members of the Opposition have spoken in such a way - as to suggest that they are shocked at the idea of the Minister of the day proposing to grant this increase of salary to the lic Service Commissioner, whereas he is - simply giving effect to an agreement made by his predecessor in office, who is a member of the Labour party. On what ground did the Labour Government re-engage the Commissioner for a term of seven years, and agree to increase his salary? The increase is a remarkable and significant one. - Mr MCLachlan is a personal friend of mine, but I am not governed by considerations of personal friendship in dealing with a matter of this kind ; I recognise that it must be dealt with from a public standpoint. If Mr MCLachlan is entitled to jÂ£i,5oo per annum-if he is earning that salary-the n prior to the granting of this increase he must have been underpaid. The most important portion of his work - that of classifying about 20,000 officers in the Public Service, of whom about. 1.6,000 are engaged in the Postmaster General's Department-wa s carried out while he was receiving only Â£1,200 per annum. If he is today worth Â£1,500 per annum then he must have been underpaid. On that ground alone, can this increase be justified. It is an increase of 25 per cent., and whilst I believe in making a salary fit the office to which it is related, I can well understand thousands of public servants occupying minor positions being staggered when they learn of this proposal. If the Minister says that Mr MCLachlan has been underpaid, that to will be some excuse for the proposed increase.",53
425,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I pointed out that the Service had - increased by 50 per cent.,53
426,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"But that increase has not taken place during the last five months. I desire to deal very delicately with this question, since it relates to matters into which I have had an opportunity recently to inquire. I do not wish to foreshadow the judgment I have come to in regard to certain questions that I have had recently to investigate, but I would point out that the attack made by the Opposition must be directed really at the late Ministry. It is a powerful -.commentary upon their administration that a Labour Government should have gone out of their way to make such a marked increase in the salary of the Public Service Commissioner when, according to the statements of members of the Labour party to-night, the rank and file of the Service have been neglected. They stand condemned on their Pubown utterances. Members of the Labour party who have spoken of the inadequacy of this measure have been condemning their late representatives in the Labour Administration. Every word that has fallen from the Opposition to-night in condemnation of the Ministry's failure to provide for increments to the lower-paid members of the Service constitutes a most bitter attack on the - late Labour Government. In these matters, I consider not the amount of salary, received, but the return which the country obtains from it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that the House put up a desperate fight some time ago against a proposal to increase by Â£ 1 00 per annum the salary of the Secretary of a Department; he forgot to say that what we complained of was not that that officer was to receive an increase, but that the Public Service Commissioner had been overlooked, and that he had no power to report as to whether or not that increase should be granted. We objected not to the increase itself, but to the method by which it was obtained. I objected to political patronage-to the fact that the Ministerial head of the Department had recommended that the Secretary should receive an increase of Â£100 per annum, whereas the question of whether or not any other officer in the Service should receive an increase was one which the Public Service Commissioner had to determine. The same argument will apply today. At the instance of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. MCLachlan has had his salary increased by Â£300 per annum. I am cavilling not so much at the increase as at the method of obtaining it. No reason has been given for the proposal unless it be that Mr. MCLachlan has been underpaid.",53
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That does not follow. If it did, it might be applied to the case of every officer who received an increase.",54
428,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"There must have been some strong reason for making so significant and marked an increase, but it has not been put before us. I know that the Commissioner is a capable and able officer, and that he has under his control all the officers of the Public Service from the humblest to the highest. It is somewhat invidious that the man who has under his review the salaries of all the officers of - the service should be placed on an equal footing under this Bill, so far as an increase of his salary is concerned, with men whose salaries he has under review.",54
429,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I pointed out that the agreement was entered into by the late Government.,54
430,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Quite so. The second part of the Bill, as I have said, is designed to validate an act of the Commissioner. It does not of itself provide for an increase in the salaries of officers in the Clerical Division; the increase has been actually granted by the Commissioner. I would point out that these increments are to be paid only to officers who have ibeen receiving Â£160 per annum for not less than three years. Such officers are to receive an increment of Â£ 1 0 per annum, and after remaining on the Â£170 mark for two years, they are to receive a further increment of Â£ 1 0 . .. Had this been a Bill providing for-instea d ofvalidating the action of the Commissioner in granting-a n increase to certain officers in the Clerical Division, I should have Ibeen able to make a strong appeal for the equally generous treatment of officers in the General Division. I shall not deal now with that matter; but I shall have an opportunity before long to show by evidence the absolute need for action in that direction. The only newfeature of the Bill is that relating to telegraph messengers. In that respect the Department has been well advised. The clause providing for an examination of telegraph messengers is a wise one. Some years ago I and other honourable members in this House urged that telegraph messengers should not remain in the service after reaching the age of eighteen years. I believe that the honourable member for Maribyrnong was amongst the number who advanced that contention. The argument"" then raised was that if a lad were turned adrift after reaching the age 'of eighteen years, he would be in a very awkward position. It was urged that unless he received promotion he should leave the service even before reaching that age, so that he might have an opportunity to be apprenticed to some trade. We find that the section in the principal Act providing for the retirement of telegraph messengers on reaching the age of eighteen years is working to the detriment of the service. Many high officials in the Department to-dayentered the service as telegraph messengers ; but under the present system .the parents of many children will not allow them to become telegraph messengers, because they know that they are likely to be discharged either at or before reaching the age of eighteen years. The tendency of the provision in the principal Act has not been toattract the best class of boys to the service as telegraph messengers, and consequently the best class of boys have not been available for permanent employment' in the General and Clerical Divisions. It has been a means of depleting the service of lads of the class who used to join it. That is one of the many objections that canbe raised at the proper time to the practice hitherto followed. As a matter of fact, this Bill does not grant any new increments, but merely legalizes those already granted by the Commissioner, who was under the impression that he was em-' powered under the Public Service Act to grant them. I am glad that the House has been in the humour to favourably consider this Bill ; and I hope that the broader question will command attention as close. It does seem beyond the bounds of fair play for honourable members opposite to castigate Minister of Home Affairs and the Governlegal enactment. .ment, when they are simply validating the .action of the Labour Government in regard to the Commissioner. What right had the ex-Minister of Home Affairs to enter an engagement for seven years with the Commissioner and to raise his salary from .Â£1/200 to Â£1,500 without any further information than that which - us to-night? If the Commissioner had announced that he would not continue in position unless he received the increase, I year. .could understand the position. The creases in the Clerical Division representalready only about 6 per cent., while that of the - Commissioner means 25 per cent.; and --cannot expect the Public Service to be satisfied and loyal under the circumstances. What about the Public Service inspectors? They receive from Â£700 to Â£800 a year, and, although they are the men on whom - Commissioner has to rely for information formed.] and advice, no increase is proposed in their .case. This Bill is piecemeal legislation, .and is only necessary to validate what may call the blunder of the ex-Minister of bread."" Home Affairs in increasing the salary the Public Service Commissioner without - taking into consideration the whole question of Public Service salaries. The ex-Minisand ter of Home Affairs was aware that an quiry was proceeding, on the evidence of which he could test the question whether the Commissioner and the members of the service generally were underpaid or overwiden paid.",54
431,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Did the Commissioner wise remain unprovided for. - demand a rise?,55
432,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is for the late - Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, to say. It does seem bad business to increase the salary of the Public Service Commissioner and neglect the rest of the service.",55

438,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That shows the difference of opinion between the two Attorneys General.

There are several avenues in which alteration is very urgently needed, these might possibly prove more deinbatable than the provisions under notice, which, however, are of sufficient importance to warrant support.

I have here a list of suggested amendments in the Public Service Act-of 1902, and the regulations made under it, agreed to by a Conference of delegates representing the various an Federal Public Service Associations in New South Wales. These associations are comMinposed of men who have to work under the of Act, and know where it pinches.

442,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We have enough to do now in dealing with the matter in front of us.,56
443,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the Minister takes that stand, it is of little use to discuss the matter. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who was Postmaster-General for a considerable time, has asked that something of the kind that I suggest should be done, and it seems to me that we have now an opportunity to do it.",56
444,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It may shorten the debate to inform the honourable member that it is not competent for the House to add to the Bill. It was introduced by a message covering the amendment of only certain provisions of the Public Servicr; Act, and therefore other provisions cannot now be amended. The proper time to provide for an enlargement of the scope of the Bill was when the message was undei consideration.",56
445,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,It seems to me a non-contentious matter which might very well be dealt with. The Ministei proposes to provide long-service increments in the fifth class of the Clerical Division. But similar provision should b: made regarding the officers of the General Division.,56

Mr <THOMAS BROWN - In that case the law does not seem to be administered evenly.

447,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Largel y for increments in the General Division.,56
448,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Althoug h it was understood that the money would be distributed throughout the Service, I have been informed that hitherto the General Division has not benefited; and that in the New South Wales Postal Department, at any rate, only officers of the clerical [237 ] branches have received increments. There are in the General Division officers of _ and twenty-five years' service, possessing clean records, who have not received recogniThe tion from these votes. It is proposed to raise the maximum salary of certains clerical officers from Â£ 1 60 to Â£180, by means of long-service increments. The honourable member for Dalley has pointed out that that has already been done. As a matter of fact, the late Labour Government provided for this increase, but the present Attorney-General, thinking it necessary to legalize what was done, put this provision into the Bill. There are, however, a number of officers in the General Division who are not being fairly dealt with in the matter of increments. According to a statement dated 20th March, 1908The rate of promotion, it is stated, averages about twelve per annum, out of a total of 539 letter carriers in New South Wales.

449,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I am informed that those conditions have disappeared.,56
450,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If this is a matter for regulation, the Minister should see that justice is done. I have nothing to say against the proposal to give increments to the Clerical Division, and, indeed, think the increments deserved. But the general staff should be treated with equal liberality. When last session I introduced a Bill dealing with the retirement of telephone attendants, and the honourable member for West Sydney another dealing with the question of appeals, we were induced to withdraw those measures to enable the Government of the day to deal with the subjects which they covered. No proposal, however, has been made to alter the system of appeals, which causes great friction.",56
451,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I have not had time to more.,57
452,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The matter will have to be dealt with early in the life of the next Parliament. I am glad that the Minister has decided to do something with regard to telegraph messengers. The whole Department was against the view which I originally took in this matter, but experience has taught them that some change must be made. At the present time, officers who have been in the service for three or four years, and have thus qualified themselves for the performance of higher duties, find no avenues of promotion open to them, and have to retire on reaching the age of eighteen. Yet their services are most valuable to the Department. In my electorate, a and intelligent lad was appointed as a messenger, and during his service became a competent telegraphist and generally useful in the office. He was actually used to relieve officers whose holidays had accrued; but as soon as he reached the age of eighteen years, he had to retire because the Department could not procure promotion for him. His place was taken by a mere lad who had to learn the ABC of the work. The work of the office had so grown in the meantime, that the postmaster was unable to cope with it with only the help of this youth, who was a messenger pure and simple, and an assistant had to be appointed, l t , therefore, took three officers to do the work done previously by two. It was a hardship to the lad and his parents that he should be retired, because they looked forward to a permanent position for him. He did all in his power to qualify himself for promotion, but had to be retired. The same necessity applied to a number of other youths. I discovered on inquiry that if the time were extended as this Bill provides, it would allow the Department at least two extra years in which to avail themselves of the training which such youths had been given, and in which to secure their services in the higher grades. This can only be done by an amendment of the principal Act. The Public Service Commissioner afterwarrls'endeavoured to meet the difficulty by means of a special examination when vacancies occurred, and a number of these youths got' back again to the Service; but that was not a desirable method, and the Minister's proposal will, so far as I can judge, be better. In New South Wales, officers were not required to retire until'they reached the age of twenty-one, ancl there was little do difficulty in that connection, as they were fairly well absorbed. The idea of this Parliament was not to continue too long in the Service youths unfitted for the work, and it was thought that it would be discovered by the time they reached eighteen whether they were qualified or not, when those not qualified could te dispensed with. It was found, however, that that arrangement robbed the Department of the services of a large number of desirable youths, for whom it could not provide on the spur of the moment. This Bill will overcome that difficulty, whilst still enabling the Department to weed out those not qualified to"" continue in the Service. It provides that when a youth reaches eighteen he must pass bright an examination to show his fitness. If he can pass it , he gets the benefit of the extra two years. If he cannot, he is still required to retire from the Service when he reaches eighteen. I think that is a provision which honourable members will not quarrel with. Although the honourable member for Dalley seems to think that the Service generally has a grievance in the fact that the Public Service Commissioner has been appointed for another term at an increased salary, I hold that Mr MCLachlan has done a Herculean work in the Commonwealth Service. Everything that he has done is not perfect, but he has shown hisgreat talents and ability as an organizer. He is a most able and capable man, and deserves the money that it is proposed to pay him. If the Service is to be what we wish it to be, it must be under the control and management of a capable man. If the Commonwealth wants the services of such a man, it must be prepared to pay for them. The amount offered is not a largesum; and if the Commissioner does his work anything like faithfull y and well, he will earn it. I presume that the salary now named will apply also to Mr MCLachlan's successor. The late Labour Qovernment, recognising the value of his services, and the desirability of retaining him for the Commonwealth, arranged to increase his salary, and this Bill will give legal force to the arrangement. They also made arrangements to increase Hie salaries of those in the fifth class of the Clerical Division from the Â£ 1 6 0 to the Â£ i So limit, and the Bill gives legal forceto that determination. Whilst I agree with the Bill as far as it goes, it might be enlarged in the interests of the service generally, to embrace the purely technical classification which I have indicated, and to provide for an independent Court of Appeal as outlined by the honourable member for West Sydney, using the State Police Magistrates as an investigating Board. The present method is unsatisfactory, costly, and unwieldy, and an amendment of the Act in that direction is urgently needed. Amendments are equally urgently needed in many other directions, but the Minister would be well advised to extend the scope of the Bill to meet the points I have mentioned. so doing he would make it much more efficient, and it-would appeal much more directly to the rank and file of the service as granting a measure of reform which has been demanded and urgently required for many years past.  the Minister agree to an adjournment of the debate?",57

476,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [10.40] - I do not wish to discuss this Bill further than to say that in my judgment this method of legislating is unwise. To the increments proposed to be paid I have no objection; as a matter of fact, they have already been granted by the Public Service Commissioner as an act of justice to officers in one branch of the service. But those responsible for the proposed increase to the Public Service Commissioner have taken it upon themselves to do something which'may have to be remodelled at no distant date. Some of the members of the late Government say that they had to do something with regard to the position of the Public Service Commissioner, and that indicates that they had no loophole of escape when the proposition was made that the Commissioner's salan should be increased. Evidently they failed to take action until the Commissioner's first term of service had actually expired. One would have thought that the Minister in charge of the Department would, look ahead and make inquiries in time to enable other arrangements if necessary to be made, so that he would not be exposed to the exactions of any officer. I am not discussing the equity of the proposed increase of salary to the Commissioner; but that part of the Bill which deals with that question, and the clause relating to the employment of telegraph messengers, may have to be amended within the next twelve months. The Government would have been well advised had they hesitated to initiate legislation of this character until they had something sounder to go upon with regard to its effect upon the whole service, especially in view of the reform which may possibly be suggested later on. I regret that the Minister should propose to do more than is necessary to legalize an action already taken by the Commissioner, and think that the remaining provisions of the Bill might well have been left for future consideration in connection with the inquiry now being made into the whole ramifications of the Postmaster-General's Department.",60
477,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.44] - I feel that I should like to oppose the proposed increase of salary to the Public Service Commissioner, not because I think he is not worth Â£1,500 a year, but because I believe that no one man should have the power which the Commissioner possesses. Some time ago a Ministerial decision was given as to the payment of certain men temporarily employed in a certain Department.",60
478,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Me n who were really shipwrights.,60
479,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Me n who as shipwrights would have received 12s. per day outside the service. I do not say that the work that they were called upon to do required on their part the knowledge of a shipwright, but it was certainly not the work of a labourer. The Minister decided that a fair wage should be paid; but the Commissioner determined that these temporary hands should be employed permanently' at 8s. 4d. pei day. An attempt was made, but without success, to induce the Commissioner to reconsider the matter, with a view to the payment of adequate remuneration to these men. I think that the Commissioner has not given the satisfaction expected. It is not because' he has not tried to do so, or is not an able man, but because it is impossible for any one man to properly carry out all the duties intrusted to the Public Service Commissioner under the Act. I think that the Ministerial head of each Department should have more power than he has at present. I know it - will be argued that that suggests a return to political influence; but the answer that it would be no more baneful to the Public Service than, is Departmental fluence.",60
480,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,O r social influence.,61
481,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not know that social influence is brought to bear to great extent. The heads of Departments develop"" feelings against certain men, and I think the Public Service Commissioner should take such things into consideration and look beyond the reports from mental heads. I may be asked of use it is to appoint a Departmental head if at his report and advice is not to be upon. But I think that in these matters the Ministerial head and the Public SerThere vice Commissioner should exercise disthe cretion, and that if they did, they would prevent, in some cases, unfair treatment ing meted out to certain omcers. The Commissioner and his inspectors are posed to supervise the whole of the Public Service. I suppose that the Commissioner is guided to a great extent by the reports of his inspectors and of the Departmental permanently in the service. heads; and if that be so, he cannot claim all the kudos for managing the service well. I raise the same objection as that, raised the honourable member for Grey. I of men in the General Division who been in the Public Service for twenty at Â£156 a year, and cannot hope to get increase until some one above them dies. remember that on one occasion, in discussing the Budget, ' the honourable member for Flinders contended that no provision - should be made for increments unless state of the public revenue of them. I disagree with the honourable member's contention. Public servants who enter the General Division at a low wage as youngsters have much greater responsibilities when they reach, say, the age of forty-five years; and I be- lieve that long-service increments' above a salary of Â£156 a year should be provided for in the General Division. In savins this, I cast no reflection on officers Clerical Division. Though we may not be cation ? able to amend this measure, that will not prevent me from raising my voice against what I consider unfair treatment meted to a large section of our public servants. I am pleased that the Government at last proposed to do something for youngsters taken into the Public Service, by extending the age to twenty years in the case of telegraph messengers. young fellows who join at fourteen yearsis of age have to leave the service after spending four years in it, and no one will intake them as apprentices to any business outside at eighteen years of age. If the age is extended as proposed to twenty years, there will be greater opportunities afforded to find positions for these lads in the serany vice, and the time they have spent in the Department will not have been wasted. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that the Post and Telegraph Department drew too largely upon the young people of Departthe community. But that cannot be what avoided while lads have to leave eighteen years of age, and acted while lads of that age are drawn upon to fill positions ^becoming vacant! is in the Public Service too much of boy labour which is condemned so much outside. It would be better, if the De-' bepartment could afford it, to give a slight increase of pay to telegraph messengers up supto the age of twenty-one years. I agree that it is right that they should pass a. certain examination, and that their conduct should 'be fair if they are to be continued I hope that at some future date the matter will be more thoroughly gone into, and better provision by made than is now proposed.
