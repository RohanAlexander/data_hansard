NA COMMISSION. CLAIM OF H . DEAN AND SONS.",21
56,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Newcastle) [2.50] I move1. That a select committee be appointed to inquire into the claim of H . Dean and Sons, of Mayfield, Newcastle, New South Wales, against the War Service Homes Department. 2. That such committee consist of Sir Elliot Johnson, Mr E. C. Biley, Mr Gardner, Mr. Coleman, Mr Thompson, Mr Watson, aud the mover, five to form a quorum; with power to senj. for persons and papers and records and examine judgments in connection therewith, to adjourn from place to place; and have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken; and that such committee do report this day three months. I submitted this motion in the last Parliament, but it was not brought to finality. I have reintroduced it in the hope that the Government will not again resort to whipping its supporters to vote against a private member's motion, and thus deny to a citizen the right to appeal to the highest court in the land-the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Por the benefit.of honourable members who are new to this House, I shall briefly recapitulate the circumstances of the case, and I hope that honourable members will base their opinions upon the moral aspects of the claim rather than upon legal intricacies. The firm of Dean and Sons was established as manufacturers of pipes and bricks in the Newcastle electorate, and was requested by the War 'Service BTomes Commission to discontinue pipe making and enter into a contract to supply the whole of its output of bricks to the Government. Mr. Henry Dean demurred, and stated that he had private contracts for the supply of a portion of his output of bricks. The correspondence shows that at no time was he desirous of making a contract with the Government, but the departmental officers, who apparently were very well satisfied with the quality of his bricks, repeatedly urged him to make an agreement with the commission. The proof of that is supplied by the following letter:War Service Homes Commission, Newcastle District Office, - Carrington Chambers, Watt-street, Newcastle, 24th July, .1920. Messrs. H. Dean and Sons, Pottery, Mayfield. Dear Sir, The quantity of bricks being supplied by you to this Commission is very unsatisfactory. We are of the opinion that is partly due to your being under the impression that our business is only temporary, and therefore do not consider it good business to yourself to give us absolute preference. We wish to assure you that our constructional programme is permanent, and our requirements will only be imet by the receipt of 250,000 bricks per week for at least ten (10) years, ancl a continuance after that of a slightly less quantity for an indefinite period. It is not the policy of the Commission to acquire brickworks or commence new works of sufficient capacit}' to supply the whole of our requirements. This policy will only be adopted as a last resource. We are in a position to make an agreement with you to accept the maximum, quantity of bricks for which you are in a position to guarantee delivery, say, from 50,000 to 75,000 per week for three (3), five (5), or more years. An agreement to this effect would enable you to extend your plant, if necessary, and would, guarantee your output. We would ask you to give this matter your full consideration, the decided advantage of such an arrangement being most obvious. Yours faithfully, (Signed) N. H . COOK, District Officer. Later correspondence indicates that at last he was persuaded to make a contract. I quote the following letter:Messrs. Henry Dean & Sons, Henry Brickworks, Waratah. Dear Sirs, We would advise you that you supplement or vary the agreement of which' we have written the following as an indication according to what you consider a fair basis. We, the undersigned, hereby agree to supply bricks of quality and size to. submitted sample. We also agree to supply bricks at the rate of 200,000 per month from the 1st October, ' 1920, to the 1st April, 1921; and after that date we agree to supply 250,000 bricks per month until the 1st October, 1923, the price to bo 63s. per thousand for good quality common as sample, War Service Homes Commission to take delivery at kiln. We agree to load all lorries or drays with all dispatch. The following will be the only recognized conditions that will vary this agreement:'Wo would ask you to go into this matter, and enlarge on the above as you consider necessary, returning same to us. Yours faithfully , A not h e r letter, w r it t e n on the 1 3 t h September, shows that Mr D e a n s t ill dem u r r e d at m a k in g this contract Messrs. Henry Dean and Sons, Brickworks, Kcrr-street, Waratah. Dear Sirs, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., and note that you are not agreeable to arranging a contract. You actually state you are not in a position to make one. From the interviews we have had, I was under the impression you were prepared to grant this Commission your whole output, therefore we cannot understand why you are not in a position to make a contract, as it would hold good whether your output was nil or 100,000 per week. As we must, and intend, to assure our brick supply, and if necessary will commence construction of works large enough to supply our whole output, we would be glad to know if we are to rely on you for bricks or not. As a business man you . will, of course, realise that your word is not sufficient for us, and it is necessary that matters be arranged definitely by contract. We realise it will ' be necessary for you to use a large proportion of your bricks on your work, until such time as they are completed. We shall be glad to hear from you. Yours faithfully , On the 2-lst September the d is t r i c t officer of the ""War Service Homes Commission wrote to the Deputy-Commissioner in Sydney:Memorandum to Deputy Commissioner, Sydney. Subject: liriok Supply, Henry Dean & Sons. In answer to your verbal request for the result of interview with Mr Dean, of Henry Dean & Sons, on the 20th inst., I wish to inform you as follows:Mr Dean was very much against making a contract at the present time, his reasons being[a) Uncertainty of output. (6) Requires every second' kiln to carry on with construction of new kilns, (c) Necessity to complete various outside orders in hand. [12] (ci)His main reason is the necessity of a guarantee on our part to empty a kil n of 80,000 in four (4) days. I explained personally that the quantity of output did not effect the making of a contract, as I am assured this fir m is aiming at an output of 200,000 per week within twelve (12) months. It was finally agreed that a contract be made on basis, as follows:1. War Service Homes Commission to take the whole output of H . Dean & Sons' brickworks from date of signing con(Signed) N . H .

Open kilns are now in course of construction. ' 3. When the output reaches 130,000 weekly, Henry Dean & Sons to have right to disburse all excess outside of contract. 4. The commission guarantees to empty each kiln of 80,000 bricks within five (5) days after twenty-four (24) hours' notice of opening has been given to Newcastle office of commission. 5. If commission be not in a position to take delivery of any particular quant it y of bricks District Works Officer, Newcastle, to authorize Deans' to disburse outside of contract. This clause not to prejudice commission's liability to take output to 130,000 weekly. 6. The price for good-quality common Ibrick, equal to submitted sample, to be 63s. per 1,000. 7. The delivery to be taken by War Service Homes Commission at kiln. 8. Henry Dean & Sons agree to load all lorries or drays at kiln with all dispatch. 9. Price as aforesaid to be varied only by(a.) Increase or decrease in award rates of labour in brickyards. (&) Increase or decrease in cost of coal. 10. Delivery to be subject to climatic conditions. (Signed) N . H . COOK, We would be glad if you would have this legally phrased in the form of a contract, inDistrict Officer. serting any additional matter which may be necessary, but not drastically altering the general conditions, and return to this office to be submitted to Mr Dean for approval and sig'nature. (Signed) N . H . COOK, District Officer. I have read the correspondence in conn e x i o n with , this subject to show honourable members that the action taken by the f i r m was taken at the request of the department. The f i r m was induced to discard the whole of its p i p e - m a k i ng m a c h in e r y , and to in s t a l patent b r i c k making kilns. But , after it had in curred considerable expense, and h a d become somewhat heavily in v o l v e d, as most business firms do in transactions of 'this kind, the department matedthat owirig to an in policy ,no further -.action .was to be .taken. Although the - was in 'the office merely - awaiting legal drafting, the department unusual attitude, and the whole responsibility for the expenditure be borne - by the firm.

It ill 'becomes a government treat in this way private citizens whom it has entered into an agreement. Business men usually honour their moral obligations even if contracts have not actually been signed. Mr Dean was told by the department nized its moral obligation, but that he had no legal claim upon it. He endeavoured to arrive at an amicable settleiuient, and for some time did not go to law. In a last resort he the Court, and a - judge and which consisted of business gave a verdict-in his favour, as it was held that a contract was in fact in operation. 'Not satisfied with that decision the department appealed to .the Pull Court, i not upon the facts of the case as submitted in the first .instance, upon a point of law. The appeal was upheld owing to the fact that the contract ha'd.not been actually signed. If private individuals or commercial firms were to act in such a way they would be disgraced commercially throughout the Commonwealth; but it appears that a Government department .can .act-in this-way with impunity, merely under legal technicalities. officer at Newcastle, but .the Commissioner of ""War Service Homes forNew South Wales was for inducing the firm take ihhis .contract. The only redress which the firm now has is to appeal to this House for an inquiry into the""whole of-the facts. On the last occasion when I submitted .a similar motion J - selected as members of the proposed - select committee members from .of - the House possessing ability, who I felt - be prepared to assist vestigation. I also asked the - Minister Mr Watkins. inti- to allow 'the matter ito be inquired into alteration by the iPublic Accounts; Committee. ""The whole position .is .so unsatisfactory that agreement I have again brought .the .subject forward in - the hope that this 'Parliament adopted this will approve of the Government honoring - its moral - obligation - to reputable had to citizens. During the last Parliament I conse- was amazed to.find that.the appointment trade of the of a committee which I - suggested, and also one which the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) ad1 vocated, - which concerned thousands of of the depart- people in the City of Sydney, were opto posed by the Government. I submit the with motion to the House in the hope that this Parliament will recognize the claim3 of the firm of H . Dean and Sons, and agree to the appointment of a-committee such as I have suggested. I do not care how that it recog- the committee may be composed, ;as I believe that-if - an impartial investigation is made it will be found that the claim of the firm is f u l ly justified. Mr .LATHAM (Kooyong-Attorney approached General) [3.10];-The honourable memjury, ber for Newcastle (' Mr Watkins) is askmen, ing this House, the highest court in the land, to use his own words,'to consider and grant relief in the matter of-a claim made against the 'War Service 'Homes Commissioner by Messrs - Henry Dean.and Sons. The claim unay feetoxamined on either its but legal or on its moral basis, or on both. I quite understand that the honourable member rests his case solely upon moral grounds. The matter for the consideration of 'honourable - members is, therefore, whether in - all the circumstances of 'the case, the claim of Messrs. JEE-enry 'Dean and Sons deserves, on moral grounds, some recogtalcing shelter nition. It is important to remember, Not only the however, that the claim has already been Deputy considered in our vlaw courts, and honourable :members - ought to know iprecisely - responsible what has taken place there. The mover to under- of - the-mo tion. has, no doubt inadvertently, not - stated - quite accurately \the facts in relation to - the court proceedings. This claim was first investigated by a judge and jury .in - the Supreme Court of New South Wales. It was submitted in an alternative for m , both sides and £26,500 damages were asked. The business firm alleged, in the first place, 'that : sure would a contact'heel'been made-with it by the in an in- - War Service - Homes - Commissioner, under which the Commissioner had undertaken to purchase ihe whole of. the firm's' supplyof bricks f o n five years; Alternatively it said that the Commissioner had undertaken to buy 520,000 bricks per month for three years. The first thing that strikes one is that' the company itself was not at all sure of the exact nature of its claim. It was, as a matter of fact, so - doubtful of its position, that it . felt obliged to submit its claim in this alternative form . The verdict of the j u r y was most remarkable i u that it was given in favour of the plaintiffs, without mentioning any amount ofdamages - - If was, therefore, impossible for the judge to say which of the alternative contracts had really been made. The Wan Service Homes Commissioner subsequently appealed to the F u l l Court of New South Wales, but the groundsof appealwerenot confined to whait. the honourable member for Newcastle has-described as-the technical point whether a written record of the contract was actually signedor not. I have the. papersinconnexion - with the case before me, and I find; that there were : eighteen grounds of appeal, which challenged, every, element in the case. The court, which consisted of three judges,-.decided in favourofi the Commissioner, and set. aside the decision of the court below. Messrs. Henry. Dean and Sons,. in their turn; appealed to the High : Court, and the bench,of five judges-which heard the case,, decided, in favourofthe Commissioner-,, without calling'upon.his. counsel case was, 1 admit, decided on. a pure matter of' law: Of the nine judges who have considerecl the clffimj eight-have decided that Messrs. Dean and Sons had no legal claim.",21
57,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The judge who heard the facts of the case decided to the contrary.,24
58,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The ninth judge said nothing about it beyond entering judgment in accordance with' the verdict. It was for the j u r y to determine the facts, and' the judge of' first instance not only did not' express an opinion about them, but would'have been guilty of' disregard? ing. his duty if . he had presumed to do so. T have recited these facts, in order that honourable members might understand the real position. V do not"" suggest that there are no cases in which a moral claim outside of the four corners of the law should not be recognized *by Parliament, but I think that very careful consideration1 should be given to any claim that is made here after having been prosecuted unsuccessfully by the-claimant in the law courts. Parliament) should be thoroughly satisfied that there were moral'obligationsbefore it ' appoints' committeestoreview decisions of the-courts-. I propose now to! examine on moral grounds the decisionthat ' has ' been given by the court on legal grounds. The basis of the claim, which I wish to statequite fair l y , is that the W a r Service HomesCommissioner contemplated,, and' had-announced publicly that He contemplated, undertaking an extensive building programme. The carrying out of'that : programme would undoubtedly have in volved the obtaining of a very large quantity of bricks. Messrs. Henry Dean and Sons, who were brick-makers, naturally desired to obtain a contract to supply the bricks which the W a r Service Homes Commissioner needed, if they could get a price profitable to themselves.. ",24
59,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,That is not exactly.the position. I read letter after letter which indicated clearly that the officers of the War Service Homes Commissioner in duced' the company to undertake the supply of bricks.,24
60,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"What I have said is perfectly accurate. Messrs. Dean and> That Sons undoubtedly desired to supplybricks to the Commissioner if they could do so on a basis profitable to themselves. The suggestion is . made that officers of' the War Service Homes Commission , urged Messrs. Dean and Sons to extend their works for the purpose of supplying1 the bricks to carry out this programme, that the works were extended accordingly, that the Commissioner then altered his 1 programme, ancl that Messrs.. Deanand Sons,- who had spent, a lot of money, were disappointed because they did not receive the orderswhich' they had been led to expect. That, I thinkis a fair way of stating. the case: 1 Itraises-, first,. the quastion off principle, - and, secondly; a question of fact. So faras the question of principle is concerned, there was a-change of policy on the part"" of the Commissioner.",24
61,Mr WEST,WAR SERVICE HOMES,And also on the part of the Government.,24
62,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"F o r the present purpose the Government may be considered to be identical with the Commissioner. There was a change of policy. If a person, relying upon an announcement of policy and the continuance of that policy, spends money, is it to be conceded that he has a moral claim in the event of that policy being reversed subsequently? admit that would involve very grave considerations of a general character. Let us, for a moment, consider the effect of the application of that principle to tariff matters. Undoubtedly, tariff proposals affect the actions of business men; but, so far, it has not been considered proper to make any compensation to any citizen who has acted on his faith in a statement of the Government's policy in tariff matters. This House not only is concerned with the collection of public moneys; it is also the guardian of those moneys when collected, and there are well-recognized methods' under which alone liability in relation to public moneys can be imposed. Speaking generally, no liability can be created under which the expenditure of public moneys would take place unless it is done in accordance with the authority conferred by this Parliament, and, in the case of a business transaction, unless a contract is entered into. If this House accepted the responsibility of making compensation to people who proved that they had lost money by reason of a change of policy, a principle would be laid down which might have very far-reaching results. ask the House to consider that principle in relation to this case. Mr MAXWELT,' - Does the suggest that Messrs. Dean and Sons in curred additional expenditure simply on the strength of a public announcement of government policy?",25
63,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I am stating a general principle, which is a matter of importance. The next question to be determined is whether that principle applies to the facts of this case. What are those facts? The honourable member for Newcastle stated that the officers of the Commissioner urged Messrs. Dean and Sons to extend their works in order to supply bricks to the Commission. I call attention to the words of the letter which the honourable member read, and on which that contention is based. The letter referred to is that which apparently began the negotiations. It is dated the 20th July, 1920. That letter reveals that the Commissioner desired to make a contract. In it Messrs. Dean and Sons were in formedThe quantity of bricks being supplied by you to this Commission is very unsatisfactory. We are of opinion that this is partly due to To your being under the impression that our business is only temporary. The letter then proceeded to assure Messrs. Dean and Sons that the Commission's programme was permanent. It continuedWe are in a position to make an agreement with you to accept the maximum quantity of bricks for which you are in a position to guarantee delivery An agreement to this effect would enable you to extend your plant, if necessary, and would guarantee your output. I ask honourable members to observe particularly the words "" an agreement to this effect would enable you to extend your plant, if necessary."" In effect, the letter stated: ' ' We have a big constructional programme. We want bricks, and we want to make an agreement with you for the supply of those bricks. If you enter into siich an agreement, you can extend your works upon a basis of certainty, because we shall buy your bricks."" The Commissioner's letter makes it perfectly plain that only by entering into a contract would Dean and Sons be assured of a demand for their bricks on the part of the Commission. In presenting these facts I to the House, I propose to rely upon the evidence of Mr Dean himself and his own correspondence; I shall not refer Minister to anything said by any one else. In his evidence, before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Mr Dean stated that he was interviewed after the 20th July,, 1920, the date of the letter to which I have referred; that an officer of the Commission, Mr Cook, then spoke to him about bricks, and that he, Mr Dean, said he was not prepared at that time, to make a contract for any specified quantity of bricks, his reason being that he had a large number of orders from private customers outstanding, and that probably there were other orders to which his firm was committed and which it would have to honour. He was, however, willing to accept orders for the supply of bricks. A f t e r having received the letter which stated that he should enter into an agreement if he wanted a permanent market for his bricks, Mr Dean refused to do so. It has not been suggested that on the 11th September, 1920, any contract between the two parties had been entered into. At that time, as I have stated, the Commissioner was urging Messrs. Dean and Sons to enter into an agreement. That the fir m was not agreeable to do. On that date Messrs. Dean and Sons wroteJust at present we are not in a position to make any contract for the supply of a specified quantity of bricks per week, for the following reasons:On Monday next we start the erection of two more temporary kilns, and on completion of these it is our intention to immediately begin the building of a patent kiln. This will mean that for the next four or five months the bulk of the output will be required for our own work, the quantity depending on the number of men we are able to put on the work-the more the ibetter. The present position is not satisfactory to our customers or to ourselves, for the conditions under which we are working make it impossible to give delivery with any certainty, and the sooner the position is improved the better from every point of view; and we regard the matter of such importance that we think our 'best policy is to make the necessary developments here as speedily as possible. As soon as we have the two kilns in operation we fully expect to be able to supply you with a larger quantity of bricks than in the past, and in the meantime we will be.pleased to let you have all the bricks we can spare. More than this we cannot do under the existing conditions. From that it is plain that the firm was unwilling to enter into any contract and that they would supply on order from time to time such bricks as they could spare after they had filled the orders of their own customers. officer of the commission wrote, in reply to that letter on 13th SeptemberI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 11th, and note you are not agreeable to arranging a contract. You actually state you are not in a position to make one. ' He then proceeds to sayAs a business man, you will, of course, realise that your word is not sufficient for us, and it is necessary that matters' be arranged definitely by contract.",25
64,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Showin g the pressure they were bringing to bear upon Dean all the time.,26
65,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I agree, but the pressure was to make a contract. the whole point, and these letters show that that was so. I can sketch the remaining history of the matter shortly in this way:-Term s of a proposed contract were provisionally arranged - between Messrs. Dean and Sons and the local officer of the commission, and the price suggested was 63s. per 1,000. The Commissioner would not agree to 63s. per 1,000, and told Mr Dean so. Mr Dean admits that, and admits that there was no agreement as to price, and that he never made a contract.",26
66,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That is quite wrongThe Deputy Commissioner went to Newcastle, and found that he could not get bricks for less than 63s. per 1,000, and. instructed that that be the price fixed. The honourable gentleman will find that in the correspondence.",26
67,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The evidence of Mr . Dean is clear on the point. He waa shown a letter in which he said that there was no contract, and he was askedIs it not a fact that on 11th September you declined to enter into any contract? The answer isNo, I did not actually decline. I declined at that time. Looking at the transcript of his evidence, I find that statement repeated' several times on one page. He was not"" willing to enter into a contract at that' time. He was asked whether it was true that Mr Hutchings told him that he had received a communication from ' the Commissioner in Melbourne, stating that the Commissioner's view was that the price of 63s. was altogether too high,, having regard to the fact that coal could The be purchased in Newcastle more cheaply than in Sydney. Dean's answer to that question was "" Yes."" Then there is this evidenceWas any reference made at that interview to the Commissioner's view «s to the price of fiOs.?-He said that the Commissioner mentioned the price of 60s., and could I. see my way clear to reduce the price to 60s. Did you not then tell Mr Hutchings that you could not agree to the contract price being less than 63s. per 1,000?-Yes . That is Dean's own evidence. He gives evidence that, in fact, the parties did not agree upon the price, ancl what he was being urged to do was to make a contract to supply bricks at 60s. per That is 1,000. He would not make a contract at that price.",26
68,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Sixty-the e shillings was the price agreed upon.,27
69,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have read Mr. Dean's sworn evidence that he wastold that 63s. would not he accepted. happened in September, 192.0. Mr. Dean's case, now is that he was led to believe that large quantities of brickshe was not sure whether-hiswhole output would, be required'or only so i manyper month-would.be required at 63s..per 1,000. from' and after September, 1920. As a matter of fact, he supplied bricks on specific orders in 1920 at-the then current price of 63s. per l;000, and' in 1921 and 1922 he supplied bricksto the Commission at 68s. per 1,000.",27

84,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The department was trying to. get bricks, but Mr Dean took up the position that he would supply his own customers ""first, and let the department have what bricks he could spare. In'19.22, for the first time, the suggestion was.made, but the department was not carrying out some understanding that had been arrived at. In a - series of letters from Messrs Dean and Sons, they do not suggest that a contract was made; they merely say that a contract was drafted. It is quite plain that neither party regarded itself as bound by that d r a f t, because, as I have shown, Messrs. Dean and - Sons supplied only what bricks they could conveniently supply .according to their own idea, and - charged 68s. per 1,'0OO for most of them.

87,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have a letter from Mr Dean in which he says that only a partial statement, was taken from the evidence. - Mr LATHAM - 1I have read what Mr Dean swore when under examination. I shall read this part of it again. Bid you not then tell Mr Hutchings that you could not agree to the contract price being less than'63s. per 1,000?-Yes . On the same page of the evidence it is shown that Mr Hutchings told Mr Dean that the Commissioner would not contract on any other basis than a price of '60s. per 1,000. Messrs. Dean and Sons were in communication with the department, making a claim, but not for an alleged breach of contract. In one of the letters there is this passageNot for alleged breach of contract: that has nothing to do with the matter in ;my mind. Why this is brought into - such prominence I - do not know. I have made no claim on that ground. In 1922 the Administration of the rigbt told .ihonorable member for .Niorth .Sydney for (; Mr .W. M .

I am not suggesting that there are no cases which should be so referred. There might well be such cases, but upon the evidence of the claimant himself this case is not strong enough to warrant honourable members supporting the motion of the honourable member for Newcastle. Debate (on motion by Mr WEST ) adjourned. REFERENDUM AND INITIATIV E.",28
88,Dr MALONEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Melbourne) [3.48] I move1, That, in the opinion of this House, the referendum and initiative should be embedded into the Commonwealth Constitution, and that such question should be placed before the electors at the next general election for acceptance or rejection. 2. That contingent upon the passing of such motion it be an instruction to the Government of the day to bring in a bill to carry it into effect. The principle of the referendum, initiative, and recall comes primaril y from Switzerland, but in some of the States of America it certainly did appear a little earlier. It was known in the Italian republics, and also in the ancient history of Greece and Rome. It made Switzerfelt land a country whose borders were in - motion. He saidviolate during the last war. Germany, Austria, Italy , and Prance were fighting amongst themselves, yet Switzerland kept its borders inviolate because of the tice of its laws, which are based upon made by the referendum, initiative, and recall. There is, in Mansard, an epitome of reasons for this motion made by me on the 25th March, 1920, this House honoured me by carrying a similar resolution unanimously. mentions the various times this subagainst, ject was brought before most of the American States. Again, on the 17th August, 1923, my proposal was unfortuthey nately strongly opposed by the Prime Minister, and although it was taken difficult stage-o n the motion for the journment of the House-it was defeated only by six votes. I believe that some the Nationalists who voted with the 426 Prime Minister against the motion were really in sympathy with it . Mr . ton at that time said-The existence of that right would do away with the necessity for anything - like the warmth of feeling which exists among honorone able members, and we would, not have the spectacle of the party in power exercising its voting strength to deny honourable members on the other side of the House the opportunity to express their"" views. In other words, burning questions would not be discussed in this chamber, but settled at appointed times, possibly at a general election, once and for all, by the vote of the people. At one time in the State of Ohio there were 46 questions put to the people, and 34 of them were passed in the affirmative. I am astonished that the Country party members do not advocate this principle, because the Country party in the United States of America is one of its strongest supporters. It may interest them to know that one of the questions put to the people and carried was the expenditure of £10,000,000 for roads. Later, Mr Charlton, speaking of party government, saidWe talk a great deal about party government, but I fancy that the power of recall might prove one of the first and most effective means of breaking the system down. The people, and not individuals, would then have control of Parliament. The present Speaker (Sir Littleton Groom) spoke during the debate, and I that he had some sympathy with the There are certain aspects of the recall which are, perhaps, worthy of discussion. Honourable members might find it in justeresting to read the speeches that were Messrs. Charlton, Parker Moloney, Brennan,. Mahony, and Anstey. the In the journal known as the American Academy of Political and Social Science, when .published in the United States ' of America, there is a magnificent collection It of . arguments for, and in some cases adopting the referendum, initiative, and recall. I recommend that publication, to honourable members.' Prom it will find that there were 46 appeals to the people in sixteen years, and that at a during that period fourteen separate adStates adopted, in one shape or another, the principles of the referendum, initiaof tive, and recall. In 1920, there were cities in the United States of America that had adopted this principle, and it Charlwas the means of doing more to prevent graft than any other law passed in those cities. The late David Syme-the term "" late "" should not, I think, be applied to who made for himself the position which he hacl in this country, because those who do anything great in art and literature or public life do not die, their influence is immortal-in his book columns, Representative Government in England, makes this remarkWhat is wanted is a system of continuous representation; and one very simple and cient way of obtaining it is by providing the constituencies shall have the same power over their representatives which the Crown exercises over Parliament, namely, the power of dismissal. Further on, he saysI t would be far better if the constituencies who were dissatisfied with their members called upon them to resign, and quietly replaced by men whom they could trust. I look forward to the time when the position of a member of Parliament will not be so precarious as perhaps it is When an honourable member has proved to his constituents that he is doing his work satisfactorily, he should remain in Parliament as their representative. As an instance, I may state that for 37 years now I - have given the majority of my electors the right to recall me by petitionthe ing me to resign. In 1889 I was elected by a small majority of 222. My total votes were over 700, and if a petition signed by 360 of my electors asking for my resignation had been presented to I should have resigned the next day. That is the pledge that I have always given to my electors, except when I was elected unopposed. I have with me an interestof ing leaflet containing the strongest ments that I have been able to formulate in favour of the referendum, initiative, and recall. The time may come when an honourable member will be elected to Parthe liament contingent upon good behaviour, and only his constituents will have right to recall him. Judge Isaacs, sisted by Judge Higgins, made a notable fight in the Federal Convention for the referendum, but unfortunately it was not adopted in the Constitution. A Gothat vernment with a large majority in both Houses would be able, if it dared, to take away the voting right of every man and woman in Australia. But if that right were safeguarded Constitution, it could not be taken away without the permission of the people. That is the reason why I desire to see the referendum, initiative, and recall enacted. At one time the Bulletin was firm supporter of those principles; whether or not it has been influenced by the large advertisements which now appear in its I cannot say, but it is no longer as staunch a believer in the referendum, initiative, and recall as it was. The Australian Natives Association has adopted effithis reform, and advocates it through its that many fine branches. The Labour party, too, has adopted it, but the recall has been excluded from the party's Federal platform. Honourable members who have studied this question know, however, that soon after the referendum and initiative become law, the recall, the coping stone them of this splendid edifice of political economy, will be added. Some of the highest officers of. the Nationalist party have been supporters of these principles, now. and one is a vice-president of the Referendum, Initiative, and Recall League in Victoria. Nationalists, however, have been diffident about including this plank in their platform. Various municipalities have adopted it, so that money cannot be borrowed or expended until the will of ratepayers has been ascertained by a poll. Both Gladstone and Lord Salisbury, men of opposite political parties, supported the referendum, which at one time was the third plank in the platform of me, the Conservative party in England. The last constitution evolved by the genius of the British race, thanks to the sympathy of the late King Edward and the support the House of Commons, namely the arguconstitution of Ireland, includes the initiative and referendum, and that, in my opinion, makes it the finest constitution enjoyed by any people living under British flag. In the splendid little island of Tasmania, a bill providing for the the referendum and initiative has been aspassed by the Legislative Assembly, and I hope that the Legislative Council, too. will have the good sense to adopt it. If it does not, I hope that the Government of State will follow the example of Labour Governments in Queensland and New South Wales, and abolish the House of Fossils. In New South Wales, Mr. Lang,_ who' appears to be the strongest in the Premier who has ever controlled the destinies of that State, has said definitely that if Sir Joseph Carruthers attempts., as he has said he will, to insert in. the bill for the amendment of the constitution a an amendment to provide for the adoption of. the referendum, and initiative, the Government will accept it. I. hope that Sir. Joseph Carruthers isacting sincerely; hut I. cannot recollect any previous-proposal by him during, the last 30 years to trust the people entirely, as this principle implies.. However, I. have a high regard for him personally, and I endorse his scheme, to settle 1,000,000 settlers on 1,000,000 farms, and if he is now a true believer, in the referendum, initiative, and recall, I. welcome him into the fold, even as an eleventh-hour recruit. principles might have been part of Australia's Constitution today but for that accursed' murder of human, beings which we call war. Andrew Fisher, who never lied and was trusted, by all,, pledged himself during theelection, which gave his party a majority, in this Parliament, to introduce the referendum and initiative, and to provide pensions for widows. But the war absorbed all our finances, changed, the ideals of men and women, and left the world poorer not only by the murder and mutilation of millions of soldiers,but also by. the death, through starvation and. disease, of a very much greater number of innocent men, women, and childrren. What stronger preventive of such horrors: could there be than a law requiring, a referendum to precede anydeclaration of war ? No. finer deterrent of legalized, murder has ever-been evolved by. the brain of man. At the present time there is: a difference of opinion between some States of. the Commonwealth in. regard to the 44-hours working week. In. South.Africa, that, is alreadythe lawof the. land. - Thanks to the wise advice given by the late. Alfred Deakin > to a South Africanroyal commission-, thai; visited Australia, a law promulgated, by the South African Parliament operates throughout' the: Union, and from the 1st December, 1924, it became the law of: the land that every skilled worker in the building, trades should.receive at least 2s; 9d. per hour for a week of* 44'hours:. The avowed'.purpose of that'is to discourage overtime, the opinion, being held that continuous employment, is: more beneficial to a country than a system"" of overtime, which connotes, the. alternation of abnormal earnings and unemployment. The. maximum penalty for, am offence against this law. is a fine - of £500, or. Dr Maloney. imprisonment for two years, or both. When I was in Capetown I . ascertained that, its white, population of 112,000 persons did not include one"" plasr terer. I was told that there were two bricklayers in the community, but I could not find them. When Senator Whiteside, of the South African Parliament,. who had' been a worker on the? tramways in Victoria, and is now Commissioner forRailways in South Africa, came to Australia, I said These to him, ""Do I understand this law to mean that if any man, white-, coloured or black, works at those skilled trades hemust be paid at Mr least 2s. 9d. per, hour.?"" - He answered that that was the law, and, to their credit, the employers in South Africa formed a council, upon which' the workers in the building trades had representation, and raised the wage in some parts-of South Africa from 2s. 9d. to 3's: 6d. per h'oUr: Honourable members will understand that there must have been some reason for the slow development of South Africa, in comparison with that' of Australia. Prior to the opening - of-' the Suez Canal, only one of every four ships that', went to the Cape came to Australia. Why have not more"" white people settled in that great country^? Because they bad to compete in employment with the blacks and half-castes. To-day aBritisher holding an appointment"" in South Africa receives, a higher-wage than is paid'in any part of Australia other than Ford's motor works atGeelong. If Australia adopted the referendum,. initiative, and recall,', the standardization of hours; wages, and other, working conditions throughout Australia could be easily effected. To-day there are in the Commonwealth six. different arbitration laws, and different systems, of industrial tribunals, awarding different-rates of pay and working hours. I come now to the strongest argument I can adduce in favour of the principle of the referendum, initiative, and recall. A clergyman quoted against the principle of the referendum, the demand of the populace of. Jerusalem for the release of Bar abbas and the crucifixion of Christ. I said "" Having regard to the fact that Christ's opponents had used money and persuasion to inflame the mindso f the populace against Him; it ' waslittlewonderthat they demanded that He be sacrificed."" I have never permitted my brain to formulate or my lips to utter a word against any religion. times I may have cause to criticise ministers of the Gospel; and adherents of a religion, but I never.assail any man's faith. So I said, ' in all sincerity, to my clerical friend, "" God never created anything H is equal - or H is superior. Why , then, should the electors, who are the creators of Parliament, once in every three years, make an institution more powerful than themselves?"" The referendum, initiative, and recall will give to the people control of Parliament at all times. No country, however richly endowed by nature, can contain a happy, contented race of healthy human beings if the laws governing it are unjust . or are badly administered. History shows clearly that countries poorly endowed with natural resources can contain healthy, happy, contented people if the laws are just and founded upon democratic principles. The true foundation of any democracy must be the initiative referendum and recall. Switzerland is not so favourably situated as is Scotland in this regard, but a genius to whom I .have already referred has compared Scotland, with all its advantages, with Switzerland, though he gives the palm to Switzerland. On one occasion I listened to a speech in this Chamber which lasted for nine hours. What would happen in Switzerland-that school house of Europe-if a speech which lasted for nine hours were delivered, 'say, by a German? Switzerland is a trilingual country, and in such a case a French member would ' 'have the right to say, "" This is not my vernacular. I desire the speech to be translated."" An y one who has experince in the translation of speeches-as MT . Speaker must have had when representing Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nationsknows that the translation of a speech takes longer than its delivery in .the first instance. Therefore, another nine hours would be required to complete the work of translation, making eighteen hours, before the speech was available in German and French. An Italian representative would then have the right to say, "" . I wish the speech to be translated into Italian."" This would in ' volve .another nine .hours' work, or 27 hours in all. In Switzerland they dispose of burning questions by appealing to the people. If this Government wished Some- to settle a difficult question, especially if an election were pending, it eould be left ' to the arbitrament of the-people. I have much pleasure in submitting the motion for the favourable consideration of the House. Debate (on the motion by Mr GIBSON) adjourned. NAVIGATION BILL.  That he have leave to bring in a bill for an Act to amend the Navigation Act 1912-1925. Bill presented and read a first time. RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from .20th January (vide page 220), on motion by Mr . HILLThat the bill be now read a second time.",29
89,Mr LACEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Gray) [4.21] - The bill, as has been explained by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) , is to r at if y an agreement entered into between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr Bruce) and the Premier of South ' Australia (Mr Gunn). It is also proposed to carry out an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia in 1910, which is embodied in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act and which provides that the Commonwealth shall construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. Since that agreement was entered into by the late . Mr Alfred Deakin on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the late"" Hon. Thomas Price on behalf of the South Australian Government, various interpretations have been placed upon its provisions, generally by persons endeavouring togain some advantage fOT the' States which they re: presented. It was an honourable agreement entered into by the respective parties, and one to which effect should have been given at an earlier date. Time after time the construction of the north-south railway, as it is now 'known, has been before the people, particularly at election time for propaganda purposes, and party leaders have said that immediate action would be taken in the building of the line if they were returned with a majority. I congratulate the Government upon the action it, has taken in bringing the bill before the House so early in the session. I also wish to commend the Premier of South Australia (Mr Gunn) for the active in terest he has taken in the subject, and for the efforts made in bringing the agreement to fruition. From time to time this proposal has been the stalking horse of those contesting elections, and I heard a candidate for a seat in another place state that the Premier of South Australia was responsible for holding up the present agreement. The Minister will, I am sure, agree that that gentleman is largely responsible for the satisfactory position which has now been reached. In moving the second reading of the bill the Minister said a good deal concerning the potentialities of the Northern Territory, which have been discussed in this chamber on many occasions. Having had the privilege of travelling through the Northern Territory since I last spoke on this subject, I realise that a good deal of what I have heard and read in the past has been said or written by people unacquainted with the actual conditions in that large tract of country. Last year I accompanied the party of which the Minister was a member, who, last night, gave the House his impressions of the country. His statement concerning the potentialities of the Northern Territory is not in any way exaggerated, because at the time the t r ip was made, the conditions generally were most unfavorable. State officers who had visited the country before stated on several occasions, when one day's journey ended, that the country to be traversed on the following day would be better; but, owing to the drought which prevailed, they were disappointed to find that the conditions were not as they expected. I travelled over country which had not had any rain for three and a half years, and in these circumstances the Minister saw some of the country at its worse. Notwithstanding this, he was able to give the House a satisfactory report, and to express the opinion that a line should have been built years ago. The construction of the proMr Lacey. ] posed line has been delayed, I believe, owing to the fact that the existing railway terminates .at Oodnadatta, a township which is surrounded by some of the worse country in Central Australia. All the stock which travels from the north, of course, comes to Oodnadatta, so that the surrounding country is always in an eaten-out condition. Travellers, therefore, invariably see it in the worse of conditions. The party of which the Minister for Works and Railways was a member went - SO miles beyond Alice Springs, and they found that although there were patches on the road, the farther north they went from . Oodnadatta the better the country became. Beyond Alice Springs it was extraordinarily good. The area known as B u r t Plains was so good that some of the settlers there had already gone in for sheep, and were doing well. The greatest difficulty in the way of development is the lack of transportation facilities. Practically every visitor to the Territory returns south with the opinion that the North-South railway should have been built before now. It is a great satisfaction to South Australians, myself among them, that at last the agreement of fifteen years ago is to be honoured. I wish to take this opportunity of expressing the hope that the Minister will try to do something to improve the cattle transportation facilities on the Oodnadatta line. On the 27th August last I asked him in this chamber the following questions :1. Whether' it is a fact that cattle trucks of a large size are being constructed at Port Augusta, for use on the railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta? 2. If so, in view of the fact that the stock-owners definitely state that cattle travelled on large trucks are more susceptible to damage and bruising, which thus involves cruelty, will he give consideration to the matter, and to the objection of the stock-owners, and, if satisfied that the objection is valid, have the smaller sized truck constructed? His replies were1. Under contract let in April, 1924, 32 bogie cattle wagons are being constructed in Adelaide for traffic on the Oodnadatta railway. 2. The wagons were designed after long experience in the transport of very large numbers of cattle over long distances in hot climates. The wagons are being constructed in such manner as will facilitate the handling of cattle and land them at destination in good condition, and with - a minimum of bruising. In the Northern Territory, and in other parts of Australia, similar types of wagons are carrying to freezing works thousands of cattle from consignors, who are most particular as to manner in which the cattle are handled, who insist that bruising of the stock must be avoided. The fact is, however, that the cattle raisers are very dissatisfied with the ment their stock receives in these big trucks during transit from Oodnadatta. On this matter the South Australian the Stock-owners' Association wroteto the Commonwealth Railways Commissoner on the 15th September, 1925, as follows: At the annual meeting of members of association, the following resolution was mously carried :- "" In the opinion of this sociation, the new cattle trucks which been and are being installed on the Commonwealth railway lines are not, owing to climatic conditions existing in this State, suitable the transport of stock over long distances, that strong representations be made to the ally it reaches right to Darwin. Commonwealth Railways Commissioner with a view of having improvements effected in trucks as follows :(1) That a partition should be the trucks. (2) That provisions be made for more tilation on the sides. (3) That all trucks should be covered."" I do not propose to read the whole of the . letter, but will content myself with observing that it indicates a thoroughly unsatisfactory position from the stock-owners' point of view. The large trucks are not suitable for the conditions that prevail in these far northern areas. These stock-owners are men of considerable experience, who would not complain without just cause. I trust that the Minister will give earnest consideration to their suggestions. Only last year I met a gentleman at Port Augusta who uses these trucks a good deal. me that on one occasion he purchased, in the north, a number of horses for Indi a n remount purposes, and had them sent from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta in one of these big trucks, but they arrived in such a shocking condition that they were of no use whatever for remount work. Some of them, as a matter of fact, had to be shot. If the present conditions are allowed to continue, stock-owners - will cease to use the railway. It is well known that, when feed is to be had en route, they prefer fo send their stock by road. If the railways into the interior are to pay, the transportation conditions must be greatly improved. I was glad to hear the Minister mention last night the possibility of mineral developments in Central Australia. He did not, by any the means, exaggerate the prospects. North and of Alice Springs there are many mining shows that are likely to yield splendid results. The Home of Bullion mine, to treatwhich the Minister referred, is, I am informed on good authority, only one of many similar mines. The evidence that last parliamentary party to visit this country obtained from unbiased persons was that Central Australia was rich in minerals, but that their development was this altogether dependent upon the proviunanision of railway facilities. The railway aswhich it is now proposed to build will not have gonear the Home of Bullion mine, which is about 150 miles from Alice Springs, for but I hope that very soon it will be and continued further north, u n t i l eventuMany these honourable members yesterday discussed at length the value of the mining indusplaced in try to the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that there will be no unnecesvensary delay in making it possible to develop the mineral resources of Central Australia. Included in the proposal before us is the building of a line from Red Hill to Port Augusta. Red Hill , which may not be very well known to honourable members, is the terminus of a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railway 106 miles from Adelaide. It is only 30 miles south by south-west from the important industrial centre of Port Pirie. - Prom Red Hill to Adelaide it is proposed to lay a third rail, in order to provide a 4-ft. 8-in. gauge line from Port Augusta to Adelaide. W it h the standard gauge line extended from Red Hill to Port He told Augusta, the distance between Adelaide and Port Augusta by r a i l would be 193 miles, as against 260 miles by the existing route via Terowie. Moreover, there would be no break of gauge as at present. The Minister said last night that the construction of a railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta would be the subject of inquiry by the Public Works Committee. Personally, I am glad that that will be so, as the route tentatively fixed by the surveys which have been made is not, in my opinion, the best one for the railway. It is not proposed to extend the 5-ft. 3-in. railway to Port Pirie, and it is intended that the 4-ft. 8^-in. line shall be not nearer than 1 mile 50 chains to that town. Last year, in reply to a question, the Minister informed me that it was intended. that - the line should not enter Port _ Germein, but that the railway station was to - three-quarters - of a mile from that town. Another survey left the railway 4 miles from Port Pirie, and about l£ miles 'from Port Germein. ' These two towns should be on the new standard gauge railway. Instead of that railway being used only for the conveyance of passengers between Adelaide and Port Augusta, it should be made to serve that .portion of South Austioned, tralia - which at present does not enjoy proper railway facilities. Port Germein is a shallow seaport 18 miles north of Port Pirie. Communication with Adelaide is obtained by means of .a small boat fortnightly. If the railway between laide and Port Augusta were to pass through Port Pirie, the distance by rail between that place and Port Augusta would be about 60 miles. At present, to travel by rail between those two towns necessitates a journey of 1S2 miles. To considered. make a deviation 'from the route suggested to enable the railway to pass statement through Port Pirie would prevent the subthat it willfrom division of fifteen farms, whereas if line were taken further - west that would not be necessary. Moreover,- the struction of the railway in a more westbe erly position, would mean that .less drift would be encountered. Last I presented a petition, signed 'by thouHouse, sands of ratepayers in that portion South Australia, in connection with this matter. Apparently, the idea of both State and Eederal Railways Commissioners is to .prevent overlapping .in railway ters, but it should not be difficult to the necessary adjustments in the acby counts. Any commissioner who was into capable of doing so would not be fit to retain his position. Last night the ister for Works and Railways referred ,thepossibility of a big silver-lead being opened up in the Northern TerriAustralia tory. As it would be impracticable convey .the coal, coke, limestone, other materials necessary'for smelting to the mine because of - their bulky nature and necessary high - freights, any ore obtained - from it 'would have to be transported to a seaport in South Ausshould tralia for smelting. It has been gested that in that event smelters would be erected at Port Augusta, but at Mr Lacey. newPirie the Broken - Hill Associated Smelters Proprietary - Company Limited be has now the largest smelting works in the world, and it is not likely that while that plant remains there another will be erected at'Port Augusta. ""With the improved machinery and .appliances at the existing-,plant at Port Pirie that plant would be capable of dealing with five times the .quantity - of ore 'it now .treats. In view of the .possibility .1 ;hav.e ""men1 it is extremely desirable that - the standard .gauge railway should pass through Port 'Pirie. 'With a railway station '1 mile '50 chains '.from the town, .transhipment .of the.ore would be necessary, to say nothing of the other 'disadAdevantages of a break-of-gauge station.",32
90,Mr HILL,WAR SERVICE HOMES,If the South Australian Government is prepared - to .give tto the Commonwealth the exclusive right to enter Port Pirie by rail the-suggestion of the honourable member will be .seriously,35
91,Mr LACEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I am glad to have that the Minister, and hope lead to negotiations between the the two Governments with beneficial results to the whole .of'the people of Auscontralia. No engineering difficulties would encountered by connecting Port Pirie sandwith this railway. I hope that the bill year will have a speedy passage through - this and that in dealing with it honof orable members will recognize that an agreement between South Australia and the the Commonwealth has been in existence for fifteen years and has not yet been mathonoured, notwithstanding that the make people have been told from time to time various Ministers - that if returned power the matter would be dealt with. In spite of the different interpretations Minwhich have been placed on that agree to ment, the .fact remains that - it is an mine agreement between the Slate of South and the Commonwealth, and to that no other parties are interested. and Efforts are being made by some of the representatives ..of other States to .obtain a deviation of the North-South railway, with a view to obtaining some advantage for those States; but - no such .proposal be entertained. I hope that the sugagreement will he honoured, and that before long the people of South AusPort tralia will see the fulfilment of a \ cherished dream.",35
92,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Swan) [.4:59.]. - It should, be clearly understood, that this agreement which we are now asked to ratify, is not only for the construction of a. railway across Australia from north to south, but . that . it is for of other, railways also. A good deal of troublehas been experienced in connection with the old' agreement, and the Commonwealth has been compelled to build a. railway south from Darwin. From my knowledge of the country I feel sure that for the proper development of' the'north, apart from - the construction of a railway from Oodnadatta to AliceSprings, it would be better if a railway wereconstructed from either Derby or - Broome; in Western Australia, easterlythrough Hall'sCreek to Camooweal, in Queensland. We were, however-, bound by the agreement to the Worth-South line - This bill contains an agreement for-the construction of a proposed new railway-. Honourable members will notice - that' in paragraph 2ofthe schedulei t is stated that - 1 The. Commonwealth undertakes that, as soon as the necessary surveys and estimates are complete, it will introduce into and take all reasonablesteps to have enacted. by. the Parliament' of the - Commonwealth-, legislation authorizing, this agreementto bei performed by the Commonwealth. It isprovided that the Commonwealth shall'construcfa railway.on.a 4-ft.. 8^-in. gaugef r o m Port Augusta to Red Hill , and provisionis furthe r made for the layingof a third rail'betweenPort Augusta and Adelaide. 1=believe that the idea is a good one; and-that it would be a good. thing for the.

But, before this Parliament commits itself, to the construction of a railway, honourable members: should havef u l l information before them.. In this, bill we. are making apromise to South Australia, that we w i ll build this railway, though, we. have no information about it . The agreement .makes, provision, for, the. laying of a third rail.between Port.Augusta and Adelaide. There has been a good, deal of. investigation by railway engineersi and others into the safety and practicability of a. third rail, but I . do not knowt h at ' it can be stated. authoritatively; that at h i r d r a i l - can: be introduced into arailway system 1 Agreement Bill. 275 without grave danger.' If it can, the adoption of such a course-might-overcome 1 the difficulty of the break's of gauge in our railway systems generally. The matter is-- one about whieb we the construction should be very careful. 1 1 The Minister should give ussome> assure ance tbatj bypassing' this bill, Parliament' will not be binding itself to the construction of a new railway-. Once this bill is passed, it will be contended' that a pledge has been given to South Australia,- and that Aveought to carry 1 it out. Arewe going' to - pledgeourselves to this without information which',- in m y 1 opinion, is essential before we can decide : upon the construction of' such aline? I have madenopersonal investigations ! withregard to the use of the third"" rail, but I know that some"" trialsof itsuse were made in New South* Wales; closeto the Victorian border.

97,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"No matter what report of the committee may be, it will the duty of Parliament to do its best carry out the agreement it has ratified. should like to have an assurance from Minister that we shall not be committed to the construction of the new railway until we have sufficient information before us. I believe that if we had direct line on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge from Adelaide to Port Augusta, the' transcontias nental railway would have a far better prospect of being a financial success. not indulging in criticism with a view prevent the construction of such a line. But it is questionable whether we are being asked to commit ourselves to a fair ment between the Commonwealth and South Australian Government. HonorWhen able members will remember that in case of the construction of the railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane the monwealth undertakes to bear a certain proportion of the cost, and the New South as Wales and Queensland Governments adopted. undertake to share in the cost. Under the agreement now before us, the monwealth is to pay the whole cost of the construction of the proposed line. agree that the construction of the line would be of great advantage to passengers to and from Western Australia, and in connection with the carriage of mails tween Fremantle and Adelaide. It would help to make the transcontinental raillong way a financial success; but I repeat we should have more specific information honourable as to what the proposed line will cost, reports of engineers in support of route proposed.",37
98,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Adelaide) [5.8] - I wish to compliment those responsible for the introduction of this measure, and especimade. ally the Premier of South Australia, who has evinced so much concern about the long-promised development of the NorthParern Territory, and has, I think, brought authoits accomplishment within measurable distance. I am reminded of the statements which used to be made about the and Murray Valley, and what might be done the with it. It was due to the practical mind honof the late Tom Price, of South Austhat operations are now being carbound ried, on in locking the Murray, and makproing it the asset which it should be to the Commonwealth. I think that the action go beprovided for under this bill has been much too long delayed. The honourable the member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has be suggested the construction of a line from to Derby across to Camooweal, but I canI not believe that such a line would have the the same effect in the rapid development of the Northern Territory as would a line giving us direct communication beplaced tween Port Darwin and the south. The a line bisecting the Commonwealth north and south should be carried out as quickly possible. All the plans submitted to us show that the valuable parts of the NorI am thern Territory are the Victoria Downs to country, the Barkly Tableland, and the mineral country of the centre, and if the Northern Territory is to be properly deagreeveloped it will be by a line from Port the Darwin to Adelaide via Oodnadatta. such a line is constructed there may the be branch lines running to Derby and to the Pellew Islands. I believe that Mr. ComHobler reported in favour of such a scheme. I personally do notmind so long the best route and that which will give the best results to the Commonwealth is It is pleasant to note that the . agreement which has existed for go long Combetween the Commonwealth and South Australia is at last being honoured. It I has always appeared to me that the use of a third rail ought to be possible to overcome the difficulty of a break of gauge. Its use through big stations with much inbeterlocking gear might be found difficult, but it should be possible to use it over distances to overcome the difficulties that experienced from breaks of gauge. The member for Swan (Mr. and Gregory) takes some exception to the the proposal for the laying of a third rail, and I direct his attention to paragraph c of clause 6 of the schedule, in which provision for an alternative is That paragraph states that if the use of a third rail is considered impracticable or dangerous, a railway on a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge should be constructed, so that always there will be a continuous railway on that gauge from Port Augusta to the central railway station in Adelaide. I hope, with the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey), with whom I have had several conversations on this matter, that when inquiring into this work the Minister and the Public Works Committee will carefully consider the claims of towns to which railway com-. munication means so much. I have been led to believe that some of the surveys take the railway to within 1£ miles of places like Port Piri e and Port Germein, without actually running into those centres. I am unable to dogmatize as to the route which should be followed, but I hope no mistakes will be made which would prevent the line offering the greatest facilities possible for development. I trust that the best brains will be devoted to its construction. It may be suggested that I do not know what I am talking about; but I have in mind the fact that somewhere back in the 80's, when the line was constructed to the hills near Adelaide, provision was made for two tunnels and for a Yankee bridge, over which a great many people were afraid to travel. Though the contour of the country and engineering principles have not altered in the meantime, only about two years ago the line was altered in such a way that one tunnel and the skeleton bridge were done away with. I presume that with the advice of the South Australian Railways Commissioner, whose qualifications induced the Premier of that State to appoint him to his position, Mr Bell, and the Public Works Committee, we may look for the adoption of a line which will give the best results. I compliment the Government, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) , and the Premier of South Australia, upon this measure to deal with the North-South railway. I hope that before this Parliament dissolves the railway will be completed, because I am sure that it will be an asset to the Commonwealth and turn what is now a white elephant into something of value to the Commonwealth.",37
99,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Richmond) [5.15] Although I am nJeased that something is at last being done to construct a railway from the north to the south of Australia, this agreement does not quite meet with my approval. I object to the route agreed upon by the Federal and South Australian Parliaments. I do not take a parochial view of this matter. The speeches delivered by honourable members representing South Australian constituencies naturally favour the route proposed by the Government; but I would remind honourable members that the loss on the railway, as outlined by the Minister last night, will , of course, have to be met by the people of Australia. When the Northern Territory transfer was being effected, Messrs. Deakin, Lyne and Forrest represented the Commonwealth, and Messrs. O'Loughlin, Peake arid Price represented South Australia. I have been given to understand that Mr Deakin would not agree to the stipulation desired by South Australia that the: line should run direct from the Northern Territory to South Australia. He insisted that the matter of the route should be left open. . To comply with the agreement the railway must pass through the northern border of South Australia, but it is possible for the line to take a more easterly route than is now proposed by the Government. It could pass into Queensland somewhere in the neighbourhood of Birdsville, and even west of it , and yet comply with the agreement. Mir. FENTON - That is not so.",38
100,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The honourable member should look at the map in the library.,38
101,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,We should honour the agreement.,38
102,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The construction of the easterly route would honour the agreement.,38
103,Mr LACEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is the honourable member familiar with the country between Marree and Birdsville?,38
104,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have seen some of that country. Mr Deakin would not agree to any definite route being decided upon, as the line might possibly go through Queensland after leaving South Australia.",38
105,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,That is not correct.,38
106,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"In reply to the honourable member I shall quote from , a speech made by Mr O'Loughlin, Commissioner of Crown Lands, on the 15th October, 1907, when the Northern Territory Transfer Bill was introduced by him into the. South Australian Parliament. His speech is reported in the South Australian Hansard, as follows:Numerous objections have been made to the agreement, on the ground that there ought to be a stipulated time in which to connect the. Territory with South.. Australia by a line of railway, and which route it should take. They held, this opinion, but in discussing the question' with' Mi ; Deakin--he pointed' out, and properlyi so, that, it would, be - unwise to bind the-. Commonwealth:. Government to construct the line. of. railway, within a stipulated-. time. Mr Deakin-, however, undertook to construct the line from Port Darwin through Central Australia , to join. the existing line, at Oodna-: datta,'. or' to go throughwhat was: considered to be very much better country--fro m Pine Creek,, via, Camooweal,. down alongside the borders of'Queensland, and .the Northern Territory westof Birdsville, and downto Port Augusta, via Hergott. Mr OTiOUgHinsaid that the route via Camooweal' down alongthe borders of the Territory and.' Queensland' west of Birdsville would go through what was considered' to be much better country. Mr Foster. - The original agreement especially excludes that proposal.",38
107,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The H o n . R. Butler was also of the opinion that the line should be constructed west of Birdsville. He. is reported, in ' the - S.outh. Australian Hamsard as.follows:He disapproved of. the, proposal to hand over any, ofi our railways, to the Commonwealth. He would-not oppose the eastern route. (The Commissioner of Crown. Hands - "" Theagreement provides that the railway must come through South;. Australian territory-."") It-certainly touched the. territory of. thisState, but only a corner, of - it, and then: iti passed three-quarters 'of. the. way through' Queensland territory If theeasternroute were agreed upon, tWere must be some' definite 1 stipulation concerning the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta. Thati. speech; shows; that? at: the: time of making the transfer of the Northern Territoryfrom' South Australia, to the Commonwealth; the eastern route was favoured. The H o n . R. Butleris further reported^-*He would be prepared' to start from - the present-end if-the Commonwealth - started; from PineCreek, and, agreed, to meet the South. Australian, line at, a point to be, arranged. If that were done, they would know what South Australia was to get. Under the agreement! they would not know what South, Australia, would get out of-the ment. The Federal line would i enter Queensland; and it. would be years before South Australia got a through line. Prom those speeches we must conclude that when the Territory was transferred the eastern route was favoured. L cannot understand the presentchange of i opinion, in view of the geographical positions, of the two lines. If a line is constructed fro m Hergott,, now called Marree, . in . a direct, northerly direction;, it will pass through the northern, border of South Australia, and will.still,comply , with the original agreement if* ito entersQueensland. The boundary line betweenth'e Northern Territory - andSoutbi Australia is the 26th parallel of latitude, and'from the. point at which it meetsthe Queensland border it: runs easterly for a. considerable distance to the 141st meridian of longitude. Mr O'Loughlin is also re- ported-in the South Australian Bnnsm-d as follows: - Subjecttothe provisions - of this act, and the agreement, and of. the. actsincorporated with tliisact, the Commonwealth-(1 ) For the purpose of carrying out,, in accordance with the agreement, its undertaking to construct, or cause to be constructed, the transcontinental railwayline from Port Dar* win southwards to a point' on the Port Atagusta railway, may construct, or causeto be constructed, as part of such transcontinental railway, a railway in South Australia proper from a .point on the Port Augusta, railway, to connectat a point on the northern boundary of.

Australia, to connect the railway at a/ point on the northern boundary of South' Australia proper. Mr LACEY ;-That , means the boundary, between the NorthernTerritory! and South Australia. Mr R l . GREEN - The agreement does not' say so.",39
108,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,-It meansthat the line . should bewholly within the Northern Territory and Seuth Australia . 1 Mr R. . GREEN - It does not mean anything of the sort.,39
109,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Eminen t lawyers in South Australia, and Mr Deakin, saiu so.",39
110,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have quoted fro m the speech of the South Australian Com-arrange- missionerof' Crown - Lands to-- show - that when introducing theoriginal legislation in the-- South'- AustralianParliament he said' that the railwayshould go near 1 Birdsville. I comenow. to the merits of these two routes. The present' line from Marree. to Oodnadatta is-2:47! miles , long, and' runs - through very poor country, ' some of it being saltand. below sea' level. Tihe proposed route from Oodnadatta to Alice Springsis 297 mileslong: A i line fromMarree to Birdsville! would bes 280 -.miles in ;length, or, roughly, the same distance as from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The Minister for 'Works and Railways '(Mr .Hill) admitted last night that the western route will pass through ,poor country. Those of us who have travelled over the .present line as far as Oodnadatta know that it passes through poor - country - drought. The average .annual rainfall at Charlotte Waters is only 5 inches,. at Alice Springs 10 inches, and at Barrow Creek 12 inches - eastern route will tap country with an",39
111,Mr HILL,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The average rainfall at Alice Springs over the last 45 years has been ill inches - 550 miles through which the 'line proMr :E. GREEN -.Eve n that is quite insignificant. If the line followed 'the route through Birdsville and Western Queensland to the BarJily Tableland, the actual distance between Adelaide and Darwin would be only 40 miles more than by the .route - which the Minister has proposed. But the - railway would traverse .country (having a rainfall that would permit - of successful settlement. I could not help thinking .last night that the whole of - the arguments which the .Minister adduced against the Kingoonya to Alice Springs route were equally applicable to the area :between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. He spoke of the diffieulty of obtaining water by - sinking, and said that at Todmorden station no rain had fallen i or .two and a half years. Through 'such country Parliament is asked to build a railway. - I aek honourable members to consider this proposition on its .merits and ito free their minds of bias. I admit that if the railway followed the eastern deviation it would 'pass through very poor country'for'the 'first 200 miles north of Marree.",40
112,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"'What is the rainfall of standardization. at Birdsville? ' Mr JR. GREEN""-About 15 inches .per annum. Mr 'POSTER - Nonsense' ! Mr E. GREEN - That information was given to me by a gentleman who has lived there for many years. The counferent proposition. try .for about 200 miles north-east of Marree is very similar to that between Marree and Oodnadatta, but a line built from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs will traverse .550 .miles of bad country.",40
113,Mr LACEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That .is not so Mr JS. GREEN-On ""the - BirdBvillo route the 'line will run into - country having, an assured rainfall, 'will adequately serve .the ""Northern Territory, - and'will honour'the agreement made with South Australia. The Barkly Tableland .is said'to be the - only .part of Australia that has never experienced a The dine I am advocating will traverse .that tableland, and connect with the existing railway from '.Darwin to Pine - Greek. If a .railway.on the assured rainfall, and traverse only 200 : miles of - poor country, instead of the posed by the - Government will .run, - the House must agree that the eastern route is the-better. Much emphasis has been .laid upon the alleged 'mineral wealth in the Macdonnell ranges. Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie were at one time enormously rich, and still have large quantities of .lowrgrade ore, but notwithstanding railway facilities, water supplies, and other aids .to development, .Coolgardie is almost extinct, and Kalgoorlie is on .the decline. I - cannot understand why honourable .members should expect '.the - future of the Macdonnell range mineral areas 'to be any brighter -.than the record of 'the eastern gold-fields of Western .Australia. The declared policy of the Commonwealth - Government includes the unification of railway gauges; \yet ;the Government .proposes to make an .arrangement - with a State Government for the construction - of a railway on the 3-ft. '6-in. .gauge, thus helping - to continue and aggravate the break of gauge evil. The very fact of building so many more miles of railway on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge will make more difficult and costly 'the .task The Government seems to be entering into an agreement to break down its -- own policyMr STEWART:-And in opposition to an agreement with Queensland to build a railway.on the 4-ft. 8£.rin. gauge. Mr ;HILL - That is an entirely .difMr JR. GREEN - If the 'North-'South railway is justified - at all, and I think it is, it - should be constructed on the - standard gauge. I therefore hope that rthe agreement will be - - returned to the - Government of South Australia, with an intimation that this Parliament insists that a railway shall he built on the standard gauge along the route which will best serve the interests of Australia as a whole. A railway constructed on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge from Marree to Birdsville, and thence to Camooweal, would be a continuation of the line from Adelaide to Marree, which will eventually be converted to the 4-ft. S^-in. gauge, thus providing a railway of the one gauge from Central Australia to Adelaide, and avoiding the inconvenience and expense necessitated at breaks of gauge. It seems ridiculous that this proposal should be submitted to the House when the Government is considering laying down a third rail on the existing 5-ft. 3-in. gauge between Red Hill and Adelaide. The proposed line is to be of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge.",40
114,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,And they all connect.,41
115,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Yes . I do not know if this aspect of the question was brought under the notice of the Minister by departmental officials. Apparently the representatives of the South Australian Government conveniently neglected to remind him of the fact.,41
116,Mr FENTOIT,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is the honourable member overlooking the point that the proposed line will connect with the existing 3-ft. 6-in. railway from Oodnadatta to Quorn ?,41
117,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,No . I am advocating the continuation of the line from Marree northwards on a 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge.,41
118,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is not the honourable member making a destructive speech without considering the merits of the case?,41
119,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I do not wish to assist the Government to commit itself to such an absurd proposal. I believe that the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australia should be honoured in the interests of the whole of the Australian people, who have to find the money. I am endeavouring to look at this subject from a truly Australian point of view, and am suggesting a route which, I sincerely believe to be preferable to that proposed. I do not think that a railway from Oodnadatta northwards is the best that could be constructed; a line in an easterlv direction would be more advantageous owing to the fact that it would traverse only a comparatively small area of poor country, arid serve territory with an assured rainfall. In introducing a bill in 1907 to provide for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South' Australia expressed the opinion that a railway to the north would probably be constructed along the Queensland border. Another member of the South Australian Parliament, the late Sir Richard Butler, who spoke later on, expressed similar views, but said that he was opposed to transfer because the time within which the railway was to be constructed was not stipulated. He said, however, that he was not opposed to the eastern route, which is the one I favour.",41
120,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Did other speakers express different views?,41
121,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have not read the speeches of those who expressed a contrary view. The general opinion at that time was that a line would be constructed along the Queensland border. When the bill is in committee I propose to move an amendment to the effect that a line be constructed from M'arree to Birdsville on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge.  my intention at this stage 'not to go over the whole of the ground covered by previous speakers, but to answer the criticismsof some speakers and to confirm the statements of others. A good deal has been said by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) concerning the most desirable route for the proposed railway. I do not know whether my schooling differed from his, but I remember learning that the four cardinal points of the compass are north, south, east and west, and this leads me to think that a line known as the North-South railway should be built from the north to the south, or vice versa. Yet, according to the arguments of the honourable member for Richmond, a north-south line should be built in an easterly direction. The history of the proposed line extends further back than 1911, when the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory was entered into, as a transcontinental line was first mentioned 55 years ago when the South Australian Government"" undertookthe construction of the overland telegraph line through, the centre of the continent. In 1882 my late father, the Hon. J. Langdon Parsons, who was the Minister controlling the Northern Territory in the Bray Government, visited the Northern Territory in charge of a parliamentary party. On his return to South Australia so impressed was he with the wonderful potentialities of the Territory that, after having piloted a bill through Parliament to provide for the construction of a line to Oodnadatta and one from Darwin, which was then known as P aimerston, to Pine Creek- a distance of 346 miles-h e resigned his portfolio as Minister controlling the Northern Territory and Minister of Education, and accepted the position of Government Resident in the Northern Territory, so that he could represent the Government in connection with the construction of that line. Notwithstanding my father's urgent representations to the Government that the work should be done by southern Europeans, who were to be granted land on the completion of the construction, the Government in its wisdom or otherwise, employed Chinese coolies who, when the work was completed, placed their money in their pockets and returned to their own country. No settlement whatever followed. South Australia completed these two sections of railway ; but owing to the frequent changes of government, the Northern Territory was practically forgotten. There were other gentlemen who believed in the possibilities of the Territory, including the late Mr Simpson Newland, who, irrespective of what was said concerning the Territory, was always one of the keenest advocates of a north-south railway. The South Australian people, who had almost despaired of seeing. a railway constructed, 'finally agreed, through their Parliament, to the construction of a line under the land grant system, the merits or demerits of which I do not propose to discuss at this juncture. If one has the slightest doubt as to what South Australia meant, and what the Commonwealth knew that South Australia desired, when she stipulated in the agreement under which she handed over the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, one has only to refer to the plan attached to the bill embodying the agreement, on which is shown, a line running directly northwards. South Australia was prepared to trust the Commonwealth and the other States to do a fair thing. Certainly no period in which the work was to be undertaken was specified, but South Australia showed that she trusted the Commonwealth to honour its obligation. Opinions have been given on the question by some of the most learned King's Counsel in the Commonwealth, all of whom agree that there is not the slightest doubt that the railway provided for in the agreement is a direct north- rfouth line. It would be undesirable, if not impossible, in such an agreement, to define the exact course that the' line must take.",41
122,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The route has been surveyed.  agreement would permit of some slight variation. There was no doubt whatever about what the South Australian people intended when it was framed.,42
123,Mr R GREEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"What about the talk of the eastern route?  have talked of another route, but I cannot remember that a single South Australian advocated it . I must remind the honourable member for Richmond that Bentences in speeches may be taken from their context and used to support almost any argument. In Holy W r it there is the statement, "" There is no God."" That sounds, very strange, taken apart from its context; but when one reads the complete verse, he finds that it is, "" The fool hath said in his heart there is no God."" The honourable member had a good deal to say about that wonderful place Birdsville. I have been informed that at one time children of five years of age were living there who had never seen rain. I have also been informed, and I have no reason whatever to doubt the veracity of my informant, that the average annual r a in f all in Birdsville is 7 inches, and not 15 inches as stated by the honourable member. If his statements on other points are as in accurate as that of the average annual rainfall, we cannot safely place reliance upon them. I agree with the honourable member for Grey (Mr . Lacey) that, it would be a serious mistake to allow the line from Port Augusta to Red Hill to pass within . 2 miles of Port Pirie without actually entering the town. I have not examined the survey, ibut I 'know that a 3*ohain road 'runs almost all the way from Red' Hill to Port Pirie. the line could he taken down that road into the town a good dealof money might be saved in the purchase of land. view of the - speech just delivered by the honourable member 'for Richmond R. Green), and also because of the attempts that have been made from time to time to filch from South her fights in regard to the I should like a definite assurance the Minister for Works and .(Mr Hill) that the agreement in the schedule of this bill does not in any way abrogate the undertakings in the original agreement to transfer, the Territory. must confess that I , in common with a good-many other-South Australians, been - suspicious of the intentions of the Commonwealth in regard to the building of the .North-South railway. years I conducted an extensive spondence in the press on this and I always urged that South tralia should .hold fast to every that she had under the transfer ment. Referring for a moment to the route of .the .railway, the question in the last analysis is not whether this, .that, or the other route, is the better one, but whether South .Australia the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth for certain definite siderations. Icontend she did so, and that one of the considerations in the mind of the .Parliament at that time was that the NorthSouth raihvay .should be ; constructed by the Commonwealth within a .reasonable time. In my judgment, ""it - is improper for any group of persons, or for to attempt to interfere with the fulfilment of the agreement that was made. Australia should not be robbed of .her rights. There is a much more consideration in this matter, than the honouring .of the made with the South Australian ment. The building of the railway is absolutely essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth, and the continuance of our White Australia .for it will make possible 'the populating and development of the Northern tory. If that is done, we shall be able should war occur here in the  iand we know the quarter from which trouble may come--to do something, at If - least, in our own defence. ' If we make even an honest attempt to populate the Northern Territory and the unsettled In parts of north-western Australia, we shall be able, in the event of another nation (Mr attempting to dispossess us of our country, to appeal confidently to our friends abroad for assistance. If , on the Australia other hand, we allow this .great territory Territory, to remain undeveloped for years in the from hands of a meagre population of 2,000 Railways people, we shall, in my opinion, have no right, in the event of war occurring, to expect assistance from outside. For these reasons, I sincerely trust that the NorthI South line will-shortly be an accomplished fact. have Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES (Boothby) [ 6 . 8 ] - I do not intend to delay honourable members .long, and I regret that it For - many is necessary to speak so soon after the corre- introduction of this bill late last night; subject, but I understand that the Minister Aus- desires that it shall be pushed through. right The long and elaborate agreement in the agree- schedule of the bill would need close consideration before one could follow the whole .of its ramifications.

The South then honourable - memDer 'for Angas (Mr . - Gabb) - moved an amendment to that important .measure which, had it been 'carried, .however, would have had the effect of referring agreement the whole matter to the 'Public Works Committee for consideration. The attiGoverntude adopted - by honourable members on North-South this 'side of the Chamber was that, although they would prefer work on any instalment of the North-South railway to policy, begin from the - southern end, they were willing, in consequence of a verbal stateTerri- ment by the Prime Minister that the Government proposed to honour the future- agreement made - with South Australia in 1907, that work-, should be commenced from the northern, end; I am glad that our confidence in the Prime Minister's promise has been, justified.!. So far as 1. can see; the. rights,.of South Australia in the original agreement are not in any way curtailed by the. provisions, of the agreement in the. schedule of thisb ill . The very-fact that the Government: pro^ poses to introduce .a. measurefor: thecom struction.of this railway. "" as a portion of the. transcontinental railway to be constructed, pursuant to, the agreement! in the schedule, to the Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910,"" makes-it clear to me that it intends to press-on with the completion of the through line. If I required, additional evidence of that, it is supplied' by the speech delivered by the Minister for Works, and Railways (Mr . Hill ) ' last night, in which he gave the total mileage that had been constructed ; from the north and from , the south, the length that the ' Government proposed to build immediately, and. the distance that would still remain to be constructed before the two ends were connected. One of my main objectsi n rising, to speak was to-make it perfectly clean that, so far. as I am concerned personally^-and I believe .my view is. held byall the South Australian membersofthis.

124,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Adelaide) [6.17] - I have pleasure in,supporting this-bill, concerning which the same arguments thai applied, to the measure with which we have. just, dealt are to a great extent applicable. The question of the route of this, railway has been raised, but I feel that. the. Government is. adopting, the right attitude - in . that matter. While 1 should like to see a railway of 4-ft. S-^in. gauge, constructed, across: Australia from north to.south,. I . believe that the-Governr ment, in this proposal, is doing as much as can reasonably be expected. The conversion, to the standard. gauge of the Oodnadatta to Darwin railway, will be quite as simple a matter as the conversicn of any other railway, in Australia. The railway with which this bill deals will be purely developmental. The problem of I the development of the Northern T e r r i tory has not yet been.grappled.with, nor will . it be u n t i l we get into closer, contact with the people there. Nothing helps so .much in that direction as. the construction of railways. I agree with the honor1  that if South Australia had retained the Northern Territory-a railway from north to south would have been constructed before this. While the bill is not all that I desire, it is an honest attempt to ""honour the existing agreement; and to develop the Northern Territory. It will at least give those who now-live there some chance of reaching civilization more frequently and more quickly than is possible at present. In that, respect alone the construction, of this railway is more than justified. The Northern Territory must be devel6ped, and we must pay for that development. The pioneers there must on no longer be overlooked. South Australian members, are pleased to know that something is being done to honour the compact entered into so many years ago, and we all hope that it will not be long before the railway is extended to Darwin.",44

It is further a business proposition that we should endeavour so far as we can to make those Territories self-supporting, which they are not now. Their soil and climatic conditions make them specially suited to the production of tropical products which are very largely used m Australia. As the population of the Territories numbers about 500,000 natives and about 3,000 whites, it is evident that their products must nearly all be exported. Australia by reason of her geographical position is the natural market for such products, but two factors have militated against the development of our trade with these Territories. One of these factors has been the coasting sections of the Navigation Act, and the other has been the Australian Customs Tariff, which has treated the products of even our own Territories as being of foreign origin. The Government considers that it devolves upon us to have a fixed and definite policy for the development of tropical agriculture in - BILL. these Territories. It is proposed to give effect to this by means of this comparatively small preferential tariff, and by a further proposal that will follow, prod in g a n y t h in g contained in viding for bounties on other commodities. To remove any disabilities suffered by the Territories because of the coasting from the T e r r i - provisions of the Navigation Act e T e r r it o r y, of New Guinea, those provisions were in part suspended by proclamation on the 1st September last. The ' commodities covered by the tariff resolution which I THE SCHEDULE. am submitting, and by the Bounties Bill tofollow, are not commercially produced in Australia, and do not come Item. into competition with any of our primary or secondary industries. It is of great importance to Australia to develop the cultivation of tropical fresh, viz., Chicomatney, Litchi, Longau, Akce, Pnlasan, Rambntan, products practically at our own back Avocado, ?.Iangostecn, Sapote, Sapodilln, Abiu, Star-apple, Langsat, door, because if we do we shall be to some Imbu, llama, Durian, Jabnticaba, Grumichama, Kap Fan Seedless extent, and I hope to a large extent, Pnmmelo, and .Tak Fruit independent of foreign countries for such Fnugi, edible commodities. In addition to those referred to in this tariff resolution and the and Pulse, viz., Rangoon Beans Nuts, viz.:- bounty proposals to be submitted, there (A) Coco-nuta, whole («) Coco-nuts, prepnred are other commodities produced in the Territories, such as copra and rubber. These are very largely used in our manufacturing industries, but it is not proposed to give any assistance for their production, because those engaged in it have been afforded considerable relief by the suspension of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act, and because a great proportion of the copra produced finds its way to 'the world's markets whilst there is a comparatively small consumption of it in Australia: and by reason of the very much i m proved condition of the rubber market. The action taken by the Government with regard to Papua and the Mandated Territories of New Guinea has two objects. One, and the major object, is to benefit the producers of tropical prodiiets in the Territories, and the other object which will be directly accomplished will be the granting of relief, through the Customs tariff, to the users of the commodities specified, to the extent, if developments progress as we hope, of an average of about £25,000 a year. Although Papua has been a Territory of the Commonwealth since September, 1906, we have, have already said, treated it throughout by our tariff as a foreign territory, and as if we had no responsibilities in respect of it . Tariff preference has not been given to Papua, and the comparatively recently acquired Mandated Territory of New Guinea, notwithstanding the fact that the planters, plantation managers, officials, tradesmen, and missionaries, as well as the monetary in vestments in the Territory, are nearly all Australian. The backward state of tropical production in the Territories is something which I am sure we all regret. The cultivation of tropical products which flourish in Java, in the Federated Malay States, Ceylon, and other parts, has, as yet, been practically untried in either Papua or New Guinea. Both Territories have their eggs in one basket, or rather their basket has only one egg in it , and that is the coconut. The economic structure of the Territories has its sole foundation in the production of copra. That is a position which must be viewed with some concern when one visualizes their future development, particularly because the consumption of copra in Australia is comparatively small. It only amounts to about 9,000 tons a year, whilst the total production of Papua and New Guinea in 1924-5 exceeded 45,000 tons. It is proposed to attempt to overcome the uncertain economic position of these Territories by encouraging the cultivation of a greater diversity of products, and this tariff resolution is a part of the scheme to that end. The . tropical products selected by the Government, after most exhaustive inquiry, for the application of bounties and' a preferential tariff, are those specially adapted to the climatic conditions of the Territories, and for which an established market already exists in the Commonwealth, representing a value at the present time of nearly £2,000,000. Products such as bananas, citrus fruits, maize, peanuts, and sugar, which can be readily produced in the Territories, have been omitted from the Government preference and bounty proposals for the reason that they are commercially grown with in the Commonwealth. A few figures relating to these Territories, and covering the last five years, may be in teresting. The imports into the Commonwealth from Papua in 1920-1 amounted in value to £325,773; in 1921-2, to as I £163,232; in 1922-3, to £ 2 0 9 , 1 9 3; in 1923-4, to £471,953; and in the last financial year, 1924-5, to £295,199. The value of our exports to Papua- I am speaking now only of Papua, and not of New Guinea-was , over the five years, respectively, £292,851 , £172,419, £219,225, £214,839, and £259,302. The exports from Australia to Papua include goods not o i Australian origin. The value of goods of Australian production exported to Papua over the five years was, respectively - £163,449, £S8,643, £111,442, £116,954, and £141,309. The value of the import and export trade of Papua over the five vears was, respectivelyImports. £484,770, £305,705, £315,423, £354,965, £459,080; and exports, £172,672, £220,236, £179,452, £239,408, and £367,629. The exports from Papua in order of value are-Copra , rubber, pearls, beche-de-mer, pearl shell end trochus shell. In 1924-5 'the exports from Papua were valued as follow: Copra, £ 1 7 2 , 9 0 5 ; rubber, £68,507: copper, £ 4 1 , 6 7 4; pearls, £ 1 9 , 3 0 0; bechede-mer, £ 1 0 , 3 5 1 ; pearl shell, £ 8 , 7 7 3 : gold, £ 1 4 , 9 8 0; osmiridium, £ 3 , 6 3 0; and sisal hemp, £13,141. These figures show that the commodities to be affected by the proposals of the Government are produced in Papua in minor quantities only. The territory of New Guinea has reached a higher state of productiveness than the territory of Papua, as the figures of the import and export trade clearly show. In the last five financial years the value of goods imported into the territory of New Guinea was, respectively-£661,441 , £468,711 , £516,855, £485,634, and £537,940. The value of the exports was, respectively-£673,992 , £499,197, £630,892, £718,535, and £858,990. The exports are similar in value..and variety to the - Papuanexports, with.the exception of .pearls; and the export of copra. and rubber comprises from three-quarters to seven-eighths of the total - exports of those territories. value of the .Australian import and export trade with the territory of New Guinea for the year 1924-5 was-^Import s into Australia, .£470,574; and exports from Australia, £268,664.. ""The Australian exports to the territory - of New Guinea include - a considerable proportion of oversea products, - as is also the case respecting Papua. The balance of the imports into these territories over and .above Australian exports to them are made up largely - of direct importations of - petrol, - kerosene, cotton goods - and machinery. The Papuan Legislative Council can, and I understand will , give a preference to Australian imports in reciprocation of our 'effort to help-the development-of-plantations in ' the territory. TJnder the'terms Of ' the Mandate given to the Commonwealth by the League of Nations, 'the Customs' tariff of the territory of 'New Guinea permits of - no preference to any country; but with the development of trade under the bounties-scheme and the preferential tariff proposals of the Government, a closer lallia-nce of trade in terests between the Commonwealth and the territory can be confidently expected.  sidered giving a preference on tobacco'? Mr ' PRATTEN - Yes . I propose making some exhaustive inquiries respecting the growth of tobacco and the manufacture of .cigars in Australia. Later, T shall draw the attention - of the 'Tariff Board to the possibility of the growth in Papua of special cigar leaf. I believe that we can grow in OUT tropical possessions cigar leaf equal to the best leaf grown in other countries, but tobacco, and cigar leaf have deliberately been omit ted'from these proposals, because the inquiry concerning them has not yet begun. It is intended to admit into the Commonwealth,'free of duty, coffee grown in the territories, and to place a charge of 3d. a pound on coffee from other countries. At one time a considerable quantity of coffee was grown in Queensland, and for many years it had the protection of a duty-of 3d. a-pound. ' But i l regret toisay that 'the. quantity of coffee now .produced in Queensland is almost.negligible. Pour.teen years ago I'oliOSO lb. of coffee were grown in that State. Last 6,160 lb. were - grown there, valued at -£231. 'The importation of coffee into the Commonwealth during 1-923-24 was 3,460,441 lb., valued at-£136,654. The Mr Foster;--What is the reason, for the diminished production of coffee in Queensland ?  and find it if possible. It is evident, from the figures that I .have quoted, that there is every opportunity for the development of' the coffee industry both in the Commonwealth and in the territories. Prepared or desiccated coco-nut is the largest item affected by the proposed reductions in tariff duties.' It is imported now from other countries, and the reduction of 3d. a pound in duty in favour of the territories will , it is expected, establish the industry there almost immediately, and provide an outlet for a further proportion of the main staple production of coco^-nuts. ; Last year 1,500 tons of prepared coco-nut, valued at '£98,000, were imported into Australia, the average price being from £ 4 0 to £ 6 0 a ton. .As quite a number of honourable members have hacl-an opportunity of visiting .some portions of the territories, I feel sure of their sympathetic co-operation in the passing of these proposals, which the'Government confidently anticipates will materially assist to .deve1 lop Papua and New Guinea, and help them-to become self-supporting.

' In committee - ('Consideration < of Governor General's - message).: Motio n - (by : Mr .P<BATTETT) agreed to'That it is'expedient that ain appropriation of revenue be made.for .the-purposes of a .bill for an act to provide .for 'the payment of bounties on certain goods the produce or manufacture of the 'Territory of Papua, and on certain goods the i produce or ^manufacture of'the Territory of ""New Guinea. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution .adopted. Ordered pare and bring in .a .bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented and read a.first time. '-SECOND READING.  year only Trade and Customs) [8.35]' - I moveTihat the bill'be-now'read a second time. I stated in previous remarks that it was a responsibility of the Government to help reasonably to develop the tropical productions of the Territories of Papua , and New. Guinea. While it': is believed that the suspension of the coasting p r o v i sions of the Navigation Act will help the big industry of. copra producing, and the very much smaller industry of rubber producing, and while it is. believed that the proposed preferential tariff will give further, help to the - development of theTterritories,. it isstill' felt that it . is essential to take f u r action to get the diversification of. tropical agriculture to which I have referred. Honourable members know, that the Commonwealth-has. at different times granted to-the'Territory of Eapuailoans-amounting to £100,897j and that the amount to be. repaid to the Commonwealth is at present £93,302: This money.haa been made available for the-'construction of reservoirs, wharfs, androads, for general development, and. for the settlement of returned soldiers-on the. land;: but, in addition to that), the Commonwealth has granted an annual subsidy,.which started at-.£20,000 a year,, and was-increased at various, times, untili t nowstandsat £50,000-a-year.. On the 1st July-,.1901', we subsidized-the Territory, of-Papua at the rate of £20,000 - a year. That continued for eight, years-, and on the 1st July, 19.09, we raised the subsidy to £25,000 a year, at which amount it remained-for three years. On the 1st July, 1912; it wasfurther increased to £30,000, where it remained for about eightand a h a l f years, u n t i l the 1st January, 1921,. when it was,.increased to-£50,000 aiyear. The total subsidies, therefore, that the Terri tory ofi Papua alone hashad from the Commonwealth-since we took it over have amounted to the large. sum i of £752,000, ori three-quartersof a million. addition tothese subsidies to enable Papua - to carry on the services-of government) the Papuan portion of the shipping subsidy for: the Pacifie Islands amounts-to £12,000 a year. To the Territory of: New Guinea, the Commonwealth grants an annual subsidy of- £10,000 for the bene1 fit of the natives, and that is-spent on agriculture, and health matters-.. Commonwealth grant of £10,000 for medi"" cal services in the Territory of New Guinea was made in . 1922.. A Commonwealth loan was also granted of £67,000 for the construction of wharfs andi for drainage; and the proportion of the mail subsidy I have referred! to in connection with the Pacific Island services amounts,, sofaras the territorial share of New Guinea is concerned, to a sum-of £16,000. Erom these particulars it will be seen that the development of the natural resourcesof the Territories-is very vital :to the'well-being of' the Commonwealth, and that it isgood business for usto make these 1 Territories asself-supporting as we can, the r as quickly as-we can - There is-no question that, if the proposals of ""the Government are accepted by this House,- theTerritoriesshould be largely self-supporting at a not very distant date; and 1 there will be the f u r the r advantage that the Territories, will provide Australia with some, if not all, of hertropical-importations-. To obtain these tropical'productions from our, own Territories, will ' make us; atleast partially, independent of foreign sources of supply. Honourable, members will notice-that-the bill provides: amaxim-umisum of £25,0.00 a year foF a. period of t e n years-,, and that'a. carryrover can be-made from-year to year;, but not more than the amount appropriated,, namely-,.£250,-000-in-all, can,be spent in a> period, of ten years-. A very careful calculation has .been. made, regarding the developments-that are expected to follow the applicationof this, proposal. It is' calculated that the appropriation of an average sum of, £-25,000 a yearfor, ten 1 years, will reasonably cover the developments, expected. If there is a greater and-more rapid development than, we have calculated upon, then the bounty is fixed, and power is given to - the Minister to - pay it pro rata to the-limit of the appropriation, available at. the time. The trade that: can be - further developed between In the Territoriesof Papua and. of New Guinea is of much importance to A u s tralia.. It maybe-stated with every assurance that most of Australia'srequirementsof kapok-,, coir,, sisal and manila hemn, rubber; , cacao beans,, bamboo and rattan, coffee; coco-nuts,- desiccated, coconut,, vanillabeans, spices; and sago can, be eventually produeed in the great The islandterritories; of the: Commonwealth. I mentioned;irma previous-speech.that the importations of tropical productsinto Australia every year were worth nearly£2,000,000. The details of these importations for the year 1923-4 are, approxi- now proposed. mately: kapok, £350,000; coir,' £13,000; sisal and manila hemp, £300,000; rubber, £456,000; cacao beans, £231,000; bamboo and rattan, £45,000; coffee, £130,000; coco-nuts, £3,000; coco-nut, desiccated, £98,000; vanilla beans, £18,600; spices, £135,000; and sago, £3,500; making a total of £1,783,100.",45
127,Mr OOBSER,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The bill refers to "" goods the produce or manufacture "" of the Territories; If goods are manufactured in a Territory, but imported from another island, will the bounty be payable in respect of them?  to allow any concessions through the Customs tariff, or by way of bounty, to any goods that are not the product or manufacture of the Territories.",49
128,Mr OIIAKLTON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The original resolution does not make that clear.  shall be willing to accept any amendment that will make more clear the deliberate intention of the Government that the tariff concession and the bounty shall apply only to goods that are sent to Australia direct from a territory. The Government's desire is to promote tropical production in Commonwealth Territories in order to increase the sources of our supplies of raw materials. The Commonwealth Analyst (Mr. Wilkinson), whose knowledge of tropical production is most extensive, has made a special study of the economic conditions of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea, and having visited all parts of the Territories on a special mission before these proposals were finalized, he is most favourably impressed with the possibilities of the successful production on a large scale of kapok,- coir, desiccated coco-nut, cacao beans, coffee, sisal ing. and manila hemp, vanilla, and all kinds of spices. With the granting of the bounties and the passing of the Papuan tariff, I am convinced that considerably more interest will be taken in the purchase of the expropriated properties, and the indirect benefits from this source likely to be substantial. Those already interested in the development of the Territory confirm this view, and are optimistic concerning the added value which will accrue to the Government properties there as a result of the'legislation A ll the representations that have been made by the administrators of both Territories, the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce, the Samarai Chamber of Commerce, and leading planters, and others who are financially interested in the Territories have been very carefully considered. With regard to the individual items, some points concerning them are of special interest. A very important aspect of kapok cultivation is that the tree is the natural nesting ground of the red ant generally known throughout the Territory as the kurakum. This red ant is one of the most active controlling agencies of the leaf destruction caused by the coco-nut beetle. This insect is widespread in New Britain, and also occurs at Manus and the Solomon Islands, and has already caused considerable havoc and financial loss in numerous coco-nut plantations. The beetle causes the palms to look as though a plague of locusts had passed through them. The planting of occasional rows of kapok, followed by the introduction of the red ant, is regarded by competent entomologists as one of the most effective methods of combating this destructive pest. I am sure that all honourable members desire to do everything possible to assist the industries of the Territory. These proposals have been most carefully considered by the Government, and will, I am sure, be f< great stimulus to the planters, who for a long time have been struggling under adverse conditions. The bounty proposals are spread over a period of ten.years; a fairly long term of encouragement must be given, because some of the developments for which we hope can come only a number of years after plantFor instance, cocoa plants, although sometimes yielding at four years of age, do not give a ful l crop of beans until they are seven or eight years old. Manilla and sisal hemp are usually cut four years after planting. The vanilla vine and the kapok tree begin to are bear in about the third year. Bamboo and rattan are usually cut in the fourth year after planting, but a full crop of coffee beans. is not obtained until from seven to ten years after planting, although the tree begins to bear in - the second or third year. I have furnished the House with all the particulars at my disposal, hut in committee I shall be prepared to answer any questions which honourable members may care to address to me. In the first few years the bounty payments will probably be small, and there will be a large carry-over, I estimate sufficient to meet all developments which can be reasonably expected as a result of these proposals with in the ten year period. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. NAVIGATION BILL. SECOND BEADING.  Trade and Customs) [8.56] - I move:That this bill be now read a second time. Since the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act were brought into operation in July, 1921, a constant agitation has been maintained by the people of Tasmania, and particularly the citizens of Hobart, for the exemption of the shipping trade between that State and the mainland from their operations. ""Whilst that request has been made in respect of both passenger and cargo traffic, it has been recognized that the substance of the grievance was the tourist traffic, which is admittedly of great importance to Tasmania. It is not possible for the Commonwealth Parliament, by any amendment of the Navigation Act, to specifically exempt the trade with Tasmania only. The Constitution requires that all States must be treated alike.",49
129,Mr MANN,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"That applies also to any proclamation under the Navigation Act.  99 of the Constitution provides : The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, ov revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof, ever any other State or ariy part thereof. That prohibition does not apply to a territory, and exemptions of the trade of the Northern Territory, New Guinea, Papua, and Norfolk Island have been granted by orders-in-council, under section 7 of the act. Often the question is asked- "" As the Northern Territory is exempted from the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act, why cannot the same concession be extended to Tasmania?"" The answer is that the distinction between a State and a Territory is made, not by the administration, but by the Constitution. But for section 99 of the Constitution, which has proved a lion in the path of Tasmania's desires, there is little doubt that that State would have received some special consideration long before this in respect of the tourist traffic with the mainland. In order to avoid any conflict with section 99 of the Constitution, the amendment of the Navigation Act now proposed will not apply specifically to Tasmania or any other State.",50
130,Mr CHARLTON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"It . will apply to all the States equally.  tourist traffic is concerned. It will confer a right which will be available to all the States so far as their tourist traffic is concerned, but whereas that traffic is negligible, so far as most of the mainland States are concerned, it is of the utmost importance to Tasmania. Indeed, the tourist traffic of Tasmania is equal to the whole of the tourist traffic of the mainland States. Therefore, Tasmania is more vitally concerned in its maintenance than is any other State.",50
131,Mr CHARLTON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,But the effect will be that tourists going to any other State can travel on these overseas boats.  that certain conditions in regard to tourist traffic must prevail before any Gazette notice can be published.,50
132,Mr CHARLTON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"But when it is published, it will apply equally to all the States.  circumstances must be equal before it is Section applied to them. The amendment wil l give relief to Tasmania to the extent that the limitations of the Constitution will allow. At the same time, it will create no discrimination against, nor do in justice to, any State to which it does notapply. It will particularly apply to Tasmania, because the bona fide tourist traffic for which it provides is of very much greater volume to that State than it is to any other. It is persistently urged that the accommodation provided by vessels belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, the Orient Company, the Aberdeen and White Star lines and other overseas British companies that call during, the apple season at Hobart, and which, prior, to. the proclamation of the. coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act, regularly carried from the mainland to Hobart during the tourist' season; is very much better that which is provided steamerstrading between the and'the-island. It is-claimed, also,- that' because the passengeraccommodation on those overseas vessels is not now available for the voyage to Hobart, Tasmania has been considerably prejudiced, although those vessels went to primarily to lift Gargoes of apples, advantage was taken by many of the opportunity to make the round trip from Sydney to Hobart Melbourne. That the tourist contributesa very important the island's revenue is shown by the statement of the Tasmanian of Railways, in his last annual that the total loss sustained by the State during the last seamen's strike, lasted for eleven days only,, was about £250,000 - Each season, since the Navigation Act has-- been in force,, the Commonwealth. Government, has. been askedto allow the big., comfortable vessels to take passengers, to Hobart, but the only, provision in the Navigation under which these vessels could be exempted from the coasting-trade visions of the act is section 286, which provides,, in effect, that it can be. shown to the of the Minister, in regard to the coasting, tradewith. any. porti or between, any ports in the Commonwealth no licensed ship is. available-for the service, or (f i ) the service out by a licensed ship is. inadequate to the needs of such port or ports.; and if . the Minister is satisfied that it is-desirable in the public interests that unlicensed ships be-allowed to engage in that trade, he may grant permits-to unlicensed'British so,- and thereupon the-carriage ships ofpassengers - on cargo to-or theport or - between the ports specified in the permit is not deemed to be engaging in the coasting, trade. provision.no relief has-been given to the. tourist traffic to the island, for the reason that inquiry on'everyoccasion has shownthat the shipping service maintained  licensed vesselstrading between. Sydney - and Hobart w as "" adequate"" in the sense that sufficient accommodation, of sorts was passengers, available, except during the rush periods immediately preceding, holiday times, than for. all. persons, who desired to travel to on the local the island. It has long been recognized mainland that, especially by reason of. itsisolated position and its dependence on shipping for transport and. means of communica-tion. with the mainland, Tasmania suffers^ as compared with other parts of thebecause, Commonwealth, a distinct disability, Hobart which is mainly brought about by the restrictions imposed by the Navigation tourists Act upon itspassenger traffic. Although each successive year shows a small in and crease in the number of tourists visiting traffic Tasmania, there is no doubt that the part of- withdrawal of the privilege of being able to travel on the large overseas vessels : Commissioner: has resulted, in-a-loss to the. State,, and report,, particularlyto Hobart and the southern, portionof. the island,. of - a'very desirable' which, type of tourist: Tasmania is .the smallest State in size and population, and it ispossibly, suffering financial stress.. Therefore, . anything reasonable that, the Commonwealth i Government can do to helpoverseas it. ought, I think, to be done. The Government's proposal' isperfectlyreasonAct able. W it h the object of overcoming the handicap suffered by the State, and' pro- particularly Hobart, in respect' of its tourist traffic, the Prime Minister in his 1 where policy speech announced his intention to satisfaction introduce legislation which would permit' the: better class of overseas vessels to engage in the tourist traffic to Tasmania (a) that during the apple-export season. This measure has been brought down to carried redeem that promise. I think the people or ships of the Commonwealth will ' find that the Government is prepared to redeem all its 1 promises as soon as it possibly can. The billproposes to amend section. 286 of the Navigation. Act by adding, thereto two sub-ssctions asset out in the bill. It i ships to do is not thought that this concession to by such the Tasmanian passenger traffic will do from any injury, - to theinterestsof. the licensed steamersn o w running: to the island. It is probable that, as-was. the Under thisi case prior to the coming: into-operation; of the-Navigation. Act; the-fares-charged' by the ownersof' the-overseas vesselswilli be higher than those charged by the local by companies. It is also very probable that, because of the extra facilities made available, one result of the new arrangement will be an increase upon the number of tourists that'now visit Tasmania. Thus Tasmania's interests should 'be materially helped without hurting - any one. other point to be 'kept in mind is that, as the .apple - trips do not commence .until about the .middle - of February, the Christinas and summer traffic will - still remain with the licensed vessels. cannot see that this is a party - question. During the past two or three years parliamentary representatives from Tasmania of all shades of opinion, and also, I think, the Labour Premier of the State, have been urging the Parliament of the Commonwealthto do something in the direction now proposed. I therefore submit the bill to the 'House in order that Parliament may remove an injustice and aid Tasmania without injuring any other state, thus redeeming as soon as,possible the promise made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government. Debate (on motion by Mr CHARBTON) adjourned. O ODNADATTATOALICESPRINGS Kingoonya RAILWAY BILL. SECOND ^READING. Debate resumed (vide page 284).",50
133,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"Wimmera) [9.15] This measure is of great importance, as it involves the expenditure of a large sum of money, and the carrying-. out of a long standing and much debated obligation to the State of South .AustraliaI t vitally affects the development of the Northern Territory, - which has an important bearing upon our White Australia policy. The .defence of the Commonwealth, and the question of a uniform igawge. are also involved. Numerous speeches ihave been made in an endeavour .to interpret the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australia 'when the Territory - was 'taken over by the Commonwealth, but whatever is provided in the .agreement it 'was always understood 'that a railway 'should - be 'constructed from the south to the north without any deviation'to benefit other States. That was the - spirit of the - agreement. Figures have been submitted in relation to two routes, which differ vitally , inasmuch as one is - an extension of the - existing line from '.Oodnadatta to Alice Springs on the 3-ft. '6-in. gauge, whilst the other is a take off 'from the east-west line at Kingoonya on' the uniform gauge of An- -4'ft. in . Listening very carefully to the speech of the 'Minister . for ""Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) in moving the second reading of the bill , I gathered that the - Government had carefully conI sidered the .respective merits .of these routes, and had come to the conclusion that the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs route was the better one to adopt. I also gathered that the question.of' cost influenced the Government in coming to that decision. In the figures given in the very comprehensive table - supplied to honourable members it is shown that the total estimated .cost of constructing a line from Kingoonya to Alice - Springs .is £4,500,000, and that of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs £1,700,0:00, a difference of £2,800,000. The M in ister .gave some reasons why in the opinion of the ; Government the Oodnadatta to - Alice - Springs route 'should :be adopted. He admitted that 'the country for a distance of 200 - miles north of is better pastoral country with a higher rainfal l than that on the Oodnadatta route. ' Mr HILL - F o r a distance of ""130 miles north of Kingoonya.",52
134,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"I understood the Minister to 3ay that for 100 miles sheep-carrying country was served by the east-west line, and for the remainder of the distance the same line would serve cattle country. I do not think we should dismiss such distances with a wave of the hand - One hundred miles .is .a .long way .when the travelling of .sheep is involved, .and .200 miles is a fair l y long distance to ; travel cattle. When visiting the Territory two years .ago I met many who - were conversant with the conditions prevailing .there, in cluding - a Mr .Pearce -.who, according to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) probably rknows more concerning the Territory than any other man in the country. This gentleman, stated emphatically'that the country north of Kingoonya to a 'point in -'the same latitude as Oodnadatta is infinitely better than that on the Oodnadatta route.",52
135,Mr FOSTEB,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,Did the honourable member compare the statements made by that gentleman before a section of the Public Works Committee when visiting the Northern Territory with those made by him in Adelaide 1 They were diametrically opposed to each - other.,53
136,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The gentleman to whom I have referred knows more about the territory than the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster). The Lake Eyre country, which the Oodnadatta line traverses-Lak e Eyre can be seen from the railway-is about the poorest in Australia. It is a desert in the truest sense. It has not been, and is never likely to be, of any use for agricultural or pastoral purposes.",53
137,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,There are a number of sheep fanners in that locality.,53
138,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,Upon the fringe of it. It is the poorest piece of oountry along the route from Adelaide to Darwin.,53
139,Mr FOSTER,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,How much is there of it?,53
140,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"A large area, as can that proposal. be seen by. a glance at the map. It has been said that this country is poor in appearance because it is on the stock route, and that if the country on the K in goonya route were used by travelling stock it would not appear better than the Oodnadatta country. I deny that. The rainfall, for instance, on the K in goonya route is better than on the Oodnadatta route. The Minister gave many reasons in favour of the Oodnadatta route as against the Kingoonya route, but I propose to give a few in favour of the latter. I ask honourable members, irrespective of party, to impartially analyze the position before coming to a decision. If a line were constructed from Kingoonya to Alice Springs, stock could be trucked at the latter station and landed in Adelaide without transhipment. That is very important. There would be no breaks of gauge, and, in consequence, transport would be more rapid, and, on the broader gauge, more comfortable. Stock travelling over the Kingoonya route would, with the exception of a short mileage near Adelaide, be travelling over Commonwealth railways, thus reducing the losses upon our own line. We have also to consider ihe advantages of a uniform gauge, under which rolling-stock will be standardized and made interchangeable with that on the east-west line, which will mean economy in . the rolling-stock required and efficiency in the matter of repairs and operating costs. Passengers could join a train in Adelaide and travel to Alice Springs without transhipping. If the proposed route is adopted, all the disadvantages which at present exist between Port Augusta and Adelaide will be perpetuated. The Kingoonya route provides all the advantages to be derived from a uniform gauge, which is the railway policy definitely laid down and accepted by the Government. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne in 1923, the Prime Minister of the day said, inter aliaThe Commonwealth Government considered the matter (a uniform gauge) at very great length, and as a Government we emphatically believe in the uniformity of railway gauges throughout Australia. Later, in discussing various proposals for connecting 'the States he saidWe cannot go at length into the merits of As a matter of policy, the Commonwealth Government at this moment says that whatever it does in the matter of railway construction will be done on the 4-ft. &}-in. gauge-the gauge accepted by the Commission and the whole of the States. If we agree to the proposal submitted in the bill, we shall be not only perpetuating the difficulties which now exist, but be increasing the waste, extravagance, and confusion associated with varying gauges. If there is one thing more than another that can be regarded as a tragedy in Australian development, it is the varying gauges in use throughout the Commonwealth'. Notwithstanding this, the Government, which should by reason of its promises and pledges be in favour of a 4-ft. 8Jr-in. gauge railway, is submitting a bill to this House to perpetuate the varying gauges and to expend money on the construction of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Under the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Bill passed by the last Parliament the Government agreed not only to provide our own quota for constructing that line, but also to carry - the financial burden of Victoria and South Australia. That showed its anxiety to break down the policy of having different gauges, and to secure uniformity. The most astounding part of the whole business is that in the extension southward the sleepers are being laid, the permanent way made, and the bridges constructed, on the 4 - f t. 8^-in. gauge, so that when ultimately the north-south line is built it will be on that basis.",53
141,Mr MANNING,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"Provisio n is not being made for the laying of the sleepers on the 4 - f t. 8J-in. gauge. When the honor-' able member, as Minister for Works, in troduced the previous bill, I moved an amendment to that effect, but he would not accept it , and it was turned down by this House.",54
142,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"If my memory serves me rightly, I promised that the extension should make provision for the subsequent conversion to the 4-ft. 8-^-in. gauge. The .only difference was that, as we were connecting it with a 3 f t . 6 in . line, we should have to lay the rails 3 f t . 6 in . apart, so that when the time came to convert it to the wider gauge it would have been necessary only to widen the rails.",54
143,Mr MANNING,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,The only provision made was in regard to the bridges.,54
144,Mr FOSTER,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,Bridge s and culverts.,54
145,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The Minister (Mr . Hill ) can ascertain, and infor m this House, if the conditions are as I have stated them. Let us, however, accept the view that has been put forward by those honourable members who have interjected. What is the reason for Incurring this extra expense upon bridges and culverts if. as the Minister stated last night, the proposed line is to do service for 100 vears? The Commonwealth cannot afford to set this example to the States. conference after conference the Commonwealth has deplored the lack of uniformity in the railway gauges of Australia, yet it now proposes to do the very thing that it has hitherto deplored ! We should anchor very f i r m l y to the policy of a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. If wo accept the proposal in the bill we shall be dragging our anchor pretty badly. It is estimated that the extra cost will be £2,800,000. It is false economy to construct the line on the narrow gauge. . The east-west line was planted between two other lines that were built on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. So determined was the Commonwealth Government of the day to build to nothing but. the 4 - f t. 8^-in. gauge that it actually incurred an unproductive expenditure, that is not yet returning a profit! If in the present instance we stand by the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge we shall ultimately have a standard t r u nk railway from Adelaide via Kingoonya to Alice Springs, and [13] thence to Darwin. That should be the objective of this Parliament. If the country is worth a railway it is worth a trunk line, built to a standard gauge. I have every f a it h in the f u t u r e of the Northern Territory. I believe that there are great possibilities ahead of it , and that it can be developed. While it may not be everything that some of the rosy optimists claim for it , I believe that ultimately history will repeat itself. What has been the history of this and of every other country in the opening up.of new areas? It is said ' ' The country is no good; there is no water, no conveniences, nothing."" When the hand of man gets to work, what is the result? In America, in Canada-, in Australia, in every country in the world, .the pessimists have always been confounded, and the prophecies of the optimists fulfilled. The experience of the older countries will be the experience of Australia. Eyre blazed the track. A telegraph line was afterwards erected along that route, for no other reason than that it followed Eyre's track, which was easy to trace. Later, a railway .was built to follow the telegraph line. Now, at this late hour, the Government proposes to push along the same old track. I believe that the obligation to South Australia should be met, and I shall use every endeavour to have itcarried out,' but this matter strikes at such a vital principle that I move the following amendment:That the bill be withdrawn in favour of At Kingoonya, which provides for the construction of the railway on a uniform gauge of 4 feet 8j inches. In submitting that amendment I do not desire to delay the measure. If c a n not be' said that this proposal differs fro m that relating to the Kyogle f o South Brisbane line. It is not different; one has a distinct bearing upon the other. The amendment should be acceptable to honourable members on all sides of the House, and I appeal to the Government to agree to it .",54
146,Mr SPEAKER,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A," The amendment not having been seconded, lapses.",54
147,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"Bass) [9.40] - I.con gratulate the Government upon having at last brought forward this measure, which was forecast in the speech of the Governor General, at the opening of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth 25 years ago. The State of South Australia has had to wait a long time since the undertaking to construct the North-South line was given by the Com400, monwealth Parliament as far 1910 or 1911. Several arguments been advanced against this proposal. honourable member for Richmond (Mr . Green) advocated the construction of line through South Australia to land, over what has been called by fessor Gregory "" the dead heart of AusRanges. t r a l i a . "" I do not agree with the tion of the honourable member for W i mera (Mr Stewart) that that country worthless. It is not. But I do agree that it is almost the poorest, if poorest, land in Australia. member passing through that country 1921 with the sectional committee Public Works Committee. Mr Grombie, saida settler who held 365 square miles of land and who had reared a very fine family, said in his evidence that that country did not warrant a railway. have before me the evidence that' was always given by Sir Sidney Kidman, who, pera drought. haps, knows that country better than any other pastoralist in Australia. For very many years he travelled over it with cattle. He owns and controls stations not only there, but also in Queensland and in other parts of the Northern Territory. He said that there was only one route for a railway to the Northern Terripoor circumstances. tory, and that that was the direct north-south route. He stated very em100 miles west of Alice Springs. phatically that that railway should not go to Marree or Birdsville. The Minishis ter (Mr Hill ) last night argued that less than 500 square miles were necessary from their nearest neighbour. to enable a man to make a living in Northern Territory. He went further and said, "" I believe that nothing than 1,000 miles would be any good."" do not intend to advance in opposiholding tion to that view the opinions of a surveyor who travelled through in a motor car, nor shall I give the impressions which I gained in a similar way. I shall, however, quote from the evidence of settlers who have made a very good livbad, ingthere. First of all I shall quote views of Robert Henry Harris, grazier, in July, 1921. He said I have been in this country about 20 years. I am the holder of Hamilton Downs, an area of about 615 square miles, and carry 2,000 cattle and 300 horses. Concluding his evidence, he saidProvided a man can get water on his holding he can make a living on a 200 mile ifr. Jackson. . . . At present the blocks are out into only 500, and 600 square mile blocks, and you back as must take the whole lot: have Water is procurable in the Hamilton The Downs country, and most of the MacdonR. nell Ranges and the B u r t Plain country, a at very shallow depths - Sir Sidney K i d Queensman says that water can - be got at Proa depth of 12 feet out to the Musgrave At Alice Springs water is contenvery close to the surface, and the average m - depth of the wells, on the overland teleisgraph line, for a distance of 1,000 miles, is less than 50 feet. The rainfal l in not the Central Australia, that is, at Alice I well reSprings, is 11 inches, and it gradually in increases as you go further north. Sir of the Sidney Kidman in his evidence also I have known the track from Oodnadatta to Macdonnell Ranges for very many years. I originally owned Owen's Springs, next to I Alice Springs, in the ranges. The climate there is one of the best I have been in. It is cool at night, and I have never known I "" wish to tell honorabl-e members, the story of a f a m i l y named Crook, at Wyckcliffe Well, a little further north, and I am glad to have the opportunity to place it in the pages of Hansard. The family came to Australia from London in very Their first home, after their arrival here, was at a place The husband took a situation as a drover, and wife as a cook. They were 400 miles not from the nearest railway, and 100 miles It is the almost impossible to imagine what must have been the feelings of the mother of less the family, coming from London to an I isolated spot like that. To-day they are about 200 square miles of country, and when I visited them they were full of optimism and expected to do well. This is what Mrs Crook saidThe climate is quite suitable for a white woman. The mosquitoes and flies are very but my daughters and I generally have good health, although I suffer from rheumatism the in the winter. It would be much nicer, especially for the girls, if we had some neighbours. How is it possible for them to get neighbours without either a railway or a deabout cent road ? They are 650 miles from the nearest doctor in the north and 550 miles from tEe nearest doctor in the south. For years they have been expecting railblock way facilities, and I am glad that, at last, there is some hope of them realizing their expectations. Mrs Crook also said I have never tried to grow English potatoes, although I grow sweet potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, onions, beet, etc. We grow tomatoes all the year round. The nearest white woman is about 180 or 190 miles away. I should like honourable members to give their attention to the next few words in her evidence. They areTwo years ago we saw a white woman passing through here, the wife of a drover who was travelling with him. Then a pastoralist named Samuel Nicker gave this evidenceI have been in this district nine years, and have been in possession of this block for six years. I have an area of 550 square miles and run 500 sheep, 400 cattle, 100 horses, 100 goats and half-a-dozen donkeys. His property is near Central Mount Stuart, which is the actual centre of Australia. On the basis of one beast equalling five sheep, his property could have carried at least 2,500 sheep, which the Minister must agree ought to return a man a very fair living.",54
148,Mr HILL,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,I think the honourable member will admit that the country north of the Macdonnell Ranges is better than that south of the range. Mr JACKSON ! - I have been referring to the country that will be served by this railway. The country in the extreme north of South Australia and for the first 50 or 60 miles in the Northern Territory is very poor and has a low carrying capacity.,56
149,Mr HILL,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,That is what I said. added that a railway would not be justified if it were not for the admirable country north of the Macdonnell Ranges.,56
150,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"I followed the M in ister's speech very closely last night, and I think some other honourable members besides myself understood him to say that nothing less than 1,000 square miles of that country would be sufficient to enable a man to make a good living. I thought that he was referring to the Macdonnell ranges country itself, as well as to the country to the north of it . Sir Sidney Kidman told the Public Works Committee that there was no better sheep country in Australia than in that locality. We met a man named Rosenbaum at A r l tunga, 70 miles east of Alice Springs, and right in the heart of the range. He was originally a miner, but he afterwards settled on 195 square miles of country. He saidMy block is big enough for a man to take up. I am doing very well This settler was so poor when he took possession of his block that he could not afford to pay the regulation wage of 10s. a week .to a black fellow to help him to sink a well 30 feet deep.. He did the work with his own hands, and honourable members can imagine what a job it was when he struck water. He had to go down the well, bale the water into the bucket, and then climb out of the well again and empty his bucket. But settlers in the far north, when they are starting, often have to do that sort of thing. I thoroughly b.elieve that within the first few years of the railway reaching Alice Springs the development in the' Territory will be infinitely greater than it has been for many years. I have always contended that the Territory must be developed from the south, but even when the Government several years ago bought a road grader it was sent round to Darwin by boat, instead of up through the country, where the people could make use of it . Although many motors have travelled through the Territory fro m the south to the north, only one-and that one was driven by Francis Birtles to advertise some particular make of car-ha s come fro m north to south.",56
151,Dr MALONEY,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,Birtle s did very good work.,56
152,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"No doubt j but it the Government had endeavoured to develop the Territory from the south very I much better results would have been achieved in this regard. I have a complaint against the South Australian Government. Some time ago I suggested to it that it should make a stretch of road from Oodnadatta to Charlotte Waters, but it could not see its way clear to do so. The Macdonnell range country covers about the same area as the State of Tasmania-betwee n 25,000 and 30,000 square miles-and is 2,000 feet above sea level. I feel certain that, given railway facilities, it will in the f u t u r e become a health sanatorium during the winter, provided the Government will see that fares are reasonable. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) has presented the case in favour of a 4-ft. 8J-in gauge railway. I should be quite willing to support him if I thought that there was the slightest possibility that the Government would undertake the construction of such a line, but the report of the Public Works Committee on this matter stated that only a light 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway to Alice Springs was justified. I consider that the Government has acted wisely in accepting the advice of the Committee.",56
153,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,The Public Works Committee was asked to look at the matter only from the point of view of an extension of the Oodnadatta line.,57
154,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The 4-ft. 8$-in. gauge line constructed on the "" D "" basis referred to last night by the Minister would cost £2,800,000 more than a similar 3-ft. 6 - in. gauge line. To build a broad-gauge line would involve an annual interest expenditure of £250,000 more than a narrow gauge line, and there would be an annual loss in working expenses of more than £62,000 a year in excess of that of the 3-ft. 6-in. proposal. We shall be acting on economically sound lines if we adopt the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Other countries have built light developmental railways, and afterwards converted them into heavier lines. If the optimism of the honourable member for Wimmera. is warranted-and he says that the optimists are nearly always right-this country,' in the near future, will develop to such a great extent that the Government will be well able to afford to build a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway provided that in building the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line it makes the bridges and culverts strong enough to carry the heavier lines. Queensland has long stretches of light railway on which very good travelling time is made. South Africa also has excellent light railway lines. The railway gauge in Java is 3 f t . 3 in. and a fraction, and the carriages are 10 ft. 6 in. wide. When I was there some time ago the trains averaged 33 miles an hour, including stops. An effort has been made by those who are opposed to this line to make capital out of the stock transportation arrangements in the far north. Rut after all it is not a very long journey from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta or Adelaide. Sir Sidney Kidman informed me that on one occasion a mob of his cattle which were driven from the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta and . then sent through Adelaide to Melbourne by train, topped the market at the saleyards here. These beasts were driven 300 miles overland, and then carried well over 1,000 miles by rail to Melbourne. The evidence given to the Public Works Committee by a number of pastoralists indicated that cattle would always be carried by rail from Alice Springs in preference to droving them overland, because the country between a point south of Alice Springs and Oodnadatta over which they would have to travel was poor. The general opinion was that stock sent by train all the way would reach the saleyards in better condition than if they came by road, and so would bring better prices. Although I am a strong advocate of standard gauge railways, I believe that the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge will meet requirements in the Northern Territory for. a long while, for there'will not be atremendous amount of traffic. I do not, however, agree with the Minister's statement that the line will meet the needs for the next 50 or 100 years. My opinion is that it will be suitable for the requirements of the next 20 or 25 years. By that time it ought to be an economically sound proposition for us to convert it to the standard gauge. It is probably within the memory of many Australians that there was a tremendous outcry in America when the transcontinental railways, there were being constructed. It was said that they would not pay axle-grease because they would have to traverse so much desert and useless country. The same sort of thing is being said today in Australia. As a matter of fact, there is - practically no desert country between Oodnadatta and Darwin. I admit that there is some poor country in South Australia and in the southerly part of the Territory, but none of it could be called desert. The building of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and the extension of the line from the north to Newcastle Waters or Powell's Creek, and then across to Queensland, would provide adequate railway facilities for the development of the Northern Territory for the next 20 or 25 years. If the optimists are right, and I hope the honourable member for Wimmera includes me among them, the development in the Macdonnell Ranges and the Barkly Tablelands will soon , force . the Government to complete the North-South line. I hope that I may live to see that day. The possibility of mining development in the Northern Territory has certainly not been overstressed. In the eastern portions of the Macdonnell Range almost every known mineral has been fouud, and mica can be traced there for more than 100 miies. The great strides that have been made in the development of wireless have caused such an increase in the consumption of mica that, if a railway were constructed to within 70 or 80 miles of the Macdonnell Range, deposits, which are so extensive, would become very valuable. Yesterday honourable members had under consideration a bill for the provision of £40,000 for the encouragement of prospecting for minerals, and, by way of interjection, I remarked that the proposed railway to Alice Springs would do infinitely more than the £15,000 allotted to the Northern Territory under that bill. The Minister said that the two measures would go hand in hand, but I maintain that there will be no need for offering inducement to prospectors if the mineral belts in the Macdonnell Ranges country are made accessible. An area from 300 to 350 miles in length by almost 100 miles in width reaching from Alice Springs to Tennant's Creek is highly mineralized, and it contains almost all minerals, the notable exception being tin. I welcome the present proposal because of the fillip it will give to the mining industry, in addition to .the benefit that the pastoral industry will derive from it. I could quote extensively from the Public Works Committee's report, which I commend to the attention of honourable members if they desire to know the facts in regard to the stock-carrying capacity of the Northern Territory, according to men who have made their living there. I have not previously commented on the agreement made between South Australia and the Commonwealth with respect to the transfer of the Northern Territory, but I have said that the. country in the neighbourhood of the Macdonnell Ranges thoroughly justifies the construction of the line. If South Australia has such a good case as it thinks it has under its agreement, the argument is all the stronger for the construction of the railway. I confidently believe that the [1*4] line will lead to a rapid development of the Territory, and, therefore, 1 welcome the bill.",57
155,Mr DUNCAN,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"HUGHES (Boothby) [10.3] - For three reasons, which I shall briefly set out, I personally favour the route that the Government has decided upon. In the first place, I consider that it is the route which it was originally intended the line should follow. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) stated that in his opinion-and I was glad to hear it-wha t was intended under the original agreement with South Australia was a railway running through that State, and through the Northern Territory. I put it to the honourable member that he should go a little further, and then he will probably agree that what was intended in the first place was a line from Oodnadatta on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. At that time Kingoonya was almost, unknown, for no railway passed through it. My second reason for supporting the bill is that it provides for a line that will be very much cheaper to construct than the alternative proposal, since it will cost £1,700,000 as against £4,500,000. It will necessitate the construction of only 297 miles of new line as against 530 miles, which is a considerable difference. In the third place there will be considerably less loss in the working expenses than if the other proposal were adopted. It seems to me that the only sound argument against the Oodnadatta route-assum ing that the country is substantially similar in each case, or even assuming that the country about Kingoonya is ft little better-is the lact that the line is not proposed to be built on the standard gauge. I am in full agreement theoretically with those who do not desire to support the construction of any railway on a gauge other than 4 f t . 8£ in. But in this matter one has n good deal more than theory to consider. It must be remembered that a railway has already been constructed by South Australia for a great distance northward from Port Augusta on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. The 3ft. 6-in. gauge runs as far as Oodnadatta in the south, while in the Northern Territory a line on the same gauge has been authorized as far southward as Duly Waters. This matter was f u l ly discussed in the House in 1923 when Parliament decided that,, all things considered, the north-south line was so different in nature from other railway systems, and so disconnected with the other great lines, that the extra expense of adopting the standard gauge would not be justified. I happened to be looking through Eansarcl when the honourable member for Wimmera was speaking tonight and I propose to quote what he said on the 25th July, 1923, when the Northern Territory Railway Extension Bill was under consideration. I do this in no spirit of hostility to the honourable member; in fact, I think that the House is under a debt of gratitude to him for the interest he took in this question when he was Minister for Works and Railways, and for the journey he undertook into the interior of Australia at a time when he was not in good health. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mx. Makin) at that time took exception to the proposal of the Government to perpetuate and extend the difficulty which he said had arisen in Australia as a result of the adoption in different States of varying railway gauges. The honourable member for Wimmera interjected, ""We must build this extension on the same gauge as the existing line."" If that was his opinion then, there is all the more reason for it now, since the construction of the further section of railway which was then under discussion has been authorized.",58
156,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"The cases are not at all parallel. We should have had to put 4-ft. 8A-in. gauge rolling stock in the Northern Territory, and we had none.",59
157,Mr DUNCAN,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"HUGHE S - In my opinion the cases are parallel. Subsequently the subject of sleepers was raised, and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) movedThat the following words be added to the elause- "" But the sleepers shall be of sufficient length to enable the gauge to be widened to 4-ft. 8i-in. when required."" The ex-Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) stated in-replyI hope the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) will not press the amendment. The estimate provides for bridges and culverts-includin g the large bridge over the Katherine Biver, which will cost £95,000capable of carrying a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge line. The reason that sleepers suitable for a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge line were not included in the estimate was because the sost of conversion will not be great if the bridges and culverts do not require alteration. On the other hand, the initial cost of providing the longer sleepers would be approximately £160,000. The House has already passed an appropriation for £1,545,000 which will provide for bridges and culverts large enough, and strong enough, to carry a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge line. It is quite true that the line may be converted some time to the. wider gauge, but that is not likely to happen in the near future. I ask the honourable member to withdraw the amendment, because his wishes have been met in every respect except the length of the sleepers. The Government has made reasonable provision for the future conversion of the line. The same remark applies today in connection with the line which we are now considering: at some future date it also may be converted to the wider gauge. I hope that I am not doing the honourable member an injustice.",59
158,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,Not at all. The honourable member is pointing out that provision has been made for the future conversion of that line to the standard gauge.,59
159,Mr DUNCAN,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"HUGHES - In that instance it was decided to construct a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway. If the honourable member's argument was good then, it is good in this instance also.",59
160,Mr STEWART,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,-In this bill no provision is made for conversion.,59
161,Mr DUNCAN,PAPUA ANDNEW GUINE A,"HUGHES - The honourable member cannot have it both ways. I do not think that I need say any more in regard to this matter, except to support the remarks of the honourable mem the late Mr Simpson Newland. When I spoke in this House on this question three years ago, I made reference to Mr . Newland's untiring efforts on behalf of the Northern Territory, and I am glad to know that he derived a little pleasure from my utterances on that occasion. Unfortunately, since then he has passed away. No man in Australia. did more for the construction of this railway than did Mr Simpson Newland. During a period of 40 or 50 years, politicians and statesmen came and went, but he, himself a politician and publicist, fought until nearly 90 years of age for this and other causes dear to him. I profoundly regret that he is not among us to see the attainment of his longcherished desire. Debate (on motion by Mr MANNING)/ adjourned. House adjourned at 10.13 p.m.",59
