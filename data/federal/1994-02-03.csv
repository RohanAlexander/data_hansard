2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows, and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Leaded Petrol To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the reduction of octane quality of leaded petrol from January 1994, resUlting from the government's 'Lead Roundtable' meeting. The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality: (1) Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffei-ing serious engine damage; . (2) Will result in worse vehicle operation, higher emissions and greater fuel consumption for up to three million vehicles; (3) Will have negligible benefit to the community, through reduced lead emissions, because the oil industry proposes to leave lead levels in petrol unchanged in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and because the use of leaded petrol already is rapidly decreasing; (4) Will disadvantage vehicle enthusiasts and low income members of the community. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House take action to ensure the continued availability of high octane petrol for Australian motorists. by Mr Anderson (from 822 citizens), Mr Cobb (from 33 citizens), Mr Sharp (from 16 citize-s) and Mr Simmons (from eight citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: I. The majority of Western Australians are opposed to any form of title based on a High Court decision and based on eligibility being determined by racial origin. 2. The majority of Australians acknowledge the specific rights granted by the Mabo decision. 3. The issue of whether potential claims' for native title should be allowed in any other place, or whether all Australians should have equal right to acquire land under the established laws of the States and Territories'-as applied pre-Mabo-should be decided by a referendum of all the Australian people. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by ' Mr Evans (from lQ9 citizens), Mrs Moylan (from 104 citizens),  Mr Williams (from 35 citizens). Breast· Cancer Screening To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House: 1. Overwhelming evidence is now available in Australia to indicate breast cancer can be treated and many deaths can be avoided if screening takes place early enough. 2. Many Australian women are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to be able to undertake mammography screening. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House requests the Federal Government to undertake an urgent review of the present policies with a view to introducing expanded mammography screening services and including them in the schedules to attract medical benefits. by Mr Cameron (from 23 citizens).

Bears: China To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears for these purposes to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Evans (from 22 citizens), Mr Filing (from 151 citizens) and Ms Moylan (from 30 citizens). Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes. to the Family Law Act of Australia and to The Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes. (1) That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped . and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary.

Petrol Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax: (I) discriminates against low income families and those living in rural areas (2) increases business costs and will cause further unemployment (3) adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product (4) breaks Mr Keating's election promise not to put up tax. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose these iricreasesin petrol excise. by Mr Evans (from 114 citizens) and Dr Kemp (from 275 citizens). National Flag To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: (1) The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national (2) We therefore request that the.

Violence in the Media To the Honourable - he Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citi-ns of Australia draws to the attention of the House the controversial cartoon ""Beavis and Butt-Head"". This cartoon is coming to Australia from America where it is said by some to be unravelling the fabric of society. These animated teenagers engage in arson, petty theft, shoplifting, auto-theft, credit card fraud cruelty to animals. Not to mention their attitude towards women which is also outrageous. There is growing evidence to support theaqve-e effects that violent videos and television have on the mental and spiritual health of our children. We must not ignore the evidence. . Your petitioners therefore pray that the House ban this cartoon from being shown in Australia. We just don't need it. by Mr Atkinson, (from 79 citizens) .. Child-Care Guidelines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that we strongly support the constant repetition of Christmas songs as' background music being played in child-care centres at the - nd of the year; and we humbly request that the NatIonal Childcare Accreditation Council does not with-raw or withhold a present or future Federal subSIdy from any child-care centre where Christmas ba-k-round - usic is played in this way. And your petitIoners as In duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Atkinson (from 74 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows flag. That the majority of Australians clearly stand united in satisfaction with the existing Australian National Flag which reflects their values, history, Australian natIonal and heritage. And that they condemn unwarranted attacks on their historic Australia Flag, whenever of wherever . made by any Australian citizens. So therefore we call upon the House of Representa' tives to ensure that the Australian National Flag, as publicly acclaimed in 1901 and confirmed under the Flags Act (1953), is not changed, replaced, or diminished at any time, or in any manner whatsoever, without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Braithwaite (from 1,911 citizens). Australian Army Band To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the· State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the and House our strongest opposition to the decision of the Federal Government to disband the Australian Anny Band, Perth. . Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to oppose any attempt to dissolve the Australian Army Band, Perth. by Mr Cameron (from 88 citizens). Pathology. Collection To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Leichhardt in the State of Queensland, draws to the attention of the House that at the end of the month of January 1994, the sole, licensed private pathology collection centre in the town of Gordonvale will be closed. Because of the lack of public transport to the sites of alternative pathology collection centres in Cairns, this closure will place great stress and some danger on to many people, including elderly persons and younger mothers of this district. The House should note that the decision to close the centre was made in 1991 on the basis that the then population of the immediate district was less than the numberrequired to justify such a centre. In 1993 the population materially exceeds the required figure. . Your Petitioners therefore request the House to take action by asking the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson to allow the present pathology centre to continue operating. by Mr Dodd (from 1,172 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of.Australia respectfully submit that the Government's proposed scheme for the accreditation of child care centres in the ""Quality Improvement and Accreditation System Handbook"" be rejected because it: (1) Fails to recognise that Christian values are important to children. ' (2) Forces parents to relinquish their decisiqn making rights in relation to the manner in which they choose to raise their children. (3) Will cost the taxpayer $11 million dollars to implement without creating a single care place. (4) Forces children and parents to accept values that may be unacceptable to them. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Evans (from 50 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the the Hanoi authorities: potential to,affec- every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (d) notes that extent of research funding ture on other medical conditions with significantly lower mortality rates such as the HIV virus; (e) calls on the Federal Government to provide more funds for breast cancer research; and, (t) recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150% to encourage community support to help eliminate this disease and to increase the availability of research funds. We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that greater resources are made available for research into breast cancer. by Mr Evans (from 25 citizens). Medicare Office: Warwick To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia, recognising that: Child Care (a) the Federal Electorate of Cowan is serviced by only one Medicare office; (b) for a majority of Cowan electors, the closest Medicare offic- is in excess of twenty minutes away in a vehicle; (c) the electors of Cowan deserve an easily as set out accessible Medicare office; (d) the Federal Electorate of Cowan has experienced a population growth of 20% from 1986-1991 with no adjustment to services offered to the community by Medicare; calls on the Federal Government to open a Medicare office at the Warwick Shopping Centre without delay. extra child by Mr Evans (from 18 citizens). Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church To the honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled the petition of the undersigned showeth that: Since May 1992, th({ Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) started a new campaign trying to stamp out the voice of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation (UVBC which is led by the Modest Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, an Amnesty International's prisoner of conscience since his third arrest by the GOSRV in 1982. The GOSRV has ignored the UVBC's moderate demands: the restoration of its structure and activiti- in the country, as clearly stated in the letter signed by Thich Huyen Quang on 25.6.92 to . Your petitioners therefore pray that the House make stronger representations to the GOSRV by: (a) urging that the GOSRV respond promptly to expendimotion passed by the Commonwealth Parliament condemning the continual denial of basic religious freedoms to the people of Vietnam; (b) asks the Prime Minister to express, in the strongest possible terms, the disapproval of Australia at the religious intolerance displayed by the GOSRV; and (c) requests that the GOSRV restore and recognise the independence of the UVBC's structure and activities. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Evans (from seven citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Repr-entatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned parents and friends of Wattle Pre-school draws attention to the House that the Federal Government is seeking to link accreditation to eligibility for Childcare Assistance and in the opinion of your petitioners this link will only lead to higher f-es for parents and no g-aran­ tee for improvement m quahty of care for children. We know that quality care cannot be legislated for-it comes from the heart. Please help us to help our children. Your petitioners therefore request the House to reject accreditation being linked to Childcare Assistance. by Ms Fatin (from 12 citizens): National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.

We express deep concern over the proposed changes to the legislation which would take us from a Judeo-Christian ethic of the raising of children within our Nation. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House seriously consider the ramifications of the proposals as they would affect the future generation of citizens toward the twenty first century. by Mr Forrest (from 141 citizens). United Nations Religion Declaration To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that: The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief: prohibits all forrns of religious discrimination, thus potentially restricting the freedom of Australians to make any choices on the grounds of their belief; could lead to US-style prohibitions on public Christian prayers, Christmas carols or nativity scenes; has the potential, according to the NSW Attorney-General, to res\rict greatly the freedom of religious groups; and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association; gives only the legally-weak term urespectU for the rights of parents in Article 5; could result in government-a::;sisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore 'pray that your Honourable House will: act to disallow these two International Instruments from the HREOC Act. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mrs Gallus (from 49' citizens). Child-Care Guidelines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives aS,sembled Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. We are opposed to the childcare guidelines issued by the National Child care Accreditation Council and the Keating Gove-ent, and 2. In particular we find offensive the guidelines relating to Christmas Carols and the misconceived gender statements relating to the childrens toys.

We therefore call upon the House to reject the guidelines as they are currently drafted. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. . by Mr Lloyd (from 34 citizens). Democratic Constitutional Monarchy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: Australia, under its constitutional system based on the Monarchy, is one of the world's most successful democracies. The petitioners note that our constitution, based on the monarchy, has: ensured national independence maintained national unity in a federation provided constitutional stability , protected our liberties and freedoms produced a tolerant society Your petitioners therefore request that: Australia should remain a democratic constitutional Monarchy with Her Majesty, the Queen of Australia, as our Head of State and represented in Australia by a Governor General. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Lloyd (from three citizens). Child-Care Services To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of parents of Australia's children oppose any proposal of the Federal Government to link compulsory accreditation with eligibility for fee relief for parents who send their children to long day care centres. We recognise that as parents, we are the best people to determine the future of our children and reject any attempt by the government to institutionalise our children. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Represeritatives to oppose any plan by the government for compulsory accreditation of child care centres. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Moore (from 109 citizens). Vietnam: Human Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in The Australian Federal Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. Even as Communism disintegrating elsewhere around the globe, Vietnam's 72 million people still suffer under communist totalitarianism. 2. Although there have been some moves towards economic development by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in recent years, they have not led towards political liberation or improved human right records. People are imprisoned or kept under housearrest without charge or trial for the peaceful expression of their beliefs and alternative points of view. Among them are Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and Thich Quang Do, Thich Tri Sleu, Thich Tue Si, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Tinh, Thich Hai Tang, Thich Khong Tanh: Recently Assistant Archbishop Nguyen Van Thuan has not been allowed to return to Vietnam after his overseas tour. Other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience include Dr Nguyen Dan Que, a member of Amnesty International, Dr Doan Viet Hoat a former Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the Van Hanh University. 3. Especially the Hanoi government has arrested on 17/11/93 Mr Nguyen Dinh Huy, Dr Pham Tuong, the leaders of the Movement to Unite People and Build Democracy inside Vietnam because of their plan to organise the International Conference to develop Vietnam in Saigon. Some other members of the organisation were also arrested such as Mr Bui Kim Dinh, Mr Tran Quang Liem, Mr Nguyen Tan Tri coming to Vietnam from the United States. This is further evidence of human rights violation and communist totalitarianism. Such treatment represents a systematic attack of international standards of human rights solemnly recognised in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and in the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Your petitioners respectfully request the House of Representatives to: . 1. Urge the Hanoi government to take action to facilitate the release of all religious leaders, political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, in particular those mentioned above. 2. Urge the Hanoi government to allow all religions to independently practice and organise their religious affairs in Vietnam. , 3. Call on the Australian government to press the Hanoi government to respect human rights and civil rights in Vietnam, and to take these factors into account in its consideration of the provision of economic assistance. by Mr Ruddock (from 44 citizens). East Timor To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Padiament: The petition of certain dtizerisof Australia, draws to the attention of the House the blatant abuse of human rights that have occurred and continue to occur to the people of East Timor at the hands of the occupying forces of the Indonesian Government. Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House uses all it's power and influence to persuade the Indonesian Government to bring a speedy end to this suffering and to support any United Nations action to free the East Timorese people from this oppression, consistent with your response to the people of Kuwait. by Mr Ruddock (from 22 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament House - Since then the We, the citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House of Representatives the issue of East Timor.

We know that quality care cannot be legislated for it comes from the heart. Please help us to help our children. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled reject the accreditation guidelines. by Mr Somlyay (from 152 citizens). SBS: Wide Bay To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors in the Division of Wide Bay points out to the House that the Wide Bay was originally scheduled to receive transmisEast Timor sion of the Special Broadcasting Service in a submission to the Government in 1985 but was subsequently dropped. ' Wide Bay has experienced one of the biggest population growth rates in australia and there is now a demand in the community for the service to be provided in the Wide Bay. Your petitioners therefore request the House to put in motion the procedure for the transmission of the Special Broadcasting Service into the Wide Bay region as soon as possible. by Mr Truss (from 657 citizens). Mabo High Court Decision To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention of the House to the confusion over the Mabo High Court Decision and calls on Members to require the conduct of a Referendum to amend the Australian Constitution to reaffirm beyond doubt the rights of State Governments alone to define and issue land title. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Thckey (from 159 citizens). Off-Road Diesel Fuel To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the unde-signed shows: We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the Government's proposal to charge user$ of off-road diesel fuel a tax equal to one per cent of the amount rebated to them through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme under the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration to Charge Bill 1993 be abandoned. The Petitioners note particularly that 1. Users of off-road diesel fuel currently receive a full or partial rebate of fuel excise paid in recognition that they shOUld not have to contribute to. road funding and maintenance in the same manner as on-road users of diesel fuel; .:l. We Dbject to. being forced to. pay fuel excise on diesel fuel and then being charged a tax, which the GDvernment is calling an 'administratiDn fee', to. have that mDney returned to. rebate; . 3. This tax sets a dangerous precedent and cDuld lead to. gDvernments charging similar taxes on rebates, such as thDse fDr persDnal incDme tax. And YDur petitiDners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Tuckey (from 155 citizens). To. the HDnDurable the Speaker and Members of the HDuse of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to. the attentiDn of the HDuse that great effDrts are being made to. attain sustainable land use through landcare. At the present level in the order of 100. years to. achieve a stable landscape Australia wide (based on an accepted level of necessary vegetatiDn cDver). Whereas environmental degradatiDn on private land in Australia needs substantial expenditure to. !Irrest and reverse trends such as increasing salinity brought abDut by traditiDnal practices of land utilisatiDn. Such' expenditure required encDuragement and some degree of SUpPDrt from the general pDpulatiDn and tax payer. We request that assistance such as tax deductibility in the order of 150 per cent on approved landcare expenditures be granted ..· We believe this wDuld result in Ii massive re-directiDn of available funds tDwards landcare l,md subsequent improved sustainable land use, living standards and taxable incDmes. YDur petitiDners therefore pray that the HDuse will give this matter earnest cDnsideratiDn and YDur petitiDners as in duty bDund, will ever pray. by Mr Tuckey (from 22 citizens).

We do. not believe that the Australian Broadcasting AuthDrity is, to. use.its own terminD1Dgy, ""in tune with current cDmmunity attitudes."" Over 100,000 Australians have expressed their CDncern relating to. viDlence' and pDrnDgraphy on televisiDn to. the ABA, with no. apparent effect. DDzens of majDr . natiDnal cDmpanies have refused to. assDciate their products with pDrnDgraphic programs. ""BlasphemDUS, indecent Dr Dbscene"" material, which is prohibited by ABT standards, cDntinues to' be broadcast on televisiDn regularly. In additiDn, we are cDncerned that the FederatiDn us as a of Australian CDmmercial TelevisiDn StatiDn's CDdes of Practice seem to' be designed not to. protect impressiDnable children, immature adDlescents and adults from Dffensive televisiDn but to. protect networks from prosecutiDn. We urge the Parliament to. investigate the escalatiDn of gratuitDus viDlence and sexually explicit material on televisiDn and to. institute appropriate measures to. lift televisiDn standards; Landcare And we will, as in duty bDund, ever pray. by Mr Walker (from 1,055 citizens).

3,Mr CONNOLLY,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"I move: That this HDuse: (1) expresses it sadness at the lDSS of human life and damage to. fauna and property caused by the recent NSW bushfires; and (2) cDmmends the effDrtsand sacrifices of regular and vDlunteer firefighters from New SDuth Wales .and interstate in quelling thDse fires; From time immemorial, fire has been an important part of the Australian ecosystem. In fact, it is even recorded in the reports of Captain Arthur Phillip when he arrived at Sydney Cove. He was impressed at the pall of smoke that he saw drifting over Botany Bay and Port Jackson during January 1788. Virtually all the citizens of New South Wales and Australia, as well as people around the world, for the first 15 days of this year watched hourly on their television sets and heard on radios the· human and ecological tragedy of the fires that occurred along the coastal fringe of New South Wales. At their height there were some 200 fires being fought by thousands of volunteers and professional firemen, who came not just from Sydney and the metropolitan area, not just from volunteer fire brigades across New South Wales, but from every state and territory of the Commonwealth. Undoubtedly, that was one of the I most significant aspects of what was otherwise a very critical situation. We saw at a time of need the Australian people and the state and territory governments come together to give of their best in what, in my experience, has been a unique effort. I recall distinctly, travelling in a police through a fire in the Lane Cove National Park, the feeling of utter joy-I can describe it in no lesser terms-at seeing a convoy of white South Australian fire trucks going past with unit names-such as Mount Barker and other places-on their sides; carrying the men and the women volunteers with their yellow hats bravely facing what was to come. They had travelled all night from South Australia to be with us in the metropolitan areas of Sydney under threat and on the central coast of New South Wales. As I have said, there were volunteers from across the continent. The fire buckets provided by New Zealand and flown in by the New Zealand Air Force were of critical importance in enabling both the RAAF and civilian pilots to water bomb in very critical situations. It is appropriate on this occasion to draw special attention to the very sad human cost of those fires. We lost five people in New Sout- Wales directly as a result of the fires; four m that first 15 days and the fifth only last weekend. I would like to place on the record the name of Mr Norman Anthes 45 of Lithgow, who· served as a voluntee; fo; more· than 20 years and was burnt to death when a tree he was felling bounced after hitting the ground. The Mount Horrible fire is believed to have been caused by a lightning strike in the Winburndale Nature Reserve. He gave of his best. He spent a lot of his time working for the bushfire brigade. He took gre-t pride in his membership and his death has had a devastating effect on his fellow fighters and the community. He was a selfemployed builder and is survived by his de facto wife, Glenda Hollaway, who. is six months pregnant, their one-year-old son, - tuart, and two sons from a previous marriage, Corey, 22, and Scott, 21. . Mr .R-bert Page, aged 53, of Bundanoon, died d?rlng the mopping-up operations after a fire m the Double Duke State Forest near Grafton which was deliberately lit. Mr John Roach, 74, of Glendale near Newcastle suffered a heart attack brought on by smokinhalation while he was trying to build a firebreak to protect a friend's home. Perhaps one of the saddest cases in relation to Sydney car was the death of Patricia O'Neil. She died trying to protect her de facto's children. She ""Yas 42 years of age. She died of asphyxiation, although the police will be conducting further investigations into her death. Finally, last weekend we had the case of Clinton Westward. At the age of 17 he had been a volunteer with the Pheasants Nest bushfire service for some 12 months. He had fought in the recent fires at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains alongside his father, and also battled fires at Belrose in my, electorate in early January. Clinton was part of a team called to a grassfire on the F5 freeway near Pheasants Nest south of Camden. He was in a tanker which was travelling about one kilometre from its base when it overturned throwing Clinton from the vehicle, and hwas killed. Four other members of the team were injured. Clinton would have started year 12 at school this year, but now he is dead. When we compare the fires in New South Wales with the conflagrations of Ash Wednesday some years ago in South Australia and also Victoria, in human terms the cost was obvi-usly less. In terms of lost property, certamly the cost was less. It was estimated by the insurance industry that the total insured loss was somewhere in the range of $60 million, but estimates are still being made. But that in no sense reduces the enormous human participation and the enormous costs to those hundreds and hundreds of families which were evacuated from their homes and for all the others who had their sons, daughters or their fathers and mothers as volunteers out there fighting those fires morning, noon and night while their relatives waited at home wondering what was to become of them .. In terms of economic effort, it was an enormous exercise as well. The emergency services used 43 light helicopters, six planes and one jet reconnaissance aircraft to water bomb the worse affected areas around the state. There were over 8,000 volunteer bushfire fighters from the New South Wales bushfire service, 800 from· the New South Wales urban fire brigade and 1,500 from interstate, as well as military firefighters, who were in action throughout that entire period. Aqd we must not forget the substantial contribution in a technical sense made by New Zt;aland. While only five people died in last month's fires, several hundred people were injured, and 185 houses were actually destroyed. I have moved this motion because my electorate is surrounded by bush: regrettably, over the years it has probably had more than its fair share of fires. Some of the most dramatic fires in the metropolitan area of Sydney worked their way from Turramurra right through to Lane Cove, down the Lane Cove River valley. That was only part of the problem; the other problem was across in the Kuring-gai Chase National Park and the national parks over towards the Hawkesbury River. Those fires burnt right through, to the coast at Broken Bay, and that was where most of the damage in the metropolitan area was done-as well as, of course, in the Menai area and the southern suburbs of Sydney. In the Warringah Shire, fires broke out in the Cottage Creek area on Friday, 7 Jariuary. They were under control by 6.00 p.m. on Thursday, 13 January, and the state ofemergency was revoked. I should point out, however, that the first of those fires was started on New Year's Eve by people firing flares into the bush from boats on Broken Bay. That fire was put out but, subsequently, another fire started. The sad thing about most of these fires in January is that it appears-and I say this subject to the final determination of the coroner-that most of them were deliberately lit. The one in Turramurra was lit by a schoolboy and his mates, and they were caught. I find it utterly inexplicable that people deliberately create such mayhem, both in environmental terms and in human terms, simply to get a kick out of hearing the sirens of the fire brigades going by. Perhaps· the sickeSt part of all is that some of those people SUbsequently are out there as 'volunteers'doing their bit to put out the fire which they started in the first place. Those people require the services of a psychologist, one of which I am not. The firefighters in Warringah Shire were drawn, in the local area, from bush fire brigades and the New South Wales Fire Brigade. From interstate, they came mainly from South Australia, and police and emergency services personnel were involved. We lost. some 11,000 hectares or 110 square kilometres of land, and 29 houses were burnt; 130.houses were partly damaged; and two bridges were lost. Fortunately, there were no significant injuries sustained, nor loss of life. At this stage we do not know the totality of the property damage. In Ku-ring-gai on the Turramurra side 580 hectares, mainly in the Lane Cove River valley, were burnt. A further 231 hectares were lost around the Ku-ring-gai wildflower gardens at St Ives. Property damage amounted to 13 houses destroyed in Ku-ring-gai and 22 houses damaged to various degrees. Assistance came from the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai bush fire brigades, the New South Wales Fire Brigade and, from time to time as required, from firefighters from the ACT and the Country Fire Service of Victoria.

4,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,Is the motion seconded?,20
5,Mr HARRY WOODS,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"page) (9.48 a.m.)I second the motion. I would firstly like to say that I support completely what the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has just said. Generally, on both sides of this house, we are extremely proud of the effort the bush fire fighters put in at a time of crisis. There is no doubt that the New Year bushfires in New South Wales did tell a story of crisis, loss of property and loss of life. They also told of a community spirit of which, as Australians, we are immensely and justifiably proud. They showed that at a can time of crisis we can come together, and that type of mateship has helped us, over 200 years, to live as a strong and close community in what is really a harsh land. The bush fire crisis showed us that we can forget our political differences, our neighbourhood jealousies, our prejudices-and all the other baggage that we carry in our daily lives-in order to look after those who are in trouble at times like this. It gave me great faith in the Australian people and the people of my community. All of us feel the same about the work done by the emergency services and the raft of other volunteers who helped to prevent the disaster from being much more severe. It also gave me confidence about a growing relationship with other countries in the Pacific and the South Pacific. I was surprised, I have to say, to learn that after the fires the people of Vanuatu had started a public appeal to raise funds to help the people with rebuilding in and around my electorate base of Grafton. Vanuatu is not a rich community; it is a very small Pacific island but, within days of the appeal having been launched, the target of $20,000 had been reached and appeal funds have now passed $25,000. I think that that is a remarkable effort and one of which the people of not. only the Clarence Valley but the rest of Australia should be very appreciative. People of Vanuatu, some of them expatriate Australians, learned of the bushfires from TV broadcasts and they wanted to do as much as they could. But with a small population and low incomes, the prospect of raising those funds was perhaps a little daunting for them. They chose Grafton because we have a strong relationship which has been built over the last few years in a number of areas. Their generosity showed that that relationship was more than commercial, as it has been in the past; it was evidence of the growing affinity between the Clarence Valley and Vanuatu. The participation of the people in my electorate and from visiting firefighters that came to our region from Queensland, from Northern Territory and from many other parts of New South Wales was equally pleasing. It was an event which went a long way, I think, to restoring our faith in human nature, a faith that had bel<n largely shattered by the actions of a few heartless and thoughtless fools who started the fires in the first place. Back at home the fires started long before Christmas, as far back as October, when the local press was running stories that bad times were ahead with the forthcoming bushfire season. Less than two weeks later the stories started about the first deliberately lit fires in and· around national parks near I1uka. And they were right. Bad times certainly were ahead. On 27 December, the real problems started. Three villages-Angourie,Wooloweyah and Brooms Head-were at risk bec-use of fire, again started by an arsonist. Sixty firefighters were required to get them under control, but they started to pop up all over the place. Now, as well as the fires in Brooms Head, Wooloweyah and Angourie, there were outbreaks near Grafton, Kyogle, Lynchs Creek, Middle Mountain and North Mountain, Cawongla, and soon they were at Dalmorton and Grange state forests. In Copmanhurst shire more than a dozen homes were threatened. New Year celebrations had to be put on hold for the 250 firefighters who had come frqm all over the state at a time of year when they would have liked to be home with their families and friends. They came many hundreds of kilometres in order to help prevent loss of life and property on the north coast. On 2 January bushfire authorities were hoping that they had most of the blazes under control but the positive outlook was shortlived, On 4 January the number of volunteers had swollen from 250. to 500 and there was no sign of things getting easier. The fires deteriorated badly and volunteer firefighter Robert Page lost his life at 3 a.m. on that day from another deliberately lit blaze north of Maclean when a tree fell on his vehicle. Four others were injured in the incident. It is worth poting that Robert Page had come to the north coast. from south of Sydney to help there. There. were something like 70 blazes going on at the time. People were being evacuated froIJl camping grounds. They were living on sP9ri:ing fields. . It is difficult to comprehend even now the magnitude of it all. Almost everyone who could was helping. Those who could not be of direct assistance in the bush were helping by preparing meals and taking them to the volunteers' in the field. It was a remarkable spectacle of cooperation. We even had a local health consultant offering the field workers free massages in order that they· could get some relaxation if not much sleep. . On 7 January the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) came to Grafton and joined me in a flight over the fire stricken areas and he offered whatever help the government could provide. At that time the Clarence Valley and other parts of the north coast were fighting 45-degree heat, day after day, with no sign of rain, very low humidity, high winds and no prospect of the fires abating. A change in the weather late in the week brought the reprieve that everyone had been waiting for. A total of 2000 firefighters were involved in fighting the fires, which occurred largely within my electorate. I do not think either myself or any other member of the community can adequately express our appreciation for the work of these men and women and scores of others who worked behind the scenes. It was indeed a humbling and wonderfully rewarding experience to be able to join these men and women in the field ,on a number of nights and to be able to help control the blazes. The fires have raised questions across the state about fire management. It is clear that we can 'and must do more to help prevent outbreaks of such magnitude occurring again. If that had been done in the past perhaps those fires may have been more easily controlled. It will probably cause other states also tore-examine their fire management regimes. I think there is a role for politicians but should always bear in mind that we are not the experts and that any decisions we reach should be based on the best possible advice from the best sources. There has been plenty said since the fires about what was perceived as a need for more controlled bums, about the need for more access trails and more burning through national parks. I think that is true but it .needs to be done with advice and in a considered way. There has been plenty of criticism of the fire management practices of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service but there has been little consideration in the argument so far of the needs for the other inhabitants of the land. Critics often tend to forget that the fires were equally as bad in other areas as they were in the north coast. Before making decisions, state and federal governments should weigh up all the options and not make decisions which are devised, if you like, in the heat of the moment. These fires gave a lesson which we can all take into our daily lives and that is if we work together we can achieve almost anything. It was something of a miracle that there were not more deaths or property losses. For that we can thank the efforts of thousands of volunteers who worked tirelessly and with great skill to do as much as they could to reduce the risks. I think country area brigades particularly, although their training is first class and their efforts could not be surpassed, very often work with equipment that is outdated. Although it is kept in good condition by them, their ability to fight the fires would certainly be enhanced by funding for up-to-date equipment. Many of the fire trucks and equipment are over 20 years old. Because of the funding arrangements, country area brigades often have to purchase those vehicles second hand from other fire services that have better funding. The situation is perhaps worse than that in the western area of New South Wales. That is one area that needs to be looked at very seriously. (Time expired)",20
6,Mr VAILE,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"It is certainly a pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on this particular we motion this morning. I join with the previous speakers in saying what a very heartening situation it was to see many thousands of Australians coming together at a time of great crisis and great need. I might start where the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) finished by making some comments about the structure of the volunteer bush fire organisations, particularly in New South Wales. Anybody who has been involved in local government, and I am sure the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) will make comments in his address, is aware that the volunteer bush fire brigades are supported by local government, supported by state government, and that they work tirelessly. They spend, a lot of their time raising funds themselves, running raffles and doing all sorts of things to purchase equipment to protect other people's property and other people's lives. This was borne out in this dramatic experience that we had in New South Wales at the beginning of this year when we saw so many people prepared to give up time and risk their lives to protect other people's property. In the analysis that will go on during the year following the tragedies of the fires, that is a very important aspect of the inquiries that must take place. As the honourable member for Page said, we must look closely at adequate funding and support for these organisations. Just as an aside, when I was in Sydney on my way through to Canberra for this sitting week, someone made the comment that in excess of 300 regular New South Wales Fire Brigade personnel were on leave and were not recalled to assist with the fighting of these bushfires. That claim is unsubstantiated. It was a comment I picked up, but it is one that I would certainly like to express concern about if it is true. No doubt it will come out in the ensuing inquiries. All three tiers of government need to seriously look at the type of equipment provided to these people. It is too late when the crisis arises. We had to seek assistance from New Zealand with some of the firefighting equipment and with the technology that it has developed over the years. As was mentioned by the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), New Zealand fire buckets made an enormous difference. Although the damage bill could hilVe been greater, it is certainly enormous in dollar terms and in terms of the cost in lives, the social impact, and the disruption caused by these fires. As we are all aware, the majority of the fires were started by arsonists, for whatever reason. It is incomprehensible why someone would want to do that, but that is something that we are never going to change in this country. There are always going to be people who are prepared to do that sort of thing for a joke or as a prank just to see the fire engines come out. They do not understand or care about the consequences. As h-s been put on the record, during the fires four lives were lost, and one was lost more recently. About 800,000 hectares of New South Wales bushland was burnt out, and a lot of that area was in national parks. A total of 185 homes were destroyed and a further 114 homes were damaged. The insurance claims are expected to top the $100 million mark, but the total bill is likely to exceed $200 million. During the fires, more than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the state's central coast area, the Blue Mountains, Como, around Grafton and on Sydney's North Shore. Around 20,000 volunteer bush fire fighters were needed to fight the fires, with 10,000 on duty at all times during the peak weekend. As was stated, 1,500 volunteer firefighters from other states were involved. It astounded me to see the convoys of vehicles heading into Sydney, not only from the country areas of New South Wales but also from interstate, coming down the Pacific Highway to assist the bush fire brigades around Sydney during that time. Two thousand members of the volunteer rescue association helped tirelessly to feed, clothe and transport evacuees and to maintain radio communications through their emergency radio networks. About 100 taxi drivers helped with the evacuations. Sewage tankers, petrol tankers and concrete mixers assisted in carrying water. Again, I emphasise the importance of the equipment that we do not have. I know that a lot of this equipment can sit for 10, 15 or 20 years, being used only in training programs and at field days and the like, but the question is: what are lives worth? What is property worth? We spend an absolute fortune in this country on other crisis areas, and yet this one has been neglected. That was certainly the case during the years that I was involved in local government. There was an upside to the fires. There have been some notable events that have affected community spirit throughout New South Wales. The 28· January ticker tape parade through Sydney was absolutely fantastic. It was heart warming to see a lot of those people who, as I said before, put their lives on the line to try to save other people's lives and property. Interestingly, the fellow who robbed a service station in WOblloomooloo of its bushfire appeal money had an attack of conscience when he got home and found out what he had done. He returned that money with an extra $50, with a note saying: Dear Firefighters, I am deeply ashamed of the crime I committed. It is something I will wear the rest of my life. Hope this helps. It was signed 'The Meanest Man Alive'. The Lord Mayor's bush fire appeal has raised over $7 million, with contributions from all sections of the community. It really has had that effect. Certainly these sorts of things do have an effect on the Australian people. It means that we are a nation of people that are not always divided, that are not always bickering about different issues, that can under severe circumstances get together and help each other. It is all right to talk about what has happened and what should have been done, but are we going to learn the lessons from the tragedies that we have witnessed and experienced in these fires. There are many lessons to be learnt. I have spoken about one of them, and that is the need for adequate support and equipment for the volunteers. A lot of people probably would not realise that the majority of the people who were fighting these fires were volunteers. They are volunteers because they live in areas that sustain bush fires regularly, although certainly not to the extent that we saw earlier this year. One lesson that we need to learn is that Australia has no significant airborne firefighting capability. That was shown when we had to borrow equipment from New Zealand. This really needs to be reviewed. I believe that the Commonwealth should playa role in this and it should have an input. Maybe a lot higher level of controlled burning and prescription burning needs to take place. As the honourable member for Page indicated, a lot of criticism has been levelled at the National Parks and Wildlife Service for its restriction of access and its restriction on controlled burning. Some of that criticism is justified, but not all of it. The entire blame should not be laid at the feet of the National Parks and Wildlife Service but I am sure that state ministers, federal ministers and the people involved in that organisation have a lesson to learn. In years gone by, in my area, we have not been able to get the required people to undertake prevention activity in the national parks. How long is it going to take for the regenerafor tion of the Royal National Park? It will be in excess of 150 years. Without the amount of fuel that was stored in those areas we would have had a better chance. We might not have avoided the fires but we would have had a better chance of stopping the fires from doing the damage that they have done. It is certainly an area that needs a great deal of attention. A full inquiry into the bush fires has been announced by the New South Wales state government. Heading the inquiry will be the New South Wales Coroner, Greg Glass. It is a very important inquiry and it should have broad terms of reference to look at all these areas. They are the important areas. I believe the Commonwealth should be prepared to support the recommendations from this inquiry and financially support the modernisation of the equipment that a lot of volunteer organisations have. Next time-and let us not kid ourselves that there will not be a next time; the fire might not be so widespread and it might not be so tragic but there will bea next time-we need to be better prepared and better equipped.",22
7,Mr SNOW,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"Eden-Monaro) (10.08 a.m.)My sympathy and good wishes are extended to my colleagues from the areas which were very badly threatened by fires in early January. My daughter Natasha and I had been on a camping holiday to Brisbane and we were intending to return home via the New South Wales north and central coasts. However, the fires caused us to divert inland, where we saw only the smoke filled sky. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro we are still waiting for the fires and hoping that the oft repeated February-March fires in the south east forests and the south coast do not happen. Fires are also a threat in the district around Canberra, as the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) knows, staying quite frequently as he does at Burra, where there were fires' not so very long ago. Already we have experienced fires in the Batemans Bay and the Wadbilliga National Park area. They occurred at the same time as the fires endured by my colleagues. Recently, I motored through the Batemans Bay area and saw the large areas of forest that had been burnt out. It is to the credit of the bush brigades, the emergency services, the volunteer men and women, New South Wales Forests, Eurobodalla council, property owners and the National Parks and Wildlife Service that property damage was minimal. In fact, national parks surveiIIance was a great help, particularly at WadbiIIiga. Having experienced fires from a very young age when my father had a position in Warragul and Gippsland in Victoria in the 1939 fires, I can just recall an old couple who had been completely burnt out coming to live with us. At the time my father was a volunteer and took food around to the areas that had been burnt out. He brought this old couple home to live with us. I have already mentioned the fires at Burra Creek, not very far from Canberra. The honourable member for Bradfield would recall those. He was probably involved as we were, my son and I, up all night, taking it in turns to watch, to back-bum and to take action to prevent fires that came on to our property from moving on to our neighbour'S property. There was a lot of sharing and a lot of unselfishness. Honourable members have mentioned the people who sometimes light fires. The superintendent of the Queanbeyan district,which extends right down to the Victorian border and to the south-east coast, told me that, the year after the fires I have mentioned, he got a phone call saying, 'You know that ring of fires I did last year-this year it will be a triangle'. Fortunately, in that second year we had a lot of rain and it did not happen; it could not happen. I think that the reaction of a lot of us, immediately after the fires started and we learnt that some of them were possibly deliberately lit, was questionable. I think high penalties are questionable if we examine the people who light these fires. Apparently, they are mostly male, mostly young, mostly have a fascination with fires and mostly get very little recognition In their lives or in their homes. As the honourable member for Bradfield says, perhaps we should be thinking more about psychology and what is happening in our homes, maybe in our schools too, when we think about how we deal with those who fire perform what are really atrocities. I pay tribute, as other honourable members have, not only to New South Wales but also to other states who cooperated and to the federal government. In a number of these fires, the armed services were made available. This was a significant financial contribution by the federal government. There was also top-up funding through federal systems. When there were fires in my electorate in January this year, a lady rang me from the coast and said, 'Why isn-t the federal government doing something? People are saying that the state government is to the fore and is saying things. The federal government should be taking charge'. We have to explain to people that, under our amazing system of government, we have different levels of government and, if we have too many with the power to take initiatives, it becomes much more complex. I believe operations were pretty well coordinated in New South Wales by the relevant state departments, and I pay full credit to them. We cannot have too many bosses. That point needs to be made time and again. Often in our lives we see market forces as the solution to many of our problems. Last evening at the testimonial dinner for John Kerin I heard both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and John Kerin speak of the cooperation between people, the unselfishness of people and the fact that there was no thought of gain. As the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) said, when there was a theft the person involved returned the amount plus $50. That is one positive thing, I guess, about what has happened. It shows that market forces are not always the solution to our problems: quite often the solution is cooperation and unselfishness and Australians are capable of these things. They are capable of working together, of not thinking about personal gain but thinking of others. ' We do not want to stop that attitude. We do not want to stop the volunteer services, but we could help quite extensively in a couple of ways. Just recently the government party has been talking about policy directions, particularly in employment; we have talked about more flexibility with volunteers. We have unemployed people who may well be interested in training for a time in emergency services in fire protection or in coastal patrol. The Ulladulla coastal patrol raised that matter with me and it took on some unemployed volunteers. If rules are too stringent and say that people cannot do a six-week course because they will not be available for jobs if they are found, then we will not get those people. I agree that governments could back up the situation with better equipment, and perhaps we should take a national approach. When we were driving back from Queensland, we heard some of the radio talkback programs when the point was made that there ought to be some more national research. There was a national fire research project which lost some funding, but there are three or four areas which ought to be examined from a national perspective. One of the things that has been mentioned is hazard reduction. Phil Koperberg, the Chief Fire Commissioner of New South Wales, said that perhaps we had moved too far away from hazard reduction burning. We can still be environmentally sensitive and at the same time perhaps have a bit more hazard reduction activity than has been the case. We could, as one listener said, consider what has been done over thousands of years by the Aboriginal people, who had less intense but more frequent burning. We could learn from them by working out the methods that they used. Through a better researched hazard reduction burning that takes into account the history prehistory of its use in Australia, perhaps we could avoid the disasters that are occurring. As well, we could look at the fires that have happened in Europe. Some have said that the large water drops that take place in Europe may not be suitable in Australia, but we ought to examine such action properly. It is true· that a lot of the fires are cooler in Europe. Australia has eucalypts with flammable oils, and its fires are much hotter than those in Europe. Nevertheless, perhaps we could examine the use of larger water drops than we have had and which could be more effective. Once again, we can learn. We give full credit to those who were involved. The operation was successful, but we can learn not only from our mistakes but also from what is done elsewhere. I want to strongly defend the fire control work of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. I do not always agree with the service, but the cooperation between the service, the bushfire brigades and the state forest councils meant that the excellent work done by all organisations was effective and will be more effective. We need to be on the ready in our region over the next few weeks. The joint surveillance flights by the New South Wales national parks and state forests people are very important and they are being continued over the current fire season. Two of the recent fires in the wilderness areas showed how national parks surveillance flights can spot fires, how they can take a leading role in getting rid of them, and how they prepare against fires. What they are doing is extremely important. They are involved in local committees to work out the best protection strategy. I congratulate the national parks people on their role as well as all others involved.",24
8,Mr RUDDOCK,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"I commend my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) for raising this matter. It is very appropriate that this House should express its sadness at the loss of human life and the damage to fauna, flora and property caused by the recent bush fires in New South Wales and to commend the efforts and sacrifices of those who and were involved in fighting the fires. I commend those who were involved from New South Wales and even more particularly those who came from interstate. I thank my colleague for giving us this opportunity to speak to this motion. His electorate was more devastated than mine. Homes were lost and others had the sadness of people losing their lives. That is one aspect of fires that we do not often see. From the time of my youth I have been aware of the propensity for bush fires in the area in which I have lived and which I now represent. We are surrounded - y par-. Lane Cove national park and Ku-nng-gal Chase national park adjoin the electorate of Berowra, Brooklyn. along with Pennant Hills Park, the Elouera Reserve, and Muogamarra Nature Reserve. Each of these very substantial parks border significant residential areas of Sydney. There was concern that the fires which were devastating other areas would be unleashed in the Berowra electorate. In fact, we were mercifully spared. The loss was not significant although it was for those who did suffer. Oli-er's Garage on the Pacific Highway out of Brooklyn, for those who might remember the old road, was one property that was lost. The house which adjoined it had been owned for 50 years by the Oliver family. Mr Oliver died about five years ago and Mrs Oliver, who is in her 80s, was living alone in the house. As the fires approached she was asked to leave, but she refused and later her son came and forcibly removed her from the house. Five minutes later it was ablaze, and the laundry in which she had been sitting caved in, so she had a very lucky escape. Other properties were destroyed. An unoccupied fisherman's hut in the Brooklyn area was destroyed and I understand that close to Wisemans Ferry in what may, in fact, be the electorate of Macquarie rather than Berowra, four houses and numerous outbuildings at what is known as TroIlop Reach-the name originally given to the Wisemans Ferry areawere lost. There was also a fire in the Muogamarra Reserve. I particularly want to commend Keith Harrap, the control .centre commander at Hornsby. He is the control centre commander for the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai bush fire brigades. He teIls me that we lost something of the order of 12,480 hectares of bushland right through the Muogamarra Reserve. Along the Hawkesbury River north of Brooklyn the scene is desolate. The intensity of the firebaIls that obviously impacted as they swept across the landscape can only be imagined. The fire threatened communities such as Brooklyn. Dangar Island was worried that it might be taken out. That community on water, which has very little in the way of ) firefighting equipment, faced real fear. It was only a matter of a few degrees direction from which the wind was blowing that spared If the fire had come just a couple of degrees north of the town the boats and boatsheds would have been destroyed, and that would have been an horrific situation. An enormous effort was made by many people from the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai bush fire brigades. Seventeen groups were involved. They were assisted by the Baulkham Hills team, which again was mercifuIly relieved on this occasion, and a contingent from the Country Fire Service of South Australia. They were mainly volunteers. Water bombing by helicopters was used quite extensively. I want to take the opportunity to commend not only Keith Harrap ancJ his deputies, Mr Graham Blinksell, Assistant Director, North Metropolitan Region National Parks and Wildlife Service, and John Anderson, zone commander of the New South Wales Fire Brigades, but also all the volunteers who assisted so actively. I also commend Commissioner Koperberg for his leadership role. It was something that the people of New South Wales greatly admired. I endorse· the comments that have been made by so many of my colleagues about the evident arson that was involved. I find it impossible to imagine how people could want to start fires which create such terror. The Bush Telegraph, a local newspaper, wrote about these matters because little townships like Berowra, Mount Kuring-gai and Mount Colah all felt threatened as a result of the fires as the winds blew and changed directions. What is depicted here, I think, is the fear that so many people were forced to endure terror. The questions were: Will I lose everything? Will I be safe? Will we survive? What if the fire comes up our valleythen what? What do we do? Where do we go? Are we evacuating or not? Will help be there when we need it most? This fear was evident throughout the whole community. But I want to take this opportunity of talking about something else. The F3 out of Sydney and the northern rail line were blocked and, of course, it meant that there were large numbers of people in the community unable to reach their own homes, without accommodation, without food; thousands of people who needed to be provided for. The spirit of the community came out in providing that food: the local RSL clubs, the halls that were open; the activities of the councils, the mayor, Chris Meany, who arranged with council for funds to buy food for people who were temporarily unable to proceed. As I read through the Bush Telegraph I find a report of a large number of people who were left having to sleep next to their cars or in the community centre on the floor, and of the efforts of so many who helped to provide for them. Having said all that, I think it is more important to think about the future, as some of my colleagues have today. There is a concern in my electorate about the adequacy of the equipment that they have for fighting fires. It is a very real concern. I hope that in relation to the funds that have been very generously subscribed there may be a surfeit to assist in re-equipping many of the brigades, particularly in these places like Dangar Island, which is so much out of the way, or Brooklyn. There need to be vessels that can be used. We need to look nationally at how we can acquire other equipment. There has been a good deal of argument about whether or not these planes that might carry large amounts of water could be usefully used. It seems to me that for the Commonwealth there may be a capacity to acquire such equipment nationally that could be used throughout Australia. They are matters that we need to look at. The Commonwealth was involved using the disaster relief arrangements to assist people and the firefighters. It is a matter which I will talk about on another occasion,. but it was important, in the context of the difficulties that we {aced, that we looked at ways and means of helping those people who were affected and those people who were giving up so much of their time at great personal inconvenience and often great risk. I commend the government for what it did. I will criticise it later for some of the shortcomings in relation to the way in which the matter was dealt with, but when the legislation is looked at will be a more appropriate time.  a.m.)-I am honoured to be able to join in supporting this motion this morning· and to support the remarks of previous speakers and the mover of the motion that is before us this morning. I would like to say at the outset that everyone in this place feels for the families of the four persons who lost their lives ... We cannot adequately express our feeling upon what they must have experienced and what they are going through subsequently. We also pay tribute to the incredible efforts, the endurance of thousands of firefighters and all those people associated in backing them up that prevented what could have been an unmitigated disaster in terms of loss of life and loss of property. This morning we pay tribute to the volunteers, the fire brigade regulars of New South Wales and those that came from interstate, including police and the defence forces. We include the council workers from each of the councils but, particularly in my electorate, Lake Macquarie and Wyong councils. Our tribute is extended, in fact, to everyone who played a role and made a contribution towards containing the fires and protecting the lives and property of the people that were affected. The bush fires had been burning in various locations in New South Wales since Boxing Day. The media had been referring constantly to the fires at Newcastle, but they were actually around the southern area. At the time the fires really came to a crescendo, those that were of great danger to us were the fires in Lake Macquarie, which had very little to do with Newcastle. There was some angst among quite a number of people that the media constantly referred to fires in Newcastle when in fact they were in Lake Macquarie and Wyong. But the fires themselves brought with them the prospect, as I said, of unmitigated disaster. The baking weather-I can think of no other words to describe it"""":""'added to that prospect. As a child I lived on a farm, and every summer we experienced bushfires and every summer we fought bushfires with wet bags and branches and a little bit of well water-we did not have resources-but the weather in which the fire crescendo developed I just found quite incredible. Day after day brought more baking type of heat, together with strong winds. The fires in the Hunter region brought out the best and the worse in people, to use the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The best was seen in the firefighters, their supporters, the volunteers, all the other organisations I have mentioned and the ordinary men and women and young people of our region who helped supply back-up materials, food, water, cold drinks and even cold fruitsustenance for those who were working unceasingly. The worse in people produced a fear of looting and the inexplicable acts of those who lit fires. That I just cannot comprehend. Reference is made to increasing penalties in dealing with that issue but I just do not comprehend the actions of those people. We speak from some experience in the Hunter because those of us who experienced the earthquake on 28 December 1989 know something of the fear and the helplessness that people feel when a disaster like this happens. The earthquake also brought out the best in people, in particular that great Australthe Ian spirit. It brought people together and galvanised community spirit. This occurred, only on a much broader scale, with the bushfires. The best in people was evident in that community of interest, that Australian spirit, where all people were pulling together, all were getting into help, regardless of what differences there may be among people on other occasions. Reference has been made to the need for better firefighting equipment and firebombing amphibious planes. They are matters that are going to be looked at by the New South Wales government and those who are directly involved in the administration of that area. But in my own electorate of Shortland we had fires at the northern extremity and the southern extremity: at Charlestown, Windale, Bennetts Green, Belmont, Caves Beach and - udgewoi. Fortunately, there was no loss of bfe. Fires were dealt with quickly by the fire brigades. There was minimum damage and loss of property. There were great fears during the fires until they were brought under control and the emergency had passed, but there was minimum damage and loss of property, with two home units being destroyed at Charlestown and some commercial property being damaged at Bennetts Green. In that case a fire had been lit on the opposite side of a divided carriageway, leapt a'cross the divided carriageway, setting fire to and destroying a wrecker's yard. It then moved on to the upstairs portion of commqcial premises. At Budgewoi a fire came close to threatening the town itself. That fire lasted some four to five hours. The firefighters, I believe, performed an amazing job to contain it and to extinguish it. The residents of the nearby streets and the Walu caravan park had to be evacuated. One thing about these fires was that, even close in, in Charlestown-where my own office is situated and where I live, virtually in inner suburbia-wherever you have the wildlife reserves and the nature reserves in the bottom parts of gullies, fires just raced through with terrifying speed and height. The fact is that the flames were transferring at tree-top level: it was not the burning along ground that was transferring the fire; it was the airborne debris and embers that were transferring the fires from location to location. The speed with which the fire moved and the blanketing of the air by smoke were what was so terrifying. All of those anxieties and worries that people went through are very hard to describe. Now, some weeks after the event, it is difficult to recall, for other people who did not experience it, just how terrifying it was and what people suffered. Whilst the supreme efforts and bravery of firemen and volunteer bush fire brigade people have been justly praised, we should not forget the other volunteers who helped. In my area, the Salvation Army had responsibility for preparation of food; at Toukley, they called in the Society of St Vincent De Paul to help make sandwiches for several thousand people. Many of those people were people referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and they had been stranded on the national highway link. Those people either could not get onte the highway or could not get off it, so they had to be fed and accommodated. Many of them were helped at Wyong racecourse, in the electorate of Dobell. There was an enormous spontaneous effort from people: in fact, I think there were probably more people around who were willing to help than had need of help. Camp Breakaway at San Remo provided accommodation for firefighters from interstate. The »yong Shire Advocate of 20 January describes it thus: The mateship tradition of Australians helping each other in crisis was no more evident during the recent bushfires disaster than at San Remo's Camp Breakaway. I think that pretty aptly describes numbers of incidents and efforts throughout the whole area in which the bushfires were located. Questions have been· raised subsequently about back-burning, fire prevention and how much effort was made by householders themselves, and about the surrounding foliage. They are all questions that need to. be addressed, but the question of back-burning would perhaps be probably best resolved by an open inquiry headed up by the CSIRO. Some erroneous fire reports added to people's fears and anxieties on a number of occasions during the period of what I describe as the crescendo-those days of raging fires. I do not criticise the media. I understand that people were phoning into the media and saying that such and such a place was alight, and that such and such a place had been evacuated-when, in fact, that had not happened at all. Why people do those things, I do not know. It is difficult, when you are in a time of crisis such as that. When the earthquake happened in Newcastle, we had a similar thing. There were all sorts of stories suddenly peddled around. People were ringing up and advising, many of them erroneously. That is something that I think added to the worry and to the fear. The Acting Prime Minister was quickly on the scene. I was very pleased with the rapid cooperation between th- federal government and the New South Wales government. Aged people were moved from areas that were ""threatened, and Department of Social Services assistance and emergency payments were quickly made available. It was an excellent example, when we had a disaster and we had a problem, of both governments rapidly coming together to help the people at risk. All the things we have been saying this morning are probably best summed up in the words of the editorial of the Newcastle Herald of 11 January, which said: Of course, all the issues brought to light by the bush fire crisis deserve urgent attention and some will no doubt prove contentious. Happily, though, the matter of greatest priority is anything but factious, that being to express the heartfelt gratitude of the people of this State to the volunteers, fire brigade regulars, police, ambulance officers, defence forces and others who appear to have averted a tragedy of unthinkable proportions. I am very honoured to be able to support the motion before the chamber.",26
9,Mr DOBIE,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"It was not my experience to be in Sydney during the fires; I was in the United States on my annual vacation. I have to tell the House that all the international newsagencies had the Sydney fires as their number one news item for days on end. Wherever one went on the North American continent, when one mentioned that one was from Sydney, the locals knew of the tragedy that was taking place in New South Wales and in Sydney. That normally never happens with news items from Australia, yet there we were as the major news item for over a week. Then, of course, it was overtaken by the Los Angeles earthquakes. But we are here today to talk about the bushfires. Sutherland Shire has a history of bushfires and a history of death through bush fires. A whole truckload of firefighters were burned to death several years ago when the wind came back on a grassfire. A couple of years later we had another tragedy when three bush fire brigade members were killed and others were permanently injured. So there is certainly an awareness of bush fires in the Sutherland shire. On this occasion, the death of Mrs Paula O'Neil in Jannali and the destruction of 89 houses in the inner suburb-as far as Sydney is concerned these days-of Jannali-Como has shaken everybody because it happened to people and in neighbourhoods such as their own. Ftom talking to people there and elsewhere since I have been back, I have heard that people sitting in their houses casually watching television, or just casually sitting, had to literally jump out of their houses because within 60 seconds their houses were totally destroyed. Most of the people who have spoken in this debate so far have said things that I endorse, such as commending the tremendous effort of the bush fire brigades and of all the other organisations, councils and social security offices. In the debate on this motion, which I am pleased to see was moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), I want to thank particularly the Sutherland office of the Social Security Department. The day after Jannali-Como lost 89 houses, the Department of Social Security opened a special office among the destroyed houses to give emergency payments to people in need. It was a tremendous effort to do things like that. The second thing that should be borne in mind for southern Sydney was that the whole suburb of Bundeena and Maianbar had to be physically evacuated. It was another Dunkirk. This has almost happened on several other occasions, but on this occasion the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol managed to organise all the people with boats. This armada drew thousands of people from Bundeena and they were housed in the Cronulla Leagues Club premises. I thank the coastal patrol and all people who volunteered, I thank my friend Bruce Webster from the ABC for reminding me of the role of the voluntary coastal patrol, and I particularly thank the Cronulla Leagues Club officers and staff for the tremendous work they put into create emergency accommodation for so many people. . While I am on the subject, I should mention that the voluntary coastal patrol people helped man police radios to allow the water police to undertake other duties. They also provided sea water pumps; they put in a great effort. But as one looks at the whole effort of that time, one sees the tremendous community concern that everybody felt. Since I was elected here 28 years ago, my area has always had bushfires. Though most of the area that was destroyed on 9 January and around that time was in the electorate of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), I had been its representative 20-odd years ago. I pay great tribute to the workers and I do extend great personal sympathy to the children, Ms Paula O'Neil's stepdaughters, and her husband, and to all those other people who have lost everything. I was surprised to find that the Como Presbyterian Church had been burnt to the ground. This is a church I happened to have had a lot to do with years ago. I also would like to say that the Sutherland Shire officers were superb. What has to be realised is that, the fires having taken place in January, it was a time when great numbers of people were away from their homes and a great number of those houses that were destroyed were empty-otherwise I suspect the death toll may have been far greater than it has been. r have already mentioned that Sutherland shire has its history of bushfires. r remember when I was first elected being in the city of Sydney and we were in one of the tall buildings and looked out and we could actually see froll). Sydney city the bushfires that were in the Sutherland shire at that time. Now, of course, there is much more building on it. There is a great love of eucalyptus trees by people. How on earth you settle the problem of the trees in suburban Australia. I do not know. It is not going to be an easy thing and the people are not going to want to do it, but something has to be done about council regulations on trees adjoining houses. and the like. So much has been written about the bushfires, day after day, page after page, each article demonstrating and reflecting a personal tragedy. My own grandfather, for example, before I was born, died in a fire, and our family has always been conscious of fire problems-and so it will be with the people who have been burnt out of their houses in such large numbers on this occasion. They will never be unaware of the fear and the danger of fire, and this is something we have to be careful of. I brought to the chamber the Daily Telegraph - fire special, I suppose one would call it, and I would just like to read in the couple of minutes remaining some of the headlines: 'Red January', 'A City Bums', 'The Hellish Winds of Change', 'The Flames of a Terrible Summer', 'In the Line of Fire', 'The Ultimate Sacrifice', and so it goes on. It really has been something that shook cynical Sydney to its roots, and it takes a lot of effort for that to take place and a lot of tragedy. The Red Cross has an advertisement the heading of which I would like to finish my speech with. It says: The burnt out bush rehabilitates by itself. The out families will need your, which means our, help.",30
10,Mr HORNE,NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFIRES,"Paterson) (10.48 a.m.)Firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Bradford (Mr Connolly) for bringing this motion before our parliament at the earliest possible time. The subject of the motion does not give me any pleasure but I do rise with pride to support it. It alIows me to express my respect and admiration for that tremendous band of workers who fought bush fires in New South Wales in the worse weather conditions in the history of our country. Perhaps the best way to describe the extent of the damage, the courage of the firefighters and the support of the community is to report what happened in my own electorate of Paterson. Paterson is a fairly typical east coast region, tucked in between the forests and national parks of the foothiIls of the Great Divide on the west and the coast to the east. It contains many hectares of native eucalypt forest and abundant native fauna, including many koala colonies. A series of good seasons has produced an extensive fuel supply, and so the scene was set for the helI that we experienced. During the emergency, three of the five local government areas in my electorate were declared 41.F-or emergency zones. All brigades were not only involved in fighting fires in their own particular area but also deployed elsewhere as the calls for assistance poured in. They were stretched; they were exhausted but they kept on. It is not easy fighting a fire at any time, but it certainly was not easy fighting fires in temperatures above 40 degre-s Celsius and with a westerly wind that was fanning the blaze at more than 50 kilometres an hour. Fires were actually spotting from in excess of 1'/2 kilometres because of these winds. Some fires of course were deliberately lit, which is very hard to conceive. When wind changes came, fires moved back into areas that had previously been considered safe. During the ordeal, in excess of 1,000 volunteer firefighters had to be rested and fed. Community response was fantastic. Lions and Rotary clubs, the Salvation Army and local burnt businesses all donated supplies and their time with great generosity. Just ordinary people in the community rallied with overwhelming offers of support. If anyone ever wanted to know what Australia is about, they only had to be there. It was not a case of 'Do you need help?'; it was a case of 'We are here: what can we do?'. On behalf of the residents of my electorate I want to pay tribute to our volunteer bush fire brigades and I ask leave for a list of those brigades and their captains to be incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The list read as followsNA NA BENDOLBAjSALISBURY Malcolm MCDonald NA John Shelton NA Ken Tickle NA Peter Sivyer NA John Maher NA David Hom NA Colin Sellens NA John Stammer NA Don Vickers NA poug Eyb ALLWORTH WANG AT Earle Felder Allan Delaney HAWKS NEST/TEAGARDENS GLOUCESTER Warren Wilson NA Mr K Laurie Keith Grey NA Mr J Fraser Ron Pile NA Mr A 0 Smith Neville Palmer NA Mr A Middlebrook Mr N Harris NA Mr RS Sansom Ray Worth NA Me P Sumll)erville Mr K Gleave NA Mr J Testorelli Allan Grey NA Mr A Rumbel Mr A Witt NA  NA Mr I Bourke Bob Olsen NA Mr NE Bignell Neal Cook NA Mr J Higgens Allan Dunn NA Mr JH Hughes Mr J Williams KIA-ORA STROUD Mr R Bolton Don Russell NA Mr LK Watt Ernie Holstein NA Mr A Laurie David Melmeth NA Mr K Shaw John Taylor NA Mr KS Bolton NA Mr DR Andrews Rainer Balzer LOWER BOWMAN BOWTHORNE/HINTON Mr RG Isaac David Baus NA Mr B Andrews Warwick Mathieson NA Mr E Blanch John O'Keefe NA NA Alan Nunn IONA/DUNS CREEK Bob Aspinall NA Kenneth Hepplewhite NA John Johnson NA Ian Hicks NA Lou Cassar NA Brett Bowden NA Brian Chiarelli TANILBA BAY/MALLABULA George Brandenberg WILLIAMTOWN/SALT ASH Barry Sansom NA BOLWARRA/LARGS Mr D Flindle NA Mr G Lawson NA Mrs R Lawrence",32
11,Mr HORNE,MAITLAND VALE,"I thank the House. Fire control officer Ted Murrell and David Uphill of Dungog council, Alan Hepplewhite of Port Stephens council and Kevin Carter from Bulahdelah forestry, Kam Baker of Gloucester council and Mike Pryjma of Gloucester forestry also deserve our deepest gratitude. All had to cope with section 41.F declarations. Barry Pont of Maitland fire station was spared that declaration. In his area there very few fires but he had to send his troops to other trouble spots. Ian Stewart of Great Lakes had wild fires in all parts of his shire but, thankfully, was able to minimise property damage. At the height of the fire danger our firefighters were joined by firefighters from Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory. I had the privilege of being alongside half a dozen units from Victoria in fighting a fire bearing down on a mate's home. As soon as that blaze was subdued, they were off to the next. They were a magnificent team and I salute them all. In the Paterson electorate, compared to others, we were lucky because no lives were lost. Certainly, much property and two homes were destroyed; hundreds of kilometres of fencing worth millions of dollars and not insured has been lost. Its replacement will be a burden to farmers for years to come. Hundreds of acres of beautiful bushland have been turned into a scorched wasteland. The loss of wildlife has been devastating in spite of the mighty efforts of the native animal trust fund and the Hunter Koala Preservation Society who, with hundreds of volunteers, undertook a rescue operation for injured koalas, wallabies, snakes, goannas and birds. They searched through the blackened forest and cared for and relocated the fauna that survived. The effort was coordinated by a young woman, Kim Gaudry, who left her family and home for two weeks because of her concern for the suffering of our native animals. Glen and Lynda Stephenson held open house for traumatised animals before passing them on to trained carers or relocating them in a safe area. How can our community repay this dedication? Management techniques will be needed to restore the burned areas when the flora regenerates, even though the animals may not return. Many areas have lost their native animal population completely. As they were in isolated pockets of bushland that are now surrounded by development, we will need to ensure that native animals go back into those areas. There are lessons to be learned from the were horrendous experience in New South Wales. Fires will come again. Lives, property, livestock and wildlife will be threatened. The scarred land and ruins of homes will go, but there are some tragedies that will never be forgotten. Australians have always lived with an environment that is both beautiful and dangerous. We live with its risks and therefore we must be prepared. Many brigades are underfinanced and have inadequate equipment. Throughout my electorate many bowling ch1bs have organised a series of fundraising galas, which the community has supported with enonnous generosity and enthusiasm. Firefighters need better training and the opportunity for debriefing, evaluation and assessment. The state member for Port Stephens, Bob Martin, and I will be conducting a seminar next weekend and all captains in the Port Stephens area will be there to address this particular need. Survival techniques need to be taught ,in schools. The build-up of fuel, particularly in forests and in open space corridors, must be controlled. Building design should be thoroughly researched and the use of fire resistant building materials encouraged. Studies should be carried out into the effect of fuel reduction bums and their effect on native flora and fauna. The back-bums that took place at night in my electorate were far less destructive than the uncontrolled wildfires in similar areas. Above all, we must be prepared as a nation to invest in research and development for firefighting techniques. Already two inventors in my electorate have come forward with sound ideas that I will be presenting to the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). There is also a unique opportunity for green jobs. It makes economic sense to employ people in environmental control, specifically for the reduction of fire hazard. I am sure that there are many people out there with unique ideas that these fires allowed them to employ to defeat a fire. Actually, when we consider the situation, the amazing thing about the fires in New South Wales is that more property was not lost. As I indicated, it does give me great pleasure today to support this motion. With new measures we can minimise risk, and I sincerely hope that the feeling of helplessness that pervaded much of our community during our recent experience will not be repeated.",34
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAITLAND VALE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! During the course of his remarks the honourable member for Paterson sought leave to incorporate certain material. Leave was granted. I should advise the House that, under the strict guidelines that the Speaker has used, this material may not have been allowed to be incorporated, but I think that, given the significance of the motion before the House, the House would be quite agreeable and the Speaker would be quite agreeable to allowing the request of the honourable member for Paterson to be acceded to. Mr Connolly-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I gave permission on behalf of the opposition because of the reason you mentioned, but would you also be agreeable to allowing other honourable members who spoke in this debate to incorporate in their speeches, if they wish, the similar details from their own constituencies?",35
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAITLAND VALE,We will take that on board.,35
14,Mr CADMAN,MAITLAND VALE,"I wish also to pay tribute to all of those who participated in controlling the tragedies and taking care of the community over the period of the bush fires in Sydney. My area of Mitchell, which is north-western Sydney, is a bush fire hazard area. We have always got bush fires, we have always got problems, and it is something that the community lives with. Fortunately, due to the high degree of skill and training of volunteer bush fire brigades and other services, we are able to minimise the dramatic impact and damage to property and life, and that has occurred over many years. On this occasion, except for one small area, the electorate of Mitchell was spared the damage of fire. In the Maroot area, however, there was loss of property and severe damage to the livelihood of orchardists. Trees were burnt or scorched. Many of them will die and will eventually have to be replaced at high cost to those farmers. All services pulled together. In the last couple of years in my area, the state services and volunteers have been able to amalgamate into an effective unit to fight fires. In Mitchell, as elsewhere in New South Wales, the state government has given the police pre-eminence in emergency situations, and that appears to be working very well. We have central control systems and emergency headquarters can be established and operated by the police. Sitting alongside the police are the professional firefighters, the volunteer firefighters, the state emergency services, the voluntary aid detachments, the ann of the Red Cross that looks after the needs of people, the Salvation Army and others involved in this process. I think it is a good organisational model. I want to pay tribute to the local police, State Emergency Service, the volunteer bush fire brigades, and all others that were involved from Mitchell. They went out in huge numbers to the rest of Sydney, across into the Hornsby area, into the Blue Mountains and even to the north coast, realising all the time that their areas-the areas of Annangrove, Kenthurst, Dural, Glenorie, Galston, Arcadia, Berrilee-were all likely to come under threat. Some of these areas have recently been transferred to the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I know them well and I know how hard those volunteer bush fire brigade members worked to support other areas and to assist others in sore need. I want to pay tribute to John Hojel, the fire control officer, Baulkham Hills Shire Council, who has a vast wealth of experience in bushfire control. I want to leave this debate with one comment. Having had a background on the land and having been involved in these sorts of organisations for most of my life, I am led to the view that, in the preparation that has been made through much of New South Walesthe equipment, the training, the cooperation and organisational skills-all of the emergency services involved and the bush fire brigade have reached a high level, and that is something of which we should be proud. In the electorate of Mitchell there is one more thing that can be done, I believe. People are aware, through building codes, that they need to build in sensible places and need to keep the immediate environs of their houses free from rubbish and fire hazard material. The cool winter burn that has been so long a tradition of fire control is something that must be reinstigated, and sensibly. The loss of fauna has been tragic because the very people seeking to protect fauna in fact created the circumstances that caused so much fauna to De lost. It is a case of people not understanding and having no practical knowledge of bushfire control. The community needs to take precautions to alleviate the difficulties that were exposed to us all over the tragic days in January.",35
15,Ms DEAHM,MAITLAND VALE,"Macquarie) (11.04 a.m.)the Like many other speakers before me, I can say that my electorate is used to bushfires. The Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury have had many fires over the years. Every summer, we say, 'Will this be the big one?'. On what is now known as Black Friday in early January, a deliberately lit fire started at the outskirts of Mount Wilson and soon leapt into the Grose Valley. Residents of that area know that, once a fire is in the Grose Valley, nothing can be done about it: it moves at rapid speed. As predicted, it hit the lower Blue Mountains villages of Winmalee and Hawkesbury Heights on Saturday afternoon and soon spread down into Yarramundi on the Hawkesbury side of the electorate. Six properties were lost in the mountains: four houses, a youth hostel, and an historic stone house, which was unoccupied at the time. In the Hawkesbury, particularly in the Yarramundi and Bilpin areas, we lost parts of orchards, many fences and farm sheds. We were extremely lucky that there was no loss of life. As I drive from the Blue Mountains side of my. electorate to the Hawkesbury, down Hawkesbury Road around the hairpin bends that lead to Yarramundi, I see nothing but black trees. Every time. I have driven along that road in the last few weeks I have been astonished to see a row of houses standing on that road surrounded by black bush. One house had ivy growing on its front verandah, and that ivy has been burnt, but the house is still there. The fact that those houses are still standing is a tribute to the firefighting efforts of our wonderful volunteer bush fire brigades - which were helped by interstate brigades and all the other agencies that were there. As other honourable members have said, this was a wonderful cooperative effort. I would like to pay tribute to all three levels of government-federal, state and local-which worked together regardless of their political allegiances to make the firefighting effort a success. At the federal level, RAAF Base Richmond is in my electorate. It was immediately put on alert, ready to feed hundreds of people. RAAF personnel were called back from holiday. They fought the fires, they burnt firebreaks, they dug firebreaks where bulldozers could not get in. The discipline there was absolutely incredible. The base hospital was turned over to evacuees from nursing homes in Springwood. The military is not used to geriatric care but it did ard. extremely well. Other evacuees went to HMAS Nirimba at Quakers Hill, which is shortly to close, and it also did a splendid job. Some of my oldies are quoted as saying, 'Is this a holiday camp? I do not know whether I can afford this for much longer'. So I would really like to pay tribute to those people at those military bases. I would also like to pay tribute to the following. people: Mr Bill Roger and Mr Keith MCKellar, who are the fire controllers from the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains councils; and the National Parks and Wildlife Service coordinators who worked in the emergency, Gregor Manson and David Crust, from the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, respectively. I would also like to pay a special  Wales Coordinator of Bush Fire Services. He is a former captain of Winmalee brigade and a former Blue Mountains coordinator. He is a constituent of mine who lives at Winmalee. I am sure that anyone who saw him on television would admire Phil Koperberg's level-headedness, his calmness, his ability to handle the crisis that was going on up and down the coast, and further inland. I have spoken extensively to Phil since the tragedy, and we will be working very closely together to ensure that the lessons we have learnt from this are followed through. Senator John Faulkner came to the mountains to look at the military effort because, as well as the RAAF base, we had army and navy contingencies camped on the showground at Katoomba. I flew with him to Mount Wilson where I saw submariners, who were not used to being that high above sea level, working with a small brigade which is made up of older people because of the nature of the area, and they also did a splendid job. I realise that with the constraints of time. I cannot add too many more thanks, but I would like to take up the offer of listing my brigades in Hansard. I will also have the privilege later of talking in the grievance debate about the aftermath of· the fires and what we can learn from them. I seek leave to incorporate the list in HansLeave granted. The list read as followsBilpin Bush Fire Brigade Blaxland Ridge Bush Fire Brigade Colo Heights Bush Fire Brigade East Kurrajong Bush Fire Brigade Ebenezer Bush Fire Brigade Freemans Reach Bush Fire Brigade Glossodia Bush Fire Brigade Grose Vale Bush Fire Brigade Grose Wold Bush Fire Brigade Hawkesbury Headquarters Bush Fire Brigade Kurrajong Bush Fire Brigade Kurrajong Heights Bush Fire Brigade Lower Macdonald Bush Fire Brigade tribute to Lower Portland Bush Fire Brigade Mountain Lagoon Bush Fire Brigade Oakville Bush Fire Brigade St Albans Bush Fire Brigade Tennyson Bush Fire Brigade Upper Colo Bush Fire Brigade Wilberforce· Bush Fire Brigade Yarramundi Bush Fire Brigade G1enbrookjLapstone Bush Fire Brigade Mt Riverview Bush Fire Brigade Blaxland Bush Fire Brigade Warrimoo Bush Fire Brigade Valley Heights Bush Fire Brigade Winmalee Bush Fire Brigade Faulconbridge Bush Fire Brigade Linden Bush Fire Brigade Woodford Bush Fire Brigade Hazelbrook Bush Fire Brigade Lawson Bush Fire Brigade Bullaburra Bush Fire Brigade Wentworth Falls Bush Fire Brigade Katoomba/Leura Bush Fire Brigade Blue Mountains Headquarters Bush Fire Brigade Medlow Bath Bush Fire Brigade Blackheath/Shipley Bush Fire Brigade Megalong Valley Bush Fire Brigade Mt Victoria Bush Fire Brigade Bell Bush Fire Brigade Mt Wilson/Irvine, Bush Fire Brigade Mt Tomah Bush Fire Brigade Jenolan Bush Fire Brigade",36

17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATE EMERGENCY SERVICES,Mr Nehl)Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. 'HOMELESS CHILDREN'S NA,38
18,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ALLOWANCE,"I move: That this House: (1) views with concern the breakdown in Australian families, through the encouragement for children to leave those family units for the homeless children's allowance; and (2) calls on all state government departments of family services to set down guidelines to ensure that there are appropriate and sufficient reasons before taking children from the care of their lawful parents without their knowledge. I move this motion because of a concern which I have, and which I believe the community has, about the lack of consistency between various state organisations, such as the family and community services, in the handling of homeless youth. There is concern about what is seen as the encouragement of young people to leave the family home and gain financial independence as a consequence through the financial carrot of the Commonwealth's $218.40 fortnightly benefit. I do not believe that anyone here would deny that there is a problem in Australia today and it is not unique to Australia. It was identified by Burdekin in the late 1980s. At the time of his report, the estimate was that there were some 500,000 homeless youth in Australia-a great percentage of the population. What we can object to is the method of treatment of the problem and sometimes a further alienation of families as young people are encouraged by departmental officers and some social workers to break family arrangements and become financially enriched at the same time. Whose responsibility is the young person? President Clinton said as recently as two weeks ago that the state is not responsible for bringing up children, the responsibility is that of the parents. In the Year of the Family, it is absolutely imperative that when we legislate it should be tq assist the family and not to weaken it. Yet the action of so many authorities, for instance, the offices of social security and community services, and also the Family Court, appear to me and many others to be destroying, not strengthening, the family unit. The reasons for asking for consistency of guidelines were identified through local complaints to my office on the behaviour of the community services department and also the results of a program on 60 Minutes on 3 October 1993. The local complaint that I received in my office-one of the few that we get-is from a parent who was not able to trace the daughter who had sought the protection of the family services department. The daughter was taken out of the parent's custody, placed in the hands of a local custodian and given the benefit. After that, the family services department denied any responsibility for that child. In fact, she actually left that custodial arrangement and met up with a chap much older than herself and became an itinerant fruit-picker. The mother was not told at any stage where, the daughter was; she had to seek the help of other agencies. to try to trace her. That was a 15-year-old who had been encouraged to leave' what we might consider the benefits of a family home. In this regard the result was the payment of a homeless youth allowance and financial independence for that daughter. I think many of us saw the 60 Minutes program and the transcript is available from the library. It documents the fact that Queensland was not unique in this area of my personal experience; the problem was spread over l)ll the eastern states. I want to read a few of the extracts because there is a commonality between what I experienced and what these three episodes of the 60 Minutes program said. The transcript states: When you went to the department to ask for the allowance, were they tough on you? SHANNON: No, they weren't. They were sort of like as if divvying it out. It didn't really worry them. I mean, they didn't go and check out the place where I was living so for all they know, I could have been living with drug addicts or something ... The next extract reads: SHANNON'S ,MOTHER: If every time things don't work out the way they like, they can just get up and walk out. It puts a terrible pressure on you. The transcript continues: JENNY'S MOTHER: Seven thirty earned got a call from the police to say that my daughter had been down there making accusations against my husband for slapping her across the face and beating her up twice a day, every day. RICHARD CARLETON: So did you go down to the police station and pick her up? JENNY'S MOTHER: We said: We will come down and pick her up. And they said: 'Well, you can't, she's not here'. And we thought that was odd; they'd let her. go. RICHARD CARLETON: The police were under no obligation to detain Jenny even though she was only 13, and they refused to tell her parents where she had gone. Jenny's mother said that on another occasion: ... the District Officer said that if she didn't want to come home that she didn't have to come home, that they would have to find alternate accommodation for her because of her age. Incidentally, her age was 13 years. Regarding another occasion, Julie's mother said: I rang the welfare officer myself to see if he could make her come home, and he said to me: 'Do you want your daughter back?'. And I said yes. Ahd he said: 'Well, the only thing I can tell you, you're going to have to drop your moral standards'. And I asked him what he meant by dropping my moral standards, and he said 'You're going to have to let her bring her boyfriends home here and sleep with them'. I said: But she's 15. The transcript continues: SHANNON'S MOTHER: I got a call from the Department of Employment, Education and Training from one of the social workers there, and I told him roughly what had happened to cause her to shift out, and he went on to accuse me of being an unfit parent, telling me that I was too strict and that 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 10,485",38
19,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ALLOWANCE,"I thank the House. The figures that I have just tabled indicate that in the first year in which the young homeless allowance was paid, 1987, there were 942 young people who directly benefited. In 1993 there were 10,485. The number had increased 11 times. When one looks at the figures on Austudy one sees that it started in 1989, at 8,398. The figure rose to 13,518 last year, although that was a decrease on the figure for the previous year. Abstudy adds another 510 last year. This means there are 24,513 youths on benefits as at 1993. As an indicator of a recession,' these figures and those for unemployment give testimony to a continuing and worsening recession in a family sense. Values are deteriorating and on too many occasions homelessness is linked with hopelessness. I believe it is evidence of human deprivation in a very vulnerable age group, the under 15s, 16s and 17-year-olds. With the current payment by the Commonwealth ohin allowance of $218 a fortnight there is positive encouragement for some children to separate from their parents. Often this is brought about by the financial deprivationof the families to which the children I should go to evening classes and learn how to bring up my daughter properly. One of these days we will have social workers telling us who are fit parents and whether they can have children. That will be the result.. I ask for leave to have incorporated in Hansard some statistics on the young homeless allowance since its inception in 1986. Leave granted. The document read as followsJune Monthly Austudy Abstudy Total Average Number 942 942 1,632 1,632 1,996 8,398 10,394 2,630 10,949 13,579 4,880 13,692 504 19,076 8,065 16,286 634 24,985 13,518 510 24,513 normally belong. We know that over the last few years the failure of economic policy at state and federal level has resulted in many cases of the unemployment of the family breadwinner, which brings about this situation. I think that has been fairly well documented. I have not meant to quantify the amount the government gives by way of these benefits. I believe what is more important is the fact that, in June 1993, 24,513 youngsters were out of the custody of their lawful parents and were supported by the state. As President Clinton said, the state has no real responsibility in that area. I then go to the Burdekin report. While there are many recommendations, and some based on the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, there are two which concern the reuniting of the family. Recommendation 15.3 is that youth accommodation services be resourced, et cetera, and that there should be negotiation, conciliation and consultation with the parents. Rec,ommendation 15.4 says: . Young people must not. be compelled to return home, and children should not be returned to homes where their right to protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation is clearly threatened. I have no objection to that point but it appears to me that there is very little emphasis given to recommendation 15.3, whereas a lot is given to 15.4. I believe that the problems of the homeless in Australia are massive, both for the child and the parent. What is required i- a commonality of approach between the Commonwealth and the state departments for appropriate and common guidelines and proper assessment, taking into account the interests of the parents and the family as a whole and the contribution of these families to society. I believe that there should be common guidelines throughout. (Time expired)",40
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ALLOWANCE,Is the motion seconded?,41
21,Mr CADMAN,ALLOWANCE,The motion is seconded.,41
22,Mr GIBSON,ALLOWANCE,"Moreton) (11.20 a.m.)Although the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is held in high regard in this House and is viewed as a man of compassion, it is not the view of the government that this motion can be supported because we believe that, although this is a very important issue that does need consideration by this parliament, the way in which this motion is structured is factually incorrect and is leading to wrong conclusions. It is for that reason that my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and I will be making our contributions in opposition to the terms of this motion. We do so for some very important and valid reasons. The first point is that the part of the motion of the honourable member for Dawson claims that the House should view with concern the breakdown in Australian families through the encouragement for children to leave those family units because of what he calls the homeless .children 's allowance; in fact, he means the youth homeless allowance. His assertion is clearly not correct. It is a wrong assertion that the youth homeless allowance in fact encourages people to leave home. I agree that the 60 Minutes program painted that picture but it was, as· is fairly typical with 60 Minutes programs, a very superficial and simplistic analysis of a very deep-rooted problem and It very serious problem. It has used two or three case situations and has then drawn a whole range of overwhelming conclusions based on evidence from two or three family situations. I appreciate the point that the honourable member for Dawson made about a particular constituent of his who has come to see him. I also have had constituents come to me to express very grave concern about the fact that their children have been granted this aiIowance and that they were not aware of it; they were concerned about what was happening to their children, they did not know where their children were, et cetera. These are very genuine issues and as a parent I can appreciate those parents' concelT!s about not knowing where their children were and the fact that they fear that the government is somehow supporting children leaving home and living in less than satisfactory circumstances. The facts of the situation in our community are these: there are very many family situations where there is a true breakdown .of proper parental responsibilities, where there has been a real breakdown in the relationship between parents and children. Often those breakdowns in parental responsibilities are demonstrated through abuse, whetl:Jer it is emotional abuse or physical abuse or sexual abuse, or situations of neglect. It is .an unfortunate commentary on our society today that we are seeing more and more evidence of this occurring. In fact, just in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald we have a court case outlined of a boy aged 12 being kept ·in chains for several weeks, being starved, not first being given access to normal meals and nutrition and being forced. to write out thousands of lines each time he wanted to get a meal. These types of situations occur.· . I also appreciate. the fact that there are situations where there is .a rebellious nature in some children in their mid-teens. and they are not prepared to cope with reasonable parental disciplinary techniques. They storm out of - he home and they decide they will have a better situation somewhere else, et cetera. But the role of government is to ensure.that we care for everyone in our community. We mak;e sure that we do not have people starvingon the streets, thltt we do not .have young children sleeping in parks and other unsatisfactory places. The role of government is to try wherever we possibly can. to make su-e that everyone in our communtty has a baSIC living standard and basic access to care. As a government, we are responsible to e-sure that young people do have some protectIOn wh-re their situation is one where they are faCing real abuse by their parents. It is not true .to say that officers of the Department of SocIal Security are actively using this allowance to try to support people leaving home. In fact, we look at the procedures that the Department of Social Security undertakes, there is a very scrupulous process that is undertaken to examine very carefully the circumstances that occur in those situations. As the honourable member for Dawson has indicated, the Burdekin report showed that on anyone night there were about 25,000 young people living in the streets. In fact, one estimate put it as high as 50,000. At the last estimate, there were about 10,000 people receiving the youth homeless allowance. So the youth homeless allowance is not meeting the needs of this community because there are possibly 15,000 young people who are living on the streets and are not getting access to that financial support. So in no way are we going out there marketing this as some way of breaking up families and saying, 'Here is your chance to leave home and not have to cope with discipline, et cetera'. When an application is made for a youth homeless allowance, the application is scrutinised not only by social workers but alsb by senior departmental officers. A very strict process is followed. There are two bases upon which they can make the claim: they are - ot allowed to live at home or they are faCing unreasonable risks to their safety by living home. If they make the claim that they are not able to live at home, the departmtfnt immediately contacts the parents and ascertains the situation. The department finds out from the household what the rules and the situations in regard to those children are; department also requires corroborative evidence as part of the assessment. If the child claims to have been physically, sexually or emotionally abused, a judgment is made by qualified professional people who assess the level of risk in the situation. In most cases, they will contact the parents. If there is a grave risk and if there is clear evidence that abuse has occurred, corroborative evidence will· be sought from other people in the community, whether they be schoolteachers, church officials or others who have knowledge of that child or the family situation. No claim is paid unless the departif ment is provided with clear corroborative evidence of the actual situation. If the child's claim cannot be verified, no payment is made. In the majority of cases, verification occurs with both parents being given the opportunity to put forward their information regarding the case. As I indicated at the beginning, this is an important issue; this is not an issue that the government wants to run away from. The government believes that there may be s.ome circumstances in which departmental offIcers act in a hasty way but these instances would be very few, when one. looks at the total number of homeless youth. However, there may well be cases that justify some further consideration. The government has empowered the parliamentary Standing Committee on Community Affairs to investigate this issue. I think the parliament and the government have undertaken a legitimate and reasonable approach. The community affairs committee has instituted an inquiry to report to the parliament on the provision of assistance for homeless youth requiring income support and the.re is a whole series of references. That commIttee has the professional expertise and will have the job of talking to parents, community officers, social workers, state governments at and federal government agencies. It will have a very close look at that question. That is - he way to examine this question, not by passing motions that make claims in this parliament that cannot be sustained. The second part of the motion of the hon The ourable member for Dawson calls on all state government departments of family services to set down guidelines to ensure that there are appropriate and. sufficient reason- before taking children from the care of theIr lawful parents without their knowledge. Such guidelines exist. That is clearly the case. There are very strict guidelines. Both parts of this motion are framed in a way which suggests that the government is taking children willy-nilly from their parents and keenly trying to break up families. As if a government would want to do that! It is a process which costs the government more money. This is not the way in which the government wants to structure our society. The government is keenly trying to keep families together. The way in which state governments operate, the taking of children from families is very much a last resort. It is done only when there is very clear evidence that children are facing grave risks to their health and welfare, as is the situation in the case outlined in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. Governments act very carefully. Any decision to take a child from a family entails going within a short space of time to a court and facing a magistrate and having all the circumstances set out there. (Time expired)",41
23,Mr CADMAN,ALLOWANCE,"I have listened on two occasions now to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), and have been interested to hear of his support and compassion for, and dedication to, the role and significance of the family in Australian society. Today, however, we have heard a speech which seems to run completely counter to the speech that he made yesterday: instead of looking at the family situation, today he has chosen to support what he calls a government line-a party line. The honourable member for Moreton opened his remarks by saying that the government 'cannot accept'. How about him looking at it from the point of view of the people and the families that he represents, and having the rest of the government do the same thing? It is only fairly recently in New South Wales that we saw, at the· whim of bureaucrats, busloads of people carted off to detention centres, with parents separated from their children, only to have the court case collapse weeks later. What about that? Is that not an abuse of bureaucratic power? Is that not what this motion today is about-the role of government in relation to the family? I hope that the parliamentary committee to which the honourable member refers will invite to appear before it Mrs Gallaway of Coping, an organisation formed.in New South Wales by parents who have had bureaucratic abuse in their families. Coping had 90 t;ne,ubers as at March 1993; they are parents who have been beset by people who claim, using youi' words, to have 'professional judgment', but who are nothing more than claim setters or decision makers on whether a person is eligible for a Commonwealth entitlement. Untrained in the areas that they should be trained in, they are making a judgment about whether or not a family is coping, and what the relationships are between husband and wife or partners and children. That is not their role at all. The honourable member talked about professional advice. Let us have proper professional advice and assessment, not the whim of a clerk or somebody in a Social Security office. He also said that the department contacts the parents. Let me just deal with one recent instance from my electorate office. A 14-year-old girl got sick of the discipline of home-it was not onerous discipline-and she decided to move in with some friends a few blocks away. The couple that she moved in with were a girl aged 16 and a bloke aged 19 or 20 who were drug users. Yet the department did not phone the parents once, and did not notify the mother or father of the whereabouts of the child. Instead, the department conducted separate interviews keeping these parties apart. There was complete confidentiality for everything disclosed by the 14-year-old girl-the department kept that to itself-btlt everything the mother thought she was saying in confidence to the departmental officer was disclosed to the 14-year-old. What does that do? It creates insurmountable barriers and gaps. The child was being told of the mother's concern and of the difficulty the mother had had; as an adult, in coping with a rebellious teenager under peer pressure. That was all being disclosed to thechild,but the child's problems with the mother were not disclosed to the mother. Does the honourable member call that professional behaviour? Goodness me! Get real; get with it. Get with what is happening out there in the relationship between bureaucrats and families. The bureaucrats are making decisions which they have got no right to make. I am not saying that this is general, but it must be stopped. If honourable members really probe their communities, they will find, amongst those people who have a real dedication to families, a resentment that there exists an enticement for young people to move out of home immediately they strike some resistance or discipline of which they personally do not approve, and about which they have neither the maturity nor the wisdom and judgment to make a decision. I wonder if honourable members opposite have spoken to people who are really caring for their families far better than are most Australians: the Italian and Greek communities, who understand the nurturing of small children and teenagers, and even of people approaching marriage and the elderly. Honourable members can use any measure they like to establish whether that is factual Concern is expressed in those families about the subtle intervention of a government saying, 'If you leave home, there is a payment for you'. The Sun-Herald of 3 March 1993 refers in depth to case after case where there has been an encouragement through this process of enticement to have young people take a decision for freedom-what they thought to be freedom-only to finish in disaster. If decisions of this sort are going to be made, let us instigate a proper process of assessment and not have somebody who is a pension decider saying, 'Yes, here is the money. Why do you not leave home?'. They have no right to make those sort of judgments; they have no right not to consult parents. Instead of handing out fundswhich,by the method of delivery, encourage people to leave home,the government needs to be concentrating on saying that parenting is not easy and to be offering some support to those organisations that assist people to understand the role of parents and the difficulty that they are going to strike in applying discipline and the role that they will have to play where young people come up against pressures that are antagonistic to the values of that family or the codes of behaviour of that family so that it becomes unbearable for their offspring to sit in the middle. Sometimes teenagers have to make a difficult decision in an instant, so many decide that they are going to opt for the peer pressure group and no longer face the pressure of being left out or being considered different for sticking with mum and dad. The government's role in this area is to support those organisations that are helping educate parents, and helping them understand some of the processes, techniques, services and advice that are available to them. So often with this government there are superficial, social engineering answers instead of looking at the root of the problem and seeing whether something can be done. It sounds so good to have a bee in the bonnet and placate a social worker by saying, 'Look, at these poor kids on the streets. It is deplorable'. Doing something in the interim under proper assessment may be warranted. But why not go or not. to the root of the problem? We are still involved in a debate with regard to social security and the family in this International Year of the Family. If families are going to be assisted, one does not haphazardly throw a few dollars here or there; one analyses what the situation is and acknowledges that parenting is difficult and that some parents are going to have more problems than others. The parents need to be helped to resolve the problems, because all the research that can be mustered ultimately demonstrates that it is ideal for children and teenagers to grow up in a complete family where there is a husband and wife who nurture and care for them. Everything that takes away from that ideal is going to make things more difficult for those teenagers and everything that adds to it is going to make it easier for them and better for them. That is not said in any judgmental way with regard to different family styles where people have problems. I think everybody understands that. But everything that assists those families to restore an ideal situation is good and everything that detracts from it is bad. I do not know how a single mum, for instance, copes with a rebellious 14-yearold teenage daughter who wants to move in with the boyfriend. How does she cope with it? It is extremely difficult. If there is the carrot of $100 a week offered which will snatch the kids from home, many kids will take that option-and have taken that option. From the comments of the previous speaker, the government seems to be endorsing that process instead of saving, 'Yes, maybe there is a problem here and we should investigate it'. Whilst I may disagree with some of the expressions in the motion of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) I endorse the thrust of the motion and the sincerity of the man that has come here, identified a problem and is prepared to have the courage to exhort the parliament's el(;!cted representatives to take a lead in dealing with this jnstead of accepting the flim-flam that we are hearing in the House today.",43
24,Ms HENZELL,ALLOWANCE,"l rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and, in spite of my respect for the honourable memberJor Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), I must oppose the motion. I would also remind the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that one swallow does not make a summer.",45
25,Mr CADMAN,ALLOWANCE,"There are heaps of them. Get to them. M8 BENZELL-I listened to the honourIlblemember for Mitchell so perhaps he will let me have my 10 minutes. Speaking as one who belongs to one of those maligned categories-:-a professional social worker-I had considerable experience in the field before I came into the House, and it is very important that we do not use an individual case, or even a series of individual cases, to make an argument against the process of providing income support for a particular group of young people who, it has been clearly established, are in need of support. Referring to 60 Minutes program-I did not see it but I have read the transcript-it is typical to use one or two cases to make out a very spurious argument. We are talking in terms of the statistics of 10,000 young people who are getting the youth homeless allowance and about another 5,000 or so who are getting the Austudy homeless allowance. Given the numbers of young people who are in a state of dependency in our community, we are talking often about a group of people who 20 or more years ago would have been out in the work force at 14 and who often would have moved out of home. We are also talking about children who have come from a diverse range of backgrounds and their situation has nothing to do with their individual ethnic backgrounds. My only point of agreement with the honourable member for Mitchell is that adolescence is a difficult time. I certainly have counselled families with children of preschool age right through to the difficult adolescent period. There is no doubt that if parents have not established family mechanisms for communicating and mediating with children, whether they be aged four or 14, then those parents are going to have considerable difficulties during the period of adolescence. I have said to a number of young people, after having assessed their situation, that, if I were their mother and the problem was simply that they did not want to cop the discipline, I would be a lot tougher on them than their own mothers had been and I certainly would not support their application for the young homeless allowance or the independent Austudy homeless allowance. That has not made those children stay at home; they have often gone Off without income support. This is not about whether or not people are getting incomes; this is not about enticing young people to leave home. It is about providing for those young people who have been assessed adequately. I spoke to my local DSS people this morning and the situation is as follows: if a young person comes in and requests an allowance, that person is immediately seen by a social the worker, who has to do a very accurate assessment. In 90 per cent of the cases, contact is made with both parents. So in the 10 per cent of cases where it can be. clarified that there are significant difficulties about contacting parents, corroborating evidence has to be established, and I have been in this process myself. In fact, I can say to the House that very often young people stay on and on in really extremely abusive situations. I recall a case when .J went along to my local high school and gave a talk on conflict resolution to help young people to have the skills to be able to talk with not only their peers but also their parents about how they could deal with a problem more constructively. It was very interesting to see the responses of the young people in that classroom. Only a couple of months later, one of those young people came to the notice of my employer assistance program in a mining town. It was essentially a dispute about whether the young person could go to the party' after the formal. We could think that this was one of the typical examples where the child did not deal with the parental discipline, but what was underneath all that were several years of really quite extraordinary emotional abuse. I was absolutely amazed that this young person had coped with school life and had done very well in spite of the unrelenting emotional abuse from an abusive parent. We attempted to mediate and to get a resolution that would work. It did not work in spite of all our efforts and that young person did leave home. After a couple of those situations, I had a stream of kids coming to see me because the story got around, 'Go and see Marjorie and she'll get you income support', and that is where you start working out who's who in the zoo. As I said, in spite of whether or not income support is provided kids will leave home. In spite of attempting to mediate, one will not always get a successful resolution, because often by that time family systems have been developing over years that are not helpful to the resolution for either side, whether it be parents or the children. I think there is an underlying assumption in the views put forward by my colleagues on the other side of the House that children are the property of their parents. The·honourable member for Dawson twice mentioned President Clinton talking about families being responsible for children. It has been the case for a long period of time that the community has said that ultimately the community must be responsible for the welfare of all of its citizens, including children. If one speaks to any victims of child abuse they will tell of the years that they spent being unable to get help and of their attempts to talk to their teachers or talk to their GP or else have been frightened to talk to anyone because they would put their parents in a difficult situation. They long to help a vulnerable young person. The reason why we have young people living on the streets in our cities or else moving from house to house of friends is that they have suffered years of unrelenting conflict and pressure, or else there has been family breakdown at a significant point in the development of those young people, and indeed their families. It has nothing to do with whether a single mother is involved. In fact, evidence from the Institute of Family Studies is that young people from singleparent families are actually doing quite well. Family members, having dealt with family breakdown, have had to pull together and work together. Very often children leave intact homes where there has been abuse or where there·· is a re-partnering situation. Conflict can arise also in relation to ethnic difficulties where the parents are from a different culture and where the children have moved into the mainstream Australian culture. The sort.s of examples that were in the 60 Minutes report, and some of the issues that come into our electorate offices, are indeed tragic. As a parent of teenage girls, I can only feel where that has happened, where children have run away and the parent does not understand what has happened. I certainly would support any moves that we as a government could make to increase the the allocation to fund mediation and conflict resolution support services. That is an entirely appropriate use of funding to support families and certainly that is the government's policy. We should not be running away. from our responsibility. We should provide help after the best efforts of community agencies have not worked. We should not put blame on a parent or a child. Very often adolescence is very tough and that child is not going to cope and deal with the developmental crisis within that family structure. That child may well have to go through a very rough period before that child gets some level of maturity, and that causes a lot of pain to a lot of parents. Rather than have, as Burdekin found, children having to sell their' bodies on the streets, we should as a government be responsible to make sure that there is income support so that those children do not have to do what we hear happens in Bogota. The news report this morning referred to the homeless, the dispossessed, the young, being murdered and dumped on the streets of Bogota. Do we seriously want that kind of society? No, we do not. Therefore, we need as a government to take responsibility to make sure that all our citizens have income support. Where family structures break down we have to be able to provide resources. If we cannot get that family back together we must make sure that that young person is not homeless or dispossessed or selling his or her body on the streets. I think that is very important. I am sure these issues will come before the community services committee. Let us not get carried away with the extreme views and frighten the community into assuming that we are enticing children away from their parents. That is not the case. The government does not support that. We are supporting families but also individuals in our community. We waht those young people to become effective· and productive citizens, and income support for this troubled group is one aspect of government policy that has been very productive.",45

27,Mr HALVERSON,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that on 1 January 2001 it will be one hundred years since the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia took effect and the people of Australia were united in a federal commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia; (2) recognises that such a significant occaSIon is worthy of national observance and commemoration; (3) agrees that an appropriate permanent national memorial, designed by an Australian and made in Australia, should be erected in a suitable position of prominence in the national capital to mark the centenary of the Commonwealth of Australia; (4) suggests that such a permanent natiof!al memorial should be known as The Spirit of Australia and should represent and reflect the role and contribution of Australian men and women in the development of this great nation, so far as is possible including, but not necessarily confined to, our indigenous peoples, pioneers, explorers, scientists, defence forces, migrants, the rural community and the arts; and (5) calls upon the government to organise and sponsor a competition for the design of the national memorial and that (a) such a competition carry a significant monetary prize and (b) entry to the competition be open to all Australian citizens. In bringing this matter before the House, I am conscious of the fact that other proposals have already been made as to how we may appropriately recognise and celebrate a significant event in the history· of this nation. Unlike some of these other suggestions, the proposition outlined in this motion is based on creating a new symbol and expression of our nationhood, rather than replacing or changing existing symbols or institutions, These other changes mayor may not eventuate at some time in the future, but their introduction should not be influenced by the need to meet an inflexible and rapidly approaching deadline. Neither should they be contemplated without informed and widespread community debate resulting in unequivocal and spontaneous indications of acceptance and support by a substantial majority of the Australian people. The commemoration of our first 100 years as a federal commonwealth should not be seen as an opportunity, or used as an excuse, to impose unwanted or unwarranted changes. It is neither appropriate nor acceptable to celebrate the coming together of a nation by dividing it. There is no doubt that we will, as we should, organise various official and formal events, activities or projects to recognise this national milestone and that taxpayers' money will be used to underwrite at least some of the costs associated with our celebrations. The proposal we are considering in this debate woulcl not only allow us to commemorate the occasion in a positive and constructive way butJrom a purely materialistic point of view it would be a lot cheaper than some of the other options that have been noated so far. In the few minutes available to me this morning, it is impossible to fully explain or examine the various elements of this proposal, for example, to specify the actual form the memorial should take, whether it should be utilitarian or contemplative in nature, its exact location, the amount of the prize, or the composition of the judging panel. It is, however, important to emphasise that this suggested permanent national memorial would be truly Australian in character, in design and in construction-of Australians, by Australians and for Australians. Obviously there are already many magnificent monuments, memorials and shrines, statues, fountains; sculptures, paintings,' hospitals, halls and other buildings, even swimming pools, clock towers and gardens, that commemorate particular achievements, events or people from the pages of our history books. But the memorial proposed in this motion differs from these others in that it aims to represent and renect the combined efforts, deeds and contributions of Australia's sons and daughters not just over the last 100 or 200 years but for the past 40,000 years. It would therefore be just as relevant and meaningful to, and enriching and inspiring for, all our citizens, irrespective of age or occupation, social, cultural or economic background, whether they be of Aboriginal or European or Asian descent or are Australian by birth or by choice. Although in some ways we are a very ancient civilisation, in other ways we are a very young nation. From this rich and diverse background and its combina-, tion of old and new have emerged a very special national identity and distinct and identifiable national characteristics, one of which is a uniquely Australian spirit that is manifested and reflected in what we know and value as the Australian way of life. , This spirit of Australia was derived and has developed from the Australian commitment to the ideals of freedom, democracy, security and a fair go. It is the result of a well-founded and sincerely held belief that the greatness of a nation does not depend on the size of its population but on the capacity of its citizens to do their best, and their preparedness and willingness to make necessary sacrifices gladly for the advancement of the common good or to protect the ideals they value and the things they hold dear. It encompasses such qualities and characteristics as determination, hope, optimism, courage, initiative, resourcefulness, perseverance, compassion and concern for the underdog. It is perhaps one of the most important elements of our Australian heritage. This unique Australian spirit was evident at Gallipoli, Flanders, Tobruk, the Kokoda Trail and Long Tan-but it is not restricted to brave deeds on battlefields. It is obvious at the Olympic Games,' in the America's Cup challenges, and on the cricket grounds and football fields at home and abroad-but it is not limited to sporting arenas and' events. It can be seen on the walls of our galleries, the shelves of our libraries and on the stages and screens of our theatres-but it is not confined to the arts. It is apparent in the achievements of our inventors, scientists and technologists-but it is not only found in laboratories, ' workshops or research institutes. It is reflected in the fortitude and endurance of those who have suffered as a result of fires, floods or droughts, and the dedication and courage of those who rally to their assistance-but it is not only witnessed during times of national crisis or disaster: It is to be found in the cities, or the outback, suburbia or the bush, and on the floors of factories· and woolsheds. The spirit of Australia is an intangible, intuitive, innate feeling of national pride and belonging-of mateship-that binds us to'gether and cauSes us to help and support each other when there .are challenges to be met, and which allows us to acknowledge, share in and celebrate the endeavours and successes of our fellow Australians. It enables ordinary people to do extraordinary things, to overcome adversity, to perform remarkable deeds and to realise exceptional achievements. Our Australian heritage, and the heroes and heroines who have helped forge it, include many so-called 'ordinary' people as well as .those whose exploits, accomplishments or talents have resulted in national and international recognition and fame. That is why this proposal does not call for a national memorial which is designed to honour the contribution of anyone person or group of persons, but one that will pay tribute to, and therefore provide inspiration for, all Australians. In representing a wide cross-section of our community, it will hopefully capture the essence of, and also represent and reflect, the pride, loyalty and love that past and present generations have felt and future generations will feel towards this nation and its people, and the achievements that have been and will be realised as a result. I commend this motion to the House.",47
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,Is the motion seconded? Mr Andrew-I second the motion.,49
29,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"I think it is widely recognised' throughout Australia-and I am sure the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) will agree with me-that Victorians are probably the least parochial of all Australians, so, in prefacing my comments, I would crave some indulgence today to be a little bit parochial responding to this motion. I wish to press the claims of Melbourne to be the major site for the celebration of the centenary of Federation and the associated recognition of 100 years as a nation. I certainly endorse the sentiments that the honourable member for Casey has put forward with respect to Australia's nationhood and the importance of an appropriate recognition of the centenary of Federation. What I would like to suggest today is that it would be appropriate that some consideration be given to where the most suitable place is to recognise the centenary of Federation. As I said, Victorians generally are not very parochial. We have managed to see the AFL premiership go west and then fortunately come back last year to Essendon. Unlike the  we did not seem to have any need to get up and talk about it in this place. We just accept- . ed it as something that happened and which was just one of those things. As an example of the lack of parochialism on the part of Victorians, we were quite happy to see the west take it and, of course, it has since come back. In this situation, I would suggest to honourable members that, given that Federation was inaugurated in Melbourne in 1901 on 1 January and that the first Commonwealth parliament did sit for roughly 26 or 27 years in Melbourne, it would be appropriate for the main focus of celebration of the centenary of Federation to occur in Melbourne. I say that while acknowledging that there are, of course, many other significant events that preceded the inauguration of federation, such as Sir Henry Parkes's Tenterfield speech, the Corowa conference and the like, which clearly can claim to have been very major milestones in the achievement of the federal dream. But, ultimately, it was the actual inauguration of Federation that we will be celebrating and that occurred in Melbourne. With magnificent buildings such as the Exhibition Building and the state parliament, we have ideal locations to be able to engage in. the celebration of our political history, of our democracy and of the sorts of values that were very well reflected in upon by the honourable member for Casey in his contribution. It is also appropriate, given that Sydney has the Olympic Games in the year 2000, that we should have a celebration in the following year perhaps not of quite the same magnitude but certainly of some considerable significance in attracting potential tourism and greater economic activity in the second largest city in the country, Melbourne. To establish an appropriate focus of celebration of the centenary of Federation in Melbourne would dovetail perfectly with the Olympics in Sydney, would be a very good double' act in the tourist industry and would ensure that the economic benefits that we do get from the Olympics in Sydney would be magnified and broadened into other areas. Of course, there may well be some that argue that the same logic could apply to perhaps holding the celebration of the centesubsidy nary of Federation in Perth, but I suspect that there are probably a lot of Western Australthe ians who do not believe that we should be petrol celebrating the centenary of Federation, given the attitudes they tend to take on some matvast ters. So it may well be best that we leave it with the enthusiasts who actually think that Federation was a pretty good thing. I also point out that Victoria has played a pivotal role in the political history of this country. I did a rough calculation the other day and discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that the Prime Minister of this nation has been a Victorian representative for roughly 50 the 93 years of federation. So, for a majority of the time since Federation, we have had Victorian Prime Minister. It is quite clear Victorian politics have played a pivotal role in the development of this nation on both sides of the political divide and it is equally appropriate on that angle that the centenary of this seminal political event should be celebrated primarily in Victoria. n is also worth reflecting that we in Vicmemorial. toria have copped a bit of a battering recently. In the old days we used to have a nice little arrangement whereby we got tariff protection for' our manufacturing industries which posed a cost on states like Queensland and Western Australia and, in return, we subsicelebrate dised. those states through our taxation ments ,going via the Commonwealth and just returns through the Grants Commission celebration arrangements. UnfbrtunateIy, in recent times we have lost the tariff protection but we have not had a countervailing rearrangement apply with respect to taxation. So Victorian taxpayers are still subsidising people in Queensland and Western Australia who are doing things . such as sending delegations-as the Brisbane City Council did not so long ago-to Melbourne seeking to persuade businesses to relocate from Melbourne to Brisbane. So we now have the bizarre situation where, in effect, Victorian taxpayers' money is helping to subsidise people from other states trying to take away our economic activity. I would point out in this context that it is long overdue for these arrangements to be reviewed. I am a great believer in crossacross the nation and, if one looks across all of the issues-I know that some of issues were debated yesterday about the tax - and looks across all of the various· aspects of life, it will be seen that there is a array of cross-subsidies that do occur in ,our nation and that, by and large, they tend to cancel each other out. Therefore, I think we have to be a bit cautious about too much special pleading. I feel that there has been a bit of a change in the economic structure of the nation which does entitle Victoria to some reconsideration. We have also seen a drift away from maritime of travel and transport towards air freight and that has changed the economic significance of a Melbourne to some extent. We have now got that a fairly strange state government which is putting into practice the logic of reducing services because they are a bit better than that therefore some other states.",49
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,I have given the honourable member for Melbourne considerable tolerance in pursuing the matter. He might now return to the issue of a national,50
31,Mr TANNER,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"I will return to the subject. I was taking it a little more broadly than just ima memorial, Mr Deputy Speaker. I suggest to honourable members that the opportunity to the centenary of Federation should payb- given some serious consideration and not from the point of view of what is the best that we can have. We should also consider the economic issues and the implications for the economic and social activity of the areas where the celebrations are held. Certainly I have no problems with the notion of a memorial. I also endorse the balance in the comments made by the mover of the motion, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), with respect to the various aspects of Australian life. All too often in our history we have been very keen to approve of and to applaud military activity, such as the original invasion in 1788, ANZAC Day and so. on. They have a place in o-r - istory-there. IS no doubt about that-but It IS extremely Important that we balance those parts of our history with all of the other great achievements that have occurred in our nation and not get too carried away with the sort of mindless flag waving and extreme nationalism that is such a problem in so many areas of the world. There are different types of nationalism, there are different types of national pride. I believe in being proud about being Australian and about some of the things that the honourable member for Casey mentioned, such as concern for the underdog, tolerance and an ability to get on with each other. I see those as values which are of equal, if not greater, importance than having proved ourselves brave on the battlefield. Therefore, it is appropriate that we should give very serious consideration to the style and the content of the celebration of Federation, because at the end of the day we are not celebrating a military victory but the fact that people across a very large continent were able to come together and reach, without any conflict, battles or violence, a political accommodation and achieve a new structure for the continent. Finally, I endorse the need to move to a republic and a new flag in the year 2001 as part 'of the celebrations, but that is a debate for another day, as you have rightly pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker.",50
32,Mr ANDREW,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"I am honoured to have the opportunity to second the motion and speak in support of the remarks made by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and to acknowledge the support extended by the former speaker from the government benches, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). On Saturday, January 22 1994, less than two weeks ago, I stood at the mid-north South Australian town of Kapunda while its people celebrated 150 years since the first bullock team of copper ore had moved from Kapunda by a then uncharted path to the seaport in Adelaide. The man who had been responsible for this initiative was a Captain Bagot who, 150 years ago on an equally sunny day, stood in the same location as thousands of people stood with me, to farewell that first copper load. Captain Bagot joined the bullock team that was drawing his copper load towards Adelaide, and he instructed that the bullock team should pull a plough behind the first dray in order to mark a furrow all the way to Adelaide. Kapunda is only 80 kilometres from Adelaide, but 150 years ago it was such an isolated settlement in the colony of South Australia that a plough was pulled by a team in order to mark an established route for future bullock teams. A little over halfway on that journey to Adelaide, the plough collapsed and Captain Bagot instructed that a she-oak tree be cut down and from that tree another plough was shaped. To this day the town called She Oak Log remains at the point at which that sheoak tree was cut down. The trace drawn by that plough all the way from Kapunda to Adelaide was as a result of the plough that was shaped at She Oak Log. I stood there and I reflected on all of the history of Kapunda, which was in many ways one of Australia's first mining towns and certainly was the first of the mining towns in South Australia to herald the new copper boom which ultimately saved the state from bankruptcy and was followed by the discovery of copper in the other mid-north mining town of Burra Burra, which will celebrate its 150 years next year. While I stood there reflecting on all that history, the thing that most struck me was that here was I, not quite 50 years old, enjoying a lifestyle which is the envy of the rest of the world and which as a parliamentarian is the envy of many Australians, and yet my lifetime had in fact spanned a third of South Australia's history. I thought that was a fairly incredible sequence of events. It reflected on just how young our nation is. and on how far we have come, in that we all enjoy a very affluent and comfortable lifestyle, and on the sort of progress that this nation has made, both as a result of its pioneers and as a result of those wise decisions indicated by the motion from the honourable member for Casey that brought us together as a federation and gave us as a natjon a real sense of purpose. Ina little over a month, on 28 February, I intend, by gracious leave of the Whip of the Liberal' Party, to join the Governor of South Australia, Dame Roma Mitchell, in celebrating what will be 100 years of irrigation settlement in the River Murray area of South Australia. This 100 years celebration \Viii occur at a small town called Waikerie, where it is fair to take up the biblical analogy that the desert has blossomed as.a rose, because in the Riverland of South Australia and in the Sunraysia area of Victoria the average rainfall is probably about eight inches and the whole area has been transformed by the impact of irrigation through the pioneer spirit of the Chaffey brothers. That is a little over 100 years old, and I put it to. the House that, along with a number of people, both in the gallery and on the floor of the House, I have lived through a half of that history. Twice my lifespan ago there was little there other than the mallee scrub, which is picturesque in its own way but makes no real contribution to the economic development of this country. So in 100 years, thanks to the pioneer spirit of· the people of Kapunda and of the people of the Riverland and people all over Australia, this. nation has been transformed, and it is barely 100 years since. we had the federation that brought the nation together to be one family. I want to commend the honourable member for Casey for the initiative he has shown in bringing this motion to the House, because those of us who are about 50. years old in fact have. lived through a half of the history of the federation of Australi,a. What the honourable member for Casey is proposing is that in ,1994, in the Year of the Family; we should consider what it means to be a part of the Australian family, as celebrated by the decision to bring, all of the states together into what has become the .Commonwealth, and into this place, Canberra, and into the parliamentary system that we now enjoy under Federation. The honourable member for Casey proposes that we should' construct somewhere a tangible reminder of the indebtedness that we have as a nation to the pioneers and to those who chose to so structure our government that we would in fact be governed through our present Westminster system, through a federal parliament based in Canberra and appropriately recognising the role of each of the states. The only point at which I would want to take issue with the previous speaker is that I do not think it is the intention of the honourable member for Casey and it is not my intentiori that this particular tangible memorial should necessarily be based in Melbourne. In fact, that does have parochial undertones that run counter to the sense that the honourable member for Casey has injected into this motion. It is intended to be a national memorial and I think that probably the appropriate place for it is here in Canberra. I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would say to the House that, just as the nation chose that the appropriate resting place for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was to be here in Canberra, so it is appropriate to consider Canberra as the point at which this tangible memorial should be constructed. Just as the decision to place the Tomb of the Unknown Solider in Canberra in no way detracts from, and in fact enhances, those memorials to the fallen that have been constructed around Australia in RSL halls and institutes, so is it intended that this national memorial should enhance wHat already exists around Australia and what will exist in the year 2000 when we celebrate both the tum of the century and the recognition of our movement into federation. The intention, I would have thought, of the motion moved by the honourable member for Casey is for the national capital to be seen as the place for such a tangible statement of gratitude to the pioneers of places such as Waikerie and Kapunda in my electorate and places in the electorates represented in this parliament. It will be a tangible memorial of all that the pioneers in those areas have done. Fundamentally, I believe that the honourable member for Casey is calling for a symbol of our gratitude to those who have been pioneers in Australia and to those who shaped federation. It is intended, with that symbol of gratitude, that we should acknowledge the indebtedness we have to those people. One of the things that we frequently fail to do is to say 'thank you'. In an increasingly impatient age, we do not pause long enough to recognise the indebtedness we have to other people. I conclude with an unattributed quote from a desk calender which says: He who acknowledges a debt with gratitude has already paid the first instalment on that debt.",51
33,Mr CLEELAND,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"MCEwen) (12.17 p.m.)Honourable members on this side of the House would probably not have any great disagreement with the general thrust of the motion moved by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) on the centenary of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, upon reflection, there are also many different views on what should be the appropriate way to celebrate in the year 2001 the centenary of the federation of the six British colonies which existed in this country prior to constituI tional federation. We should not forget that up until the British parliament passed an act of parliament, which is what our Australian constitution is, we were six separate independent British colonies. We were not particularly Australian at that time. Indeed, the six colonies were in dispute with each other. We had the free traders and the protectionists. We had customs officers at the Murray, the border between Victoria and New South Wales. We do not do justice to history if we forget that the impetus for Federation was not some high motive to create an Australian nation. It was motivated by fear of a Russian invasion. It was fear of being invaded by the Russians which forced the two' major colonies of Victoria and New South Wales together. We can still visit Fort Nepean in Victoria and see the cannon which were placed there to repel the feared Russian invasion. We can still look at that part of our history, even today. It was fear of invasion which moved the two major colonies to look for a national defence system and a national foreign affairs program. Even today, those of us who have bothered to look at the constitutional history of this country well recognise that our constitution is fralJled to give minimum power to the Commonwealth government and unlimited power to the state governments. Hence today in the state of Victoria the Victorian state constitution provides that the Victorian parliament has powers to make laws for the good government of Victoria, while at the national level we are stuck with the defined powers of section 51 of the constitution. In all fairness, it must be said that over recent years we have had, at least in my view, a more enlightened High Court of Australia. We have got rid of the boilermakers case and the engineers case and we have gradually, in an accidental way, been evolving into a truly national parliament with powers which enable the Commonwealth parliament to exercise a proper role in the direction of our country and in a national sense. I might add that I, like all members here, am a proud Australian. On my maternal side am a product of a ship's carpenter on the Sirius, William Hambly, who arrived as a free settler and who cohabitated with a convict woman known as Mary Springham. We never knew if William Hambly or Mary Springham married but nevertheless they produced offspring. Mary Springham is, in fact, buried on Norfolk Island. Her gravestone is identifiable with a carved inscription, MS, with an H over the top. She was a product of the first settlement on Norfolk Island, a settlement which was so disastrous. William Hambly then moved back, after her death, to Van Diemen's Land where most of the maternal side of my family have their history. . On my father's side, my great-great-greatgrandfather arrived in Melbourne in 1847 on the ship the Andromocha from Kinnichy in Ireland. It turns out, of course, that he was a lowland Scot whose ancestors were forcibly expatriated from Britain because the Poms did not like them. That is where the Protestant part of Northern Ireland came·from and it is from where all of Northern Ireland's problems have since come from. He settled, strangely enough, in a place called Springham which is now known as Mill Park, a suburb, and that is now within my federal electorate of MCEwen. I must say, as an Australian, I often strut around with chest out because of my ancestry. I look at my electorate and say that I am proud and enonnously grateful for my ancestors, whether like Mary Springham they arrived from the Old Bailey as a convict to serve seven years transportation, or whether like my paternal side they were free settlers who came from Ireland and made a major contribution in that part of Victoria. For them we should be looking not just at a physical symbol, we should be looking at the year 2001 as involving something more pennanent and something which is more structurally important for the long-term history of this country whilst recognising the past. Our constitution is a joke. It has been joke for so long, since the constitutional conventions. If one reads the proceedings of the constitutional conventions one will know that way back then people knew that what was going to happen in the act of the British parliament was a compromise and was not the solution to the long-tenn constitutional requirements of this country. Yet for successive years we have had a desultory kind of debate in this country about who we are, what we are and where we are going and still there is no consensus. Politics, unfortunately, continually rears its ugly head and self-interest dictates the arguments rather than a sense of pride and achievement and a sense of history and a sense of the future. I do not run away from my European past or my European history and as a lawyer, as one who has a constitutional background, I would say to this House and to this country that we are very fortunate that the British colonise this country, though the indigenous people may disagree with that, understandably. But from where I stand I say we are fortunate. They did give us the Westminster system of parliament. We are the oldest surviving democracy in the Pacific, in South East Asia, and we have a democratic tradition stretching from our forebears and from Britain that we can be very proud of. We should not deny or run away from that background. But I am not British. I am Australian, unarguably Australian and proud of that fact. my My children are Australian and for them and for their· children my aim for the year 2001 is not just a physical monument which I accept is a desirable idea and one which no doubt will probably come to pass but I want to leave them a future-an identifiable Australian identity and a future. We need, in the years before 2001, to destroy the notion of politics in the debate on our constitution. All of us in public life, whatever our background, our migration history, whatever our political views may be, should seriously not be frightened of a debate about our constitution and about how it can be changed to truly reflect the changing nature of this country. If we do not, we will a have failed those who bravely came here; we will have failed those who have created the most stable democracy in our part of the world; we will have failed those who, through compromise, established what I regard as a most deficient 20th century constitution. Let us not forget that we are one of the very few countries in the world which had our system given to us from another parliament. We have never fought for it. We have never, ourselves, sat back and thought much about it, because we are fairly lazy. Mr Andrew-Yes, we have.",53
34,Mr CLEELAND,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"No, we have not. What a lot of rubbish! In our schools today, we do not even teach anything about the constitution. To file an absolute failing in our education system, just ask how many people in Australia have actually picked up a copy of the constitution and read it? They all talk about it but, when they are asked if they have read it, they say no. That is what has to be did done, and that is what honourable members on the opposite side of the House should do. They should not be frightened or fearful, as is so often the case. People should stand up and have some guts and recognise their history; it is a proud history and I, for one, am not ashamed of it. We should look to the future. We should be prepared to look to the year 2001 and create something which will carry our children and their children into a new Australia. We should recognise not only our history but also our place in the world today, which is not a British one.",54
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,"Order! It being almost 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursbrother day. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",55
36,Mr NUGENT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I activities would like to talk this morning about families. There has been a lot of media talk in country and a lot of speeches and articles written recently about the family and, given that it is the International Year of the Family, it is something that is very appropriate. In particular in this grievance debate, I want . talk a little bit about how the fact intrudes-I think unreasonably-all too often in family life. The hand of big brother! Those intrusions are damaging family life in this country. It seems to me that the. government is increasingly bringing in measures do not leave the family to get on and lead their life. It wants to tell them how to spend their money and what to do with their lives: it wants to control every single aspect. seems to me that that is a basic intrusion in our democratic system. The government should stick to providing roads and public services, and so on. It should leave the famiCrowley's lies to get on with their own things. I want to talk about a range of areas mention one particular aspect of what believe is an absolutely unconscionable intrusion into the private lives of Australian citizens, an intrusion that I have come across recently in my electorate of Aston in Melthat bourne. But, to give a general example, let just mention the disability employment vice. I understand the government is planning to get rid of sheltered workshops disabled, for example. It claims that this is taking advantage of people with disabilities. Yet families with disabled members are very happy to continue to have those sheltered workshops. They give an opportunity for some skills to be learnt and for some happy and productive times to be undertaken by the people concerned. ACROD is very much on the ground in this respect and will, in fact, attest to this. Unfortunately, the government has decided that it is going to take its big attitude; it is going to do away with those sheltered workshops. The Spastic Society is a particular example in my electorate and those people who are looked a(ter by the Spastic Society will be. very much affected by this. Another general area where the government seems to me to be Families interfering unconscionably these days in the of families is with its application of this draconian training guarantee levy. A this whole new industry of people has been created. They are there for no other reason than to live off the backs of business. It provides training for those who do not want it, training for those who do not need it, and that to often affects the family businesses worse than government in . the bigger businesses. I also have concerns, in ternlS of industrial relations, about compulsory ullionism and the inflexibility. that workers get. For example, that many women in the work force who want flexible hours and want to be able to negotiate flexible arrangements with their employers so that they can look after family commitIt ments are just denied that flexibility. A final good example of the government's attitude to families and the unconscionable mind-set that we often have was Senator child-care accreditation guidelines, where, for example, Christmas carols and and Santa Claus are deemed to be 'culturally I inappropriate'. It seems to me that those restrictions are absolutely unacceptable. Of course, included in those guidelines was the ultimate whip, where only those who abide by politically correct philosophy are going me to be given assistance because they were told servery clearly that if they took their child elsewhere they may well not receive their for the child-care assistance. I want to mention the story of Adrian and Lorraine Thomas, who are constituents of mine in Knoxfield in my electorate of Aston. A few days ago a card was put underneath the front door of the Thomases from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, asking if an appointment could be arranged to go and see the Thomases about a survey. The Thomases rang up and made an appointment for Saturday 29 January. A lady from ABS arrived with a large book and proceeded to ask questions relating to all the expenses of the Thomas household: their purchases, receipts and so on. The interview ran for about an hour and a half-which Mrs Thomas felt was a bit excessive-but the interviewer indicated that she had to complete this large number of questions, that it was part of the law and they had no option but to give this information. Five minutes before the interviewer left, Thomases were told that they each had to complete personal diaries for the following week. They had to do this every day with every single little detail recorded as to what they spent on all sorts of things. But not only did they have to complete the diaries for this week but the interviewer would return at the same time next week, go through those diaries at length and then they would be given diaries for the following week. They had to do this for the following month. This was going to go on for a full month. Mrs Thomas was horrified and told the interviewer that she just did not have time; she had a job to go to, her husband ran his own small business and they really did not have time to provide all of this. Anyway, it really was an invasion of their privacy. She asked what would happen if they did not complete the diaries. The interviewer basically said that it was the law and they had to complete them. When pressed as to what would happen if they did not, the interviewer refused to say what would happen. The ABS is due to call back this Sunday and pick up the diary. Mr Thomas came to my office, so my office rang the ABS to ask to be told at least what the punishment is if people do not comply. The ABS will not tell my office. It seems to me that we have a situation where the bureaucrats can come and knock on our door, insist on taking up our time, insist that we complete records with all sorts of information and threaten us with a punishment if we do not comply, but nobody will actually tell the individual and nobody will tell the individual's member of parliament exactly what that punishment will be. It seems c to me that that is an absolutely unconscionable state in a democratic country like this. Let us look at the sort of survey information that we are talking about. I have about 20-odd pages and I am told that this is just part of the exercise. Not only do we have to give information about what we spend, but let us look at what it is all about. It covers all purchases and all expenditures, including newspapers, bread, butcher's account, credit cards, debit cards and so on, but also the type of store-whether it was supermarket or a the service station or a milk bar. The weight, volume and quantities that are bought are to be listed.· The amount of money spent in dollars and precise cents and a description of the item purchased, the method of payment for each individual item and things like lotto tickets and bingo purchases must be given. Expenditure that may be partly refunded and any goods that might be obtained from an employer should also be given. Payments that may be partly relevant to any business or farm and so forth have to be listed. It gets down to ridiculous little things. If people go out and buy the kids some icecream, they have got to put all that down, and any lollies they might buy, or any football tickets, subscriptions, birthday presents or postal charges. When somebody comes around and knocks on their front door and tries to sell them a brush, they even have. to record those purchases: item, cost, where they got it from, who it was from, what it was for, and so on. Laundry bills; bus, train and taxi fares; fees for doctors-even the children's pocket money-all have to be recorded on these forms. We are asking citizens to fill in these forms, and I have a number of samples here of the forms that are to befilled in. They are quite lengthy and very detailed and, obviously, it is going to take a number of hours during the week not only to be briefed by the person who has come and knocked on the door, but also to fill the forms in and then to be debriefed on the following weekend. And that goes on every week for a month! I am told that the Thomases were statistically chosen, and it seems that one cannot statistically choose anybody who might be available to do these things or might be willing to do these things: people have to be statistically chosen, even where the imposition is unreasonable. Mrs Thomas goes to work early in the morning, and she is out most of the day. Her husband is out running his own business. It seems that what we have actually done here is not only to impose on people's privacy and to ask fot unreasonable detail of information, but to threaten people with punishments which we are not even prepared to publicly define. We are also denying their member of parliament information, when he seeks it openly and honestly. Of course, ultimately, it is going to be self-defeating. When the Bureau of Statistics gets this back-not from the Thomases but, I am sure, from many other people who will fill these forms in-people will not come up and openly complain and say, 'Look, we think this is an intrusion'. A lot of people will say, 'To heck with this! We'll just quietly sit down the night before the form is due for collection, and we'll fill it in willy-nilly any sort of information-valid or not-just to get the thing out of the way'. So the whole basis of the statistics that the government is using is going to be a sham, anyway. The system should be changed. (TIme expired) New South Wales Bushfires",55
37,Ms DEAHM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Macquarie) (12.37 p.m.)Earlier this morning, I had the privilege of speaking on the private member's motion relating to the New South Wales bush fires. I would like to take that discussion a step further, in the few minutes that I have, to talk about what happens after the fires. What can we learn, and where do we go from here? Firstly, I would like to observe that fires, floods and other disasters, are no respecters of electorate boundaries-either federal, state or local government-and this has come home very strongly to me, because my electorate comprises principally two major local government areas. This is particularly pertinent in the area of hazard reduction. Hazard reduction has been discussed to a great extent throughout the fires. We have seen bush fire brigade volunteers, ADF personnel and others, all burning firebreaks and digging firebreaks under very hazardous circumstances. In many cases, those breaks should have been created earlier. In the Blue Mountains, we recreated what is now being known as the black, line. It is approximately 50 kilometres long, from Winmalee to Blackheath, through national park and council land. It was crt;ated in 1982, but was allowed to revegetate. I would strongly suggest, as do a number of other people in the community, that that line be now maintained. It can be created as a bushwalk and for recreational purposes; it may be diverted where there are environmental sensitivities, but it needs to be retained. The hazard reduction program needs to be more centralised. It should not just be left to each individual local government area because, by creating a hazard reduction in one area, we can be inadvertently sending the fire to another area. More centralised control and cooperation over that area are extremely important. As I mentioned earlier, I have  Wales Commissioner, and he agrees that this is an issue that needs to be discussed. The other area that came to the fore was that of equipment, particularly communicationsequipment. I had the sad realisation that the bush fire brigades in the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains, which are either side of the same mountain range and straddling the same valley, are on different radio frequencies. The captain of Yarramundi brigade, at the bottom of the hill, told me that he had received a phone call from the captain of Winmalee, to tell him the fire was coming his way. With the differing radio frequencies, and had the phone lines been down, not even a like carrier pigeon would have been much use! So communications is definitely an area where we need improvement. I am glad to hear that the federal government, through the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), is looking into the area of creating more radio frequencies specifically for bushfact fire fighting. Of course, in this particular the use of helicopters was extensive. There was a lot of confusion where people were trying to talk to ground vehicles and there were people also talking to helicopters. needs to be improved. Some brigades have very modern transport equipment and tankers. In the Hawkesbury, saved them. one brigade has a World War II Studebaker, which was very impressive in the parade but I do not think it is terribly reliable in firegreatly fighting. There was another piece of equiplocal ment that I thought perhaps came from earlier war. When we leave the equipping the brigades to local government, which hard pressed trying to make the rates go round, I think we have a real problem. More centralised organisation is preferable. On the issue of using helicopters or planes, I have had a lot of pressure put on me to push for either buying or leasing the larger planes from Canada and Europe which are used for water bombing. There were some people in my area who said, 'Look, the helicopters are small, they can dive down and scoop 'up from a dam, and be down into a valley in minutes'. Other people are saying, 'The bigger plane may take longer but it can cover more territory'. I would like to see extensive relive on. search on that at all levels of government. We also learnt something about insurance. I know there were people with no insurance madly trying to get cover while the fire was at their door. I certainly do not approve of that, but I did have a couple of instances in my electorate, and I will be taking these to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), where people's insurance was due for renewal at that time and companies refused to renew their policies. I think that is deplorable, and it is something I certainly want to follow up on. The other issue was about the media reporting. I know that the central control centre did a wonderful job in briefing the media but, as an earlier speaker said, there were lots of other people ringing in and giving contrary information. The people of Kurrajong were very upset that people were told in the media that fire was lapping at their door when it was Kurrajong Heights. To the media fire that does not mean a lot; geographically, to the people of that area, it certainly does. Smaller areas got a little bit overlooked at times. The people of the small village of St That Albans in the Macdonald Valley were still battling for their lives and property after the emergency was over. Fortunately, heavy rain Tourism is another issue. In the Blue Mountains and in the Hawkesbury, we depend on tourism for our local industry, our income and our employment. Honouran able members may have seen the full-page of as in the Sydney Morning Herald recently is which said, 'The mountains are blue, not black'. This was a result of tourism operators getting together, because they have lost a lot of business, not only people who could not come when the roads were closed but people who had been cancelling bookings further into this year. The reality in the Blue Mountains is that only if one goes down Hawkesbury Road, which is not generally one of the major tourist areas, will one see burnt-out bush and burnt-out houses. Driving up the highway to the major lookouts, everything is still lush and green, and I hope it stays that way, because that is the side of the highway that I I would like to see that no blame is apportioned to any particular level of government or any particular group of people. The greenies have had a bit of a knocking from some people and I know there are extremists on both sides of the argument, but all the responsible conservationists I know do respect the fact that we need hazard reduction, that we need good land management in order to be able to appreciate the assets that we have in our native flora and fauna, as well as protecting lives and property. I hope we will sit down and consider those things, learn from what has happened and do it better next time. Meat Industry",57
38,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I would like to comment on the continuing difficulties the conduct of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, is causing the meat industry. In making in these comments, I would like to distinguish the work of the inspection service from that of the quarantine service. On the occasions I have had cause to deal with the quarantine service, I have found its advice and its conduct in resolving quarantine related issues to be. of a. high and professional standard. Regardless of this, AQIS's other arm, the meat inspection service, seems incapable of delivering a quality service which builds on the competitiveness of the meat industry. For years now, both the export and domestic ·processing sectors of the meat industry have laboured under a regulatory system which has been both administratively top heavy and costly. This is a penalty which is borne by the industry, not by the government. It is a cost penalty which has undermined the performance of the meat processing sector and especially its export operations. Fot years the federal government has lectured the industry about the need to boost its value added activities, to gear up to compete against imports and devise strategies for penetrating overseas markets. But the gap between the rhetoric and the reality has only widened further in recent years and government driven impediments to enhanced performances across the meat industry have only increased. Simply, we cannot afford these bureaucratic and administrative obstacles to stifle the meat industry any longer. The industry is competing with overseas competitors who are rapidly lifting their productivity rates. In addition, new rivals will enter the market progressively over the decade and the competition will stifle even more as time passes. For all of this, the export potential for Australian processed livestock goods will increase over the decade. This is especially so across the Asian states and elsewhere as protection levels fall off. This is not a fight for markets we can afford to lose. There have been changes in the industry. There is now much more of a customer focus and better producer-supplier relations than in the past, and the research and development arms of the industry have been restructured to focus more on industry needs and product development. On top of this, Australia has advantages in its production capabilities. Our faimers are efficient suppliers of livestock product, and the processing sector suffers high costs and, relative to other industries, unfortunately does not utilise capital extensively. There are many causes for this, and I will not labour through each relevant factor on this occasion. But one of the key ones is the role of government. Simply, there has to be a serious effort to build a strong quality assurance system which is efficient and streamlined and responsive to industry and market needs. Meat pro-essing is too valuable an industry not to pull out all the stops in pursuit of this goal. There are about 30,000 people in the meat processing industry. There are some 73,000 to 76,000 farms producing livestock to supply the industry. The meat processing industry's annual turnover of about $5.6 billion further signals its pivotal importance to the rural economy. On the basis of these few statistics, honourable members will better understand that we cannot afford to get it wrong with the industry. They will also understand that the industry's anger with the government is deepening week by week as producers labour under AQIS's increasing costs arid decreasing local level of efficiency. AQIS is indeed overstaffed. It employs some 750 people above its realistic needs, a level of administrative excess even the government concedes to be true. As an inspection service, it is far from obtaining a world's best practice rating. Inspectors in Australia inspect about a quarter of the number of animals a day compared with their counterparts on beef chains in the USA. Our meat inspection costs are twice that of New Zealand. It still costs abattoirs about $70,000 for a meat inspector, even though the actual salary of such an inspector is only $31,000. These costs, which have hurt the smaller end of the industry chain especially hard, have not improved greatly over time. There has been a minimal fall in inspection costshardly appreciable, regrettably. When states such as Victoria put inspection services out to tender, we will hopefully see some of these types of costs driven down. Moreover, as we move increasingly towards quality assurance arrangements, which are part of the production process, again, hopefully, we will see some streamlining ofAQIS's responsibilities. But above and beyond this, other costs associated with the inspection service have ballooned out. AQIS has spent lavishly on consultants: $3 million went down the drain through these outlays in the last financial year, and there are also deep concerns about the way in which the organisation and some of its officers have expanded their own resources. If this was not enough, the government's new registration or premises charges have only served to increase the cost burdens imposed on industry. Under this new legislation, the government will charge meat industries a registration fee of sorts in those states 'and territories where AQIS inspection services are employed. . Under the original terms of this charge, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy committed the government to lowering inspection charges and flattening out the cost bill for the industry. This has not happened. Instead, under the legislation, inspection fees for meat industries have skyrocketed-for some by 300 per cent, for others reportedly by up to 2,000 per cent. A few big meat works which employ large numbers of meat inspectors have squeaked out of this situation because of the small reduction in inspector fees. But the vast bulk of the meat processing chain is a victim to increased charges. This unwelcome development has virtually poisoned relations between the industry and the government. It has torpedoed any hope that the federal government was seriously intent on reforming AQIS or creating the environment in which the industry can improve its competitiveness. The states, such as Victoria, are rightly resisting the new legislation and looking to other innovative avenues for providing for adequate quality and inspection services which are also efficiently operated. There are' other matters even above and beyond these concerns which stifle the industry's performance. For example, on one hand, there are administrative confusions to do with the way in which the government conducts its regulatory codes-say, in respect of exemptions from and discounts off the premises charged for remote operators. And I have a matter affecting my own electorate before the minister at the moment to which I look forward to a response. On the other hand, there are a large number of stories circulating about the element of corruption in the inspection services and criminal activity across the meat processing sector. These stories do the industry and AQIS no good whatsoever. They must be investigated as can be and it is important that matters such as these are not swept under the carpet. In a speech to the House of Representatives on 14 October 1991, I raised a number of these allegations relating to organised crime activities. Following that, I have watched with interest over the past two years as the federal government has introduced fit and proper persons regulations in an effort to bring greater integrity to the licensing process for meat works. Regulations of this type were needed and will continue to be needed to ensure product is of the highest quality and that those involved in industry, from the workers to the financiers and retailers, all have their rights and interests protected. While on this subject, I wish to take the opportunity to clarify something that I said about the meat industry in that speech of 14 October 1991. In the course of those remarks I referred specifically to Tony, John and Amelio Giannarelli and their families and companies associated with them which are involved in monumental masonry, funeral services and other businesses, and made statements that they were connected with the mafia and involved in certain criminal activities. I acknowledge and accept that the allegations connecting them with the meat industry, drug trafficking and any other criminal activities whatsoever, as far as I know, are unsubstantiated and not corroborated in any way, and I happily retract them. I said at the commencement of my remarks that, while I hlld concerns with the inspection service within'AQIS, my personal experience with the quarantine service is altogether different. Those inspection officers with whom I have worked in the past have been receptive to concerns voiced by their client groups, and they have been able to provide sound advice. More importantly still, the quarantine service offices with whom I have dealt have shown exceptional follow-up and taken swift corrective action to remedy outstanding issues. In conclusion, I can only hope that the government can start to gain in its efforts to cut the cost of inspection services for the meat processing sector. The move to tendering for inspection services and the adoption of various forms of industry-managed quality assurance systems herald some change. This will have to be watched. But on the front on which the government is most exposed, the inspection services and charging practices of AQIS, it is vital that there be real and substantial and rapid reform. Regional Development",58
39,Mr OCONNOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As a member with a strong personal and professional interest in rural and regional affairs, I noted with more than a passing interest the questions directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) in the other place last Tuesday. Those questions were directed to the minister by the pretender to the Liberal leadership throne, Senator Bishop, and by Senator Tambling. They related to the $1.2 million study by the MCKinsex company into impediments to business investment in regional areas, which was commissioned by the former industry minister Mr Griffiths. I noted with some concern the inference in Senator Bishop's question to the minister, which is recorded on page 20 of that Hansard, that the study might be used to porkbarrel in ALP marginal seats. One does not have to have half a brain to realise that, regions from around Australia are selected, some of those regions are going to be in ALP m-rginal seats and some of those regions are gomg to cover Liberal Party and National Party held marginal seats. In that question several members and former members were named by Senator Bishop, in particular my good friend and colleague the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham). The honourable member for MCMillan can certainly take care of himself in this place, but it is worth putting on the public record the absolutely dreadful political sin he has committed on this occasion, according to Senator Bishop. He has committed the cardinal political sin of lobbying hard for the La Trobe Valley to be included in the study and, what is worse, he was successful. 'J1hat is his cardinal sin, lobbying hard for the Latrobe Valley to be included in that particular study. Of the 14 regions identified for intensive study, I am pleased to say that the Geelong region has been selected for examination by the MCKinsey company. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am here today to confess my sins to the Bishop, because I also lobbied hard for Geelong to be included in that study and I was successful. But I was not the only member in the Geelong region who apparently lobbied for that region to be included in that MCKinsey study. I would like to quote from the Geelong Advertiser of Monday, 24 January 1994. In the business part of the paper, in an article entitled 'Geelong Focus of Million Dollar Study', it said: Geelong was overlooked when plans for the study were first announced last year but lobbying by Corangamite MHR Mr Stewart MCArthurLiberal- . helped secure the region's place on a list of 10 areas now under scrutiny. I do not know whether his lobbying consisted of writing a letter to the editor of the Geelong Addy or whether he spoke to the minister personally, but the simple fact is that the honourable member for Corangamite has apparently committed the same sin as the honourable member for MCMillan and I as the member for Corio. I suggest to the honourable member for if 14 Corangamite that he ought to take himself over to the other place and have his confession heard by the Bishop, because he too is guilty of the cardinal political sin of lobbying for his region. It is going to be an interesting confession and it is one that I would not mind being around to hear, because in the Geelong Advertiser on Thursday, 27 January 1994, the honourable member for Corangamite had plenty to say about Senator Bishop: Mr MCArthur questioned the leadership qualities of the recently appointed urban and regional strategy spokeswoman, Senator Bishop. 'She has not given any indication that she would make a good leader. She has received a lot of publicity but she has displayed no real leadership capacity in the Senate'. He said it was notable that the parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office, during which Senator Bishop grabbed the attention of the nation, had failed to accept her accusations against the office in its official report. '\ let the facts for themselves' he said. 'She has yet to prove herself in the House of Representatives'. Of course, she is not here and she cannot prove herself until she gets here. What I am suggesting is that it is going to be some confession when the honourable member for Corangamite confesses the cardinal sin that he too lobbied for the Geelong region to be included in the MCKinsey study. I did a little bit of basic mathematics. I am not a mathematician of note but, when one divides the $1.2 million that is to be expended on the study by the 14 regions that have been identified, one comes up with a rough figure of around $90,000. That coincidentally happens to be about the amount of money that Senator Bishop spent in the last financial year traversing the length and breadth of Australia in pursuit of her leadership ambitions in the Liberal Party. I was interested in the reasons that were advanced by Senator Bishop for this extraordinary expenditure in getting to know the people of Australia and especially the people of regional Australia. She said that it was to be more accessible to the people of Australia and indeed more accountable. I know there are a few of my good compatriots in this House on the Nati.onal Party benches that are absolutely seething that the opposition leader has appointed Senator Bishop to be the spokesperson on affairs relating to rural and regional matters, or is it urban and regional matters? They really do have their noses out of joint in that regard and I have some sympathy for them. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) is a good bloke and he has got plenty of ability but he has been overlooked in this mass exodus from the backbench to the opposition shadow front-bench. I am sure that those National Party members, like me, who come from a rural background-I am the son of a dairy farmer; I have farmed the land myself-probably do not know as much about the city as I should. I think I should make myself more accessible and more accountable to city people. I am thinking of inviting some of my National Party colleagues in the House to come on a tour of the capital cities with me so that we speak can get to know the city folk. We could, perhaps, stay in the Hyatt in Sydney and the HXatt in Adelaide and perhaps the Hyatt in Brisbane. We could rake up a bit of an airfares bill and put a bit of a tab on Comcar all in the process of getting to know the people of Australia and getting to know our constituents. Let me say this: if the opposition spokesperson on urban and regional affairs is really fair dinkum about getting to know the people of rural and regional Australia, and if she is really fair dinkum about allowing some processes to take place that will assist these regions in coming to terms with the enormous structural economic changes that have taken place in those areas, then she would back off this rather spurious criticism and petty questioning that has taken place on the MCKinsey report in the other place. The area that I come from, the Geelong region, has undergone some significant economic pressures Over the last decade. We have borne the brunt of industry restructuring in car production and component production and also in the TCF industries as well. We have suffered the general effects of the recession, the Pyramid collapse, and depressed local demand because of high unemployment. Despite this, this resilient community has come up trumps in the Kelty task force report which highlighted many exciting opportunities for the region to develop and expand its economic base over time. We have identified in Geelong the opportunities for the expansion of Aerospace and general aviation facilities at Avalon. There are exciting prospects in value adding to wool products, tourism, food processing and the commercialisation of new innovative technologies developed in the Geelong region. The expan-ion of the education industry and the expansion of the motor vehicle component and accessory production industry in this city all point to a rather good economic future for the Geelong region. I hope that those outside the region will no longer look on Geelong and its surrounding area as a cot case or 'as part of the industrial rust belt of the south because it is a dynamic economy, one which is poised to take advantage of the recovery as it proceeds. (Time expired) Television Services  Cable News Network offered to provide a free service to heads of state wishing to subscribe. More than 100 governments accepted the offer. During the Gulf War, the New York Times reported that leaders of front-line states like King Hussein of Jordan and Saudi Arabia'sKing Fahd, as well as more isolated participants such as Margaret Thatcher, relied on CNN to keep up to date as events unfolded. Here in Parliament House things were no different. For the few short months while CNN was piped in from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, people were hooked. A giant video screen dominated the staff dining room and, 10 years after Fraser's communications minister, Tony Staley, established an inquiry into pay TV that recommended its introduction as soon as possible, all the inhabitants of Parliament House finally saw what subscription TV services could offer. Pay TV in Australia and its related services have had a sorry history. Indeed, one industry heavyweight has described the government approach as 'delay elevated to policy'. By any measure, pay TV policy has been a failure, a failure I wish to discuss today. In the past, governments used claims such as shortage of frequencies to justify broadcasting legislation. In reality, commercial and political restraints easily prevented the number of services on offer from approaching the actual technological capacity. The sheer variety and capacity of delivery mechanisms available today· have long since made this approach obsolete. Broadcasting policies now neeq to acknowledge the types of service, not the method of delivery. Advancements ir& technology have also made the old geographical definitions of media markets obsolete. Satellite footprints do not stop at borders. We are already faced with a huge variety of new policy issues when we consider subscription television services as a mere extension of the traditional entertainment oriented free-toeast air services we live with. However, they are much more thal1 even that. Today, the fastest growing industry in the world is communications. We are now hearing more and more about the information super highway-the convergence of telephones, computers, television, videos and movies that industry groups are already planning for the next century. This is scarcely the easiest area for policy formulation. Conflicting visions of the future are hard to resolve. There is little public interest in the complexities of different kinds of services. The stakes are high and uncertainty flourishes. However, the government has scarcely worked to overcome these difficulties. Since 1987 we have be-n provided with communications ministers at a rate of more than one per year. For too many politicians, pay TV has just meant more programs to watch. Tony Staley was a technological enthusiast. Ministers like Graham Richardson have simply regarded pay TV as a political inevitability. Australians will finally have access to pay TV, because they will soon have it, as Northern Territorians do already, from overseas broadcasters on foreign owned satellites, with scant government regulation and scant opportunity for local profit. In Australia, pay TV has not affected our daily lives and so, despite all the importance it may take on in the future, it has not been given serious thought. Once again, Australia has been lagging behind the rest of the world. It can only be seen as the greatest irony that the introduction of a medium that has such potential to break down barriers has fallen victim to our parochialism, to that odd isolationism that turns up in this country. It is difficult to know· how to formulate policies for a medium whose nature and importance in the future are so awkward to determine. Our current pay TV policy dates from November 1992 when the governrpent announced that it would legislate for digital pay TV and delay the introduction of satellite delivered pay TV until digital compression technology was available. Earlier that year a Senate select committee reported: The most difficult Issue the committee had to deal with was the question of the transition from using an, analogue signal to using a digitally compressed signal for transmission of the subscription television broadcasting system by satellite ... There was ... no unanimity from witnesses nor evidence of an agreed time scale for the introduction of digital technology. At the time of the committee's inquiry, it was not operating commercially anywhere in the world. No world standard or agreed specification for digital technology existed. As I have said, it is awkward to formulate policy about technological change. Experts will disagree on matters of timing. The technology that is immediately available is not often the best. However,. in pay TV the theory goes· that the first player, not the best technology, will be the big winner. Late in Ja-uary last year the big players, Packer, Murdoch, Time-Warner and the ABC, became aware that Steve Cosser's Australis Media had bought most of the available licences for microwave distribution in Sydney and Melbourne. The November 1992legislation and accompanying statements had laid down various provisions satellite users must meet, but it left open the possibility of narrowcasting through other means, with minimal regulation. It was clear that Australia would soon be in aposition to initiate Ii lower cost pay TV system more quickly than the proposed satellite system. It had been a laborious task to produce the pay TV legislation. When the act )'las finally passed, it aroused less excitement than might have been expected, as constant policy backflips and reversals had made it clear that cabinet decisions and parliamentary acts did not have the finality in the area that they have in most others. This assessment soon proved correct. Despite all the previous statements to the contrary, the government announced on 28 January that the integrity of pay TV was to be protected by barring the allocation of broadcast pay TV licenses using MDS technology, six weeks after it originally called for license tenders. It was questionable whether the minister had the power to act in such a way. Cosser and the other main potential MDS operator, Kerry Stokes, immediately launched legal action. The decision coincided with' the election campaign and, for those five weeks, Cosser ran a hard-hitting, and often cheeky, campaign against the government and the minister. In mid-March, the federal court ruled, in the Stokes's case, that the government's termination of the MDS licence tendering process was invalid. In April, documents produced in the Cosser action showed that the Prime:Minister (Mr Keating) was warned that legislative amendments would be required to ban the use of MDS technology for pay TV. In May, following further action the Federal Court, on an injunction from Kerry Stokes, ordered the government to complete the MDS license tender process. To many; the government's decision was yet another deal to protect its media mates. Something snapped when pay TV policy was pulled in opposite directions by free market oriented bureaucrats and Labor's long tradition of political patronage to media owners. For others, the decision was the result of incompetence and of a failure to consider how line of sight microwave transmissions could offer a quality service in topographically complex areas like metropolitan Sydney. The MDS row, while short-liyed, was fierce. It seemed to embody all. that was wrong with the government's pay TV policy and with the public debate. While the merits of delivery systems have been disputed, too many of the wider issues have gone unnoticed outside the industry. There has been little debate on how we can ensure the commercial viability of infant pay TV services, while still imposing the sorts of regulations that are desirable for services that can hold such an influence on Australian life. We have still not yet debated how we can take the opportunities offered by technology to increase media ownership. We have not yet discussed what limits will be suitable to programming, whether in terms of Australian content or community standards. In London last September, while unveiling a spectacular expansion of his Sky TV service, Rupert Murdoch said that advances in telecommunications had freed people from the 'once powerful media barons' and spoke cif the vast future potential of integrated information and entertainment industries. Of course, it is easy to make that sort of comment when one owns the hardware, when one employs the news gatherers and when one's own private video collection is better known as 20th Century Fox. But Murdoch is right. The government has failed to adequately deal with the implications of pay TV as an entertainment medium. It has barely considered what the convergence of technology might bring in an area that will be vital for the future. For the first time since the age of in Australia, the capacity exists to transform the way power is shared. Instead of consumers watching television gratis, and advertisers seeking their custom through commercials, consumers will have the power to buy what they want to see. For a Liberal, this is something that I support. (TIme expired) NSW Bushfires Werriwa By-Election",61
40,Mr HAVILAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Macarthur) (1.14 p.m.)Firstly, I would like to add my thoughts on the bushfire disaster in New South Wales and give my condolences to those who lost lives, who lost the lives of loved ones and also to those who lost property. It certainly was a major tragedy in New South Wales. Let me also give full credit to the great numbers of volunteers who fought those fires. They showed courage and bravery. We all owe them a great debt. In my electorate, we .can count ourselves very lucky. I drive through my electorate regularly. We have much beautiful bushland in Macarthur, yet we were hardly touched by the bush fires. We can certainly count ourselves very fortunate. Nevertheless, a number of bushfire brigades, involving hundreds of people from my electorate, actually worked on the fires in other electorates all over New South Wales; and they also deserve great credit. One of them is one of my own electorate staff, Paul Palmer, who fought the fires on the north coast. We certainly all owe them a great deal of gratitude. Last Saturday I worked on a polling booth for the Labor Party in the Werriwa by-election. As a former resident of Werriwa, it was very interesting to work in myoId areaindeed, in the suburbs of Campbelltown, where I waS first elected to Campbelltown Council in 1987. Th'e Labor candidate, Mark Latham, had a decisive victory in Werriwa. He ran a campaign based on the important issues, as we always do on this side, in south-west Sydney, like jobs and transport. This contrasted with the negative campaign of personal attacks waged by the Liberals and television their candidate, Charlie Lynn. Of course, Charlie Lynn was the one who referred to Macquarie Fields as a ghetto. He also made the claim that Labor would win the seat if Donald Duck ran as the candidate. He said that most of the people were welfare beneficiaries who were afraid of losing their benefits if Labor lost. He told the local newspaper, 'They are voting for their cheque'. I guess that this may have been a bizarre reference to the Fightback proposals to cut the unemployed from benefits after nine months. After all, Mr Lynn also advocated a consumptiontax during the campaign. It is interesting to look at the comments about the 'ghetto'. Mr Lynn claimed that he was trying to draw attention to Labor's so called neglect of the area. But the area of Macquarie Fields which he called a ghetto was a public housing estate. And who has responsibility for public housing? It is the state Liberal government of John Fahey. Everybody knows that the New South Wales government has disgracefully neglected public housing areas since Nick Greiner was elected Premier in 1988. Of course, it was previous Liberal governments in New South Wales which were responsible for building the large public housing estates in the 1960s and 1970s of the type that we do not see built these days. It was not only a distasteful and politically stupid comment, but one which was badly misdirected as well. The Liberal candidate for Werriwa now wants to be the Liberal candidate for Macarthur in the next election; and I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I can hardly wait. But then not even the Liberals, not even the people on that side, could be that stupid; so I could not get that lucky. What I want to talk about in the grievance debate are those major issues which won the by-election for Labor-the issues of jobs, growth, and regional development and infrastructure. My electorate of Macarthur virtually surrounds Werriwa in geographical terms and both electorates are part of what is known as the Macarthur region. The Macarthur region falls between the large regions of western Sydney and the Illawarra. Because of this, Macarthur is often not mentioned as a region when regional development is discussed on a national scale. But Macarthur is part of neither western Sydney nor the I1Iawarra really, and is an area of rapid growth with particular needs in the areas of development and infrastructure. One of the major opportunities to provide this is the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek airport. I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) that construction of stage 1 of the airport wi11 commence within weeks and his invitation to the private sector to present proposals for investment in the airport which could lead to its completion ahead of schedule as an international airport. Apart from the aviation and the other national benefits that Badgerys Creek will bring, it will also be a great boost to both western Sydney and Macarthur regions. It will provide new jobs and will aUract industry, which will in tum attract more employment opportunities into the area. The associated transport links, both road and rail, which will be necessary for access to the airport will also have spin-offs for the region generally. Of course, the One Nation statement included the construction of the national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth. This will travel through the Macarthur region and will be of significant benefit to the region. The Deputy Prime Minister e Mr Howe) recently announced funding of $50, ()(){) from the Office of Local Government for a feasibility study into the proposed rail link from St Marys to Port Kembla. I believe this is a vital project. A railway linking western New South Wales with the Illawarra will provide improved access with reduced transit time for a range of export goods, including wheat and coal. It would also provide a link to the airport at Badgerys Creek and create the potential for badly needed commuter transport linking Penrith, Narellan, Campbelltown and Wollongong. It would also provide access for coal transportation from the Burragorang Valley to Port Kembla, which would alleviate' the current problems around Picton, where there are lots of coal trucks travelling through residential areas. An improvement in transport links would generate and attract industry, which would create thousands more jobs in the Macarthur region. The other reason why it is so important that the St Marys to Port Kembla link goes ahead is that there is already a halffinished rail link between Maldon, near Picton, and Dumbarton on the south coast-a half-finished rail link that the Greiner government in 1988 put a halt to after spending $150 miIIion. I went and had a look at it the other day; I went and inspected the half-finished bridge. It is an absolute disgrace if that does not get finished. What a waste of public money that is. It is a perfect opportunity. I think that both federal and state governments need to pick the ball up there and run with it and complete that link from western Sydney, St Marys, the right through to Port Kembla. We have already got a half-finished bridge and a halffinished rail line; let us finish the job. I might add also that that particular project is listed as a high priority in the Kelty report on regional development that was released in December. Whilst talking about the needs of the Macarthur region, it would be appropriate to remind the House of the need to reform the telecommunications there to bring parts of the 046 telephone area into the Sydney telephone district for the purposes of cost. One of the disincentives for industry and business and, indeed, for people to live in the Macarthur area at the moment is the fact that to ring from Campbelltown or from most places in my electorate to Sydney is an STD call. That could quite easily be fixed, I believe. It is a long overdue project that successive members for Werriwa and Macarthur have fought for in the past. I think it is time that the government, in the context of regional development and economic efficiency and creating jobs, did something about that in the course of the next few years. Jobs are what it is all about. We have heard a lot about regional development-and that is very important-but the spin-off from all this is that we create jobs. We have had the green paper-I was a member of the caucus committee which presented a submission to that process-and now the government is considering the employment statement to be released later this year. Of course, I agree that we have to have economic growth, and we are, indeed, having economic growth. We have to have that market driven economic growth. I certainly also support the concept of the job compact which is recommended in the green paper. On top of that I believe we have also got to look at our infrastructure, particular in the growing regional areas, and also in some of the declining regional areas, such as Wollongong. We need to look at renewing and also creating new infrastructure. We need the private sector involved, of course, but we also should not overlook the role of the public sector, because with One Nation we built, and are in the process of building, major capital works and transport links-things that only the public sector can or will do. Another example, of course, was the local government capital works program of 1992. I think that was a successful program within the limits of its terms of reference. If we have learnt anything from the local government capital works program, it is that future programs of that nature, while they are desirable, probably should be looked at on a regional basis rather than on purely a council boundary basis. There are certainly potentially a lot - ore efficient ways of doing it. If it is done - n such a way as to look at the common tnterests and the projects that will give common benefit to a region and also common benefits to the nation, it will be much more efficient to run a program of capital works like that on a regional basis rather than at the purely parochial local government level. Nevertheless, those programs are important. There are also links, of course, particularly in growth areas like Macarthur, with urban development and housing policy. So it is very important, I believe, that we do not overlook ' the role of the public sector in providing capital infrastructure which provides useful social benefits and economic efficiency. I am not talking about make-work schemes; I am not talking about building monulllents to politicians or anything like that. I am talking about things that will provide real benefits and will actually create jobs. (TIme expired) Unemployment",65
41,Mr WAKELIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I would like to address the issue of the latest economic recovery of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and his latest pledges of support to the long-term unemployed in regional Australia. I will begin with two short statements from constituents, which are typical of the job searching and soul searching that is occurring in my electorate of Grey. The first quote begins: I am writing to you in desperation regarding my immediate employment prospects ... I called a Member of Parliament in Adelaide recently and told his spokeswoman of my concerns .. , and she said 'It's terrible isn't it? They should do something about it'. It's always the they, they never want to name anyone specific. A second one from a constituent reads: . .. although being desperate for work and writing letters, making phone calls and filing out application forms throughout the State, the only response is 'We will put you on the LIST!' They are from two constituents in the last few weeks. Letters such as these sadden me. They are all too typical of what I am hearing from people. My main electorate office is located next door to a Department of Social Security and Commonwealth Employment Service office. Every morning, crowds line up on the steps of these offices waiting for the doors to open. They are quiet crowds; they do not talk or mingle; they just wait for the doors to open. But one could be forgiven for thinking these constituents will soon be saved. The Prime Minister tells us we have yet another recovery on our hands. Unemployed men and women, including those I see lining up each morning, are no doubt dancing in the street. Not likely! I do not blame the unemployed for regarding the Prime Minister's renewed optimism with caution; they have heard it all before. On 22 March 1990, Mr Keating, on recession, said, 'We won't let there be a recession'. On 1 August 1990, he said, 'We are not about putting the place into recession'. Then, of course, there was the famous one on 29 November 1990, 'This is a recession Australia had to have; I knew there had to be one but I didn't want to tell you'. So it is little wonder my constituents are cynical. About one million unemployed people are still searching for jobs to put food on the table. The economic forecasts which thrilled the financial journalists mean little to the unemployed today. They do not just thrill the financial journalists; they thrill ministers treasurers, as we have seen in the last few days. But they do not thrill the unemployed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated this week that unemployment may be twice as high as we think. We have all known that, but the ABS is starting to get a handle on it. We know now that the number of hidden unemployed-that is, those who would like to work but are not captured in the official unemployment figures-is around 908,000, compared with the official unemployed of 940,000. This means that about two million people would like to work but have no job to go to. Last week, the Prime Minister said the recovery must be shared; it would not just be for the top end of town. I would hardly think that needed to be said. This recovery must be a recovery for the jobless. The two million people Labor has left behind should be given hope-we have had enough of hope; we are tired of hope. The government must now deliver. The Prime Minister has placed long-term unemployment and regional development at the top of the federal government's policy agenda in the forthcoming year. What took so long? The long-term unemployed in regional Australia have known for 11 years, that is 11 years of Labor, that there has been a problem out there. The larger towns in Grey have significantly higher proportions of unemployed persons than the national average. For the June quarter 1993, the percentage of job search and newstart recipients unemployed for longer than 12 months was 64 per cent in the City of Port Pirie, 63 per cent in Whyalla, 58 per cent in Port Augusta and 57 per cent in Port Lincoln. These figures are clearly well above the national average. We desperately need to encourage development in the region and create jobs. I therefore look forward to urgent action from those honourable members opposite. However, I must advise my constituents not to hold their breath. The Labor government has shown it is just not capable of solving our unemployment problem. The Kelty task force report on regional development called for higher petrol and company· taxes. This report was judged by many in the community-most in the community, I sugand gest-as an uninspiring and patronising document. I have been working with my regional development boards in the electorate and meeting with potential investors to raise real, long-term solutions for the electorate. Local governments and development boards are working tirelessly to generate new industries and attract investment. Their ideas for projects include fuel additives plants, container manufacturing, brass production, aquiaculture and ecotourism projects such as an arid lands botanic park. The regions are working together to keep people in the towns, keep the local banks and post offices open and provide a future for their children. They have learned that they cannot rely on this federal government to lead the way with creative development and business incentives. I challenge the federal government to rise to the task of supporting these regions with a new spirit, not one which comes down out of the ivory towers of Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is one of the most distressing aspects of this debate. I thought, as a younger person, that Labor was the party for the battlers. But what has it done for them? Labor has had over 11 years to look after the interests of the people of Australia, and what do we see-one in five Australian children, dependent students, growing up in families affected by unemplqyment. One-third of a million Australians are unemployed for more than a year. In fact, over 10 per cent of the labour force has been unemployed, and nearer 20 per cent underemployed in every single month since August 1991. That is 1991. It is little wonder that Australia's youth suicide rate is at such a high level. That is a distressing fact which the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) raised in this place yesterday.. We all know that youth unemployment rates are a national disgrace. Australia is supposed to be one of the most egalitarian societies in the world, and yet we are witnessing the entrenchment of a class of long-term unemployed people who do not reap the same benefit from society as their employed cousins. Under the Australian Labor Party, Australia has lost its spirit of egalitarianism. The fair go for all which is branded on my soul appears to have been lost forever. I would like to quote from an excellent article by Morris West which appeared in last week's issue of the Bulletin. In that article Mr West talks about our sunburnt country which he calls the 'broke, bewildered and besieged' country. He says: This Australia, this divided and deeply discouraged nation, this nation which has a million unemployed and is full of fears for its economic future, is being treated to the shabbiest exhibitions of political theatre that we have seen in a long time. The principal offender is the prime minister, whose vulgarity is now notorious. He is charged to deal with high matters which touch all our lives, yet he demeans them by gutter language. In doing so he demeans us, too. I am constantly amazed at the dichotomy which he exhibits. Clearly he wants to be seen as a statesman dealing wisely and temperately with major issues for the future of this country. Yet the moment he faces a parliamentary or press audience, he acts like a rather malicious comedian playing for cheap laughs, debasing himself and the nation he was-lected to lead. His insulting and hectoring style In debate aggravates dissension when we need a sense of national unity. Morris West is such a good wordsmith that I think it is worth quoting more of his article in the time available to me. He says: We elected the government, therefore we deserve it I will not include myself in thatIt has been forced to make graceless comprises which have tarnished its image and shaken the confidence of the community. ' The result is that at the very moment when we need common sense and moderation in all our social relationships, we are embroiled in fruitless contention which will profit none of us. There are enough rifts and divisions within the country without digging new ditches to divide us. Put it another way. It is time to put value back into the currency of the parliamentary system. He continues: The prime minister is promoting an Australian republic. The national conference of the Labor Party has already chosen to eliminate our present flag from its logos. The flag can be changed by legislative action but constitutional change to a republican form of government must be put directly to the people. However, a fundamental change has already taken place in the body politic. Opinion is divided, groups are polarised. The Mabo verdict on the land rights of Aboriginal people and island 'peoples has already become an abrasive issue, even though the court ruling itself has been poorly expounded, grossly misunderstood and in some particulars distorted by special interest groups. I will finish with this quote, which I think we should all ponder: What we should aspire to be, what we should work most earnestly to be, is a community whose members respect each other and are open to each so that their children can live and work ... harmoniously together. Australians, and particularly regional Australians and the long-term unemployed, must not wait any longer. They have already waited too long. Mafia Allegations Community Grants",67
42,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Before I move to my grievance, I wish to express my deep concern at what seems to me to be an abuse of the responsibilities that attach to every member of this parliament. I was present today, as I was present in October 1991 when the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) made some very damaging allegations about members of an Italian family in Melbourne whom he suggested were deeply involved in Mafia activities. They were serious allegations at the time, and they were treated as such by the press. Those allegations caused great pain and anguish to the members of that family and, from the moment the allegations were made, the family made it perfectly clear that they were innocent of any such involvement. Parliamentarians do not always get it right. When we get it wrong and we do grave damage to an individual citizen and their family outside this parliament, the duty and indeed the obligation of the member concerned, in my view, is to come into this parliament and to correct the parliamentary record. I would have thought that that is what privilege in this parliament means. What occurred in this parliament today was something of a national disgrace. Some two and a quarter years later, having made these allegations, the honourable member for Gippsland wanders in, makes a general speech about the problems in the meat industry and then, as if in passing, says, 'Oh, those things I said back in October 1991 about this family, I retract' . At the least he owed them an apology, at the least he should have apologised to this House and to that family for the grievous damage that he has done. Not to do so not only seriously reflects upon him but also seriously reflects upon the standards of this House, and I for one will not let this pass without saying that I dissociate myself from what I regard as a totally unworthy retraction. If the honourable member for Gippsland has any sense of decency, he will come in and apologise and retract, and in some way try to indicate his apology for the damage that he has done to an Italian family which is respected not only in the Italian community but in the broader Melbourne community. I now want to turn to the cause of my grievance. In my electorate, as a result of representations I was able to make in support of many community organisations, those organisations were the recipients of sports and cultural grants. I would like to deal with some of those because I am getting a bit sick and tired of a beleaguered opposition with leadership problems, desperate to find any kind of argument at all, constantly referring to these grants as 'sports rorts grants'. If one looks at it, and I can only deal with it on the basis of my own electorate, what has occurred, and what seems to have been overlooked, is that most of these funds were funds to community or sporting organisations as seeding grants which were backed up by activities in those organisations and by the exercises of their own members to top those processes up. I have not got the time to go through all the grants in my electorate, but let me just deal with a few of them. The Port Melbourne Soccer Club received a grant of some $250,000, but the total cost of putting in club facilities was some $600,000. And what was it for? It was to put in a community sports pavilion, available in the first instance to the soccer club but to all youth organisations, because kids were <;:hanging in men's toilets, behind bushes and in Cars. They made that application, it was a bona fide application, I was pleased and proud to support it, and it was successful. But these are the sorts of things which are now described as sports rorts. Let me deal with another one, the Albert Park community playground. That was an exercise where a community, citizens, decided to build a playground, which included facilities for disabled children, which ultimately cost $250,000. The fact that they received $46,000 as a Commonwealth grant allowed that development to take place much more quickly. It was a project that was built in something less than three days by 3,000 ordinary citizens bringing their hammers, their nails, business organisations providing infrastructure and support, to build a playground which every member of that community is proud of. Is that to be described as a 'sports rort'! Then there was the grant to the Hellas Soccer Club. That is an interesting one because for years it has been without a decent modern stand. It received some $200,000 when the total amount that it is proposing to spend is $2.8 million. This was also related to the fact that the facilities of that ground and that club are also available to the local seconable dary college, which is not one of the most wealthy schools in Melbourne. For years it has not had a decent sports oval or facility, and that facility at South Melbourne is now available to the students five days a week for their own sports activities. They welcomed that. They welcomed it so much that th!3Y had a formal opening, and who was there? Was there any talk of sports rarts then? The Liberal Premier of Victoria sent a very full apology. He sent along no fewer than two state ministers to take part in the opening ceremony, and a newly elected Liberal Senator for Victoria, Senator Troeth, was there. Was there any talk about sports rarts then? Of course there was not. Sports rorts exist in the tiny minds of honourable gentlemen like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is at the table. They specialise in slurs and in misrepresentation because, at the end of the day, many of them-and they have not said this clearly to the people of Australia-were opposed to this program. They were so committed to their own program which hinged on the great concept announced by the leader at the time that all those grants were going to be abolished; there was no place for them· in a Liberal-National Party coalition government. So when honourable members opposite came back here, having lost the unwinnable election, they had to find an excuse and so the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) became a target. I want to say, quite frankly and publicly, that I thank her for maintaining the integrity of this program; I thank her for the funds which have done so much for the kids in my electorate. I say to some of my coalition colleagues that they need to do better than they are doing at the moment. This parliament is being debilitated because strong governments need strong oppositions and we have not got a strong opposition because of the internal row. There are more knives on the other side of the House, directed mainly at the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), than one would find in the best restaurants in Melbourne. The day of the long knives is on. The sooner honourmembers opposite get their act together and provide some real opposition, the sooner they will abandon the ridiculous assertion they are making about a policy that is directed to Australian communities and mainly to the young people involved in sport and cultural activities. It is a major program that I feel proud of, the' government feels proud of, and the minister is entitled to feel proud of. Youth Unemployment",69
43,Mr SLIPPER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I think the people of Australia have a very great grievance with the ongoing problem of unemployment in this nation. We have more than . one million people out of work and up to two million people unable to find adequate work. The Labor Party has now been in office for a period of some 11 years and yet we find that ministers come into this place without any real solution. We find that our young people leave school without any real prospect of obtaining a job. The people of Australia have a great grievance regarding this ongoing national scandal. One only has to go to the electorate of Fisher and the Sunshine Coast of Queensland to see that youth unemployment is a major problem. These young people, who are products of our education system, are concerned because getting a job remains almost a total impossibility for them. They are asking us in the national parliament of this country for some answers. The Labor Party has been elected the government of Australia on no fewer than five occasions. Ministers and honourable members opposite come into· this House and yet we find that the continuing national tragedy of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, goes on and on and on. Quite frankly, the people of Australia have had enough. The unemployed people of Australia are sick and tired of being used by the government as political footballs; they demand solutions, they demand opportunities. It is simply not reasonable, and it is not Australian, for the government to continue having a society where people are permanently unemployed with absolutely no prospect of employment. In fact, we have families in which unemployment has become institutionalised, with two and three generations unable to obtain a job.",71
44,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106; the debate is interrupted arid I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",72
45,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"There is no greater gift than the gift of life. I therefore find it distressing. to see the tragic waste of life in the form of suicides, in particular youth suicide. Last September I wrote to the Chairman of the·House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs urging him to instigate an inquiry into suic;:ide. I ed that the terms of reference be far-reaching and consider all aspects of suicide, including the reasons for it, the means, ways of preven'ting suicide, what can be done to provide more help to potential suicide victims, and so on. The facts are frightening, which makes the need for this inquiry even more urgent. Suicide is now the second most common cause of death amongst young males in Australia; and for every young male suicide there are 15 attempted suicides. We also have in Australia the highest incidence in the world of young people killing themselves by their own hand. That is an appalling record. The reasons for suicide are many and varied, and I am sure that there are reasons which we do not even know about. We need to find out what we can do to prevent suicide; and, to find out what we can do, we first need to know the reasons. Knowing the reasons, we can then seek ways to implement preventative measures and start programs which assist those who would be classed as potential suicides. While I am disappointed that the Standing Cqrnmittee on Community Affairs is yet to do anything about this issue, it is my hope that the committee will examine the subject and make recommendations which can be acted upon, so that we can hopefully make headway into solving a problem which is too often considered taboo and therefore ignored. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",72
46,Mr NEWELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to clarify some comments I made in the House yesterday. I understand that there are press reports today relating to the higher education contribution scheme. Yesterday I spoke on that legislation, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1993. I wish to point out that my remarks referred to the higher educaSuicide tion contribution scheme funding arrangements put forward by the government in the budget last year. These measures were defeated in the Senate. The legislation before the parliament does not deal with these budget proposals. It deals with increased places for students. It deals with an additional 1,500 places for students for 1996 and some insuggestcreased funding of $5 billion for higher education. The government has a proud record of supporting tertiary education and again I commend the responsible ministers, as I did yesterday, for the fine work they have done in seeing the growth in numbers and in the capital funds that have been made available for the continued growth and development of tertiary institutions throughout Australia. Community Grants",72
47,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and others to my left have been at pains to remind us that the Labor Party is the party of social justice. In between, there has been much crowing about the stock market. Unfortunately, in and around Wills the price of shares is not a regular topic in the local pub or the lounge room. South-east of the electorate of the honourable member for Calwell, the defenders of Northland Secondary College are asking the government, iIi a spirit of reconciliation, to throw a few dollars its way. They are not having much luck. The Brunswick community chi1d-care co-op is angry also. Brunswick, of course, has an unemployment rate of around 20 per cent and the child-care co-op survives because of volunteer labour. Being asked to find $50 a head for additional copies of the Quality Improvement and Accreditation Handbook is, they reckon, a bit rich-only slightly less than two weeks of home care allowance, by my mathematics. West Coburg Sports Club is trying to work out how it could be ranked category 2 by Minister Ros Kelly's department and be overlooked when a particular organisation ranked category 3 was granted $100,000. The latter organisation did not even specify the amount sought. What about the application for funding for a female sporting complex? You guessed it: ranked 2, but no funding. So much for the status of women. So much for social justice. Gure, Mr Matt",72
48,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is with some regret that I am here today. I would prefer to be in Lakemba at this point in time. Mr Speaker, you would understand why. It is because of the death of a person known to both you and me-a man by the name of Matt Gure who was a public servant of extreme ability, a person who gave great service to our nation, and a person who was diligent in his duty, conscious of the people that we represent and did a great service to them. The funeral service is currently taking place in the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney. Unfortunately, l was not able td get leave to go to that funeral, and you are in the same position, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to put it on the record of this House on your behalf, on my own behalf, on behalf of the honourable member. for Throsby (Mr Hollis), on behalf of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and on behalf of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) that we valued this man. We valued his service to Australia, and we will continue to value his service and honour his name whenever it· comes up. He was truly a great Australian. He was a person who gave his all-one of the legion of public servants who do a magnificent job but very rarely get the credit for what they do. I ' would hope that his family and those people who are sorely missing him understand the respect that he was held in by this House, by his work mates and by the people who had any dealings with him. Balance of Trade Figures",73
49,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Every Australian should be concerned about the December balance of trade figures. They were quite startling. The country really needs to have a look at what is imported into this nation. Imports are far too high, and all Australians need to be looking at where they purchase product. By that, I mean that we should be getting a change in philosophy in Australia to buy Australian made products. The need for all Australians to purchase AustraHan products was never higher than it is right now, and I think the government needs to be setting .the lead in this particular aspect. If a lead can be given by the government and government departments in the purchasing arrangements that the government departments have in looking at. Australian products, of which we have many fine examples, it would make a tremendous difference to this nation. In Bendigo, the electorate that I represent, we even have a policy of buying locally. I am proud to say that I never look further than a local manufacturer for the suits that I buy. Some of the materials and cloths that they have are produced in Australia as well. I do not know about ties, but I would like to find a local manufacturer of ties and I would buy them, too.",73
50,Mr TUCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I think I can help you there. I can get you some wool ties.,73
51,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yes, there are some woollen ties, as the honourable member for O'Connor says; and I have got some good .woollen ties. I compliment the honourable member ·for O'Connor on arranging wool week. But can I say: buy locally and buy Australian. Community Grants "":'",73
52,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to endorse some of the comments that wer.e made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) earlier today. There has been a campaign on the part of the opposition to suggest that, as a result of the fact that Labor electorates were getting something in excess of conservative electorates for those sport grants and for sport allocations, there was necessarily something wrong with the program. There is something wrong with the distribution of services and facilities between the of areas that those opposite represent and the type of areas that we represent. If there was not some sort of disparity between the volumes of money being allocated in grants to improve services and facilities between their electorates and electorates of the kind that I represent, I would want to know damn well why there was not. I cite one program in one area of my electorate, a relatively conservative voting area. Fortunately, most of the people' in my electorate have great political perception because in every area over 50 per cent of them vote for us. That area tends to be fairly conservative. I do not ask, when people come along in my electorate, which way they vote when they put in applications for any of these programs. 'I supported this program, which was for facilities to provide access into the Watagan Mountains areas for people who were out touring. They are not the wage plug in the western suburbs of Sydney who are looking after their weekly domestic budget. They are people from the northern suburbs who are taking advantage of the opportunity to go there; and those facilities have been provided for them-not for the wage plug in my electorate. Community Grants",73
53,Mr ATKINSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I find it quite fascinating that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) would decide that he would tackle the issue of electorates being worthy or otherwise of funding. The fact of the matter on this issue is really related to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) herself$30 million worth of allocation of funding based on, one can only assume, a very good memory and assessment of information. The area that the opposition is concerned about is not the allocation. We are quite happy to see funding go to areas where money is necessary to make sure that people get facilities. The part that we are upset about is the allocation of the funds on an electorate basis and without any information being type carried in the minister's office to back up those applications that were put forward. The fact of the matter is that applications went into the minister's office and decisions were made, but in that process there is not one piece of paperwork to provide justification for those funds being put forward. It has got nothing to do with allocation on the basis of individuals in our society, it has got to do with the propriety of the ministerial approach taken by this government. Victoria: Pork-barrelling,",74
54,Mr CLEELAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"What nonsense. Let us get some pork-barrelling onto the table in this place today. Let us go to Victoria. Let us go to the state seat of Seymour. At a time when 50 rural hospitals in Victoria look like closing, when 79 rural schools are being closed, in the state seat held by Mrs Tehan, would you believe $2.1 million is to go to the Kilmore Hospital for 10 acute beds, there is an indirect promise to the Seymour Hospital of $5 million for an upgrade and $120,000 is to go to the Seymour Racing Club for new stables. If honourable members want to talk about pork-barrelling, they should come down to Victoria and see Liberal policy at work. They will see porkbarrelling like they have never seen before, and there is no logic. The Victorian government is prepared to close 50 rural hospitals elsewhere in the state, yet, when one walks into the electorate of the Victorian Minister for Health, bingo, up it comes-pork-barrelling. We will give the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) pork-barrelling! National Flag Badges: Parliament House Shop",74
55,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to draw to the attention of the House the fact that Australian flag badges have now been withdrawn from sale in the parliament shop. Being naturally suspicious of the government's motives, I wondered whet-er this was yet another attempt to undermine our flag and national institutions. While in 1994 the ment shop has apparently adopted the commendable practice of selling only Australian goods, I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) remains obsessed with Thai tables, French clocks, Italian suits and British prints. Australian flag· badges produced overseas have now fallen foul of this new push to sel\ Australian products. I do not disagree with the principle of giving preference to local\y produced items, but I am amazed that the parliament shop has not been stocked with Australian flag badges made here as a substitute. It is shocking that badges bearing this important national symbol are no longer available from Australia's Parliament House. One hopes that their absence is a temporary aberration. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation",74
56,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The CSIRO is Australia's finest scientific institution and unfortunately it is facing a funding crisis yet again. The government has failed to confirm what its funding will be for the new triennium. In fact, we understand there will be a $50 million reduction anyway in the funding program for CSIRO. In my view, to put such an institution in that position is irresponsible. There are side effects to it as well. CSIRO is one of the core funders of a number of organisations, including the Murray-Darling Freshwater Laboratory, the only freshwater laboratory research institute for inland waters in the whole of Australia. If CSIRO does not sustain its own funding, it follows that the freshwater laboratory will also suffer because CSIRO will be unable to sustain funding for it. I believe that the government has to get its act into order. Triennium funding for organisations with research agendas such as this on behalf of Australians should be granted and we should not have the adhockery and the uncertainty we have now. Community Grants",75
57,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I will add one other comment to the observations r that! was making before. Another reason why there has been such a success on the part of parlia- members on this side of the chamber is because they represent their electorates so effectively. They get out and they fight for their electorate and they do not just luxuriate in this place, as honourable members do on the other side of the chamber. Community Grants",75
58,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Honourable members should know that people are not necessarily whingeing about the application of money.

60,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Tuesday, 1 February 1994, I informed the House of the receipt of the resignation of the Hon. James Joseph Carlton and indicated that I was aware of the intention of the Hon. Michael MACKellar to resign from the House on Friday, 18 February 1994. I indicated that consideration was being given to possible dates for the by-elections for the divisions of Mackellar and Warringah and that I was consulting the party leaders in relation to the matter. Honourable members wilJ appreciate that these are adjoining electorates. Following question time on Tuesday, the Hon. John Dawkins, the honourable member for Fremantle, confirmed his intention to resign from the House on 4 February 1994. I indicated that I would consider dates for the consequent by-election and would write later that day to party leaders and the independent members in relation to the by-election. I have received advice from each of the party leaders in respect of the three by-elections. The Prime Minister has indicated that, on the assumption that the honourable members resign on the dates they have announced, he has no problem with the dates suggested by me. The Leader of the Opposition advised me on 1 February that the dates proposed for the by-elections in Mackellar and Warringah were acceptable. On 2 February, he advised me that he was of the view that the by-election for Fremantle should be held on the same date as those for Mackellar and Warringah and that, if this is not acceptable, each by-election should be treated separately and be held as soon as possible. The Acting Leader of the National Party has advised that his party will not be fielding candidates but that, in respect of the by-election for Fremantie, he supports any remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. I have considered all the comments made. I now inform the House that, subject to the receipt of Mr MACKellar's resignation on 18 February, it is my intention to issue writs for the by-elections in Mackellar and Warringah on that day. Dates in connection with the byelections will be as follows: issue. of writs, Friday, 18 February 1994; close of rolls, Friday, 25 February 1994; nominations, Tuesday, 1 March 1994; polling, Saturday, 26 March 1994; and return of writs, on or before Friday, 27 May 1994. I also inform the House that, subject to receipt of Mr Dawkins's resignation on 4 February 1994, I propose to issue a writ that day for the by-election in the division of Fremantle. The dates in connection with the by-election will be as follows: issue of writ, Friday, 4 February 1994; close of rolls, Friday, 11 February 1994; nominations, Tuesday, 15 February 1994; polling, Saturday, 12 March 1994; and return of writ, on or before Friday, 13 May 1994.

61,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to her statecompared ment in the House yesterday that 'there has been nothing to suggest any misappropriation or any misuse of funds' in the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. I ask the minister whether she still stands by this statement in the light of the Australian National Audit Office submission to . the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, dated 20 January, which states: Tn the absence of any effective monitoring or control mechanisms, the Audit Office believes that the department has no way of knowing either the level of outright fraudand I emphasise 'outright fraud'or the extent of the allocation of grants to purposes not approved by the minister. Mrs KELLY....,...I absolutely stand by my statement. The additional submission from the audit office adds no new information. It made comments on my secretary's submission to the committee and I would like to table in this House comments from my secretary in response to the Auditor-General's comments. Economic and Financial Policy",76
62,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of developments since last November's APEC leaders meeting regarding closer regional dialogue and cooperation on issues relating to economic and financial policy?,76
63,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have been saying in recent days, this government has been instruthe mental in changing the Australian economy and transforming it from a rather closed, inefficient economy to an open, highly competitive-internally and externally-economy and one which is now very much internationally competitive and much more a part of the trading world. This transformation has been behind much of the good news for the economy in recent times. This has gone hand in hand with a determination to face up to the economic and political realities imposed by our geographic location and to take advantage of Australia's proximity to the world's most dynamic economic region, east Asia. Average growth of the Asian economies over the last five years has been 5 1h per cent, with 21h per cent for the OECD. So it is clearly far more economically dynamic. By locking our exports increasingly into that region, we have been able to maintain an export performance much better than would otherwise have been the case. Our exports to South-East Asia have been growing at an average rate of overseven per cent. Merchandise exports to east Asia, excluding Japan, have increased from 19 per cent in 1982-83 to 33 per cent last year. Together with Japan-around 25 per cent of exports go to Japan-the east Asia region now accounts for over half of all of our exports, almost 60 per cent. That is just our merchandise exports. If we look at our service exports in the area of tourism, for instance, we can see that there has been a vast increase in the amount of service export income coming from tourists from the Asian region. They account for almost half of the visitors to Australia now, co-pared with a quarter less than a decade agoThis orientation towards the economy of the Asian region which is so beneficial to us has been reflected in a deliberate effort by the government to foster a closer engagement in the Asia-Pacific region on all frontspolitical, cultural and economic. Australia's participation in APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, has of course been a central part of this process. In that connection I am pleased to be able to indicate that in recent days I have accepted an invitation from the US Treasury Secretary, Mr Bentsen, to attend a conference of APEC finance ministers in Hawaii on the 18th and 19th of next month. The agreement to convene such a meeting was an important outcome of the very successful APEC leaders summit held in Seattle in November of last year. I would like to say, particularly on this which is the last day in this House as a member of this parliament for my predecessor, the honourable member for Fremantle, that this conference is the culmination of a major diplomatic effort by Australia, most particularly by the honourable member for Fremantle in his capacity as Treasurer, to extend and strengthen APEC ties in the area of economic and financial policy. At the meeting of the Asian Development Bank last year, the former Treasurer hosted an infonnal gathering of finance ministers from the region to discuss the potential for greater dialogue on such issues. This meeting revealed considerable interest in the possibility of a meeting of finance ministers in the APEC region. Prior to the Seattle leaders meeting, he wrote to all his regional counterparts, not only emphasising the growing importance of trade and investment flows to all the countries in the region, but also underscoring the many economic policy issues and challenges which we have in common and the considerable potential benefit from sharing experiences on these matters. The former Treasurer also noted the desirability of taking stock of the existing range of regional and subregional contacts and the potential benefits of a more direct involvement by finance ministers in encouraging a more focused development of these existing contacts. I concur fully with my predecessor's views on the importance of more participation by finance ministers in APEC. The forthcoming meeting-and in particular the positive way in which the current APEC chair, the United States, has adopted this idea-is now providing the necessary political leadership and is therefore very pleasing. It is intended that the APEC finance ministers meeting will provide an opportunity to consult freely and openly on the challenges facing the region, including ensuring noninflationary growth, financing development, infrastructure development and the promotion of capital markets. I assure the House that I intend to pursue participation in this forum with all the vigour that was initiated by my predecessor. The forthcoming meeting will further strengthen the sense of community day, among Asia-Pacific economies as we seek to build on the successful outcome of the GAIT Uruguay Round and look to further enhance the commitment to open trading relations and a cooperative partnership in tackling common problems.

64,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories refuse an application lodged by the Kilkivan tennis club, in a coalition electorate, which arrived one day late even though an officer from her department had advised the club that the application would be accepted?

66,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might ask in whose electorate it was in a moment, Kim. Did the minister write saying that 'extensions of time for the lodgement of applications were not to be given under any circumstances' and 'I do not believe it is appropriate to consider any late applications'?

70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have made your point of order. Industrial Relations,78
71,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Industrial Relations seen reports that the Victorian government is conducting a review of its Employment Contracts Act in response to the passage of the federal government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill late last Can the minister tell the House what impact the federal Industrial Relations Reform Act will have on state industrial relations systems, such as the one in Victoria?",78
72,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. It has taken just over a year for the industrial relations white flag to go up over Spring Street and the office of the Victorian Minister for Industry and Employment, Phil Gude. Government members-Who? Who?",78
73,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Phil Gude. Yesterday a headline in the Age reported that Mr Gude was embarking upon a review of the Kennett government's Employee Relations Act and that, to quote him, 'the review would be from the front cover to the back cover'. It has taken just over a year for this to happen. Amongst the things under consideration in that review are-wait for it; here it comesminimum standards in line with the ILO conventions that we legislated for in this parliament last year.",78
74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, well, well!",78
75,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And it does not end there. Further consideration is to be given to the reintroduction of compulsory arbitration. a later Remember compulsory arbitration? It is coming back in Victoria. One does not have to be Einstein to know that the review has been prompted by the fact that several hundred thousand workers have now left the Victorian system and come under' federal award coverage as a result of the Victorian legislation. This review has come about as a result of the fact that that legislation has not worked and is not working' and that the individual contract low wage route that the Victorian government embarked upon has been a dismal failure. All that confrontation, conflict and bitterness and all those hundreds of thousands of people dragged into the street protesting has come to absolutely nothing in legislative terms. Now we have the admission of defeat. It is disguised, of course. They say it will be a review of their legislation from the front cover to the back cover. The reality is that it is an absolute and utter capitulation. We may year? well ask ourselves where this capitulation leaves the honourable member for Bennelong, the shadow minister for industrial relations, who has been the federal champion of this route-the low wage route, the individual contract route. He is the man who inspired the legislation that is now being reviewed in Victoria. It leaves his party here in the national parliament with a failed policy, a policy that he still refuses to change, except for the $3 youth wage which he said that he would get out of because it really was not his idea. It was legislation proposed by his embattled leader; it was never part of his plan. But all the rest of it remains on all fours. Mr Speaker, it may have escaped the honourable member for Bennelong but I would think that the lessons of Victoria have not escaped the new Liberal government in South Australia. In Western Australia the Liberal and National parties there are determined to follow the Victorian way; that is, to go down the route of abolishing awards and introducing individual contracts. Let me say that, inevitably, we will see the same result Western Australia in six to 12 months time that we are seeing in Victoria today. The only successful path of industrial relations is this government's path, the path that has seen almost 40 per cent of all workers under federal awards now being involved in enterprise agreements, at a galloping 1,600 agreements already made and dozens more being made every week. That is protection for those workers and for the companies in which they are involved. At the same time, it is all being negotiated within the safety net of the award system so that everyone can embrace these agreements knowing that they will not be worse off at the end of the day. I conclude by saying that, from 31 March, when Ol.lr legislation enacted by this parliament late last year becomes law, it will be available to unionists and non-unionists alike. The Victorian experiment will then be consigned to the dustbin of history. Australia be much the better for it. Community Grants",78
76,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to the memo written by Ms Kaye Dal Bon, assistant secretary of the sport and recreation branch, who was in charge of the program on or about 5 November 1992-which incidentally, as the minister would know, was after the audit of the program had begunexpressing concern that the department would be 'vulnerable' in relation to the exercise of its responsibilities under this program and suggesting possible action to 'copper bottom' the d.epartment. Were shoddy administrative practIces sanctioned on high, as claimed by Ms Dal Bon? Further, why was no action taken by the minister's department to properly document decisions made under the program, despite Ms Dal Bon's warning that documentation was inadequate, both within the department and the minister's office?",79
77,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Welcome back. Last night the shadow minister and I attended the ABC sports awards. I hope that when he returned he reported some of the proceedings to the Liberal Party room: 'One of the highlights of in the night was one of the comedians out there performing. He was talking about a group called the Buffalo Bills. He said, 'The poor Buffalo Bills. They have lost four Superbowls in a row. One more loss and they'll have to change their name to the Liberal Party'.",79
78,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This has nothing to do with the question. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The performances of comedians at functions outside of this place have nothing to do with the question. The question was to do with the minister's responsibility. I ask you to direct her to get back to the question.",79
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question.,79
80,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope those opposite heard what I just said: the comedian said, 'One more failure and they'll have to change their name to the Liberal Party'. Over the last few will months, 1I have answered numerous questions-over 36 questions-in this parliament. There have been MPIs and censure motions. On not one occasion has it ever been revealed that I have at any stage misused funds or that there was· any impropriety at all. Those opposite have tried every trick they can. They have put as in newspapers around thi:> nation, trying to get dissatisfied people involved in the sporting community to come forward. They have achieved absolutely nothing. The Auditor-General made further comments today, including reference to the memo. All that is answered in my secretary's response. But the bottom line in aU this is that, from November until now, in this parliament, we have had the same questions over and over again. The reason for that is that there is a policy and a leadership vacuum over there. Out in the broader community there have been policy changes. The economy has improved; summer is over; we have won the cricket; unemployment figures are better. But what are those opposite doing here in the House of Representatives? They are asking the same questions over and over again. They do that because they are totally bereft of leadership and policy. The only policy initiatives we have had so far on this from members of the opposition are their own statements on this matter, which I did read the other day. I would like to go through that again. What is the opposition's policy initiative in relation to the sports facilities? It wants to get a big bag of money and hand it out to every member of parliament to give to every federal electorate in Australia, regardless of what the needs and facilities are. Presumably, those opposite believe the electorate of Vaucluse is the same as that of the western suburbs of Sydney. The shadow minister for sport said: ... it might be appropriate to give a sum of money to every member of the House, for them to distribute within their own electorate ... I wonder what the Auditor-General would say about that. North Korea",79
81,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What is the government's approach to North Korea's continuing non-compliance with its international non-proliferation obligations? Will the government support sanctions if they are necessary?,80
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The matters at stake in the Korean peninsula are of the highest security significance to Australia and to the region. The proliferation of nuclear weapons there would pose a grave threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. The whole talk of the attitude of the North Koreans and their program to date has already had very unsettling effects in the area. It would profoundly complicate Australia's security planning and that of our friends and neighbours. It would also make it much more difficult to uphold the global non-proliferation regime. The danger is high that over time it would encourage the spread of nuclear weapons to presently non-nuclear weapon states elsewhere in Asia. That is why the government is so deeply concerned about the North K9rean nuclear problem and why we have been so active in international efforts to persuade the North Koreans to permit, as they are obliged to do under the non-proliferation treaty, inspections of all their nuclear sites. Those Australian efforts, particularly in the International Atomic Energy Agency-an agency which Australia currently chairs-have been appreciated by our regional neighbours, including President Kim Young-Sam of South Korea, who only recently expressed his thanks to me for our effective actions. Negotiations between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency have been progressing much too slowly. In separate bilateral talks, the United States has made some progress. It has said it is willing to look at the nuclear issue in the context of a broader political dialogue with the DPRK so long as the North allows the restoration of IAEA safeguards and resumes serious dialogue with South Korea. We have been concerned by the North Korean foreign ministry statement on 31 January, threatening to set aside its earlier promise not to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty. Australia remains committed to dialogue and n-gotiation to resolve this problem, but the international community cannot permit continuing North Korean intransigence. If no agreement is reached before the meeting of the IAEA board of governors later this month, the matter is likely to be referred to. the United Nations Security Council. It should be clear that, under those circumstances, Australia would support any actions imposed by the security council, including sanctions. We again urge North Korea to cooperate fully in reaching an agreement which would resolve concerns about its nuclear program, strengthen regional security and give it the economic and other benefits that wi.ll obviously flow from a fuller engagement with the region, with the international community, and particularly with the United States whiCh, at the moment, its actions exclude it from so participating. We expect that North Korea will weigh very seriously the continuing isolation it has imposed upon itself by its attitude and see its way clear to maintain its commitment to have the. scrutiny under the international atomic energy regime of the kind that it has alluded to in the past. Community Grants",80
83,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to - he Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Perhaps in this answer the minister can refer to something that she has tabled here today and refer also to Ms Dal Bon again, who I note was not referred to in the document tabled today. I refer the minister to her constant assertion that the grants under the program were decided on a needs basis, not on the basis of political patronage. I refer her to the note for file dated 3 December 1992 by Mr R. K. Barlin, the senior officer involved in the administration of the program, which states that the minister's office requested that applications for grants be classified electorate. Could the minister please explain why her office made such a request? Could she please explain to the· House why, when the department sought this request in writing, h-r office refused? . Mrs KELLY-I asked the department to put it in electorates because some honourable members actually asked what were the applications in their electorates. Do honourable members not think that they have a Tight to know? At least our people are interested in knowing. The shadow minister obviously cannot read because the minute· from the secretary refers specifically to the minute from Ms Kaye Dal Bon. Retirement Incomes Policy",81
84,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House of the implications of the recently released EPAC analysis of Australia's ageing society for the government's retirement incomes policy?,81
85,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can say to the House that the report to which she refers contains a wealth of useful and significant information and analysis about the consequences of the ageing of the Australian population. I might just give a few brief statistics to give some sense of the dimensions of the phenomenon we are dealing with here. The total population is projected to rise from the current level of around 17 million to somewhere in the range of 24 to 30 million by the middle of the next century-by 2051. There is to be a significant increase in the so called dependency ratio; that is, the ratio of young and old people outside the work force to those who are actually part of the work force. The numbers of those aged 65 and above are projected to rise from 1.9 million at present to over five million. That will be a doubling of the percentage of the population. The population over 80 years is projected to treble. We are looking at a very significant set of developments that will have major implications for levels of expenditure in areas like health and social security. Given that, it is absolutely imperative that by we adopt a long-term approach. This is a policy area where short-term approaches are clearly not at all appropriate. The report makes it very clear that the policy responses need to be set in place now if we are to have a sustainable situation several decades hence. It is not just a matter of retirement incomes per se; it ·is also a question of ensuring that we have an economic structure that facilitates rapid productivity growth and increased levels of national savings if we are to have a basic structure where we can support this higher proportion of dependent people. It will lead to a significantly increased burden in the areas of health and social security. That is a significant issue but it ought to be manageable given the right sort of policy framework being put in place now. Contrary to the claims coming from the opposition, the government has been meeting this challenge. Since the release of this report there have been a bevy of opposition spokespersons On social security. At last count, I think there were three-the honourable member for Berowra and Senators Newman and Patterson from the other place. I feel a bit miffed that, unlike some ormy colleagues, I have a relatively small number of shadow ministers covering my portfolio. I suppose that would clog up the front benches a bit more.",81

I refer to what the co-author of the EPAC report said on 31 January on the AM program about the government's approach to the ageing population. The co-author of the EPAC report said: Australia in many ways has been a path breaker with home and community care, with employee and employer funded superannuation and with early concern about health care costs. I will take that a bit further, focusing on the retil'ement incomes area. Take the much maligned superannuation guarantee charge that the opposition has been so disparaging of. The EPAC report provides some very interesting information and analysis about that issue. The EPAC report stated: The SGC will play an important role, with the projections showing that it might keep government welfare expenditures down to around 8 percent of GDP in 2051 (c.f. 9 percent without SGC). That is a significant impact on the .level of outlays as a consequence of the superannuation guarantee charge; The percentage of the population on age pensions is expected to remain constant, but the average level of pension paid will be significantly lower because of much higher levels of non-pension income. The EPAC report continues: The SGC is expected to increase the aggregate national savings by OS percent or more of GDP year. While only a relatively small amount each year, its cumulative effects would be very significant. In conclusion, the report confirms the basic wisdom of the government's policy approach to retirement incomes and other areas. It is particularly important that we get on top of the long-term unemployment problem because if we do not then the proportion of people with significant superannuation entitlements and significant home ownership will be much less and there will be a number of other consequences which basically underpin the importance of that.

95,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer to the minister's submission to the J-Iouse of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts inquiry.into the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program where she said that no records were made of her consultations with members of parliament and other organisations involving the allocation of grants under this program. Is it a standard practice in the minister's office not to keep records of her consultations or discussions with members of parliament and other organisations involving decisions on the allocation of taxpayers' funds for specific projects or does this policy apply only to the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program?",82
96,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will be aware that the committee asked me a number of questions and I responded in detail to all of those. Today the committee wrote a letter to me which was signed by the deputy chairman, the honourable member for Wide Bay. The letter reads: The Committee is still examining your reply but decided not to call you to give evidence. However it may find that there are some matters that require clarification or that there is a requirement for additional information. If the need arises the Committee will write to you again. Those sorts of questions could be dealt with in the context of the committee. I am very per pleased that the letter was signed by the honourable member· for Wide Bay and also had the support of a National Party member and a Liberal Party member. Education",82
97,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and, Training aware of recent reports of a decline in the number of students seeking entry to university and an increase in the number of students whose preferred choice for post-school education and training is TA,FE? How does this trend fit the government's overall strategy the education and training of young Australians?",83
98,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, not another statement.",83
99,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"J am delighted to inform ,the honourable member for Port Adelaide that this year's enrolments across the whole postschool education and training sector are demonstrating a big win for the policies of this government. The national figures are not yet corriplete",83
100,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You would be aware that ministers are not allowed to announce policy at question time and this sounds to me very much like policy and, consequently, he should not be answering.",83
101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it is a very strange tum of events that has the opposition raising a point of order not to hear about the enrolment of Australian children in education. Those opposite are against sport and now they are against kids in school.",83
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order from either member. The minister is responding to a question seeking information.,83
103,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the right honourable member for New England had been listening, he would have heard that I was about to refer to figures which demonstrate the success of the government's policies, because this week the press defined a national pattern of easing demand for university places from school leavers and increasing demand for TAFE. According to press reports, there are 3,000 fewer university applications from school leavers in New South Wales this year while TAFE enrolments are up by 10,000. In Queensland the preliminary figures show that 22 per cent of year 12 graduates have put TAFE as their first preference-well up on the previous national figure of 16 per cent. In South Australia and the Northern Territory young people are also voting with their feet. Despite 2,000 more people sitting for the HSC, the number of university applications was down by 15 per cent. In Western Australia around 34 per cent of students completing year 12 are now enrolling in TAFE compared for with the 16 per cent national figure and, at the same time, those TAFE enrolments have coincided with a fall in the number of year 12 students seeking university entry. This does not mean that young people are discriminating against the university system. It certainly does not mean that the government holds one sector of the post-school education and training system in greater esteem than the other-far from it. For the past year the government has attempted to correct decades of community misunderstanding over just what the TAFE sector can accomplish. The government, in cooperation with those states which are committed to a proper balance in post-school education, has been selling, and selling hard, through its choices for youth information campaign, one simple message, and that is that when it comes to the sort of education that can provide real skills for real jobs it is a matter of horses for courses. The skills which the university system provides as compared with TAFE are different-not superior, just different. Where those skills are different there is no ground at all for assuming that a university qualification is in any way superior to a TAFE one. ' This government's achievement in microeconomic reform is bearing fruit right across the board. We need to remember that a fundamental part of that strategy is the creation of a Oexible education and training system-one which can deliver the skills that we need to compete in the global economy but, much more importantly, one which can deliver the education and skills that can establish young people on career paths. This means that we need to ensure that our TAFE system is as properly resourced as our universities and it enjoys an equivalent community respect, because that is where the jobs are. The DEET skills vacancy series released yesterday and recorded in today's press points out that that is where the jobs are. Over the last 12 months the series has increased by 50 per cent. The largest increases were in the metal trades, up by 173 per cent; the building trades, up by 127 per cent; and so on. That is why the Commonwealth is paying the states $400 million a year to run their TAFEs. We are committed over and above that to growth of more than $1 billion for the period 1992 to 1996 specifically so that we can expand the national TAFE system. Everything the government can do to ensure equality of access to TAFE and university education is being done and it will continue to be done. The trend towards a better and more even balance between TAFE and university demonstrates that the community has heard and supports the government's message.",83
104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my point of order relates to the point of order of the right honourable member for New England. The answer given by the minister was obviously an answer with important and interesting contemporary information about the switch that is occurring between universities, tertiary institutions and technical and further education. The parliament should not tolerate the kind of outburst by the right honourable member for New EnglandMr Thckey-This is not a point of order.",84

114,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Further to my question yesterday, which the minister failed to answer, consistent with her approach today, as sports minister, did she or did she not check with the environment department on the credentials of any club likely to be engaged in shooting animals accidentally, legally or in any other way?",84
115,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have waited 11 months to get a question from the shadow spokesperson on the environment. I have got two questions and they have both been on sports grants. That indicates pretty clearly the lack of interest the coalition generally has on environment policy. However, I am very pleased that at long last we are getting to focus at least in a small way on the issues of the environment. I just wish the shadow minister would take into consideration her own advice which she gave to the aspiring .Bronwyn Bishop when she said on ABC radio: It's very easy to make glib statements ... It's a lot harder to know those policy areas in depth and make a contribution knowing all the facts. I just wish she would take some notice of her own advice. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this question, from my recollection, is the sixth question the minister has been asked and she has so far not answered one single question and given one single piece of relevant information. I put it to you, Mr Speaker that on this particular occasion the minister, with her prodigious memory, might like to give us some information to answer the question.",84
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The minister will answer the question.,85
117,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answering the question, I was referring to the environmental policies, or the lack thereof, of the opposition. I was referring to advice that the shadow minister has given to her colleague Bronwyn Bishop, and I was hoping she would take that advice herself. In relation to the opposition's environmental policy, or-lack thereof, we have had a number of press releases put out by the shadow , minister over the last month. While her media releases may consistently be very wide of the mark, they do contain a number of statements that hint of possible opposition environmental policy. I would just like to go through some of those. One of the things she referred to is the inclusion of golf courses in the national reserve system-that will go down very well-special licences to allow four-wheel drives",85
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order - ",85
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! A moment ago in next response to certainly one point of order. I gather, another that is about to be made, request was made to the, minister to come to answer the question. I am listening carefully to the minister. I am not sure whether golf courses fit into the question that has been asked, and I would ask her to come to the substance of the question.",85
120,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was just pointing out how irrelevant the opposition is in the development of its environmental policy. The shadow minister's press releases have been irrelevant. She has made press releases in relation to this issue, and her question remains as irrelevant as the press releases she has put out on numerous occasions. Australian Public Service: Workplace Bargaining",85
121,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations advise the House about progress with agency level workplace bargaining in the Australian Public Service?,85
122,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This has been a very good week for workplace bargaining in the Australian Public Service because on Monday we had the first certified agreement-the Defence restructuring agreement-which indicates that now we have a system of industrial relations in this country whereby, by and large, workers wages will be earned in a: sense by developing productive enterprises and through efficiency trade-offs. _What has occurred is that, in the Defence Force, civilian employees-18,500 of themrepresented by 18 different trade unions, sat down and completed an agreement with the Defence Force. The agreement states that over the next two years there will be two wage increases: two per cent immediately and two per cent in December this year. The beauty is that those wage increases - impose no further imposts on the Australian taxpayer. They are paid for by the efficiencies delivered in negotiations over the agreement between the 18,500 workers and the Department of Defence. So the essence of this is that during the two years there can be no further call on and the Department of Defence or on the governa ment for further wage rises through this system. All of the tnoney is already _paid for. In fact, we have a harvesting of the efficiencies that will be gained through the enterprise agreement by the workers, by the Department of Defence, by the government and, by implication, the taxpayer. I want to congratulate the Department of Defence and those 18 trade unions which were involved in this agreement. It is a significant agreement because it is the first in the Australian Public Service. The key unions are the Public Sector Union, the Transport Workers Union and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. Honourable members must recall that we now have a system where, by and large, wage increases will be driven by productivity bargaining. I can remember a time in this country when there were instruments available to the opposition, when it was in government, by means of running a nationaJ productivity case before the Arbitration Commission. During the years 1975 to 1983, not once did members of the coalition, when in government, run a national productivity case; not once did they develop a mechanism whereby workers, rather than just chase inflation in order to raise their wages, could seek a means of developing production and developing wealth out of which they could be paid. Not once did they use that instrument available to them. The beauty now is that we have developed instruments of negotiation and agreement whereby thousands of negotiations can take place daily and yearly inside and outside the Australian public sector so that we can harvest the benefits of efficiency and increased production and so that the Australian work force-particularly, in this case, Australian public servants-can increase their wages and conditions and create a rebate, in effect, for the Australian taxpayer. Community Grants",85
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I again ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories a question supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, which was not answered by the minister, as you well know. Did she or did she not check with the environment department on the credentials of any club likely to be engaged in shooting animals accidentally, legally or otherwise? Will the minister please directly answer the question on this occasion?",86
124,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If they were eligible applicants and they met the criteria they could be funded. Australian National Training Authority,86
125,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Prime Minister tell the House of the progress of the new training authority, the Australian National Training Authority, and advise the House of the government's funding commitmentsto the authority?",86
126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you will know that in the One Nation program I announced that we would increase funding to TAFE over the period 1992-96 by about $1 billion, with a commitment of the Commonwealth to the TAFE systems of the states of about $1 billion-that is $750 million extra from the time of the One Nation statement. This is having an effect and, as a consequence of it, we are able successfully to. produce, for the first time ever, an Australian National Training Authority, an Australian national organisation in technical and further education. No longer were we prepared to leave aside this area of education where so many secondary students were unable to qualify for a tertiary entrance and had gone back out into the work force untrained. We were able to pick them up in a modern vocational education system. I have since paid tribute to the now Minister for Finance, when he was Minister. for Employment, Education and Training, for pushing that change home. As a consequence, we now have a national authority and we have a change in that emphasis. It goes to the government's whole approach to education. In 1983, three children in 10 completed secondary school. That figure is now over eight children in 10, as a result of the government's efforts and participation in secondary schooling in this country. Since the middle 1980s we have added the equivalent of about 16 or 17 universities the size of Sydney University to the system. We have taken about 40 per cent of the output of those schools into tertiary education and we have noW built up in vocational education the kind of system that will pick up kids who have got an application in in parts of the economy where they are likely to get jobs with training which is appropriate to it. It is a revolution education: three in 10 to over eight in 10; 40 per cent streamed through tertiary institutions; and the balance, mainly working-class kids, in TAFE institutions. A few moments ago the minister, Mr Free, made very clear the change in New South Wales-3,000 fewer university applications but a pick-up in TAFE enrolments of 10,000. In Queensland, there is a 22 per cent pick-up in year 12 graduates going into TAFE compared with 16 per cent the year before. In South Australia and the Northern Territory, the number of university applications was down 15 per cent on last year as people go looking for work, looking for TAFE spots. A survey has shown that six months after graduation 65 to 70 per cent of TAFE students had jobs compared with 40 to 45 per cent of university students. In other words, for Australia to have a mature education system, we need to build up vocational education. How much is the coalition interested in this? Not one little bit. When the minister tried to give an answer with contemporary information, the right honourable member for New England attempted to gag him. He was a member of the do nothing Fraser Government that was prepared to leave only three kids in 10 completing secondary school. You would think that those opposite would hang their heads in shame. That was the legacy this party hack left to Australian school children. Now, a front bench of 37 people-can you imagine that?-with the dirty 30 on the backbench, more on the front bench than on the back bench, 37 back from the dead, including the right honourable member for New England, have come back to give us old, empty Fraser style parliamentary tactics. Forget the change in education. Forget the good, contemporary news that there is a switch to TAFE from universities. Forget the revolution in education. What do we get? We get a bit of slick parliamentary chatter from one of the famous do nothing ministers of the last 25 years, one of the people who made almost a zero net difference to this country. Thank God Australia changed its government in 1983. Thank God that the children of in this country have a government which is interested in them and prepared to come out at question time and rejoice in the fact that they have better education and job opportunities. But let the parliament take note that the Leader of the Opposition in his weakness has called for the backbench-basically a parliamentary scramble without a modicum of any ideas about policy-to come down and throw a few ch-ap give-a ways from the front bench to stop a minister answering a legitimate question about young Australians. Shame on you and shame on your front. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",86

136,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)-by leave-The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR, is one of the Australian aid program's quiet achievers. The centre commissions and promotes research aimed at improving sustainable agricultural production in developing countries-principally in the Asia-Pacific region. By doing so it contributes to their well-being-particularly benefiting rural areas where most people in developing countries live. By increasing general economic growth amongst many of our neighbours, the centre's research in tum assists Australia's economic growth and its security. ACIAR was set up as a statutory authority in 1982. Its mandate was broadened in 1992, following a highly favourable review of its operations by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade: Some of the many complimentary remarks made about the centre following the tabling of the report included that of committee chairman Senator Chris Schacht, who said, 'In my view ACIAR is one of those good news stories that does not get the coverage in the Australian media that organisations like it should get'. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) described it as a 'lean, professional organisation with an excellent approach to its task'. ACIAR's new mandate is to: commission research into improving agricultural production in developing countries; fund some project-related training, both informal and postgraduate; commission some development of results from its research programs; and administer the Australian government's funding contribution to the international agricultural research centres. Promoting bilateral research collaboration between Australia and developing countries remains ACIAR's primary aim. It mobilises Australian agricultural research expertise to help developing countries help themselves. It achieves this by commissioning research groups in Australian universities, the CSIRO and the state agriculture departments to carry out joint research projects in partnership with their counterparts in developing countries. The commissioned research focuses on high priority problems in developing countries in fields in which Australia has particular scientific and technical competence-and there are many. Research takes place both in Australia and in the partner countries, and it is a feature of ACIAR projects that they are specifically chosen to maximise the benefits to both our developing country partners and Australia. It is sometimes argued that international agricultural assistance simply helps our competitors and reduces markets for Australian agricultural products. In reality the reverse is true. By increasing incomes, it enables people to purchase more, and experience demonstrates that one of the first things they buy more of is food. In Indonesia, for example, as agricultural production increased during the 1980s Australian wheat exports to Indonesia increased by over 200,000 tonnes. ACIAR research helps Australian farmers directly as well as indirectly. It is conservatively estimated, for example, that the international agricultural research to which Australia contributes through ACIAR has increased the earnings of Australian farmers by more than $2 billion over the last two decades, principally through the introduction and use of high yielding varieties of wheat. Australia is rare among aid donor countries in that it shares with most developing countries a similar location in tropical, subtropical or mediterranean latitudes. As a result, Australia's agricultural scientists find themselves working within an extensive and very successful network of agricultural research establishments, dealing more often than not with agricultural problems similar to those of much of the developing world. It is ACIAR's contribution to have given Australia a more effective focus for its research collaboration with developing countries. Research During 11 years of operations ACIAR has commissioned around 240 projects, usually over three-year periods, 170 of which have been completed. It has tackled the critical problem of agricultural land degradation and the associated spoilage of natural resources. The Rio Earth Summit's agenda 21 calls for action to safeguard agricultural production by protecting natural resources and minimising environmental pollution. ACIAR has responded in a number of ways, including mounting a coordinated effort to alleviate the physical problems arising from poor farming practices on hilly lands in the South-East Asian region. The research complements studies to determine how best to introduce suitable technologies to smallholder farmers with little understanding of the need for change. ACIAR has discovered new varieties of Australian. trees and shrubs that will help meet the fuel wood, agroforestry and industrial needs of developing countries. Seven years research to find better adapted trees for China has led to the planting of 17,000 hectares of high performing acacia and eucalypt species and the provision for further plantings of acacias in China's five-year plan. In Indonesia propagation techniques for acacias are now being applied to large-scale forestry. In addition Pakistan, Thailand and Australia, together with many other countries with saltaffected agricultural lands, stand to benefit from the identification of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that can restore some productivity to otherwise useless land. ACIAR has developed environmentally safe, appropriate technologies that have improved the health and productivity of animals owned by smallholder farming communities. In India farmers have had milk production increases of over 10 per cent in dairy cattle and buffalo as a result of the combined effect on their nutrition of giving them nutrient blocks with medication added to control internal parasites. In the Pacific islands scientists have found that goats need almost no medication for internal parasites if they are moved through a rotational grazing system that prevents infection from pastures. Many of the traditional crops of South-East Asia, Africa and the Pacific-such as coconut, banana, sweet potato and cassava-suffer from viral, bacterial and fungal diseases. ACIAR research has developed more productive, disease-free lines of some of these crops. For example, banana varieties with resistance to black sigatoka disease have been identified. This disease is a potential scourge of banana crops worldwide, including those in Australia, and was recently isolated and contained in North Queensland as a direct result of this project. The possession of resistant varieties is a good insurance policy to protect our multi-million dollar banana industry. Mr Nehl-It will open it up to export, of course. MrBILNEY - I have already dealt with that point. When the honourable member for Cowper has a look at my statement, I think he will see the justification for this. Biological control and integrated pest management have been encouraged and progressed through ACIAR's crop protection program. Last year I launched two ACIAR publications on biological control containing some outstanding examples of successful programs to control pests and weeds in Asia, Africa and the Pacific· Islands. In addition, researchers have compiled a large body of data on fruit flies in Malaysia, Thailand and four Pacific countries that will lead to better control of fruit flies and improved quarantine protection. Associated with this is the development of bait spraying for pre-harvest control of fruit flies in orchards and field crops. When cover sprays are used for control they often kill pollinating bees and other beneficial insects, but bait spraying uses a tiny quantity of insecticide mixed with a substance such as hydrolysed yeast that attracts only fruit flies. The method is not only safer but cheaper in materials and labour. The investment of $800,000 in this projectis projected to yield an overall benefit to Australia of $176 million through local application. That is a 220: 1 return on our investment. Mr Andrew-Widely used in South Australia.",88
137,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"A good point was just made by the honourable member for Wakefield about my home state, which is of course free from fruit fly-and long may it remain so. ACIAR has become a major player in the arena of safe post-harvest handling, processing, storage, transport and marketing of both durable and perishable foods in the humid tropics. Much of the increase in food production in Asia over recent decades can be attributed to early maturing varieties which enable two crops per year to be harvested instead of one. This has presented producers with the challenge of storing grains during the wet season with high humidity and heightened pest activity. The post-harvest program works closely with national, regional and international agencies concerned with food handling. Smaller-scale operators and farmer cooperatives are specifically targeted in the program's current work on outdoor storage and, grain drying, with high potential to deliver the benefits of new technology to the poorer agricultural sector. Concern world wide about dwindling fisheries resources is mirrored in the ACIAR fisheries program. Ongoing studies in countries of the Indo-Pacific have given a clearer understanding of the effects of commercial bait-fishing on traditional fishing grounds and provided a better basis for effective comanagement arrangements between traditional owners and industry. A current study of the seasonal abundance and distribution of billfish, such as marlin and sailfish, will assist Pacific countries to preserve the habitats and regulate the catch of these fish, which are of particular interest to game fishermen. In association with its applied research, ACIAR funds economic studies to ensure that new technologies are implemented and that national agricultural policies are appropriate for the promotion of economic development. One research project devised a computer model of the Philippines' economy that focuses on interactions between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy. Application of the model revealed that one-third of economic growth in the Philippines over recent decades resulted from technological advances in agriculture and that the economic gains primarily benefited lower-income groups. This study is the most comprehensive of its kind to date and is likely to have international influence in promoting agricultural research as a means of achieving both economic growth and poverty alleviation. Training Part of ACIAR's mission is to enhance the research capacity of institutions in developing countries. This· is achieved by visits from Australian scientists who spend time with their colleagues in their home country institutions, by the conduct of project related training courses both overseas and in Australia, and by the awarding of ACIAR fellowships for project related postgraduate training in Australia. The effects of these activities are becoming evident as ACIAR's programs mature and diversify in its 25 or so partner countries. There is a true sense of international partnership, and evidence of the increasing confidence of partner country scientists is reflected in the increasing number of authors from South-East Asia in the published scientific literature. Furthermore, countries that once looked to Australia for expertise are now becoming sources of information to assist their neighbours. For instance, a recent forestry research initiative in Laos went ahead because the Thai partners bridged the cultural and language gap and conducted training in Thailand. ACIAR, with funding assistance from the Crawford fund for international agricultural research, has staged a number of master classes associated with specific projects to give advanced training to developing country scientists. One on molecular genetics, held at Monash University, involved 14 senior researchers from seven countries; another on plant virology, held in Thailand, attracted 20 scientists from nine countries. The response from the participants has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. International standing In February 1992, ACIAR took over responsibility for administering Australia's contribution to the international agricultural research centres, which was previously undertaken by AIDAB. ACIAR has reinstated the special purpose grants program, which is designed to aid research collaboration of the international centres with Australian and developing country institutions. ACIAR's familiarity with the operations of the international centres make it well placed to administer Australia's commitment to them, both in terms of development assistance and enlightened self-interest. . ACIAR is now held in high regard internationally and frequently cited as a model of excellence for others to follow in institutional planning. Recently the centre acted as implementing agency for the establishment of the new Centre for International Forestry Research, which is now up and running in Bogor, Indonesia. ACIAR research coordinators regularly undertake short-term advisory consultans:ies for other international bodies, such as FAD and the World Bank. In tabling, and speaking to, the 1992-93 annual report of the centre, I hope I have demonstrated to honourable members, including the honourable member for Cowper, that ACIAR continues to be a 'quiet achiever' among Australia's successful international initiatives. Mr Nehl-Hear, hear!",90
138,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I acknowledge the interjection of the honourable member. Like AIOAB, the other aid agency within the development cooperation portfolio, ACIAR is staffed by dedicated men and women who have a commitment to excellence, which ought to be a matter of pride to all Australians as it is to me. I conclude with an observation from one of the centre's overseas partners, the Agricultural University of Malaysia. When ACIAR was reviewed in 1991, Professor Syed, a deputy vice-chancellor of that university, made a submission to the review committee. He praised ACIAR for helping to advance agriculture in the tropical and developing nations and pointed to manifold benefits arising from joint research. But, while Malaysia appreciated the solutions arising from the research, Professor Syed said that the enhancement of expertise amongst project scientists was of equal significance. He believed that involvement in ACIAR projects was one of the few means by which local scientists could gain access to foreign expertise and participate in technology transfer. In the end, that is what ACIAR exists for-to help other countries help themselves. I believe that it does so out of all proportion to its cost. I commend the report to the House.  will speak very briefly. I fully endorse the commendation of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr BiIney)of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research as representing a solid and, as he said, quiet achievement of the Australian aid program. ACIAR was originally established for a 12-year period with a sunset clause to review its performance in its 10th year. Following the review of its operations by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the organisation was placed on a permanent footing and, as I understand it, its mandate was broadened. The Australian development cooperation effort has thereby been reshaped to take greater advantage of Australia's agricultural research expertise. The centre is chiefly oriented to mobilising and expanding Australia's research capacity to assist developing countries in agriculture and related areas. The centre does not conduct research itself but contracts research work to Australian institutions. Importantly, its mandate now includes the administration of Australia's contribution under· the aid program to the network of 18 international agricultural research centres which are coordinated through the consultative group on international agricultural research chaired by the World Bank. The fact that ACIAR now has responsibility for managing Australia's contribution to these international research centres should help to ensure that Australia's input to the work of these other institutes overseas can draw directly on the most relevant Australian expertise in the agricultural field. It should also enhance the centre's own contacts with other research institutes and hence enlighten Australia's own program of domestic research. Agricultural research plays an important role in economic development and, in view of this role, the opposition is supportive not of ACIAR but also of Australia's funding of the consultative group on international agricultural research as managed by ACIAR. I would note, however, that the relative shares of the aid budget allocated to the centre and, through it, to the international research institutes, is an issue which will require careful monitoring to ensure that the interests of both are taken properly into account in a budget context. . I should point out that, through collaboration with other international agricultural research centres, ACIAR has contributed importantly to agricultural research work overseas. That ought to be obvious by the remarks of the minister and indeed by the report itself. Some of this research is oriented to countries-for example, in west Africa and South America-which otherwise tend to lie outside the current focal point of Australian cooperation development programs. While ACIAR's own efforts are focused on development in our neighbouring Asia-Pacific region-I understand that and support it-it is important, however, to note that this wider global dimension can also be important to us. I would also note on that point that the diversity of Australia's domestic agricultural base makes the work of many of these international research centres of direct relevance to our own agricultural production. The minister has already pointed out that ACIAR is clearly at the forefront of research into sustainable development issues as applied to agriculture. In conclusion I express the hope that ACIAR's research can similarly set an example in addressing the role of women in development, particularly as this is affected by changes to traditional agricultural practices which arise through the implementation of ongoing agricultural research. NA Economy",91
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) proposing that a definity matter of public only importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The risks to the economic recovery caused by Australia's balance of payments problems. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",92
140,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mayo) (3.18 p.m.)Firstly, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is not here for this discussion. In the time that I have occupied the position of shadow Treasurer-nine months or so-there has been only one occasion when the Treasurer, that is, the present Treasurer or his predeforeign cessor, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), has actually been prepared to debate economic policy in this chamber. The former Treasurer spoke in this House when he delivered his budget-and no other occasion. Other than in question time, neither the present Treasurer nor his predecessor has debated economic policy in this House. On one occasion only has a Treasurer been prepared to take part in a discussion of a matter of public importance. This is symbolic of the standards of government and the lack of respect for government which is a hallmark of the Keating government. Although his predecessor had no substantial experience of the House of Representatives-I think he had three years-before he became the Prime Minister of this country, he showed much greater respect for this chamber and the democratic institution of parliament than the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has been here since 1969. So it is a matter of contempt for democracy that Labor ministers, under the Keating government, simply have refused to participate in matters of public importance. Mr Atkinson-Ah, here he is.",93
141,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At long last, after making an issue of it, we see the Treasurer finally emerge and, with the greatest of optimism, we hope that in those circumstances the Treasurer will be prepared to participate in debate. If does, it will be only the second time in a year's worth of parliamentary sittings that has happened. There is a cartoon in today's Australian newspaper, an organ I do not always agree with, about the Australian economy. It shows a family motor vehicle, a hatchback, with a picnic beside it. The picnic basket has written on it the words 'the economy'. There is a nice little meal set out on a rug and a happy little family, which is the Keating family. The Prime Minister is standing with his family, looking out into the bush. In the bush there is, not surprisingly, a feral pig. That very large pig, one of those Danish pigs that Danpork specialises iri, has in its arms a grandmother. The pig has written on its side the words 'foreign debt'. Does the Treasurer remember debt? It is a bit of a problem under Labor. It has grown year by year. ",93
142,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You are wallowing in it.,93
143,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the honourable member for Kooyong says, it is a swine of a problem and, as his friend the honourable member for Bennelong says, the government is wallowing in it. This feral pig has written on its side the words 'foreign debt'. The Prime Minister is saying to his family, 'Okay, so grandma got taken by a feral pig--=-=Iet's try to not have it spoil our whole day'. That just about sums up the whole issue of Labor's management of the Australian economy. During the cyclical upturn in the economy, there have been some positive economic figures. We have been, I think quite appropriately, welcoming good news as good news has come forward. People in this country are desperate for the economy to get out of the hole that Labor and in particular the Prime Minister have dug for Australia. Any sign of a recovery is something they welcome. The degree of enthusiasm for recovery is reflected in the very substantial increase in consumer confidence. The problem is that in the euphoria in the recovery and the euphoria aided and abetted by boasting from the Labor Party, as if it has anything to do with it-not that the public he would believe that-the government is deliberately hiding the underlying problems and that weaknesses of our economy. Yesterday's balance of payments figures, however, sent a warning shot across the bows of the country and brought the government back to earth that the fundamental structural problems that reside in our economy are still there. One of the characteristics of the nearly 11 years of Labor federal government's economic management has been the boom-bust cycle. When Labor came into power, the economy was recovering. It had turned that recovery into a massive boom, which was followed by a substantial downturn in 1986. That was the time of the banana republic statement that everybody would remember. That was followed by the enormous boom of the late 1980s and that, in tum, was followed by the recession deliberately engineered by the Prime Minister of this country. Everybody in Australia has good reason to believe that, despite all the enthusiastic rhetoric of the government, we still run a very real risk of turning this recovery into a boom and then a bust. The great challenge for this country-and even the government could make a positive contribution to meeting this challenge, instead of making challenges for us more difficult-is to ensure that this recovery lasts and does not end up in tears like the one did. But yesterday'S balance of payments figures remind us of why the present Prime Minister, the former Treasurer, put the country into recession. It was done deliberately because from 1988 to 1989 we developed a balance of payments crisis and an associated foreign debt crisis. Balance of payments deficits, if we go back through the records, in 1988-89 eventually blew out at their peak to a bit over $2 billion a month. Now remember that figure because for December our balance of payments deficit was $l.7 billion or $l.76 billion, sometimes reported in the media as being nearly $l.8 billion for that month. The fact is that it is not falling far short of the record deficits that were reached during the late 1980s which led to the now Prime Mif1ister, supported by the existing Treasurer, shoving up interest rates and plunging this country into the worse recession it has had for 60 years. A million people went out of work and most of those people are not back in work again, an enormous number of small businesses and even larger businesses collapsed and massive pain was imposed on this country because the government had allowed the balance of payments and foreign debt, positions to get totally out of control in the late 1980s. The risk is-and let us hope it does not happen-that we will see a repeat of that cycle. Yesterday'S figures were for just one month and it would be unwise and foolhardy to draw hard and fast conclusions from just one month's figures. Next month's figures, let us hope and pray, will be very much better. The Treasurer looked at me wryly and I assume by .that he means that he does not expect them to be better. As a matter of fact, I do think they might be better-I hope they are. But when we look at the government's rhetoric, how sincere is it about the risks and concerns that exist in Treasury, the Reserve Bank and amongst private sector economists? To what extent is the Labor Party levelling with the Australian people? Remember when the Prime Minister became the Prime Minister . in December 1991, he held a press conference last and promised a whole lot of things. Of course, those promises were all tom up and destroyed. But one of the things he promised was-and I will use the phrase he used- 'I will not gild the lily'. Of course, he has done nothing but gild the lily ever since. We had the present Treasurer, who has been the Treasurer before at one stage-he has beaten his 18 days already; that was his previous record as Treasurer-say that our economic statistics are the best for 30 years. That got a good run in the media. That was part and parcel of the government talking up the economy, but creating unrealistic expectations and avoiding giving people the warnings that they deserve. Back in 1988, just before he plunged the country into recession, the now Prime Minister said, 'Australia has never really had a balance of growth this good'. On economic reform he said in 1988, 'Frankly, we are at the point where there is nothing left to reform' .. He was saying that all the reform was finished in 1988. In 1990 he said, 'In three years time there will be no government debt, domestic or external'. That is what he promised in three years time. He also said in 1990, 'That is my expectation that we will stabilise the debt at the end of this current term. We will get enough net exports to take the current account to the debt stabilisation point'. That is what he said in 1990 and, of course, the current account deficit remained at very high levels and foreign debt just continued to accumulate. So do not believe a word the governme,nt says. Do not believe anything it says. For heaven's sake-and I think Australians must do this-take a more sanguine and balanced look at the whole process of economic management. The definition of recovery will be whether jobs are created and, in particular-to quote the Prime Minister's words-'Whether the rate of unemployment actually comes down'. In the revised forecast announced by the Treasurer a couple of days ago, he forecast that unemployment would remain at its current unacceptable level for the rest of this financial year. So, for all the talk of a recovof ery-and where the statistics show that, we warmly welcome it-at the end of the day the unemployment rate is not going to come down. That rate tells us the percentage of people who want jobs but who are not able to get them. For this country to have a 10.7 per cent unemployment rate and to expect that unemployment rate to remain at that level for the rest of this financial year when countries like the United States have an unemployment rate a little more than half that rate is a national disgrace. Even with a recovery, the govetnment cannot get unemployment down. We have a cyclical upturn in the economy and-God forbid-if we did not, what a shocking circumstance that would be. That u-turn has been brought on by a couple of !hmgs. The inevitability of the economic cycle IS that when any economy goes into recession it will inevitably make some sort of cyclical re-overy. That has always happened. We are gomg through that process. Some of the state governments have done a magnificent job rebuilding confidence in their states. If we go around Victoria and talk to small businesses an- business people generally, we can tell that theIr optimism about their state has risen sky high because of the change of state government. Exactly the same phenomenon is being experienced in Perth and South Australia. So we have those advantages, which the government should be capitalising on, not undermining with tax increases. There is an upturn in the American economy-the biggest economy in the world. There is an upturn in the British economy and there is very strong growth in countries in our region, which is of special importance. Yet, despite all of those advantages, the Labor government in Canberra is doing its best, through its tax and spend policies and through its almost manic determination to tum its back on labour market and micro-economic reform, to keep our recovery this time around at about the slowest rate it has been in living memory. The tragedy of it is that we have a slow recovery and already the balance of payments deficit is starting to blowout. We have a slow recovery off a massive base of foreign debt. We have a slow recovery with 10.7 per cent the work force still unemployed and we are already running the risk of a balance of payments crisis. In other words, from a slow recovery-slow by historic standards-held back by the Labor Party's tax and spend policies, in this cycle we are already running the risk of a balance of payments crisis and a return to the policies of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The government has to make changes to economic policy. It has to increase savings by working much harder on fiscal policy and reducing spending. It has to provide tax incentives for people to save instead of penalising savings. It has to start doing something about labour market reform and micro-economic reform. If it does not do those things then, whatever the statistics show, the unemployed, the people who really matter in this argument, will not get the jobs they deserve. (TIme expired)",93
144,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting to hear the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), say that the opposition would welcome good news. I must say it took the opposition an awfully long time to welcome any good news. Mr Downer-I have.",95
145,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member most certainly has not. Mr Downer-I just tell the truth, unlike the Labor Party, which is gilding the lily.",96
146,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How come the honourable member said on 18 November, 2112 months ago, that 'the recovery is not strong enough to create jobs'? The honourable member said that Mr Dawkins's claims about the strength of the cyclical upturn in the economy. are 'irresponsible exaggerations'. Some 2 1/z months ago the opposition's economic spokesman was trying to tell the rest of Australia that there was no economic recovery that would create any jobs. That was the· opposition's line all through 1993 as the economy was picking up. At the end of 1992 the .Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) told the nation that we were headed for a double dip-that is, having had some growth in the economy after the recession, we were going to go back into recession. That was the opposition's official policy taken to the people of Australia in the election campaign. None of that was anything like the truth. The reality is that we have strong recovery or substantial recovery-I do not want to overstate it-through the last 12 months. We have had growth of the economy in Australia of over three per cent-just about the fastest rate of growth of not just one or two countries but any country in the Western world. . Certainly, New Zealand, which finally produced its September quarter figures the other day, showed growth of just over four per cent over the 12 months to September, but that was after years of running far below us in terms of economic growth. In the September quarter of 1992, which was the base for that 12 months growth, New Zealand's GDP declined by 1.2 per cent; so that made it rather special. Nevertheless, it is good to see New Zealand getting on to a substantial growth path, but bear in mind that our growth is as good as any other in the Western world. The honourable member for Mayo referred to the United States and the United Kingdom. The United States is doing about the same as us; the United Kingdom is certainly not doing anywhere near as well; and the whole of Europe is not doing anywhere near as well. Japan and Germany-those enormous engines of economic growth in the postwar era-are not doing anywhere near as well as us at present because they are in recession or, in the case of Germany, just coming out of it. Our performance in the last 12 months compared with the rest of the world and certainly with the rest of the developed industrialised world has been commendable. We certainly want to see not just one year of growth at three per cent but many years of growth at that rate and stronger so that we can create jobs-and we are creating jobs. Although the honourable member for Mayo was saying 2112 months ago that the recovery was not strong enough to create any jobsMr Downer-No, I didn't say that-to reduce unemployment.",96
147,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Mayo said that. His press release was entitled, 'Recovery not strong enough to create jobs'. Mr Downer-That's right.",96
148,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member had says that the economy is not strong enough to create jobs. Employment has actually increased by 116,000 in the last 12 months. It fell for a couple of months, but in the last four months it has grown by 123,000. We have seen strong employment growth in the last four months, but the honourable member for Mayo keeps saying, 'Recovery is not strong enough to create jobs' . Those opposite did not want to recognise recovery until it was absolutely staring them in the face so starkly that no-one could credibly deny it. Then they said, 'Oh, well, of course, yes, now there is cyclical recovery and that's what you would expect after a recession'. When they finally had to acknowledge that there was a substantial recovery, they said, 'Oh, well, it is a cyclical recovery and that's what you would expect'. They did not acknowledge in any way that it was one of the strongest, if not the strongest, recoveries in the Western world. They did not acknowledge that it was creating jobs until it was absolutely undeniable. Now they are on to this scenario about boom and bust. I can understand the preoccupation of those opposite with the initials BB-boom and bust and the Bronwyn Bishop thing. It is in their minds; they are all obsessed by it. But the boom and bust scenario that they are now trying to paint sits very oddly with the argument that the shadow Treasurer was running that this is not a strong recovery. He wants to have it every possible which way-'We are not recovering'; then 'We are recovering'; and then 'It will 'be boom and bust but, hell, it is not a very strong recovery'. How does all that make any economic sense? Frankly, it is just a lot of economic gibberish. This recovery is strong enough to create jobs and is creating jobs. It is going to get stronger. We have undoubtedly created the basis not just for a flash in the pan growth for sustained growth. The honourable member for Mayo misquoted me before-it was perhaps not entirely his fault because the press did as well-as saying, 'We had the best economic prospects in 30 years'. What I said was that we had the best economic fundamentals in 30 years. Mr Downer-So we don't have the best prospects.",96
149,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The prospects are very good, but we have the best economic fundamentals in 30 years. That is why we can have confidence that we will have not just a flash in the pan recovery of a cyclical nature, which will run into an inflationary burst and be stumped out before we have made much inroads against unemployment, but substantial recovety-because this is a recovery based on strength. This is a recovery based on the fact that government has addressed the fundamentals. It has made the basic changes which give us the basis for growth not just of three per cent over the last 12 months but in the order of four per cent in the near future and, if we can sustain it, for years thereafter, provided not get knocked askew by something which is not in any foreseeable scenario but which can always happen through some world development. Certainly the world economic prospects will assist us in the future. As we see them now, the OECD forecasts are for stronger growth in 1994 than occurred in 1993 and even stronger growth in 1995. The rest of the world is picking up and that will certainly assist us to grow. I come back to the fundamentals. The fundamentals are enormously strong because we have growth based on low inflation. When Labor came into office in 1983, we found that we had double digit unemployment. We also had double digit inflation. Both were over 10 per cent. We now certainly have high unemployment, and we are very concerned to see it come down, but we do not have anything like double digit inflation. Because we addressed the policies to bring about low inflation qnd went through the economic boom without a wages blow-out or an inflation blow-out, we have been able to build a low but inflation mentality in this nation. Inflationary expectations are at extraordinarily low levels by our historic standards. According to the recent NAB survey, 80 per cent of businesses believe that our inflation rate will not go over four per cent for the rest of the century. That just shows that the business community is saying, 'Yes, this government does have credible anti-inflation policies. It is concerned to keep us a low inflation country and we are therefore going to achieve relatively low inflation'. That is enormously important and that is coming after a year or so of very low inflation. The expectations are that we will keep that. The more we keep it, the more the expectations will be that we will keep it. We have low inflation along with improved international competitiveness. Against other countries, certainly because o(depreciation of the the Australian dollar but also because of reductions in our relative unit labour costs, we have improved our competitiveness by over 20 per cent in the last three years. That is a very important base from which our exporters can take off. Exports are really going very we do well in the areas of manufactures and services. We are currently dealing with a situationthis is relevant to the balance of payments issue-of very low commodity prices. Commodity prices are at dreadful levels. Despite that, we have the current accoiJnt deficit as a proportion of GDP of around four per cent. That is despite extraordinarily poor commodity prices. At the peak of the deficit as a proportion of GDP in the 1980s, it was six per cent. It is certainly much less than it was at previous times, despite the fact that we are wearing these very poor economic commodity prices. Mr Downer-But it is rising.",97
150,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not rising. The opposition spokesman says, 'But it is rising'. Of course he grabs that one month, which to him is heaven sent. He thinks, 'Isn't it terrific to have this figure of almost $2 billion that I can berate the government with?'. With his hand on his heart he says, 'Gee, we really hope it comes in a lot lower next time', while thinking to himself, 'I hope it's nota low one next time. That is really going to knock me out of the ring. I'm going to look really stupid'. Mr Downer-We don't sink that low.",98
151,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Not half. The reality is that the opposition spokesman does not want to recognise or acknowledge in any way that, in the six months to December, the actual level of the current account deficit in money terms was less than it was in- the same six months of the previous year. We have a reduced current account deficit in the first six months and he says, 'This is a terrible situation. Look at this month of December. Doesn't that mean we've got this terrible balance of payments problem to deal with?'. Of course we have to be concerned about the current .account deficit. Of course it is something that needs to be continuously addressed. We are addressing it in absolutely appropriate ways. The reality is that the markets understand that. The markets took it in their stride yesterjust day. The shadow Treasurer was in this place saying what a disaster and a calamity it was. The markets looked at it, had a temporary blip and went on as though nothing had happened-because they looked at the sixmonth figures. They can see that the government is addressing this issue in such a way that we are making progress and will continue to make progress. Because the prospects for exports are good, because we are competitive, because our inflation rate is low, because of the export mentality in the nation and because of increased productivity, we are driving exports of manufactured goods in a way like this country has never seen. We have growth of 17 per cent per annum, enormous rates of growth and growth of services in tourism. This is the kind of thing that could never happen under previous governments. This government, because of the fundamental changes it has made, is driving these improvements. The opposition spokesman says, 'No improvements to the labour market'. Where has he been? Have a look at the rate of wage growth. Wage growth is at extremely low levels in nominal terms, but real wages are increasing because we have even lower inflation and have had productivity growing at about 2'12 per cent over the last 12 months. We have wages which are based on productivity. The whole wages system is now geared very heavily in that direction. The result is that we have wages being able to be increased without being inflationary. This is a sort of sea change in Australian industrial relations, and this mob sitting opposite are saying, 'Isn't it terrible, this government will not address labour market reform'. They just do not want to recognise what is going on out there. Both the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) were making those points at question time-and they just go on as though it is not happening. It is happening, believe it: Open your eyes and see that it is happening. With all that, the prospects of boom and bust that those opposite are railing about are very much in their imagination. We are not on the same kind of economic cycle which we have been on in the past. We are starting with low inflation and we are growing with low inflation. We have the fundamentals there for a tremendous increase in business investment. Business investment, much to their regret, is picking up. Business investment, as it picks up, will give further impetus to growth and increase our productive capacity and our prospects for improved productivity. So at the moment this nation is poised for a very sustained period of strong economic and employment growth. With that strong employment growth will come a capacity to reduce unemployment. The balance of payments, in my view, will not be a constraint as long as we continue to bear down on the appropriate policies to address it. As I said yesterday, those appropriate policies are that we have to continue to improve our competitiveness and our efficiency. We are pursuing micro-econ?mic ref0':'ll' It is a nonsense to say that that IS not part of the governmenes agenda. We are the ones who introduced the whole program of microeconomic reform and we will continue to pursue it. . We have said that we will pursue the process of increasing national savings. We commissioned the FitzGerald report, the major part of which was that the government must reduce the budget deficit. As very much a part of the government's policies, we have a deficit reduction program. We will also be moving to improve private savings. These are the policies which ensure that we can grow without incurring a balance of payments constraint on growth. This nation has a great future as long as we continue to pursue those policies.",98
152,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened with interest to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) painting what I thought was virtually a no holds barred, golden future for Australia in this area. I thought he got a little carried away. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said previously, it is only the second time a Treasurer has spoken in this House in recent years outside of delivering a budget. So perhaps those opposite have not had enough practice at it. If there is one thing this Labor government is good at it is deceiving the Australian people. We saw a classic example of that in the last election campaign where the government pedalled these deliberate mistruths which I believe will come back to haunt it again and again before the next election. In recent weeks we have seen a different example of deception, with the government saying that the recession that it created is 100 per cent over. It is trumpeting the message that everything is rosy, which I believe is premature at this stage. Just as there is this unreserved acceptance that the government thinks is being bedded down in contemporary mythology, along comes a bit of news like yesterday's, with the balance of payments figure of $1.77 billion-up 48 per cent on the previous month of November. As the shadow Treasurer said, it is only one month's figure and we have to be cautious about that. Never-the less, I believe that figure has sent an infusion of sobriety through financial circles in this country, through informed economic commentators in this country and certainly through this parliament. People are having another look at this so-caIled unbridled recovery that we are supposed to be having. Some of the exaggerated euphoria that the government has been peddling and that a compliant press gallery has been printing may be reassessed. Let us look at the present balance of payments figure of $1,800 million in a recent historical context by going back over the monthly figures. In only one month in the last three years has there been a higher figure. It will be to the government's detriment if it ignores this signal. The figure is a very timely reminder of what may be ahead for us if we do get a poorly managed economic recovery which gathers strength as Australia tries to struggle out of the recession that we had to have. Let us reflect on the legacy that this government has given us. I excuse the present Treasurer from it to a large extent; it is mainly the making of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In recent years, this country has been starved of domestic savings. As a result, if we get a recovery from now on, we will have to borrow from overseas which will not help our overseas debt. This country has seen a massive and significant run-down in manufacturing equipment and in the area of primary industry. If there is going to be an upgrade, a lot of it will be imported and, as those imports are sucked in, our balance of trade will blowout. More than anything else, the country needs some sort of explanation from the Treasurer that will give us confidence in how this situation is going to be managed. Interest rates could bob up again and we could move into a boom-bust cycle, as the shadow Treasurer said. The last time we got into this overheated economy, the former Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, was whacking on massive interest rates for record periods and that was supposed to cure the deficit. The deficit is now coming down, things are easing off, and we are possibly moving back into that situation. We all remember the attempts to correct that. We in Australia suffered very dearly from the arrogant incompetence of the then Treasurer who is now Prime Minister. He had a one-dimensional monetary policy, a high interest rate policy, which delivered record bankruptcies, and all the misery that goes with having one million people unemployed. Now we have a Treasurer who says that he is going to deal with these problems by a totally differently method, not by monetary policy but by fiscal policy; that is a 100 per cent reversal. There is no explanation for this reversal. I think it is a movement in the right direction but, in many senses, it is a slap in the face for the Prime Minister that the Treasurer has done a 180 degree tum around in managing this situation. Before we get carried away with growth, we should remember that it is very easy to get growth from a low base such as the one that this government has forced us into. For five or six quarters in a row savings have been faliing. There has been a $4 billion collapse in savings in the past two years alone, before we have seen a flicker of movement in the other direction. The Treasurer spoke in his speech about savings. If he is going to be fair dinkum about savings-and he mentioned the FitzGerald report-I would like to know when the government is going to give some response to that report, because it was quite critical of what the government has been doing in this country in recent years. An explanation is needed there, too. If the Treasurer from now on is going to manage the problems in a fiscal manner, which I believe means changing taxation matters and perhaps cutting government expenditure, we need an explanation because there are lots of things bobbing up on the political horizon now which are going to mean increased government expenditure. The Mabo legislation that has gone through is one example. The Prime Minister himself said that the compensation alone from native title, which has been extinguished since 1975, is going to run into 'at least several hundred million dollars', which is probably code language for 'at least several thousand million dollars'. That is just one aspect of it. The social justice package is to come in during this Autumn session of parliament; the land acquisition fund is to come in; and a regional statement that is to come in is probably going to make the sports grants porkbarrelling of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, (Mrs Kelly) look like a soup kitchen, because this government knows that that is where the marginal seats are if it is going to win the next election. That is going to cost a lot of money if the government is going to do it on a proper basis. The industry statement, which presumably is going to run into money, is yet to come down; an unemployment white paper is to be delivered later this year-and if the government is going to do something more on that, that is going to run into thousands of millions of dollars, which it is already spending now on 'make work' schemes. We are awash with all these types of schemes. Unless we get some explanation, despite the compliant press we have, people out there in the real world are not going to believe this. The prime reason we have low inflation in this country is that the economy is comatose. If the government knock the guts out of it, destroys business and has record bankruptcies-and the Treasurer laughs at the thought of record bankruptcies-we are going to have a comatose economy. Economic management, which has improved in Australia, has largely started to improve because there are coalition or liberal governments in virtually every state and territory of Australia, except for Queensland, for heaven's sake. The government is taking, if you like, a dishonest ride on the back of the states in claiming credit for that. There has been a three-month trend in exports going down in this country. We have just seen sugar, meat, gold, metals and minerals fall by a significant extent when imports are going up, and these trends are not to be ignored. I believe the imperative message for this government is a deficit reduction strategy. That does not mean bringing in a bill and calling it a deficit reduction bill; that means nothing. We have seen that approach with the sports minister endorsing the cover. The deficit was actually going up under that bill. Something more substantial has to be done. We have seen the overseas net debt in this country blowout under this government; from the time of Captain Cook when it was zero to when the government took over when it was $23 billion to its now being blown out to $178 billion, and it is going up. This government has no stomach for micro-economic reform. It has passed the buck on this to the states and examples of this are coming through all the time. The Maritime Union of Australia, for example, is refusing to accept another 60 redundancies at this stage and its members are trying to trade this off by saying that they can improve work practices and save these 60 jobs, admitting that there is all this fat there that this government has not addressed. The waterfront is supposed to be one of their successful reforms. The government has to do much more in this area if we are going to have a sustainable economic recovery. (Time expired)",99
153,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I deal with the subject matter of the matter of public importance, I want to mention that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made the assertion in the course of his opening remarks that the former. Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), had not spoken in this House other than at budget time. Mr Downer-And one other time.",101
154,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Mayo is wrong. He made the assertion that the former Treasurer had not spoken in this House on a previous occasion other than in the course of a budget. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that on 24 November 1993, the former' Treasurer spoke on a matter of public importance, and on 18 November 1993 he also spoke on a matter of public importance. In a sense, I am gratified to see that the forensic capacities and memory of the opposition spokesman do riot go beyond a couple of months. At the end of the former Treasurer's speech on 18 November, addressing directly the opposition spokesman, he said: Let me repeat, in words that the opposition spokesman might just understand when said for'the ' third time ... He then went on to make some points, and he concluded by saying: Does he get it? Has he got it? That is what I said before. That is what I repeat today. Then his time expired. The House of Representatives Weekly Hansard records thb honourable member for Mayo as saying: You are lying; you are always lying. The former Treasurer said: Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Mayo said across the table, 'You are lying; you are always lying'. r require him to withdraw. The Deputy Speaker, you, Mr Jenkins, then said: If the honourable member for Mayo did make those statements by way of interjection, he should withdraw. The honourable member for Mayo then said, 'I withdraw'. The opposition spokesman should not come into this House and suggest that the former Treasurer has not made speeches on the economy when he has done so in matters of public importance and when the opposition spokesman has been in the House and has been forced to withdraw. I move to the substance of the MPI, which is the risk to the economic recovery caused by Australia's balance of payment problems. That is the assertion. Let us now look at the state of the Australian economy and the state of the recovery. This week the Treasurer (Mr WiIIis) released some revised economic forecasts. Let us look at the revised budget forecasts and see how Australia's economy is currently travelling. The gross domestic product forecast has been increased from two per cent to 3 112 per cent. The CPI has been reduced from 3 112 per cent to two per cent. The employment growth figure has been revised from three-quarters of a per cent to one per cent. The unemployment rate remains constant at 10 per cent, but the participation rate increases from 621/4 per cent to 63 per cent. The current account deficit is revised downwards from $18 billion to $17 billion and, as a percentage of GOP, from 4 1/4 per cent to four per cent, which compares with the 198586 figure of 6.2 per cent as an actual age of GOP. They are the revised forecasts. It is the December balance of payments figure which the opposition is asserting runs counter to that recovery. Let us look not just at the forecasts but at the actual state of our economy at the moment. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, I will read into the record some of the economic fundamentals and parameters that are currently in place. Australia is 30 cent more internationally competitive than it was a decade ago. We have the lowest inflation rate for 30 years, sitting under two per cent-not 10 per cent, as it was when we last emerged from a recession, under the opposition, in 1982-83, with double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. Inflationary expectations are effectively at an all-time low. We have the lowest interest rates for 20 years. We have the lowest level of industrial disputation for 30 years. Our productivity has increased substantially. Profit shares are at record high levels. Real unit labour costs are 10 per cent lower than they were a decade ago. In terms of attracting investment, we have reduced the corporate tax rate to 33 per cent-unlike those opposite, who went to the election proposing to increase it. In terms of investment allowance, accelerated depreciation and taxation concessions for investment in R&D, we have a very internationally competitive tax regime in place as an incentive for investment. As well, our debt servicing ratio is the lowest in a decade. That point is not often made. I want to quote something the Treasurer said at a press conference outside Parliament House when he released the forecasts I referred to earlier. I know he is in the House today, but I think it is important that the words are read back to the House for its benefit. The Treasurer said: . . . we have effectively the best conjuncture of economic fundamentals in the last thirty years with inflation expectations being low, with interest rates being the lowest in twenty years, with industrial disputes at very low levels, our competitiveness the best for twenty years and, most importantly of all, tremendous attitudinal change which is enabling us to make the kind of reforms which the nation needs percent- to continue on a progressive path. These things have all been achieved as a result of the economic policies of this government over a lO-year period. They have nothing whatsoever to do with the actions of conservative state governments in the last 12 months or two years. I want to refer to the Treasurer's contributions in question time earlier in the week because I think an important point that the per community needs to understand, and understand well, is that economic recovery is not occurring as a matter of course; it is occurring as a direct result of the government's policy. On Tuesday the Treasurer had this to say: Let us not be shy about this. This is not some historical accident that is occurring. We are in this position because of the efforts we have made as a nation to rejig the whole economy, to make it much more internationally competitive, to be much more efficient and to be able to hold its place in the world, to get exports out there to compete with imports, and to get back on a high growth, low inflation path-something this nation has not enjoyed for 30 years. In a subsequent answer in the same question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said: The Treasurer made two very telling points. One is that this is not a chance recovery. We did not just happen upon this. A quality, low inflation recovery was not something that just happened overnight but was something to which the whole nation had been put as a consequence, he said, of everyone pulling together. That definitely does not include the opposition, which has done everything to stall any growth in confidence. It has watched every good economic number come out to its chagrin and has not in any way participated in or, as a consequence, been party to, that recovery. That is the key political point, and that is what those opposite are doing in respect of the December balance of payinents figure. They bitterly resent the fact that we are recovering in a fundamentally strong way and they will clutch at any straw to try to do damage to that and to Australia's prospects. Let us look not just at the fundamentals but at some of the recent economic indicators. The ANZ bank national savings index rose for the first time since 1991. Building approvals rose 2.4 per cent in December. Demand for skilled workers jumped to the highest rate in three years. In the consumption area, the current price retail trade rose sharply in seasonally adjusted terms in November, which followed strong growth in September and October. Leading indicators in the housing sector have shown continued strength in recent months. The Treasurer has dealt with the employment figures. I have dealt with innation and innationary expectations. As well, recent business expectation surveys-the Business Council of Australia survey, the Yellow Pages small business survey and the December quarter ACCI-Westpac survey-all report large improvements in business expectations. Let us look at the way in which these things have been reported in our newspapers this week The opposition spokesman drew upon a cartoon. I draw upon the front page of the Australian Financial Review. Earlier in the week we saw a headline which read 'An econoIDic high'. In the Australian we saw this headline: 'Economic signs ""the best for 30 years'''. That is what it is all about; that is what those opposite bitterly resent. So far as our balance of payments is concerned, the opposition focused on one month's figures. Let us focus on some fundamentals and go through some of the aspects of our export performance in recent times. Exports have trebled since 1983. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have more than trebled, and they are the fastest growing component of our exports. Exports to South-East Asia have grown by 400 per cent over the last decade. Exports have risen from 14 per cent of GDP in 1982 to 20 per cent of GDP in 1992. Exports of manufactures to east Asia have increased ll-fold, or over 1,200 per cent, over the last decade. And the figures go on. An export increase in real terms of over seven per cent per annum was achieved between 1982-83 and 1992-93. In volume terms over the decade, exports of goods and services increased by nine per cent in 1991-92 and by over five per cent in 199293. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have increased by 16 per cent per annum in volume terms over the last seven years. I will not repeat what the Treasurer has said about the monthly balance of trade figures, both inside and outside the House, but it is often appropriate to note things that are said before figures are released. On Tuesday, before the figure was released, outside this House the Treasurer was asked a question on the current account, to which he responded: Well certainly the current account figures for the first five months of this year have been quite good and we have been running at a bit less than we were last year. As business investment picks up we must expect there would be some impact on imports because business investment is rather import intensive. So as we move through the recovery and as we see business investment picking up, you have that factor coming into play. ,The one month's figures will not stop what is occurring: a strong, substantial, fundamental recovery for which this government can take credit.

158,Mrs SILVIA SM,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"TH (Bass) (4.13 p.m.)After being interrupted last evening, I was saying that the chief executive of the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr David Edwards, agreed that employers could do more. He said: We've always argued that the best strategy with respect to minimising workplace injuries is tion and training of employees and management. The chamber has introduced several programs for employers to help train people. These have helped reduce the number of injuries and deaths. The ACTU's national occupational health and safety coordinator, Ms Renata Musolino, said employers needed to ensure that workplaces were as safe as possible and that workers are properly trained to manage potential danger. She also said: Clearly there are going to be industries where you can't eliminate hazards and where you have to work with hazardous chemicals or to work with electricity or you have to work suspended in the air. You make sure, that you've done everything you can to make the actual work environment as safe as possible arid you train your workers. Whert: employers are falling down, I believe, is in both these areas. solutions Ms Musolino also said: Most employers provided adequate training but many companies, particularly small businesses, neglected their responsibilities. These are responsibilities which we cannot afford to neglect. The training guarantee goes a long way towards addressing these responsibilities. It might be remembered that the training guarantee is not a government tax. It is a threshold that is designed to help employers equip their work force for their own needs and workplace efficiencies. The training guarantee does not force employers. to make their employees undertake certain types of training. It is the sole decision of the 9rganisation to decide its weaknesses and where best to focus its training resources. At its basis, the training guarantee is pro business because it ensures that every organisation contributes' to the skill base of the Australian work force. The training guarantee slots straight in with the concept of the level playing field. It also meaps that the good corporate citizens who train their employees do not have their staff poached by corporate parasites who do not train. This is achieved by the blanket requirements of the training guarantee .. All 'organisations with a payroll over the threshold must train their staff. Last evening, the honourable member for educa- Menzies (Mr Andrews) stated that only two to three percent of big businesses are training their staff. This is simply untrue. This sort of information is totally based on mickey mouse research and nothing m'ore. There is some criticism of the training guarantee because it is seen as government interference in the labour market. Many of those who level this criticism are the first to scream for government help when skill shortages occur. The government is then expected to address those shortages instantly. Such skill shortages are the basis for industrial disputation and unrest. Industrial history shows us that when there is a shortage of skill in certain areas industrial disputes and constant pay claims follow. The government, however, is no longer prepared to help those industries that do not help themselves. This is why the training guarantee is here to stay. If the training guarantee is so good, why is the government promoting the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993 and why do we need to alter the legislation? The answer is simple: to make it better. So what are we doing? This amendment bill enables excess expenditure to be carried forward. The government gave a commitment at the last election that it would allow eXcess training expenditure in one year to be carried forward to the next. The government is honouring that election pledge. This means that if an employer spends more than· his or her obligation under the training guarantee in one year, that obligation will be reduced accordingly in the next. This enables employers to spend money on training when they need it most. Similarly, employers who do not spend the required amount on training in a given year may catch up in the next year. This structural change means that the system is essentially very flexible. These changes address the basic concerns that small business had about the training guarantee. This amendment bill removes the requirement to deduct training subsidies when calculating total training expenditure. It allows businesses to double dip. The purpose of this is to make compliance with the training guarantee simple and to allow for places under apprenticeships and traineeships to expand. The age restrictions on student work experience will be removed. Under the old act, employers could only claim for expenditure incurred on work experience when the student was younger than 21. This bill removes that provision. Employers are now encouraged to open up work experience to any full-time student, including those of mature age. This is an excellent idea. For the purpose of the Training Guarantee Act, it is possible for two or more organisations to be grouped together. Previously under the act, grouping documentation had to be supplied annually. This will now be changed and simplified. Grouping arrangements will now remain in force until they are changed or revoked. It will I)lso be much easier for companies to have access to grouping by using a broader definition within the Corporations Act 1989. The definition of what is eligible training expenditure will be expanded. Employers will now be able to claim any expenditure that is directly attributable to the use of vehicles or equipment for training which were not obtained solely for training purposes. Employers will now be able to make claims for this type of usage on a pro rata basis. . These are the major changes that this bill seeks to make. The basis for these changes is the unequivocal commitment of this government to minimise the costs to businesses associated with compliance with the training guarantee legislation. The training guarantee is a great concept and these amendments make it better. Let me share with the House a couple of actual examples of the training guarantee at work. One such example is found in an article written by Max Newnham in the Age which states: One company that swears by the benefits of training is Simsion Bowles and Associates, a computer systems consulting business that has developed so quickly it made number lOon this year's BRW-Price Waterhouse list of the 100 fastest-growing Australian private companies. Mr Graeme Simsion, who started the business, says the amount of training the business does is a major reason for the successful expansion. The revenue of the business has grown by 1230 per cent from 1988 to 1992 and it has 27 fUll-time employees that is a period of four yearsMr Simsion says most of the companY's,competitors do not do much training. Simsion Bowles, by contrast, has an in-house rule that every consultant must do at least a half day of training a fortnight. The training requirement is about to be extended so all employees, not just consultants, will be doing the same amount of training. Training' is done in in-house seminars and by sending staff to seminars and conferences. Experts come into run the in-house traini-g and to cover topics other than - hose concernmg computers: public speaking, for mstance. Staff are. also aged to do postgraduate c.o-rses m computer sl\bjects and management tram mg. Mr Simsion recognises that, training can be expensive. He estimates that in addition to the direct costs of training, the company forgoes $30,000 a month in revenue as a result ?- the time spent training. However, he regards trammgas an investment rather than a cost and believes the company would have .b-en less successful without its commitment to trammg. The business was started by Mr Simsion as a one-man computer systems consultancy in 1982. In 1986, his partners who had similar computer - kills joined the business. Even when the bus mess consisted of only two or three partners the trio training sessions every fortnight. Prospects for the future look good as Simsion Bowles is competing against international consultancy firms and is starting to win work in Asia. The Company is budgeting for income growth of fifty per cent for the foreseeable future. Mr Simsion says that thanks to the training undertaken by consultants the business has an edge over its competitors. The final example I will use of the value of the training guarantee is short but sharp. This example is of actual information supplied to the Taxation Office. It does not state the name of the actual company, but it does state the value of the training guarantee: This employer ran a business fitting bullbars and towbars to vehicles. As part of the service his employees would travel to the customer to do the installation. When Training Guarantee was introduced this employer was at a loss at first as to what training he could possibly give his staff-his employees had all been with him for many years and they were all expert at fitting towbars and bull bars! However, when he thought a little harder he remembered the many hours his staff spent on the road so he sent them on a defensive driving course. The results were startling! * Great reduction in workcare claims * Reduction in his prem,ium * Reduced costs in repair of vehicles and greater availability of vehicles * Reduction in absenteeism of staff due to great reduction in injuries. The training guarantee will be improved by these amendments. It will be more responsive and flexible to the needs of small business. It will still, however, mean that the Australian work force is skilled and multiskilled to encourrespond to the rapidly changing world economy. I commend these amendments to the House.",105
159,Mr CHARLES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"La Trobe) (4.24 p.m.)This is the third time that I have risen in this House on a Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill, the prior occasions being in 1991 and 1992. I would note, for the benefit of this House and for those out in the broader community who might be interested in this debate, that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) himself does not appear to be interested in the held topic. He certainly is not here to participate in the debate or to listen to views, either from those on his own side of the House or from those of us who represent the opposition. Shame, minister! Where are you? This is an important issue. The bill is just more tinkering at the edges. In 1991 and 1992 we were here debating amendments to the training guarantee. Mr Bruce Scott-It's an annual event.",107
160,Mr CHARLES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"We would have debated it in 1993 but the government ran out of time. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got a. bit busy with Mabo, the republic and all those important things, as. well a stuffed up budget. But, anyway, here we are once again .to amend the poor training guarantee. The government tinkers at the edges. Why on earth does it not give up and put the poor act out of its misery OIlce and for all? The minister, in his second reading speech---.:he is not with us here today-stated: The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. What a lot of rot! It is not there to stimulate anything. It is there as the whip, the club, because that is the way the Australian Labor Party operates. Compulsion is what the Labor Party believes in. It does not try to encourage people. What it does is force people. That is the easy way to do it Not only does it force people; it places responsibility for the system with the Taxation Office, which is exactly what the government has done with family matters. Here we have it for training. We say to industry, 'It's to your benefit to train your employees. Therefore, through this act, we will force you to do the training. If you don't do it, we'U penalise you with a tax'. What a clever way to induce people to do something that is good for them. Honest to goodness, it is like burning down a forest to prevent a fire! 1 tum to the long string of reasons as to why the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act is not working and why it is not meeting its objectives. Firstly, the act does not address training quality. It addresses only quantity-or it attempts to address quantity-through a set of rules, regulations and procedures which are so complex that we have been here three times to amend them. The act does nothing for training quality. 1 would maintain that Australian business, industry and commerce get value out of training if it is specific to their needs and to their requirements; if it helps to lift productivity; if it makes it easier for people to do their jobs more safely, more efficiently and more cost effectively-aU those things-and if it enhances quality of the product or the service supplied by the organisation. But this bill does not address quality; it simply says, 'Thou will train whether you need it or not'. It is like going to a doctor who says, 'I don't think you need any pills but you had better take some'. That is the way it works. The bill has led to some cost cutting in training. That is demonstrably true. The cost cutting that has occurred is due to the cost of record keeping. On the one hand, the record keeping at· some companies has become· so onerous that they found that, in the competitive environment that they were in, they could not continue to spend the same amo.unt on effective grassroots training because they were spending so much more money on record keeping for taxation purposes, because the bill is a taxation bill. There are some questions about the bill's legality in that regard but I will refer to that later in my remarks. The bill adds to industry oncosts. That is demonstrably true. It goes together with payroll tax, workers compensation, long service leave and a great big long list of other statutory requirements thathelp make Australia uncompetitive. We talk frequently in this place about the need for Australian industry to be competitive. We talk about the brave new world, as we come out of recession and as the Australian economy picks up. Boy, do I welcome the fact that the economy is picking up and that, particularly in my state of Victoria, a new confidence is emerging both in the manufacturing sector and the services sector. That is so applaudable. It is so desirable. As the dollar continues to rise, as we continue to promote ourselves and as we say to the rest of the money markets in the world, 'Look, we're doing a good job here, we've got things fairly well under control, the dollar continues to rise', more pressure is placed on those self-made manufacturers and service organisations who are trying to export and address our serious balance of payments problem. But government continues to increase the rules, the regulations and the oncosts. It is the wrong way to go about it. It is the wrong direction altogether. Some companies have reduced their expenditure on training to the 11h per cent of the levy that is required. They never knew before what they were spending on training. The reason for that is simple: the formula required by this bill for companies to keep records is different from that which companies use to keep their normal records for business purposes. No company in its right mind has a cost centre that records the costs of pens and paper that happen to be used in the training exercises separately from the costs of the pens and paper used during the ordinary record keeping, tendering or estimating part of the business operations. The time that individuals spend keeping the records on training now has to be apportioned. Therefore, somehow their wages and their oncosts have to be broken up and aU of this assigned to the cost of training. It is absolutely not normal business or accounting practice, but it must be kept for taxation purposes. Artificially, this bill acts to force companies to spend money to find out how much they are spending on training. Some companies, having found out how much money they. an- spending, have decided that is too much and they have rolled it back to the 1112 per cent required. So they have reduced their effective training. That is not very clever either. Some companies satisfy their requirements under the act by sending their senior executives and middle management to expensive seminars, conferences or sometimes lovely week-long or weekend-long overseas or local junkets under the guise of training. The bill was probably designed to effectively reach the work force. But, for many companies, it is not doing that. We have created a growth industry in Australia with the Training Guarantee Act and part of that growth industry is being well serviced by the companies that promote their seminars and conferences. The prices of some of them are incredible. I have been a speaker at a few, and I cringe at the thought that I am free, that the taxpayers are paying for my time, my travel and my accommodation. The amount that those characters sitting on the benches listening to what I have to say are paying to listen to me is incredible. To spend $1,500 a day or $2,000 a day per person, per seat is an ordinary expense. Mr Bilney-For you, that is still a bargain.",107
161,Mr CHARLES,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs is absolutely right. I am a bargain at any price. Nonetheless, on a more serious note, it is a rip-off and a rort. We have created a rort industry with the Training Guarantee Act. We are laughing about it, but it really is not funny. It is not achieving the objectives of the act. The act should raise the level and quality of real training for real people in real jobs. The honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) in her speech last night and again today gave us examples of companies that have done something about training, and that has been positive to the companies' profit and loss statements and, I assume, their balance sheets .. We all welcome that. All of us want to see more effective vocational education and training in Australia and much more training for our youth; We need to train them effectively in real jobs that really will available out there so that they can compete effectively in the labour market. We need to do something about the horrible and disastrous statistic that over 30 per cent of our young people cannot find jobs. We want that kind of training. But the honourable member for Bass missed the point. It is not this legislation that caused that to occur. For every positive example she can give, I will go out and find her 10 examples of where it has cost companies more money, made them less competitive and, therefore, caused them to shed jobs. That leads to my next point. The bill acts as a disincentive to employment. That is one of the naughtiest of all. Every time by statute in this place we add to the cost of doing business we add to the unemployment queues, whether wittingly or otherwise, and that is a disgrace. Labor governments are not very good at understanding business and the requirements of industry. So what does it do? It imposes bureaucracy, rules and regulations on business to try to achieve a well thought out objective. But there is nothing wrong with the objective. The objective is fine. At issue in this case is how it is put into practice. This. bill is a disaster in putting the desires into real practice. In a recent article in the Australian Financial Review, Professor Judith Sloan, in discussing how we came to get this iniquitous act, stated: In the late 1980s, there was a clear perception in government circles that, by international standards, training expenditure by businesses in Australia was too low. That is probably true. She continued: As part of the strategy to improve Australia's competitiveness in an internationalising economy, while maintaining relatively high real wages, promotion of training was seen as vital. Unfortunately, there was little analysis of the reasons for the relatively low investment in training in Australia. Judith Sloan is right. The government simply reacted on two fronts: first, there was this perception and, second, there was the ACTU document called Australia reconstructed by Laurie Carmichael and company. Laurie be Cannichael's agenda has never really been spelled out, but I will tell honourable members how it goes. All work will be classified by skill requirement. All work is then paid for on the basis of skills that are certified. The Training Guarantee Act fits in with that. So, neatly, we give every person who has a job in the private sector a tag. We say, 'You're certified to this level of these qualifications in this kind of job'. We say, 'You are now allowed to be an ace, A grade, No. 1 mechanic'. The ACTU, through the industrial relations system, is then able, with the awards, to set the wage level for each of these skill classifications. It is very clever, is it not? What happens is that we reconstitute the bureaucracy, shove it into industry by reclassifying people, not according to the job they do but according to their skill level, and pay people according to their skill level, not their productivity or anything else. The ACTU then controls industry. It is not a conspiracy theory; it is real. Judith Sloan went on to talk about the failure to address the real issue. She stated: In particular, the impact of Australia's peculiar wage structure was never tackled head-on as a factor inducing low levels of spending on training. Let us think about that. The award system and our centralised bargaining system, a system of conciliation and arbitration, have meant that because wages and conditions are, set externally-not by the people doing the work or the jobs, because it is a bureaucratic procedurewe have never in industry looked at the real factors why people did not spend money on training. One reason not to spend money on training is why bother training people for capacities which the award system says they will not be able to use? There is not much sense in training a carpenter to put in plumbing and having him certified by the plumbing authorities if in fact the building unions will not let the carpenter do any plumbing workgood old demarcation. I do not think it has gone; it still well and truly exists. In referring to some of the real problems with the act, Judith Sloan went on and said: ... even for large firms whose training expenditures greatly exceed the set proportions, there compliance costs. For srnall and medium businesses, the costs been larger. Moreover, the survey work of Still Mortimer suggests that the levy has not generated a greater commitment to training among these firms. That is another indictment. The government's regional development task force recommended that the levy be suspended. That is a bit of a wimp out; what it should have said was that the levy ,should be scrapped. To suspend it for three years and then forget about it is an easy way for the government to back down without having to eat crow. The green paper on employment raises the issue but it squibs out and says that it will only address the issue some time later in 1994 after the government's evaluation of the effects of the Training Guarantee Act. Amidst all this, perhaps there is some employer out there who has a bit of money or a bit of guts to tackle this issue head on. A barrister-atlaw, Bryan Pape, wrote an article for the journal Taxation in Australia in July 1991. In his conclusion he said: It is contended that the legislation is invalid for three reasons. Firstly, it is simply too wide-it is repugnant to the working of sec. 51 of the Constitution; it renders the other paragraphs of sec. 51 nugatory and would potentially convert the federation into a unitary system of government. So he says the legislation is invalid. He further concludes: Secondly, the legislation purports to regulate conduct not to raise revenue. And, thirdly, the so-called tax is in truth a penalty, so as to compel or guarantee the observance of a law beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth.  tutional, but nobody has yet challenged it in the High Court-that takes several years anyway. They are interesting observations. Certainly, it seems to me it is true that if people do not do the training required under the act they therefore pay the levy. It is in fact in the way of a penalty; it is not a tax. It is a penalty because everyone does not pay it. Our industrial relations system, our archaic award system, still pays employees on the are basis of what they do, not how well they do it. This training guarantee levy continues to have enforce that procedure, which acts to the and detriment of improving productivity in Australian companies. Altogether, the act is a mess. The tinkering at the edges makes it a little less onerous,but that is about all. It was never a sensible proposition. But on this side of the House, while we oppose the act, we said that we would take time to consider it. We have and it should be scrapped. (Time expired)",109
162,Mr LES SCOTT,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The amendments in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993 are very important. They show the government's ongoing commitment to having a highly trained work force and the flexibility this government is prepared to adopt in making a lot of our proposals user-friendly to business, which I think the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) highlighted in his second reading speech. The training of our work force has always been a very important aspect that most of the work force has considered itself. Unfortunately, employers have not always considered it necessary to train their work force. It is for that reason that the government took action, by bringing in the training guarantee levy in the first place-to ensure that our business sector was encouraged to train its work force to meet the growing needs in society today. That is very important, and I am· surprised that those opposite are not actually supporting this measure; rather, they are trying to tear it down. There are many examples of how industry has embraced the training guarantee levy. A lot of employers have embraced it in a very positive way-it seems a positive way to improve their business-and, of course, there are others who have decided that it is too hard. That is the big problem. I-t-restingly enough there was a very positive response by an employer in my local newspaper, the Queensland Times, on 3 February 1994. There was an article with the headline, 'New staff to beat downturn' written by a journalist called Tony Moore. says: Bus.iness risked being unable to trade out of the reces:'lOn bec-use they have not been training a major IpsWich manufacturer said yesterday. Maxcon managing director Greg Johnston said repeated job vacancies showed many firms were finding it difficult to find skilled labour. Maxcon is one of the region's largest steel fabrication plants, employing about 100 people. Mr Johnston said he believed during hard times many firms cut back on apprentices, traineeships and general training. ""You would expect that as we come out of recession, there would be a large pool of unemployed out there with skills."" ""(But) the industry has contracted and· these people have not been training-and people have left the industry-and there is no pool of skilled labour."" He warned business faced an unnecessary lag in economic growth from the recession because of the lack of training. Ipswich CES manager Richard Spurrell said there had been a shortage in skilled labour in the 1980s. He said a shortage of training had been the problem in the past, but said the present labour shortage was more complex. Maxc-m y-sterday took on six new apprentices, five engineering tradespersons (fabrication) and one engineering tradesperson (mechanical). I congratulate Mr Johnston and his firm for the initiative they have taken not only in putting on those new people but also in drawing to industry's attention the problems that industry does face if it does not train its staff. It is rather timely that this happened to be in this morning's paper when we are talking about this legislation here today. I am very pleased that that particular article has been drawn to my attention. I once again congratulate Mr Johnston and the local paper for running such a positive article on employment opportunities and the need for training. There is growing evidence in Australia that the economic recovery is now under way, and that has been acknowledged by others here. Earlier this week the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced revised budget forecasts that indicate the economy is firmly back onto the path of growth, and that is very important for us. GDP is now forecast to grow at 3.5 per It cent this financial year, with inflation forecast to be only two per cent in 1993-94. These are more positive signs. Australia is in an excellent position to exploit the enormous trade staff, opportunities now opening up within our region and throughout the world as a result of the liberalisation of world trade through the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the efforts of the APEC forum. The minister at the table, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), with his responsibility for the South Pacific region, the work that he has to do there and with his responsibility for our local regions, would agree that this is going to be a big plus there. As I have said in this place before, I recently visited some of the South Pacific islands with the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) to actually see the opportunities that we have there. I am very pleased that the minister is here to encourage the honourable member in any way he can because I know that he is doing a good job in that area anyway. To ensure that Australian industry is in a position to take advantage of these opportunities, both globally and in the Asia-Pacific region, it is essential for industry to commit itself to devoting significant resources to increasing the skills of its work force. Since its introduction on 1 July 1991, the training guarantee scheme has played an important role in encouraging Australian business to devot- increased resources to staff development to increase Australia's international competitiveness. Sadly, prior to the introduction of the training guarantee, an unacceptably high number of employers showed little interest in investing in their greatest resource, their employees. The government wisely chose to go down the path taken by many other advanced industrial countries and introduced a mechanism to address this situation. Some of the other economies in which governments have attempted to improve the national training effort over recent years include Switzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. In Switzerland, in-firm training is strictly controlled by the government, with the cost of vocational training shared equally between the government through its training system and employers through their in-firm training. The French have taken a structured approach to training for two decades, with firms that employ more than 10 people being required to spend an amount equal to 1.4 per cent of total labour costs. Examples of countries in the Asia-Pacific region which have taken a government-led approach to training include Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. For example, in Hong Kong, the Vocational Training Council oversees a series of training centres financed from government revenue in addition to industry training authorities which are financed by levies established by legislation. These facts refute one of the great myths which has developed around the training guarantee-that the Commonwealth government has adopted a go-it-alone approach to training which has reduced the competitiveness of Australian export industries. The countries which I have mentioned and the Australian government recognise that encouraging industry to invest in training and staff development, rather than imposing costs on industry, greatly benefits industry by providing it with a more highly skilled and productive work force. It is probably important to draw to the attention of the House and of the honourable member for La Trobe, in particular, that in the United States of America, with which the honourable member has had a long association, during the election campaign in late 1992 President Clinton announced plans to establish a training scheme which was to be modelled on the Australian training guarantee scheme. I understand that that is yet to happen, but it was certainly an issue in the US election. It shows that the US, too, recognises the need to move in this direction. Given the current levels of international competitiveness, Australia must have a highly skilled work force if it is to compete effectively. This legislation will improve the efficiency of the training guarantee and wiU make the scheme more adaptable and flexible. It shows the government's ongoing commitment, to assisting industry wherever possible. The legislation will increase the ability of employers to map out their training budget over a longer period, as well as reducing the· cost of complying with the legislation, thus increasing the overall flexibility of the system. The perception amongst employers that the training guarantee was inflexible and the argument that it increased the cost of complying with government legislation was an issue investigated by the Ipswich regional employment advisory group which I convened last year. I established this group to prepare a submission from the Ipswich region to the government's employment task force and the committee on employment opportunities, which was set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and which was responsible for preparing the employment green paper released in December last year. Members of the group undertook discussions with representatives of the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation, employers, local skillshares, private training providers, IMCAS, a group apprentice scheme in the Ipswich region, and community representatives. In its discussions the group came to the conclusion that, while there was perhaps room to streamline the operation of the levy, companies which already provided adequate training for their staff had nothing to fear from the training guarantee. One example of a company which members of the employment advisory group met and which had not been affected by the training levy was a major Queensland paving manufacturing company called Claypave. Claypave started with a labour force of 20 in the mid1980s which quickly grew to 74 by the end of the first year. It currently employs over 150 people. Claypave has done it and done it well during a very difficult time for Australia. The company produces a range of products, from domestic to industrial pavers, and exports to the South Pacific, Taiwan, Japan, China and Singapore. Within Australia 40 per cent of its product is sold in New South Wales. At present, Claypave receives five per cent of its revenue from exports, and this proportion is rising. Most of its work force start young and take part in in-house training programs which en-ourage multiskilling so that there is a tramed backup for every position, This company also gives bonuses for acquiring work related qualifications, such as first aid certifismoothing cates or forklift licences. Claypave has no quarrel with the training levy as it was already providing adequate training for its staff before the introduction of the levy. I congratulate the managing director at Claypave, John Peile, and his staff for the efforts they are making in that area. While other brickworks have headed towards automation, Claypave has stuck to labour-intensive production processes as it has found that it can add more value this way and then charge a higher price to the market for a quality product. It really is a high quality product which is a great credit to the work . force and the management. Labour-intensive processes allow Claypave to produce a variety of pavers at the one time. Claypave management have a deliberate policy of trying to maximise margins rather than reducing costs and trying to maximise profit rather than being concerned with the level of cost needed to achieve the profit. This philosophy means that, rather than shedding labour in order to minimise labour costs in the way that many businesses have done over recent years, Claypave is prepared to look at hiring extra labour if the labour will enable it to increase its margins. While Claypave has not utilised federal government labour market programsit has not needed to because it has done most of it in-house-the company has taken advantage of other federal government initiatives to move into the export field. It is presently expanding its production capacity through the construction of a new kiln, at a projected cost of $6 million. The 10 per cent investment allowance announced by the. Prime Minister in the Investing in the nation statement, which will be worth around $600,000 on this project, was a major factor in the company going ahead with its expan., sion plans and has helped it in making that decision, which has been beneficial to the expansion of the company and the work force. Other factors, such as the accelerated depreciation allowance provided by the federal government, have also been of great benefit to Claypave. Austrade has been of great assistance to this company as well in getting background on potential markets, thus the path for expansion into. these markets. Claypave is an example of a significant number of employers who, rather than whingeing about the training levy and other government policies, have taken advantage of the policy framework put in place by the government in order to dramatically expand the scale of its output and move into the export market. Rather than placing a burden on business, the requirements of the training guarantee provide enormous opportunities for business by encouraging it to increase the productivity of its work force. The training guarantee is not a method of raising revenue for the government; it is a pro-business way of ensuring a more highly skilled work force. I would suggest that the government's best position would be if no payments were collected from the training levy. We would then know that employers are providing adequate training for their staff. The honourable member for La Trobe mentioned that some employers had reduced training. I find it difficult to accept that responsible employer or business would reduce its training to 1.5 per cent in order to just meet that minimum requirement. I do not think any responsible business would take such a silly action. . The ideal situation would be where no company was forced· to pay a levy, as this would mean that all employers were looking after their own self-interest by increasing the skills of their work force. I have no difficulties with that if they are doing that. The training guarantee and other reforms, including the esta-lishinent of the National Training Authority, which the Prime Minister referred to here today, will help to ensure that as our economy continues to expand into the 1990s we do not suffer the same skill shortages which were suffered in 1970s and the early 1980s. I referred to this before when I quoted the newspaper article concerning the local Ipswich CES manager, We do not want those skill shortages to occur again. We should avoid that at all costs. However,to ensure that these shortages do not occur,it is important that business make a very firm commitment to training. The article that I referred to earlier shows the commitment of some people to training and the need to ensure that people are well trained in our work force. If we draw attention to the need for Australia to become more competitive, to meet the challenges that are now available, not only in this region but also on a global basis, given all those positive things over recent times that came out of the GATT round-particularly, as I said earlier, trade with the South Pacific region, for which the minister at the table has responsibility-the opportunities are enormous, but we have to make sure that our work force is trained. We have to make sure that we encourage employers to train our work force. Before I entered parliament I was involved in the banking industry, and I was involved with my union in the banking industry. We were very supportive of the proposed training levy at that time. Even though my organisation, a major bank in Australia, was doing a lot of in-house training, it had to recognise where those costs were incurred. But the bank any knew where the costs were because it was always prepared to put the cost of training staff on the balance sheet, which was important. I do not believe that the training levy has been detrimental to large business because most large businesses would have been training their staff anyway. Particularly in the bal1king industry in which I was involved, large institutions spent a lot of money on training and rightly so. This bill formalises training. It encourages employers to ensure that they are actually training those people. It is important that industry rises to the occasion and provides greater training opportunities for employees. The government is willing to listen to the genuine concerns which have been expressed by some sections of industry about the operation of the training guarantee. That is what these amendments are about: they show that the government is prepared to be flexible to address those issues. Under the amendments in the bill, the operation of the guarantee will be made more flexible in an attempt to avoid wasteful and ineffective spending by companies towards the end of the financial year simply to spend the necessary minimum. To those employers who do the things that the honourable member for La Trobe was talking about-sending people away for long weekends in big hotels-I do not think that is a productive way to operate. If some employers are doing that, I think they are being rather foolish because they are really not going to get value for money in training people, making them multiskilled and producing more for the company. Employers will be able to carry forward spending in excess of the required minimum from one year into the next-I think that is a very good initiative-while also being able to make up for insufficient spending in one year by spending more in the next. Other amendments to the guarantee are also contained in this legislation, including the removal of the need for employers to subtract subsidies by government bodies for apprentices anQ trainees when working out their net eligible training expenditure, changes to the clauses relating to work experience for students and teachers and a provision to widen the range of bodies which can group for the purposes of the act, thus giving organisations greater flexibility to maximise their training opportunities. I do not believe that employers are picking up the opportunities that traineeships provide by having new people working in their businesses and by preparing a much more skilled work force in the longer term. There are many young people today who would gladly, I believe, take on a traineeship if they had opportunity. This encourages employers to take on trainees and apprentices. Ovetall, the legislation covers a range of rrieasures aimed at simplifying the operation of the guarantee for business, particularly small business. This legislation meets a commitment given by the government before the last federal election to make the training guarantee more business friendly. I commend the amendments to the House.",111
163,Mr TUCKEY,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It has to be said that the government is making rather heavy weather of convincing anybody that the training guarantee levy has any worth to business or industry. We are being told by speaker after speaker-I have listened to a number of them through the TV service-that suddenly all this training is being directed towards giving people safer work practices when that is the subject of quite separate legislation, a separate authority both state and federal, and a very substantial campaign from those authorities. So one would wonder why with that particular campaign we need another governl1lent initiative to achieve the same thing. I do not recollect when the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill was first introduced the government telling us that it was to be a campaign for worker safety. I am not criticising worker safety; I am just saying that the government has other authorities and expenditures associated with that activity. It puts business to substantial cost, which, as a small businessman, lexperienced recently when suddenly a person appeared on a building site-the building was being constructed on my behalf-and demanded that this very simple project have a six-foot fence erected around it on the grounds that some kid might come in, pick up a piece of steel and cart it out on to the road. The fact that we pointed out that no steel was lying around to be picked up and put on the road did not seem to interest him whatsoever. But I make the point that we are talking about a project that was designed, according to the government, to increase the skills of workers in the workplace to the benefit of the national economy. I have not read one speech the nor heard one speaker give any substantial evidence to that effect. Clearly, when that great guru of the Labor movement, the bossI am not talking about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); I am talking about the boss, Bill Kelty-was put on the regional task force,he told the government to scrap it for three years. He went all around Australia and could not find any evidence that the training guarantee was working. Of course, he did discover some of the reasons why it was not working, and we have to take some of these into account. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and speaker after speaker have been perpetuating this myth that somehow or other employers never trained their staff. What employers never did, particularly the smaller ones who are my specific shadow ministry constituency, was bother to write it down. Training was a routine part of the daily operations of their business. In fact, most of them abhor the process of record keeping and most of them, to a major degree, lack the resources-human and financial-to do it anyway. This is the first downside of this training guarantee levy: it just adds a bit Inore to the paperwork that all small business, survey after survey, is complaining about. The current situation, put to me by a major small business organisation recently, is that if ,a business happens to employ five people today half of one person will be fully engaged in keeping up with the government's paperwork requirements, part of which is now keeping a regular record of what the business spends on training. I happen to operate a horticultural business. We employ about 40 staff, and we have six apprentices. We are proud of that. We seek them and we give them good training, and one has recently been promoted to a store manager. We never kept records-it is still very difficult to cost the loss of production, the damage to equipment and possibly the lost customer""':-'of the process and the cost of training someone. But it is a real cost that industry and business has accepted for decades. I had 16 years in local government, and I have given the example time and againothers would recognise this-that there was no formal training system in the local government arena, yet go around our countryside and watch the high skills of workers operating things like road graders. Where were they taught prior to the training guarantee levy? Water binding-the final process before applying a bitumen seal-is a highly skilled exercise, but the people who practise it did not learn it at TAFE or under the training guarantee levy. Those ordinary working people who build those wonderful roads for us learnt those skills by a process of employment. Yet those opposite say that nobody put any money or any effort into the training of workers. I will tell those opposite how it happens .. Mr Sawford-Who said that?",115
164,Mr TUCKEY,TRAINING GUARANTEE,The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and about three previous speakers said that. They said that until we had this wonderful training guarantee levy nobody put any moneyMr Sawford-No-one said that.,116
165,Mr TUCKEY,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The honourable member for Oxley did. Check the record. The record of this place cannot be rewritten as the Prime Minister so frequently tries to do. In many earthmoving operations, in the local government arena or in the private sector, a labourer one day turns up to find that the front-end loader driver has not come to work. The boss, be he the council foreman or whatever, says, 'Listen, Charlie. You've been around for a while. You've seen the fellow drive that. You'd better give it a try'. Over time that fellow achieves skills in driving a front-end loader. He probably breaks a few things, to the employer's expense, and he is probably very slow to commence with, to the employer's expense, but where was that training recorded? Of course, later on he may progress to dozer driver and one day maybe to grader driver, which is the epitome in terms of skills. That happens everywhere. I am pleased to say that during January, when some may have taken their holidays, I went to my small business. I like to get out there occasionally and feel how it all works. For a period of time. I got on a shovel. That is not a very high position, but occasionally I still have to use one. I had a 19 year old kid alongside me and he did not know much about it, but he knew a bit more when the 58 year old had given him a few lessons. The only trouble was that when I stopped, he stopped. I thought I needed the breath. The point I make is that in industry and local government, employers have always done it. The only result of the training guarantee levy is the necessity of keeping records about it. Employers need that sort of record keeping like a hole in the head. We have gone down this road. We have forced most people to identify where they have given training. We have put procedures in place whereby trainers are necessary. Employers have to have people on their staff to teach someone else to do something. That process has to be fonnal and time has to be allocated, There are then fights in the workplace because employees say, 'I should be paid for training outside of the nonnal working day', Today we had the Prime Minister moralising about the wonderful things that have happened to TAFE since the government has centralised it. I think he said that the government has chucked in a billion dollars or so. No doubt that is going to expand activities at TAFE, but I do not think it is going to make it work any better than if the state governments, which were running it previously, had that extra billion dollars, The Prime Minister talks about retention rates. We know about all retention rates, All of the people those opposite boast about now being at school are the ones who cannot· get a job, Malcolm Fraser might have had much lower retention rates, but he did not need higher retention rates because people were going from secondary s,ch-ol stra-ght - nto jobs and, what is more, achlevmg theIr skIlls once they got there, That government had very low unemployment rates, apart from in times of drought and other things, which no government can control. Let me give the House another example, Honourable members opposite would really think this was a good idea because it was instituted by the trade union movement. I spent many years in the hotel industry, When I entered that industry, the training mechanism for teaching people to be bar attendants had the label of green labour, If a person arrived at an employer and said, 'I know nothing about serving beer but I would like a job' and the employers Were willing-they frequently were-that person could commence work at, I think, three-quarters of the full salary but only for up to six weeks, Might I add, those who could not learn in a fortnight were never going to learn. In fact, many employers put the highly skilled workers on full wages after a couple of weeks, I might add also that after six weeks they said to some, 'I'm sorry, I don't intend to employ you at full wages because you're not good enough, You haven't learnt in a reasonable time'. The unions said that this was gross exploitation of the work force. People were reasonably hard to get in those days, yet somehow or other the unions wanted to argue-we hear this rubbish all the time-that good people were put off after they had completed the cutprice period, Of course they were not; they were valued highly, So the unions got that situation changed, Everybody starting work had to get a full wage, So what did employers start doing? They would ask, 'Have you had any experience?' If the answer was no, they would say, 'Thank you very much, Next', Over time, all those people who used to get trained under that system, which cost nobody anything, were out of work. They could not get a job, A smart entrepreneur in a metropolitan hotel had a good idea, He advertised to teach the bar for $50, So all of these people, who used to get trained by the employer at two-thirds of the wages from day one, went and worked for nothing and paid $50 for the privilege, It was a great success for the labour movement. All of these schemes that do not work just go to show how silly people can be, Some good might be done in a couple of other matters, I support wholeheartedly the amendment to be put by the shadow minister to place a sunset clause on this legislation, much in line with the recommendations of the boss, Mr Kelty, that this thing be scrapped because it does not deliver. We have heard other speakers talk of some of the rorts and the stupid things that happen in certain areas in which it is so hard to provide the training that one mightthink is so easily provided within a work place and how people are given weekends away. I have been a speaker at one of these things, I nearly feU over when I read that the particular conference was forming part of their training guarantee levy, And they had me talking politicsl The bloke before me was telling them how to minimise tax, Mr Bilney-Don't knock yourself,",116
166,Mr TUCKEY,TRAINING GUARANTEE,",-I do not see myself as a trainer in that situation, notwithstanding that I am sure their political beliefs would have been improved no end after listening to me for a while, The point I want to make is that these are silly things when we could be directing interest elsewhere. Some representatives of the Canberra ASBA came to see me today. They have been to everyone else. Their description of the capacimuch ty of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) to absorb was quite enlightening. I am reminded that we have a trade unionist representing the small business community and a trade unionist representing industry. If that is not putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank, I would like to know what it is. These people, who are highly skilled in the computer industry, received an invitation from Erindale College in Canberra to see how they could help some of the young people who chose to leave school at the end of their secondary schooling gain employment. These people assessed a large number of such pupils and one of the things that struck them was the extent to which these pupils were already computer literate. A number of us here in this room would know that if we want our watches adjusted we give them to one of the children. Our children, at various levels of academic achievement, are very computer literate. Three and four year olds can run a VCR that I have difficulty with. So there were these kids, really quite' useful and with quite a high degree of training, some of which they might have picked up from playing video games. These members of ABSA then went off to the small business community of Canberra and identified where they could place 100 pupils. They then extrapolated that around Australia the figure could be 50,000. What were these pupils going to do? They would go, on a one day at a time basis, into small businesses that already had a computer but which, because of the such basic skiIIs, were not getting half what they should in productivity gains and actually train the boss or do certain work that was beyond the resources of that small business. The boss cannot afford them for five days a week-the business is not big enough-but may be able to afford them for one day a week. The members of ABSA said that they believed they could put together a cooperative to arrange this, something like what we see in the building industry where apprentices are farmed out to tradesmen. They cannot get anywhere with that project. It was all too for Senator Schacht. BiIl Kelty did not like the idea because he did not see how he could collect union dues, and those opposite will not do anything about it. That is the perfect pilot scheme. We do not have to go to $50,000 straight away; we do not have to go to a llll per cent training levy across Australia. The government should just go out and try that. I was very impressed with the representation made by those people. But the government's problem is that its Minister for Science and Small Business is so thick he cannot understand how it would work and, of course, he has not one iota of experience in the business arena, which is fundamental to his responsibilities as the representative of small business. I hope that by my words somebody in this place, the minister or someone else, might go back to Senator Schacht and say, 'Are you going to do anything about this?'. The cost would have been minimal; those people just wanted a bit of help and, by the way, a bit of endorsement. Most of it would be funded by members; they were prepared to pay these kids. It is just a different way of finding them jobs. I will touch on something else. Some years ago I happened to attend a briefing given by two people whom this government had brought out from Massachusetts. They were very senior bureaucrats, surprisingly, husband and wife, working for the state of Massachusetts under Governor Dukakis, a well-known liberal-not by our terminology but by American terminology-or left-wing governor. Of these two people; the husband was director of social security and the wife, as near as I could equate, director of the Massachusetts equivalent of Australia's CES. Shortly after the husband's appointment to the social security department, he discovered that he had all these highly qualified single parents, people with university degrees and such, who had got out of the work force. He instituted a scheme to get them trained and back into the work force. This government brought these two people out here, at great expense, no doubt, and said, 'Tell us about it' - and they did. They told me about it at this little briefing. But fundamental to their proposal was that this fellow had said to a number of private organisations and his wife, as representative of her state's equivalent of the CES, 'Look, I've got all these people; you train them for jobs and when they get one I will pay you so much'-good American free enterprise principles being provided by a government bureaucrat. The government of those opposite had these two people out from America. Fundamental to the scheme which they briefed us on was that they had to get someone in a job before they got paid, both department to department and department to private sector. The scheme was internationally recognised as being successful. But the successful bit of it, that incentive for achieving something, went over the top of this government's head. The people have been gone for a year or two and I have never seen any program of that nature which has been so successful in another place. That just gives us an example of how, whilst good operations and schemes are available, they are being shrugged aside because we have this centralist, nationalistic sort of approach that says, 'Oh, you just whack a 11/z per cent levy on them and everything will come good'. It is very similar to the principle of politics that says we measure success by expenditure-and we have seen so many areas where that does not work. In all, these are the points that need to be made with this particular scheme. It is not a good scheme; it is one which has achieved very little in improving the training of people. In some areas it is impossible, and those areas are in many of the professions where we cannot institute in-house training for people who have been skilled in academic training and picked up their business experience over decades. They are the ones this government sends off to conferences-and the government has been allowed to do it. As I said, some of these conferences are achieving nothing but wasting money; otherwise, they make a fortune for some of the people running them. These are the sorts of problems. This legislation does very little. It allows the government to advance some expenditure from one year to the next, whereas, probably if the thing were worth keeping, we would want a five-year averaging system at least. It is just not that simple. The smaller the business, the harder it is. But, basically, business has always done that. It has done that at considerable cost,a lot of which it is not allowed to document under this legislationand yet it is a cost. I can tell those opposite that it has not done them any good. Of course, when we add to that things like the superannuation guarantee charge, which has just put 60,000 people out of work, it gives us some idea of how silly some of these arrangements are. (Time expired)",117
167,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The real truth in this debate is that the opposition still does not appear to know anything about the training guarantee. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) ignores a recent study of the National Safety Council which quite clearly stated that lack of training contributed to 600 deaths in industry, 500,000 injuries at a $2 billion compensation cost-an all up cost of $10 billion in lost productivity. He just ignores it. The honourable member for O'Connor is very good on the homily and the anecdote. Let me not give him a homily or an anecdote; let me give him some facts. One worker in this particular study lost a finger working on a machine and, while being taken to hospital, was replaced by another worker who had not even been adequately trained. Within 30 minutes, the second worker-why does not the honourable member for O'Connor stay here and listen?-had one of his arms amputated by the same machine. In another incident, a 30-year-old woman lost the tops of her fingers during the first 15 minutes of using a machine which she had not even been properly shown how to use. Before the honourable member for O'Connor goes, he should perhaps refer to what one of his colleagues in the Senate has said-and, of course, I refer to a statement by Senator Tierney in which he contradicts almost everything the honourable member for O'Connor says. Senator Tierney stated: By the same token, training can no longer to the unstructured, hit and miss, learn as you go methods of the past. We must set national goals which will embrace the needs of industry, business and commerce for specific skills and for specific training. These goals must be met by providers who are flexible and highly qualified. Mr Bilney-Which party is he from?",119
168,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The Liberal Party. Also, according to the honourable member for O'Connor, not only do those opposite abhor record keeping, they fail to maintain time and wages books and pay at least award wages. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in this House last year said that the levy was two per cent; Senator Boswell said, in December last year, that it was three per cent; and Senator Chapman complained of the huge tax impost. What huge tax impost? This is the mob that the honourable member for La Trobe (MrCharies) said understands business. Ask the car industry how the Liberals understand business. Mr Bilney-They can't add up. Mr.SAWFORD-They cannot add up. The honourable member for La Trobe did, in fact, make a number of points. He mentioned compulsion. But I remind that particular honourable member that the best companies in my electorate spend nine to 12 per cent on training, similar to the rate of the Japanesethey want to compete in the world. The honourable member for La Trobe mentioned the quality of training programs; was he really serious? He would acknowledge, I would hope-unfortunately, the honourable member for O'Connor did not-that professional management should have operational and business plans. Is the honourable member for La Trobe suggesting that it is good practice for companies not to have personnel plans to underpin a company's aims and objectives? Is he serious in suggesting that those same firms are so dense that they cannot identify their skill needs and participate in appropriate training programs? The honourable member for La Trobe also mentioned rorts. What about rorts? If I were a company shareholder, I do not think I would be too impressed with the management of a company being involved in mickey be left mouse programs. What sort of company would be involved in those: one destined for future success? I think not. Try the highest common factor and not the lowest common denominator and we may get a little further in this debate. One would think that those opposite would have learnt that at the last election. I tum to what I think is. of national interest: training. The influential US economist, Michael Porter, stated: There is little doubt from our research that education and training are decisive in national competitive advantage. The nations we studied that invest the most heavily in education (Germany, Japan and Korea) had advantages in many industries that could be traced in part to human resources. What is even more telling is that in every nation, those industries that were the most competitive, were often those where specialised investment in education and training had been unusually great. These comments were endorsed by the US Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, who stated: The skills of a nation's workforce and the quality of its infrastructure are what makes it unique, and uniquely attractive, in the world economy. A nation's economic role is to improve its citizens standard of living by enhancing the value of what they contribute to the world economy. The concern over national competitiveness is often misplaced. It is not what we own that courits; it is what we do. The green paper on employment opportunity states: A skilled and adaptable workforce plays an important role in enabling Australia to compete in the world economy and achieve sustained employment growth. A skilled workforce committed to producing high quality goods and services will respond better to changing. technology and industry demands. This will increase the capacity for the economy to grow faster without creating higher wage and inflationary pressures. Education and training on their own will not lead to high economic and employment growth. However combined with up-to-date technology, more flexible use of labour and competent and innovative managersunlike the honourable member for O'Connorwho are capable of integrating them, they can facilitate ·economic growth. Education and training beyond the post-compulsory level give people an advantage in gaining and retaining jobs. We in this nation ought to take serious note of Australia's competitors. Many devote considerable private and public resources to vocational training. The honourable member for FremantIe (Mr Dawkins) pointed out in 1992 in his role as former Treasurer, that Ja:pa- spent, by the private sector, 9.2 per of its payroll on training compared to only 2.2 per cent in Australia. The training guarantee was introduced by this government to increase the quality of work force training. Its aim is that all employers with an average annual payroll of $226 000 or more, which is equivalent to eight' or 10 employees, must spend the equivalent of Ilh per cent of their payroll on eligible training. As at May 1992, most employers had spent the minimum requirement. The Australian tax office collected the huge sum of $3 million for 1991 from 1,306 employers. That is the huge tax impost. Mr Bilney-In other words, it is working.",120
169,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It is working. The training guarantee cannot be regarded as a government tax. It is a threshold which employers are to meet for the skill needs of their work force. The training guarantee is not prescriptive as to what a company should do to train its employees or managers in, since only the company will be aware of its own skill deficiencies and will be best placed in remedying this. Despite some of the media hype, the role of the training guarantee is pro-business. The training guarantee was designed to stop those companies which never train from poaching the skilled employees of their competitors. Some employers who complain about the training guarantee criticise the government for interference and regulation in the labour market. That is very rich when we consider that they were often the very first employers to demand that the government give them a handout when there was a skills shortage. The government signalled very early to Australian industry, back in 1986, that it was considering introducing a training levy because of the inadequate levels of skills held by the Australian work force and the lack of training undertaken by employers. The truth is that parts of industry failed to take up the challenge and develop industry specific schemes to ensure that the industry was best placed to compete with the high skilled economies of the world. Even now, only two industries have opted for their own training scheme which allows an exemption from cent meeting the requirement of the training guarantee. The training guarantee has not increased business operating costs, particularly when one note- that the government also reduced the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. It is not the intention of the government to collect any funds from the training guarantee and as such it cannot be regarded as a tax. Another common complaint about the training guarantee is that compliance is too complex. It seems that some business people can be talked around very quickly by smart accountants into believing that this is a very complicated method of record keeping. To ensure that the training guarantee appears as simple as it really is, the government has announced its intention to introduce a pro forma to assist employers in meeting their compliance requirements. When completing the pro forma the employer will appreciate that the level of detail that the Australian Taxation Office requires to be kept is not onerous but is in fact quite minimal. It is surprising, to take another tack, that whereas most Australian companies have operational and business plans, some did not have the relevant personnel or training plans to underpin the company's objectives and ensure it achieved its goals. The training guarantee is about ensuring that training is more equitably conducted in the labour market. It is directed at those employers who are short-sighted in their platming, who do not train and who belatedly realise they have a serious skills shortage and threaten the viability of their competitors by poaching. These are companies that have had to increase their training effort by engaging in relevant work related training. When these companies appreciate that training is an important feature of any company's long-term future, and the work culture changes to reflect this, then it would be appropriate that the government repeal the training guarantee legislation. There are some who criticise the guarantee for encouraging employers to undertake irrelevant training, and sections of the media have been particularly dexterous with the truth to illustrate innumerable training rorts. This is a commercial decision for the company to take. If it wishes to waste its training effort and not take advantage of the skills that can be derived from it, it is pretty silly. Obviously the government would prefer that the opportunity was not abused, but it is relaxed in the knowledge that shareholdersvery important people who too often get ignored-will be sufficiently incensed with such waste and running down of their investment, their asset, to ensure that such practices are rare. It is a pretty sad indietment on our society if managers can appreciate the value of an investment which takes a physical form and its contribution to the company's asset base, but they not consider or value the .skill of their own people, their own work force. In doing so, managers are failing in their duty to their shareholders by not providing for a high value added, skilled work force that can ensure that the company is ready and capable of responding. It is quite obvious that members of the opposition just do not understand what is in this bill; I did not want to have to do this, perhaps I need to go back and explain some of the items. In the context of the 1993 election, the government undertook to allow employers to carry forward expenditure exceeding the minimum requirement occurred in one financial year. The excess expenditure will offset or reduce the obligation for the following year, allowing employers more flexibility to plan training and accommodate the peaks and troughs of training expenditure. Is there a problem with that? I do not think so. In conjunction with that proposal, employers who have not fulfilled their obligation in one year will be able to catch up in the following year. Employers will still need to lodge a shortfall statement if they do not meet their obligations, but may now attach a declaration agreeing to make up the shortfall in the following financial year. This two-way role makes up and gives considerable flexibility within the two-year period. It will be a great benefit to business, particularly small business .. Employers will no longer have to deduct training subsidies when calculating net eligible training expenditure. This should simplify training guarantee compliance and encourage employers to take on more people under training programs, such as apprenticeships and traineeships. To maintain the attractiveness of claiming the deemed amount for apprentices or trainees, this amount is being increased to $2,260. Until now, employers have been able to claim expenditure on student work experience only when the student involved was under the age of 21. To encourage employers to extend the offer of work experience to all full-time students, including mature age students and those undertaking studies which require the performance of work experience at a later age, for example, law and engineering, this age restriction is being removed. The Training Guarantee Act allows two or more corporations which are members of a business group to elect to have themselves treated as a single employer, that is, to group together. Grouping arrangements are being simplified by allowing a grouping election, but previously required annually, .to remain in force until it is superseded at a later election or revoked. We further clarified the arrangyments by requiring that companies be related at 30 June in order to form a group. Access to grouping has been widened by the use of a broader determination of companies and controlled economic entities contained within the Corporations Act. It is important to clarify the meaning of 'appropriately qualified'. A structural training program must be designed or approved in advance by a person who is appropriately qualified. The use of that term has, admittedly, caused some confusion in the past among employers. To remove this confusion the term is to be replaced with a more comprehensive description outlining the required knowledge and experience. The Corporations Act is also being amended to allow employers to claim expenditure directly attributable to the use of training with vehicles or equipment which were not purchased, hired or leased solely or principally for training purposes. An employer will be able to claim an amount directly attributable to the period of use: To bring the training guarantee rulings into line with other self-assist obligations administered by the Commissioner of Taxation and to provide for a right of appeal against them, an amendment is to be introduced to make binding both public and private rulings. Another change is required because of the recent change to the Australian corporations and securities legislation. This requires amendment to section 78 of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, which will require that a person who is appointed administrator of a company, pursuant to section 53A(2) of the Corporations Law, give written notice of the fact to the Commissioner of Taxation. As I said before, good legislation looks after the needs of both a nation's citizens and the national future interest. The honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) gave a couple of very good examples of one company which used training to make money and another, a computer firm, which became far more competitive. It became so competitive that in four years, from 1988 to 1992, it went from a one-person computer consultancy to a company which had increased its turnover by 1,230 per cent, employed 27 employees and become the fastest growing company in the BRW's top 100. What did the principal proprietors of that company do? They spent a huge amount of money on training. It was training that gave them the competitive edge over their competitors. Mr Nugent-It was training they needed and chose, not training that was forced on them. Yours is forced training. Mr .DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Les Scott)-Order! The honourable member for Aston should cease interjecting.",121
170,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It is okay; he is another one who really does not know what the training guarantee levy is about. Why do those opposite ignore the safety of Australian workers? Not one person from the opposition has taken up the recent study of the National Safety Council of Australia, which quite clearly shows that last year there were 600 deaths, 500,000 injuries and $2 billion paid in compensation-a $10 billion all-up cost when lost productivity and lost working hours were taken into account. If we take the $2 billion given for compensation and say that $1 billion is equivalent to 20,000 jobs, we lost 40,000 jobs. If we take the $10 billion, which is probably a more appropriate figure, a potential 200,000 jobs have been pushed aside or swept under the carpet. This has not even been addressed by one member from the opposition. Mr Nugent-We have not pushed it aside. You are the government. You are the ones who have done nothing about it.",123
171,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I thought the honourable member for Aston would acknowledge that there are benefits to be gained by-ensuring workers' safety. He should know that young people are very vulnerable in the workplace, particularly in the first few hours or the first few days because that is when the injuries occur. It is not just the young people who receive these injuries but also older workers who are put onto new processes without appropriate training. Six hundred deaths and 500,000 injuries is not something that we ought to be ignoring. In. question time today a question was asked by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) which addressed education, training and young Australians. He did not want to hear the answer. I ask a number of questions on education and training in this place but, as soon as a question is asked on this subject, those opposite go to sleep. They are not interested in the answer; they ignore it. The same thing applies with this particular bill. The opposition knows nothing of the training guarantee and its contribution is negligible. (Time expired)",123
172,Mr VAILE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It was interesting to listen to the closing remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) regarding the opposition's attitude to training. I do not think the opposition is opposing or being negative about the necessity for training in this country. To the contrary, we are trying to point out to the government that the training guarantee levy included in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill is going in completely the wrong direction. The levy is misdirected and is not providing training to the right areas. We have in Australia today a vacuum of skilled tradespeople. An industry in my electorate had to go to England to get a skilled tradesperson who could manufacture components for the automotive industry. That is what we are talking about. Even Bill Kelty, who is the boss of the ACTU and the chairman of the government's task force on regional development, said in his report that this training guarantee levy should be suspended because it is not doing the job that it was intended to do. The opposition supports training for safety in the workplace where it is quality training not quantity training. This amendment bill will not provide that. That is why I support the amendments to be moved in the committee stage by the shadow minister for schools, vocational education and training, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), to abolish the compulsory training guarantee levy. The scheme, when introduced in July 1990 by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), had a lot of good intentions. The government wanted to improve the training opportunity for Australian workers. Yet, as the shadow minister for schools, vocational education and training said yesterday, the path to hell is always lined with good intentions. The scheme was introduced to improve the quantity and quality of training by employers. This scheme may have improved the quantity of some companies' training programs, but in the vast majority of cases it has done nothing to improve the quality of training programs at all. Quality training, in my eyes, is the most important issue we will speak about today; it is not the necessity for training, it is the quality. I do not think anybody backs away from the need in Australia for quality training programs. I believe we should be focusing on and targeting traineeships, and not taking the shotgun approach of this training guarantee levy. The scheme currently requires employers with annual payrolls of at least $220,000 to spend at least 1.5 per cent of their payroll on eligible training. Employers who spend less than the minimum required become liable to pay a training guarantee charge equal to their shortfall. This amendment bill is an amendment to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, and I see it doing nothing to effect the overall direction of the scheme. I reiterate to the House the recommendation that has come from the government's own committees-that this program should be suspended; it is not targeted properly and it is not achieving the results it was to achieve. The scheme has failed practically in a number of ways. It has substantially increased the cost of record keeping with respect to training expenditure and has done so, in many proven cases, to the detriment of expenditure on training individuals. The scheme has brought to the attention of some companies their actual level of expenditure in excess of the minimum which the companies then determine to reduce as a cost cutting exercise. Without a doubt-and probably the most damning indictment of the whole programthe scheme is a tax on jobs and has inhibited employment. This scheme has no solid basis to continue operating. The government can quote textbook figures on how much training has been spent on what areas, but the scheme is not targeting the people originally intended and must be abandoned as soon as possible. The challenge is now before the government not only from t}:le opposition but also from, as I say, a number of reports. Even the government's green paper on employment talks about some of these issues, but it pulls up short of recommending a suspension of this program. Within the government's own ranks the training guarantee levy has received substantial criticism. The Prime Minister's task force on regional development, chaired by Bill Kelty of the ACTU, confirmed that the levy was not providing the training for which it was designed. The task force itself recommended that the levy be suspended. This is no opposition task force or opposition committee making this recommendation to the government; this is something that has been set up by the government. I put it to the House that the challenge is now before the government to take on some of these recommendations. This is significant criticism from within the Labor Party's own ranks. I will be interested to hear some of the government speakers try to criticise the argument put forward in the Kelty paper. Criticism also arose from the green paper on employment. Despite the green paper not being the most significant philosophical document, it did pick up on one important issue, and that was that the training guarantee levy was extremely inequitable as it f9rced employers to bear the entire costs of training. While the green paper stopped short of calling for, the levy to be scrapped, this is still further damaging criticism that must place the abolishment of the scheme on the agenda for this government. The scheme, which was introduced by the honourable member for Fremantle during program 1990, has been around for over three years. ment has done. The government introduced the scheme with all good intentions. However, the government must now be flexible and accountable enough to look at the scheme and realise that it not worked. It is certainly time now for government to go back to the drawing board and look for new ways of providing quality training in the Australian work force. , I think it is important to look at what are actually trying to achieve when forcing business to spend on training programs. The mainstream view of the function that training fulfils in the economy is that it enhances productivity. Economists usually feel at ease with this idea, which corresponds with their own notion of human capital acquisition dating back to Adam Smith. These people see training as an investment process through which the stock of skills is replenished and augmented. This is certainly the basic philosowho phy that the current government I think that such a model preserts many problems. Some productive processes are selfevidently more capital intensive in the conventional sense than others, such as steel making compared with hairdressing or electricity generation compared with retailing. Similarly, some fields are more human capital intensive than others, yet the presumption that this government ha- taken is that all occupations and industries should be measured in the same way. Whatever happened to the economies of scale? The government's crazy, oversimpl-fied idea that all firms should spend1.5 per cent of their payroll on training is certainly debatable on efficiency grounds. I have another concern with the basic philosophy of this training guarantee levy. 1 would have thought that the basic economics 'would suggest that, in order for the training process to be worthwhile, the value of the benefits must be equal to or exceed the a discounted value of the costs. This seems fairly straightforward. I therefore cannot see the value to business of government making holidays to the Hong Kong Sevens and junkets to major resorts around Australia and the world an essential part of a training - Essentially, this is what this governAs training is such a nondescript term and as loopholes can and will continue to be has found with this current amendment, I think the the government must start looking for new ways of providing quality training programs in Australian business and stop kidding itself that a certain quantity of training is the best way of providing quality training. Quality we training and quantity training are two very different things. The government has, for all its good intentions, muddled up the two very badly with the training guarantee levy. Let us get a few facts straight about the abuse of the current training guarantee levy, which I see no solutions to in the current amendment bill. The training guarantee levy has been abused in the marketplace. It has often been used directly against,the employee, is just the person that this legislation is is using, but supposed to protect. Take the example of a company which is looking for a new permanent head of a section. It may be a very important position within the business. The training guarantee levy, in its current form, provides a mechanism whereby screening of potential candidates can take place. The training guarantee levy provides a cheap means by which the employers can observe workers in action without necessarily being committed to a long-term permanent contract. In particular, I argue that this has the potential for abuse among many youth training schemes. In a circumstance such as this, the training has not provided any relevant skills but instead has been used as a cheap and effective tool by employers looking for future potential managers. There is also the much cited problem with the training guarantee levy being used as a perk. The shadow minister himself alluded to the Hong Kong Sevens where doctors, lawyers and Australian business people were aided by the training guarantee levy to see a feast of good rugby. I have even heard of experiences in local government in' which, Waving to utilise 1.5 per cent of its payroll in training, it was being used by elected representatives to attend conferences and'the like. It is not targeted. The whole object of the debate today is as much involved with the abolition of the existing training guarantee levy program as it is with the amendment that is before the House at the moment. I urge the government, when we are dealing with this bill in committee and when the shadow minister moves the amendment to abolish the compulsory training guarantee levy, to consider not just the recommendations and the proposals being put forward by the opposition but also those recommendations that, as I have already mentioned in my address this evening, are contained within the government's own task force report. The chairman of that task force, who is also the boss of the trade union movement in Australia, Mr Kelty, has recommended to government that the training guarantee levy be put aside because it is definitely not targeting people that it was originally meant to target. I admit that it is more than likely that the government introduced this in 1990 with all the good intentions under the sun, but it is not . providing the correct training for the people that I believe the government meant it to target. It is not aiding employment at all. If anything, it is an impediment to employment. During the MPI yesterday, when we were talking about the current level of unemployment in Australia, I mentioned a number of impediments to employment in Australia. This is just one of them. If the government is serious about the unemployment problem and the skills level in this country, it will seriously consider the challenge that is before it now, not just from the opposition but from all sections of the community, with regard to this training guarantee levy. I believe that the levy should be abolished. I believe that it is not training the people we should be training. As far as wage subsidies are concerned, a lot of the labour market programs and short-term training programs at the moment are not achieving anything. They are not creating any jobs. They are not getting people into work. Today we heard about the retention rates in senior years of high schools and the higher participation levels in tertiary education. Those people are being more highly trained in tertiary education, but there are still no jobs at the end of the road when they complete their higher school education or tertiary education. We are going to have a highly professionally skilled work force, but we will not have the number of skilled tradespeople that we need in this country if we are to have a manufacturing value added led recovery from this recession. There is a vacuum of tradespeople in this country. The training guarantee levy that is in situ at the moment will not provide those tradespeople. We have to abolish it. We have to retarget it. We have to direct the focus towards proper training of tradespeople in traineeships around this country. After the Second World War, we had to elevate immigration programs to get tradespeople to Australia because we had an economy on the the go. If we can believe what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is telling us, with his revised economic forecasts for 1994, we will strike this problem sooner than we think. Three years of this program has certainly done nothing to assist the situation. If anything, it has been impediment. I now challenge the government to have a serious, genuine look at what it is doing. It knows that the results are not being produced. Bill Kelty knows that the results are not bei,ng produced. If the government is serious about the money that has been spent on these reports, it will acknowledge the recommendations contained in this report. I challenge the government to abolish the compulsory training guarantee levy altogether.",123
173,Ms HENZELL,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Capricornia) (6.00 p.m.)I was delighted to see the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) participate in the debate, because prior to his contribution we had two contributions from a couple of yesterday's men-the honourable member for La ""Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Mr Nugent-Rod Sawford was on his feet.",127
174,Ms HENZELL,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I was talking about opposition members. Once again, they trotted out the same old problems and issues. The honourable member for Lyne referred to the quality, not quantity argument. Let us go through the history of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993 and see what we are aiming to achieve. The amendments that I will refer to later do not indicate that we need to tinker at the edges. In his contribution last night, the honourable member for Menzies said: . . . we have a case of basically fiddling with something which is fundamentally rotten. What rhetoric! We are doing what this government always does, which is consult. with industry, deal with the realities and move and be flexible. We are working with business and the community to make things better. Before the training guarantee scheme came into effect in July 1990 there was no significant growth in structured training in this country. This country has not had a good record of investing in its own future, which includes industry investing in research and development or skilling its work force. The honourable member for Lyne was quite correct: we imported skills from other countries. While that may have been useful and an helpful in the post-war period-certainly we owe a great debt to our immigrants who brought skills into this country-that is not how we will forward our success in the future. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, prior to 1990, 68 per cent of enterprises with annual payrolls in excess of $200,000 spent nothing on formally training their work force. The introduction of the training guarantee levy has seen a fundamental change of attitude by enterprises in terms of training. In the time before the training guarantee scheme, many employers actively looked to see how they could reduce training to minimise the financial cost to business. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) mentioned, one effective way of gaining a skilled work force was to poach from other employers who had made the investment in training. That is hardly an equitable way to skill a work force. Today an overwhelming number of enterprises view structured training as an investment in improving the flexibility and quality of skills of their work force. Therefore, they achieve more productive outcomes for their business and the economy as a whole. Both the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for La Trobe-I cannot remember whether the honourable member for O'Connor did-mentioned the issue of quality versus quantity. The training guarantee levy aimed to involve business in developing its own training requirements. If we as a government had tried to tell business what it needed, we would have rightly had a hue and cry from the opposition about imposing further difficulties on business. We expect Australian businesses to be mature and to understand what is in their interests and what sorts of skills their work forces need. The bottom line is what investment will make their businesses"" successful and productive. I would have thought that returning to some sort of centralised control would not be in the interests of business and would not be supported by the opposition. Another argument that has been repeated in the debate this afternoon and this evening is the idea that once businesses discovered they were spending more than the 1.5 per cent required by the levy they started to cut back to the bottom line. I remind honourable members of what the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins)-at the time he introduced the Training Guarantee Bill in 1990 he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-said about the original aims of the bill: The Government aims, of course, to collect nothing. When we do collect nothing we will have succeeded in ensuring that the level of training enterprises has in fact been lifted._ The training guarantee is in fact a charge on the failure to train. We aimed to encourage businesses to make positive investments in their own success by training their work force. We only required businesses to pay a levy if they did not comply with the requirements. The evidence is that the majority of organisations with payrolls now in excess of $226,000, which covers about eight to 10 employees, have complied with this requirement. The amendments that we are introducing in this debate aim, in light of the experience of the operation of the scheme, to make it easier for businesses to comply with those requirements. Another issue that keeps coming up concerns rarts and junkets. The opposition is absolutely obsessed with rorts and junkets. Given the vast range of policy initiatives and challenges facing this country, what do we hear about from the opposition ad nauseam in question time? We hear about one specific policy initiative in one department. The opposition cannot get around the big policy issues. It has no vision or policies. Therefore, it really cannot get a handle on the big issues. The same miserable arguments are being trotted out in this debate. There is no doubt that it takes time for businesses to adapt to change. Since the training guarantee levy was introduced in 1990 there has been a huge challenge to all organisations. As we have moved into enterprise bargaining we have moved into multiskilling. There has been a huge requirement on organisations, as unions and management work together, to meet the challenges of enterprise bargaining and multiskilling. The emphasis on training has become absolutely crucial. If we are to have a flexible work force-we have taken away all the old awards and we are asking the work force to do jobs that traditionally other workers did on site; I refer to the coal industry in this regard-it is absolutely vital that training for multiskilling , by occur. Previous speakers on this side of the House have referred to the absolutely crucial issue of safety. I do not think it requires any further comment by me. By and large, the evidence put forward by the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), who is now in the House, in relation to civilians in the defence forces today indicates that the push for enterprise bargaining, which includes multiskilling, has been a very significant cultural change to deal with. But like all cultural changes and all changes in attitudes in business, this has taken some getting used to. I refer to an article from Australian Business Monthly of June 1993 entitled 'Managers of the new age'. There is some instructive information in it about the paradox between attitudes that are still prevalent among business leaders and the realities of their commitment to training. The article states: Most business executives believe that the 1990s' rash of heavily marketed management techniques amounts largely to a fad which is obscuring basic business principles. Yet major sectors of Australian business are busily implementing the very same practices, including ""total quality management"", ""benchmarking"" and ""outsourcing"". That is the paradoxical message from ABM's latest business poll, which sought responses from around 200 leading executives on latest management practices in their organisations. Asked ""Do you feel that the proliferation of new management practices has created a fad mentality in business to the detriment of basic business practices?"", almost 59 per cent of respondents replied ""yes"". The sentiment was strongest in the minerals and energy industry and in manufacturing, where more than 65 per cent agreed. Another question revealed that almost 62 per cent of companies in the survey had undertake- a total quality management (-QM? p-ogram, WIth more than 70 per cent sayIng It eIther met or exceeded expectations. Just over 60 per cent of these had implemented TQM over the past two years. I think this is a very interesting problem. I do not know too much about the visits to the Sevens. These are much publicised individual examples. I find it interesting that members of the. opposition trot out, as they did in private members' business this morning, one or two examples to make their point. There is an all too understandable paradox in the minds of business leaders that these things are a bit of fad and yet we are doing them. Why are we doing them? I suppose they may say it is because our competitors are doing them and are quite satisfied with the impact of this training on their organisations. On the training guarantee levy, the article states: Respondents maintained their negative view of the compulsory training guarantee levy. Asked if the levy was effective in impro.vin.g work-lace skills, more than 80 per cent saId It was eIther ineffective or minimally effective. Yet almost 45 per cent of respondents said the burden on tration costs from the training levy was acceptable, and 34 per cent said there had been no burden at all. I have not heard that sort of information being trotted out by members of the opposition from survey results. The article continues: Just over 54 per cent of respondents said they had implemented enterprise bargaining agreements with their workforces. Nearly 60 per cent of those said the results had met or exceeded expectations. As I said previously, an essential ingredient of workplace bargaining is multiskiIling, which requires a huge amount of training to back it up. The article further states: Almost 70 per cent of respo-dents said they had made safety programs an identifiable component of productivity objectives. The honourable member for O'Connor said that this is irrelevant to training and productivity, yet 200 leading executives of businesses have said that it was a very important issue. The honourable member for O'Connor mentio.ned the good old days where kids left school at 14 years of age and got on-the-job training. That did work, but what was the end result of that training? We had a significantly underskilled work force which was not productive. This government, compared with our opponents on the other side of the House, decided that something had to be done about these issues if this country was going to be economically competitive within the Asia-Pacific region. The training guarantee levy and the amendments we are talking about this evening are part of a raft of innovative industrial relations and productivity issues that we have been involved with. The Kelty task force has made a number of recommendations which will be considered by the government. This particular suggestion, which is probably the result of a number of businesses in regional Australia dumping all over the training guarantee levy, is only one recommendation that the government may look at. I am interested that the opposition is using as one of its key arguments what the Secretary of the ACTU has to say. Perhaps it is a very positive move. Let us have a look at what is happening in other countries on this matter. The honourable adminis- member for O'Connor is always asking, 'What about Asia?'. Well, what about Asia? Before we speak about the Asian experience, I should mention that the Clinton administration has made some very positive statements about our training guarantee levy and is looking to introduce it into the American system. I refer the House to an article entitled 'Quality workforce through on-the-job training study mission' which referred to a visit from 12 APEC member nations last year. Those APEC representatives were very impressed by our training guarantee levy. The article states: On 7 May 1993, at the Closing Session of the Study Mission overseas delegates commented very favourably on the Training Guarantee and particularly its effect in encouraging industry to be an active partner in the training of the workforce. The delegates also expressed their admiration for the enthusiasm shown for training by those organisations visited during the Study Mission program and support for the non-prescriptive structure of the levy. in fact, three countries (Malaysia, Canada and the Philippines) specifically said they would be following up Australia reo introduction of the Training Guarantee. Once again Australia is setting the pace and the standard. Let us have a look at what other countries are doing. France, one of our OECD colleagues, currently requires enterprises employing more than 10 people to fund training to an amount equal to 1.4 per cent of total labour costs-not unlike our training guarantee levy. Germa-y has had - long history of employer-umon cooperatIOn on training. The costs of vocational training are shared through a dual system between employers and state governments. Sweden has a Joint Industrial Training Council and through it employer associations and trade unions address vocational education issues. The Korean Vocational Training and Management Agency tests and certifi-s co-pe­ tence and supervises some publtc tramtng institutes. There are three distinct types of vocational training in Korea: public, in-house and authorised training. The Hong Kong Vocational Training Council operates a network of training centres that are financed from government revenue. Industry training authorities also operate and are financed from levies established by legislation. We are doing nothing more than many of our OECD and Asian competitors. Instead of going back to yesterday's solutions-which is about the only thing the opposition seems to do because it has no other policies-the opposition sh?uld ?e supporting these amendments which will increase flexibility into the system and provide increases in skills for our work force. Our biggest and best resource in this country are our people, our work force. Our challenge is to meet the productivity requirements to make us successful in our expansion as an export producing.natio-. yve will not do this without the effective tramtng of our work force. We know that we will have to face the challenge not only of skilling our young, unemployed people but also of reskilling our older, unemployed people ,:""ho have been displaced by industry restructunng. I say to those attending training programs in the coal industry, 'In our lifetime, each us will face the requirement to retrain and reskill as technology races ahead'. In this life we may need to look at the multiskilling required for members of parliament, one of the few areas where there is no bottom line. It does show if we read Hansard. Finally, there has been a very strong commitment to training by both employers and unions in the coal industry. I was pleased to see that part of the induction training-which is very important for highlighting safety issues in the coal industry-was provided through my own employee assistance program. We provided information on occupational health and safety issues, such as alcohol and drug abuse, to employees participating in on-the-job training. I applaud the training initiatives that are occurring in the hospitality industry in my electorate. (TIme expired)",127
175,Mr BRADFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"For the information of the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the good news is that, ultimately, we support these changes, although the bad news is that we support them only as a second-best option and a last resort. In fact, we intend to move an amendment which effectively states that we believe this act should cease to have total effect from 1 July 1994. In other words, we are still totally opposed to the concept of this particular training guarantee levy. From what the honourable member for Capricornia said, I think she still believes and perpetuates that great other lie: 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help you'. Let me tell the honourable member for Capricornia, in case she does not know-and if she moves amongst the businesses in her electorate she will soon find this out-that most busi-esses live in fear of that promise. In fact, I am sure that most of them regard it as a threat. I ask the honourable member for Capricornia to think about this question because the debate on this issue hinges on the answer: how far does the government want to go ultimately in telling people how to run their businesses? Most businesses in this country, particularly small businesses, as they are the ones that suffer most from these sorts of levies, as the government euphemistically of calls them, are already operating in a burea?cratic straitjacket that makes their very surVlV al or existence on a day-today basis very difficult indeed. I do not believe that anyone in this we on our side certainly do not-underrates the importance of training at all levels in and out of industry. There is no doubt in my that, mind-and there never has been-that training is an· absolutely vital component Australia's urgent quest to become internasuggesting tionally competitive. Obviously, training is important part of balancing that particular equation. . In my analysis of .the effect of the training guarantee levy-and I have closely observed it first-hand in a number of business environboils ments-it has simply failed in many ways to achieve its objectives. Superficially and quite correctly, I suppose, the honourable member staffing. for Capricornia alluded to instances where people have said, 'We're using the levy; we're spending the money on training. It is effective in that sense', but this fails to account of the very practical ways in which this particular 'approach fails to reach its ultimate objective. The most common complaint about the levy-and it has been referred to in this debate on a number of occasions-is that simply makes it more difficult to do business. It increases businesses' costs. It increases cost of keeping records and paperwork, which is not insignificant for this particular training guarantee levy. It has brought to the attention of some companies the level of expenditure on training and, ironically, some of them have found that they are spending too much on training. From talking to some people, I believe it has actually led to a reduction in the amount of money that companies are businesses, spending on training. Ultimately, the training guarantee levy fails because it really only ends up being a tax jobs. This is the bottom line. All taxes business translate directly into lost jobs. That is why, philosophically, we are poles apart this place in a debate on an issue such as this, particularly when unemployment is the greatrationalise est problem, both socially and economically, that Australia faces today. In an environment such as the one in which we exist now, there is an urgent need for businesses to create jobs. One is easily able to make a connection between, say, the placenumber of small businesses that exist in Australia and the existing level of unemployment. It may be trite to say it, but it is a fact if every small business in Australia could employ one more person, that would overin come the unemployment problem. I am not by any means that it is as simple an as that; it is not. But it makes the point that there is a direct con:elation between adding to a business's costs and a business's ability to employ new people or, more importantly in some respects, to maintain the employment of existing staff. That is very often what this down to. As the government adds to business costs, business is forced to decide whether it can maintain its existing levels of Time and again we have observed that, as a result of not only this levy but also other take government charges and bureaucratic requirements of business, businesses have been forced to make a decision to reduce their level of staffing. Therefore, there is a direct correlation between staffing levels and the cost of doing business, which includes all costs-not it only government levies, charges and taxes. Every time we hear the word 'levy'-and the that is what the government wants to call all these things; for example, the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy and, dare I even give the government any ideas, the proposed jobs levy-we simply ,.have to substitute the word 'tax'. We cannot beat around the bush and talk about levies. What we are talking about are taxes. If ever there was a time to take taxes and charges off it is now, for the reasons I have already outlined. There has already been mention in this on debate about the fact that the own task force on on regional development of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was against the training in guarantee levy and there has been an attempt by the honourable member for Capricornia to that particular decision. But the task force made that decision on very good grounds. Its members were out there, running around Australia and looking at what was actually happening on the ground and, as a consequence of that, they made that recommendation. We do not need to look far to see the ways in which a levy is 'not providing the training it was designed for'. I have heard of cases where all day training seminars are held in five-star hotels and turn out to be nothin'g more than a smorgasbord morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea with a sporadic half-hour lecture thrown in for good measure. I realise that there are limitations and requirements. I am reluctant to talk about the five-star hotels that do it because some of them are in my electorate. But to be intellectually honest and, I suspect, politically correct, I need to say that, even if something wrong is occurring in my electorate, it is still wrong. I do not think we can play down the fact that this has occurred. Whilst in a way we might be able to say that the money is being spent on training, it is obviously stretching the word 'training' to an extreme. We could talk about long weekend training seminars on islands which I will not mention, as many of them are close to my electorate and that of the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations Johns), who is at the table. This thing goes on. This is not ultimately genuine training activity at all. There are some people in the training industry-and I have some friends amongst them, so I need to apologise to them for having the courage of my convictions here today-who are obviously doing very well out of the training guarantee levy, but that is not the purpose of it. It has created a tremendous business opportunity and, in terms of the status quo, a genuine business opportunity. But, in that sense, it is being abused. In my view, it is no wonder that, with all these pressures, many small businesses have closed their doors. Many of them are being forced to move offshore. I refer to a business in my own electorate of MCPherson. Representatives of a furniture manufacturing company-and there are a couple of those companies in my electorate-came to see me recently and pointed out how difficult they were finding it to cope in Australia at the moment. They were particularly critical of tariff reductions. Ultimately, I convinced them, because this is what I believe, that it was not the reduction in tariffs that they .had the real problem with. After all, as I see it, tariff reduction is a vital ingredient in the quest for us to become internationally competitive. The problem was ultimately with increasing government costs. They were able to target directly the training guarantee levy and the superannuation guarantee levy as particular costs which were causing them problems.",130
176,Unknown,TRAINING GUARANTEE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,132
177,Mr BRADFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"At the moment we are dealing with the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill and before I was interrupted by the dinner break I was indicating that the opposition intends to move an amendment in due course which will effectively scrap this training guarantee levy completely, notwithstanding our. general support for the provisions of this bill which effectively improve what we regard as being fundamentally flawed legislation. Let me reiterate that our objection to this and our objection since it was introduced by the (Mr government is essentially based on. the fact that firstly, big businesses are already spending at least the amount of the levy and in fact some of them, having had that brought to their attention by virtue of the levy, may well have been discouraged to reduce their expenditure on training and, secondly, small business cannot afford to meet the commitments of the levy, even the more flexible commitments which are being brought in by this legislation. I use the word levy fairly loosely because it really is a euphemism for tax. As I was saying before the dinner break, we are opposed to increasing the tax burden on business.",132
178,Mr FILING,TRAINING GUARANTEE,A tax on jobs.,132
179,Mr BRADFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"It is exactly what the honourable member for Moore says it is. As I was pointing out before dinner, it is simply a tax on jobs. There is a direct correlation between taxes and charges on business and business's ability to create jobs or, as I was saying, even more importantly perhaps, to maintain levels of employment. This was introduced in what must have been emphatically the worse possible time, in the middle of a recession. It was, of course, another imposition on business and businesses at that stage were downsizing, down staffing, and this was a further nail in the coffin. The honourable members on the other side do not seem to understand this connection, that business essentially must maintain certain cost levels if it is to maintain its staff, otherwise staffing levels fall. Our approach in part to solving the unemployment problem, which we have acknowledged on both sides is the single biggest social and economic problem facing Australia, is to allow business to get on with its job of creating jobs. The way to do that is not only to not impose further taxes on business but actually to go about methodically reducing business's costs by removing taxes and charges. The other element of this particular levy that concerns business is the very fact that it involves administration expense in complying with the law. For most businesses it is a considerable and unnecessary burden and that is our concern. Mr Adams-What is your policy on training?",132
180,Mr BRADFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Our policy on training is quite different in its effect; we recognise the importance of training. As I said when the honourable member was not here earlier, we understand that training is a very important part of the desperate need to make Australian industry competitive. But we simply do not subscribe to the point of view that the government does that seems to be that it can impose these sorts of solutions on businesses. Where does it draw the line? How far does it want to interfere in a person's right to run his or her business or a company's business as he or she sees fit? Mr Adams-What about the national interests?",133
181,Mr BRADFORD,TRAINING GUARANTEE,The national interest in this case is served by job creation.,133
182,Mr FILING,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"More jobs. Mr BRADFORD'""-As the honourable member for Moore says again. The answer of course to training is to educate businesses on the importance of training-that is not a difficult process. Importantly, if we allow business to operate unfettered to a greater extent than the government philosophically wants to, then simple pressure of competition will ensure that businesses spend money on training. Those honourable members opposite have no idea. They do not know anything about running businesses. For most businesses every expenditure decision boils down to a cost benefit analysis. It is not difficult to demonstrate that there are benefits for business in training, as there are benefits of course for the nation. Businesses, big and small, can be convinced and shown that there are benefits in training for them; they do not need to be forced. How far do we go in forcing them? We have got the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy, jobs levies, payroll taxes, all sorts of other taxes and charges and the government wonders why businesses are putting people off. The answer appears, at least to me, to be so obvious that I wonder why the government does not get the message. Before the dinner break I was referring to a particular company in my own electorate which came to me as it was having difficulty surviving in a competitive environment. When I went through its figures with a trained eyed-I suppose I could say that modestly-I was able to identify that its costs were too high for it to be viable. We identified particularly things like this training guarantee levy which was a cost to the company. Many businesses, of course, are prepared to spend money on training but it becomes quite ludicrous when the training guarantee levy forces them in effect to go out and find what are very often just mickey mouse types of training opportunities or even send people on courses and programs which really are not much use to them because of this bureaucratic heavy hand hanging over their heads. The scheme does not work. As r was pointing out before when the honourable member opposite was not here, even Mr Kelty in his regional task force has recognised that. It must have taken some digging for it to find that. But even in its recommendations it has come to realise that the scheme does not work. It is for these reasons that we are opposed to this levy and it is our intention to move an amendment which, hopefully, some of the sensible people on the other side who have actually had some exposure to business and understand the connection between business viability and cost, structures might even be moved to come and support. They would be having the same input from many of their constituent businesses that this training levy is not working and it just becomes an impost as far as business is concerned. I wrote to the former minister for industry, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), about this particular company that was having difficulties. Its initial problem, to put it in context, was that it was experiencing some severe competition and it was concerned about the reduction of tariffs and I explained to it that another ingredient in making Australia more internationally competitive was in fact the governments's move to reduce tariffs to a lower level over time and in general we have supported that. The minister in his reply said: It is a disappointing to note your comments about the industry's viewthis particular business is in the furniture industryof the training guarantee levy as an imposed cost. Training is not an unnecessary cost on operations, but an essential part of improving productivity and one. there are always new skills to be learnt in any business, if a firm wishes to remain competitive. I make no apology for the government's training guarantee levy as I consider that any firm not spending at least one and a half per cent of its payroll on training will rapidly fall behind in competitive stakes. The minister is using the approach, 'I'm from the government; I'm here to help you'. All businesses fear this more than anything. All businesses want to remain competitive; they are not stupid. Most businesses can easily be convinced that it is in their interest to spend money on training. I will strongly support in due course the amendment to be moved by the opposition to throw the training levy out. Debate interrupted. NA",133

189,Mrs SULLIVAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"My concern relates to an article printed in yesterday's Australian Financial Review entitled - Yes, Question Time is back, all of youse great big logs' and written by one Christine Wallace. I will read into the record the paragraphs that misrepresent my position: Mr Keating's decision to embrace reform is a good Now comes the fight about what exactly those reforms should be. One of the key proposals is to free the prime minister from attending every Question Time and roster groups of ministers to attend it in rotation the with Mr Keating facing parliamentary questions once or twice a week. It was criticised yesterday by Mr Howard in his incarnation as the manager of Opposition business. 'If he thinks reforming the House means reducing the accountability of the prime minister and senior ministers to the Parliament, then we're not going to take that laying down,' Mr Howard said. He went on to attack the idea 'that the prime minister can go swanning around the country on political safaris while Parliament is sitting', describing it as 'quite unacceptable to me and to all members of the Liberal Party'. The article' continues: Howeverin juxtaposition to the statement of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)three Liberal MPs did sign off on a House of Representatives procedure committee report, About TIme: Bills, Questions and Working Hours, last October which recommended the roster system. It is the one used by the 'Mother of Pari iaments' , Westminster-and what is good enough for West,minster is generally good enough for Liberal MPs. I do not intend to debate the situation, but I think I can summarise the article fairly by saying that the message given by those paragraphs I have quoted is that the honourable member for Bennelong, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, is in conflict with a view subscribed to in the report by the Liberal members of the committee. I am one of the two Liberal members of the committee, together with the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing); there are only two. So that honourable members can see the juxtaposition of the views ascribed to me and the other Liberal member of the committee, I will read into the record what we actually signed our names to. I refer to pages 26 and 27 of the report: The committee was unable to reach agreement on a system of rostering which would advance the aims of both' the Government and the Opposition in question time. However, the committee does support a limited experiment with a rostered question time; using and extending the Monday question time for this purpose. . . It is recommended that, as a trial for two sitting periods, (a) question time each Monday be in the form of two consecutive 30 minute segments each with a minimum of 8' questions to be asked; (b) Ministers be rostered so that Ministers representing each portfolio (except Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury and Finance) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs attend to answer questions in one segment per sitting cycle. The grouping of portfolios and - lIocation of segments to be agreed by the OppositIOn and the Government; (c) the Opposition to be able to request the presence of one additional Minister, other than the Prime Minister, per segment by informing the Speaker in writing prior to the sitting of the House on the Monday to which the request relates. That makes the point in very brief summary. The recommendation relates only to Mondays of sitting weeks-for a limited period, as an experiment-as against the 'once or twice' a week as quoted in the article.",134

194,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I will not dwell too much on what the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has already described. During the publication of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure report and the dissenting report, which was authored by me and the honourable for Moncrieff, an allegation was floated around in the media that somehow our views were the opposite of the views of the leadership of the coalition. That particular view was perpetuated in the article by Christine Wallace in yesterday's Australian Financial Review. I, too, am upset at the misrepresentation of our position by the inference-the almost direct inference-that we supported a recommendation that would have allowed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to avoid being questioned in the House during question time except once or twice a week. That is quite incorrect. The recommendation was to allow for a limited period of rostering to allow the Prime Minister, along with other ministers, to be rostered for the first and second Mondays of the two-week sitting periods. As a consequence, I think that perpetuated the story that was being peddled in the media which, of course, is quite untrue. NA (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT' BILL 1993 Second R.eading Debate resumed.",135
195,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I rise to support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. The Minister for 'Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in his second reading speech described the training guarantee scheme as follows, and I think it is an appropriate summary: The training guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into this House on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training. The scheme was introduced as part of the government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled work force which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy. The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry'S commitment to training. As the signs of economic recovery strengthen, we must be prepared for an increase in demand for skilled people. . Honourable members would be aware that the latest figures in respect of demand for skilled people are the highest in three years. The rationale that the minister has outlined focuses upon two very important aspects: firstly, the skilling of our work force to ensure that Australia becomes internationally competitive; and, secondly, using skilling to ensure that, as economic recovery occurs and jobs are created, people will have the necessary skills to take up those jobs. Prior to the introduction of the Training Guarantee Act in 1989, the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirmed some earlier assessments that a high proportion of employers did little or no training. At that time, it was estimated that the average expenditure on training for all employees was about 2 per cent of annual payroll. It was also estimated that nearly. 60 per cent of private sector employers with an annual payroll of $200,000 or more spent nothing on structured training. At the same time, average expenditure on training by small firms with up to 20 employees was less than one per cent. Over 80 per cent of those firms did not incur training expenditure. There was clearly a need prior to the introduction of the act to ensure that as a nation we increased the training of our work force. The amendments before the House were again summarised succ-nctly by the minister in his second reading speech as follows: This bill amends the principal act to give effect to two amendments promised by the government in the election context and also includes other amendments to minimise compliance costs and give greater flexibility to the scheme. In line with election commitments, the bill provides employers with enhanced flexibility to plan training expenditure over a longer period by allowing excess eligible expenditure incurred in one year to be carried forward to the next year ... this ... will assist those employers who have a need to train extensively within a short time frame, but whose training needs may not be so great in the following year. ' At the same time . . . provision is made for employers who have a training expenditure shortfall in one year to make it up through additional training expenditure in the following year. The second election commitment implemented by this bill is to remove the need for employers to deduct training subsidies provided by government bodies for apprentices and trainees when calculating their net eligible training expenditure. That has the effect of doubling the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount, which is officially known as the 'deemed amount', to $2,260. The other amendments which the minister describes as providing efforts to minimise compliance costs and give greater flexibility to the scheme are described in the explanatory memorandum as removing the aid resttiction on student work experience; updating and widening access to the grouping provisions of the act; clarifying the meaning of eligible training program; expanding the meaning of eligible training expenditure; and updating the provisions in relation to liquidators to recognise administrators appointed under the Corporations Law. The minister, in his second reading speech, articulates the philosophy behind those approaches as follows: . .. this bill encompasses a number of measures to make the legislation more business-friendly, especially for the small business sector. These amendments offer significant benefits to business and their retrospectivity to I July 1993 will ensure their immediate use on receiving assent I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to an interview whichMinister Free did on the Lateline program hosted by the ABC's Kerry O'Brien on 10 June 1993. Again, I think the minister, in his capacity as an interviewee, brings to bear I)ome important aspects so far as the need to increase the training of our work force is concerned. The minister was joined on that occasion by Mr Ian Spicer, who would be well known to honourable members as the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In the course of that interview, Minister Free said that the training expenditure survey-surveys which are done regularly-conducted in 1989 before the introduction of the levy: · .. reported that 58 percent of respondents engaged in no structured training at all. Now the survey by the Australian Tax Office in the financial year '9091, the first year of the operation of the levy, found as you mentioned in your introduction, 97 percent compliance. Looking at the small business sector, those firms with payrolls between $220,000 and $500,000 reported 94 percent compliance. The money is certainly being spent. As you say, there is a more extensive survey to look at the quality of the training that is being offered, Mr Spicer said, in part: · .. I think what we have is a levy which is just totally inflexible and to that extent, it really doesn't meet the variety of needs which individual companies have. For instance, it has an assumption that training is going to be at the same level of expenditure every year. What do you do with a company that might want to spend a lot of money this year, but not a great deal of money next year or the year after. It is just inflexible in that sense, and also, I think it probably doesn't really provide a focus for the training. What the levy is saying is just spend, spend on anything, so long as it meets the criteria, without really looking at the quality, as you indicated out the outset. The minister replied: Ian described an inflexible system. It happens not to be the Government system. Ian is apparently unaware that prior to the election, the Government undertook to allow two-year averaging of expenditure under the levy, for example, concern which Ian is talking about. · .. to .-ake !t more flexible. And in a very real sense, It IS qUite open for business to be the drivt;r unde.r the current arrangements. I mean, if one consl.ders two firms, one of which indulges in c-eatlve spending-seminars in resorts and that kind of thing-and one of its competitors that spe!lds the money on genuine training, I know which fi- I would rather be working for, and I know which firm has a better chance of survival. Because the bottom line in all of this as shown by work of the Bureau of Industry Economics is that small .business which does not train when surveyed, experIenced a 65 percent failure rate' small business which does involve itself in trai-ing, even at the management level, has a 90-odd chance of success. I have quoted at length because I think those quotes accurately portray, so far as the minister is concerned, the philosophy behind the training legislation and the philosophy behind trying to ensure that we raise the previously very poor status of training in our country to ensure that we have an internationally competitive skilled work force. It is the case that the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act is the subject of ongoing evaluation. That has occurred in the past and it is ongoing. I think it is important to look at the training guarantee arrangements in the context of the white paper on employment opportunities and the question of long-term unerhas well - ployment in our country. There have been a number of criticisms from. the other side of the House-they are reflected in the opposition amendment proposing that the scheme terminate on 1 July this year. But those with standing in the area of training in this country have a much more open mind about the concept. The Austr-lian Financial Review of 30 July last year reported: . But the training industry itself has been more reluctant to call the training levy a complete failure. The director of the Adelaide-based National Centre for Vocational Education Research ·Dr Bill Hall, said that it was not yet possible t- gauge whether the levy had been successful in achieving the aims of its creators. ""Training actually now gets into the headlines of . The AUstralian Financial Review. That would never to meet that very have occurred before. So, not having strenuously searched all of the newspapers or periodicals for wholesale endorsement, that is saying that here is a scheme which has been introduced by the government which has dragged up the very poor levels of training in this country to a stage where we are now in a position of looking forward to being much more internationally competitive so far as a skilled work force is concerned. But, given the clear focus by the government this financial year on long term employment creation, we have the opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness and some of the alleged difficulties which the training guarantee scheme causes. Honourable members on this side of the House, and perhaps some honourable members opposite, may be aware that I had the good fortune to be a member of a caucus committee chaired by my colleagues the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). The report of that committee was entitled 'Growth plus' equals the employment challenge. We hear a lot from the other side that small business is burdened by on-costs and administrative burdens. In the course of the report, which took the form of a submission to the Expert Committee on the Future of Employment and Unemployment preparing a green paper which was. released in December 1993, my colleagues on this side of the House recommended as follows: There is some evidence to indicate that on-costs can function as a disincentive to the employment of additional labour in some circumstances. The Government should develop a broad strategy to minimise the employment deterrent consequences of non-wage imposts attached to company payrolls. The Expert Committee should further examine policy options in this area. I refer honourable members to some of the reasons behind that recommendation. We reported as follows: The introduction in recent years of levies based on company payrolls, such as the superannuation guarantee, which shores up retirement income, and the training guarantee, which encourages in-company training, are necessary ingredients of government policies. They are both designed to serve long term goals of improving national savings and enhancing our skills base . . . We need to be sure that the imposition of these imposts does not create perceptions in business of rising costs that would act as an impediment to further recruitment ... The Government needs to assess the effects of such perceptions and take active steps to minimise any deterrent effects. The Government should pay particular attention to the effects on small businesses. Throughout the late 1980's this sector posted the strongest employment growth, increasing at an average annual rate of 2.1 per cent between 1986 and 1991 as against 1.4 per cent for large businesses over the same period. Similarly the small business sector has proven stronger in the recovery growing at 3.8 per cent throughout 1991/92 as against a fall of 12.2 per cent in employment in the large business sector. Industry surveys also show that the small business sector is more optimistic about business conditions than other sectors. It is therefore essential that the possible impediments to increased employment, such as on-costs, are thoroughly assessed and where possible removed. It was a clear suggestion to the expert committee chaired by Dr Michael Keating of the Prime Minister's department to look squarely at the question of employment impediments by way of on-costs and administrative burdens. Honourable members opposite seem to assume that that automatically occurs so far as the training guarantee, the superannuation guarantee or other measures are concerned. It often bemuses me that, in the course of the election campaign, opposition members were themselves articulating the greatest possible burden that could have been placed by way of compliance measures on small business, that is, the GST. The expert committee, which reported and released its green paper in December 1993, deals quite extensively with these issues, although in only a couple of pages, and comes right to the heart of the issues which now confront us. I want to quote from the section entitled 'Non-wage labour costs' found on pages 55 and 56 of the green paper Restoring full employment. Hopefully, by doing so I will alleviate some of the entrenched misconceptions honourable members opposite have in this area. The section states: Employers often argue that non-wage labour costs in Australia restrict the capacity and willingness of employers to expand their firms and to recruit additional staff. These costs include charges such as superannuation, payroll tax and workers compensation ... The next paragraph states: Compared with other OECD countries, Australia has very low levels of on-costs. A recent study ranked Australia fourth lowest in terms of on-costs amongst OECD countries. In considering policy options in this area, it is also important to understand that reductions in on-costs would not necessarily result in correspondingly lower labour costs in total. Page 56 of the paper goes on to state: Nonetheless, there are some aspects of Australia's system of on-costs which do appear to warrant further consideration as part of a comprehensive approach to employment policy. The committee then refers to the administrative complexities arising from the superannuation guarantee and to workers compensation and concludes by stating: Employer groups also argue that the administrative burden associated with various forms of taxation and business regulation can be as much of a concern as the direct costs of the measures themselves. For example, the Training Guarantee Levy now requires employers to document the training provided to members of staff, although for those employers spending considerably more than the one per cent minimum this should not be too onerous. On balance, the Committee is not persuaded that these issues have a significant impact on aggregate levels of employment and unemployment. Nonetheless, it is clear that they can have an adverse effect in specific circumstances and that there may be opportunities for policy improvements to obviate these problems. It appears that a review of the employment impact of non-wage labour costs is justified, with particular reference to the interaction of different forms of taxation, the effect of on-costs at the threshold points, and the administrative implications for small and medium sized enterprises. This throws the issues up squarely for the government in the course of consideration and production of its white paper. I think the report of the expert committee is a balanced assessment and it puts the training guarantee levy in context. We on this side of the House take the view that the most pressing social and economic problem we have in Australia is long-term unemployment. It is clear that, as the recovery occurs, more than growth will be required to ensure that those who are long-term unemployed will be taken up into the work force. It is also obvious to anyone who has looked at the available evidence that those who are more likely to enter into the work force as the recovery ensues are those who have skills. It is therefore incumbent upon us to ensure that we have structures in place to ensure that our work force is as skilled as possible. That will do two things: ensure that we are, as a skilled work force, internationally competitive; and ensure that in the course of the recovery, which I note the opposition continues to decry but which all the evidence states is here and growing stronger every day, jobs will become available to the long-term unemployed. It is generally recognised that the policies which need to be adopted in this. area can best be described as growth plus. Growth by itself will not be enough to take up the long-term unemployed. There need to be additional. measures. Some of the additional measures we need to focus on include a careful assessment of the training of our work force, a careful assessment of the training opportunities available to the long-term unemployed and, as the discussion paper makes clear, a very careful assessment, not in the way often put by honourable members opposite, of the extent to which, if at all, administrative burdens and on-costs are an inhibitor to additional employment. I have outlined the provisions of the amendment bill and indicate to the House that I support the amendments. They will, as the minister made clear in his second reading speech, make the scheme more flexible, further relieve small business of administrative burdens and ensure that the training mechanisms we have in place will raise the previous appalling standards of training which we had in Australia.",135
196,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I rise tonight to speak on theTraining Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993. I am pleased to be following the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) because during his speech he suggested that he had not scoured the papers of this nation to see whether there was an endorsement of the changes that are being made or, in fact, of the training guarantee levy. I will bring to the House's attention some of the comments that have been made by industry groups through the nation's papers. It is just a pity that the honourable member for Perth did not take the time to read what industry, the job creators, the people who pay the bills, the farming organisations, are saying about this iniquitous tax. Changes to the training guarantee levy are really an annual event in parliament. It is a bit like the Melbourne Cup. We know that a bill will come around every' year and we know that there will be more changes. We can bet our lives on the fact that there will be some changes because the government constantly struggles to bring this wayward animal, the training guarantee levy, to heel. This levy must be brought to heel. The training guarantee levy is-we should all know; we have debated it so many timesan attempt by the federal government to force employers to train their work force whether they need it, whether they can afford it or whether they even want it. It is forced on them by the federal government through the provisions of this bill. The levy was originally introduced in 1990 and required enterprises with a payroll of more than $200,000 to spend one per cent of their payroll on approved formal training. As we all know, that formal training has come in for quite a lot of abuse since the introduction of this bill. Those who did not spend the one per cent would be forced to pay that percentage of their payroll to the government. The levy has since risen to 1.5 per cent and the payroll threshold has risen to $222,000. The changes proposed in this piece of legislation will marginally improve the system's flexibility, but it really is a classic case of rearranging the deck chairs on the TItanic. Like the TItanic, this bill will go down-perhaps not this bill in this House tonight, but ultimately it will go down. It is certainly destined to bite the dust. I make this prediction on the basis of the recommendations of two of the government's most lauded and recently launched advisory reports: the Kelty regional task force report and the green paper Restoring full employment. The Kelty report explained the administrative costs and the potential abuses of the training guarantee levy. It states: Regional employers said the TGL had created an administrative burden and was failing to provide the training for which it was designed. The Taskforce was told that while many employers where committed to providing training for. all employees, other employers were distorting the intent of the program by spending training money on, for example, executive training· weekends in luxury resorts... Given the problems with the TGL and the fact that it has not provided training for groups which really need it, the Taskforce believes it should be suspended. This is the Kelty task force, which travelled right across the country. My understanding is that it was granted a million dollars to bring this report to government and the report recommended that the training guarantee levy should be suspended. The report goes on to recommend a three year suspension of the training guarantee levy and a one per cent hike in company tax. But that is another chapter in an ongoing saga of this government's attack on private enterprise-and I will not digress on this occasion. But if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) sums up on this bilI tonight, I will be interested in hearing his comments on the recommendation that the Kelty task force made on the training guarantee levy. Here we have a bill which has come before the parliament which will make mild adjustments to the training guarantee levy while the government must be considering the recommendations of that Kelty task force. Thegovemment's jobs paper was a little more veiled in its assessment of the training guarantee levy but, nonetheless, critical. It states: The major deficiencies in our current education and training systems appear to lie. in the area of vocational and workforce training. Is that not the exact area which the training guarantee levy was introduced to address? The government's own green paper states that there are 'major deficiencies in our current education and training systems'. That is what the training guarantee levy was introduced to address, yet four years after the training guarantee levy has been introduced we have a government green paper being critical of the very area that the training guarantee levy was meant to address. If one of our greatest weaknesses continues to be vocational and work force training, then the training guarantee levy is clearly an unmitigated disaster, even by the government's own standards, as suggested in the green paper. However, it appears that the minister is quite determined the to lumber on with the baggage of the training guarantee levy. The training guarantee levy is really quite beyond salvation. Whilst the moderate changes provided for in this legislation are useful, there is no escaping the financial costs, the administrative burden and the potential for abuse which are associated with the training guarantee levy. It continues to amaze me how even this government could dream up such a convoluted scheme which has inevitably hurt the good businesses and simply been avoided by the bad. It should have been abundantly clear that good business enterprises will train their staff to appropriate standards without the heavy hand of government to remind them of the need to do so. It is simply good business to train where training is required. However, without the imposition of the training guarantee levy, wise businesses would. have been spared an unnecessary administrative burden and been able to base training decisions on what the company and its employees needed rather than some arbitrary government figure. Some businesses of less repute probably do not train their staff as they should. .Such enterprises are unlikely to be around for the long haul. But, in any case, compeIIing them to train staff with the threat of financial penalty will result in one of two outcomes: they will get their staff in the first training option that comes along, good or bad, because they are not really committed to training as long as they spend the money on training; or, alternatively, they will rort the whole scheme. There are reams of supportive anecdotal evidence around that tell us the story of the middle management conferences in establishments such as Club Med and the like. One does not really need a fertile brain to imagine what sort of training conferences would be carried. out at Club Med. But there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that shows that many middle management schemes go to these places under the guise of training staff and which then write it off against their training guarantee levy commitment. These basic flaws in the training guarantee levy are confirmed by a recent survey of employers conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The survey found that, although training had increased in - ust under half of the firms surveyed, in many mstances the training had not been required and did not address the specific skills shortages. It appears that many companies were forced to spend a lot of money on a very pointless exercise at a time of unprecedented economic downturn when they could least afford it. There are plenty of people in businesses in my own electorate of Maranoa who have been to see me in the last couple of years and said, 'Survival is much more important than training staff. When you are putting off staff to survive, you haven't got the money to put into training, and it is a case of the business surviving until the economy turns and then you start to get on with the job of training'. But it' was a pointless exercise for many to continue to train staff while putting staff off at the same time. The survey goes on to record that two-thirds of the surveyed firms felt that' the training guarantee levy had not led to any improvement in training; half of the firms surveyed recorded significant increases in costs as a result of the levy. It is perhaps pertinent to bear in mind that training needs vary enormously from company to company. Company A may need to splurge on training in one year to cope with new equipment and better technology in which they may have invested but will then only spend a minimal amount in subsequent years. Company B may have access only to the specialised training it requires every three or four years and spends nothing in the interim. I suggest that there are many firms like that in regional and remote Australia because access to some of the training they wish to involve their staff in is, in many cases, far removed from their place of work. Both companies could end up with exceptionally well trained work forces, but they would fail the arbitrary tests enforced by this government and be penalised. Alternatively, they could meet the government's target with unnecessary training programs. Whichever way we look at this, it is the businesses that bear the cost-the pointless cost-forced on them by this training guarantee levy. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who spoke prior to the dinner break, suggested in her contribution to this debate that business does not appreciate this cost. This is one of the members of the government-the honourable member for Capricornia, an electorate on the central Queensland coast. If she had cared to read this morning's Canberra TImes, she would be aware that business certainly does not appreciate the cost. In reference to this piece of legislation, the Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bryan Noakes, is reported as having .said that the changes: . . . appean-d to only slightly organisation believed was a bad and counterproductive impos,t on business. That is from the peak employer body, the peak employer organisation, which represents chambers of commerce and chambers of industry right across this nation. That is what it had to say about it. The Industrial Director of the National Farmers Federation, James Ferguson, is reported in the (;anberra TImes as saying: ' ... regardless of the Government's intentions, the Training Guarantee Charge still represented an additional cost to employers which should be totally removed. That is what the National Farmers Federation-another employer group-thinks of it. If honourable members read the Canberra TImes this morning, they would also have noticed that the' employer groups have been caught by surprise by important government changes to the training guarantee levy scheme. Apparently, there has not been much consultation with the industry on this bill; they have been caught by surprise. The government could do well to heed the advice of the people who pay the bills. It is a pity that the honourable member for Perth did not scour this morning's papers either. In his contribution he said that he had not done so. I would have thought that the first thing that every member of parliament did on getting up in the morning would be to scour the papers to see what they had to say and were reporting. The complete inappropriateness of the scheme is demonstrated by the magical formula of 1.5 per cent of company payrolls which underpiris the training guarantee levy. Exactly how did the government assess that that level would adequately train every work force in the country, from top-notch legal firms to funeral directors to used car outlets? The parliamentary secretary might throw some light on that subject at the end of the debate. I doubt whether much thought or analysis went into the scheme at all. I believe that the 1.5 per cent formula was a stab in the dark. It made the government appear to be responding to the training crisis when in fact it was doing little more than slapping a new tax on ameliorate what his businesses . Aside from the clear ineffectiveness of the scheme, it is chilling to consider how many jobs the cost of the training guarantee levy may have ruled out. Then again, the human cost of indirect taxes on businesses has never really been a concern of this government. We only have to look at the unemployment queues-':""and they are still far too high in this, the lucky nation-to understand that the human cost of mismanagement by this government has been borne by the million people who have not got jobs as well as by the many thousands of small businesses which have had to close their doors because of the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once said we had to have. The goyernment· has continued to pursue compulsory superannuation, payroll tax, fuel tax and sales tax with such vigour that one wonders whether the government is really determined to cripple small and medium sized businesses and wipe out thousands of jobs in the process. We only have to look at the taxes that were slapped on everyone in this nation in the last budget and the reception that it got by the people of Australia. It was all about more taxes. Not only does this training guarantee levy drain funds which could be better spent contributing to the wages of a new employee, but the addition of a new staff member blows out the payroll and consequently increases the company's training obligation. A refrain that I constantly hear from businesses throughout my electorate and all across the country is that the cost of employing new staff and meeting the government's administrative requirements is simply prohibitive. The training guarantee levy has got to go. If the government's continued attempts to modify the scheme are not sufficient evidence of its inflexibility and irrelevance, the of various surveys and anecdotal evidence should confirm that it is a very expensive mistake. Unfortunately, the cost is not being borne by the government but by the productive heart of the economy and by young job seekers who have been priced out of employment markets by the government's obsession with indirect taxes. The National and Liberal parties have opposed the training guarantee levy since its inception. Unlike the government, the coalition has a long standing commitment to removing indirect taxes which cripple small and medium sized business. It is, after all, these enterprises which will lead us out of this recession and provide jobs for many of the thousands consigned to the dole queue by the anti-growth policies of this government. If any of my colleagues on the other side of the House are courageous enough to admit that the training guarantee levy was a costly and damaging mistake, I urge them to support the coalition parties' amendment which provides for its imminent demise and eventual abolition. I support the amendment that we will be moving in this chamber. I believe it is the sensible approach to this bill and I look forward to seeing some support come from the other side of the House if there are any courageous members on that side.",139
197,Mr BEVIS,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"After listening to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I think we need to do a spot audit on the training guarantee obligations of the National Party. It is obviously not spending the guarantee money on proper training or else the honourable member for Maranoa is not attending the courses. I have a couple of comments in relation to the matters which he raised. The honourable member for Maranoa seemed concerned at a report which I also read in today's paper that some employers had been surprised by these moves. He should know as well as anybody in this place that we cannot always believe everything we read in the paper. As has been mentioned a number of times in this debate-and I think even this much would have been understood by the honourresults able member for Maranoa-the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill is the result of an election commitment which was well known months ago. Indeed, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) debated the issue in public on t.elevision and advised Mr Spicer of the Confederation of Australian Industry of the election commitment in June of last year. It was contained in the budget papers. Obviously, the National Party has not been running its normal run of the mill program on budget papers or it has not done its job with the honourable member for Maranoa. He might care to look through the budget papers to acquaint himself with the comments on the guarantee charge. 'Also, the government amendments were referred to on 4 September last year in the Weekend Australian. Lest there be any doubt, finally, the bill was introduced mid-December last year. The honourable member for Maranoa was correct that a newspaper article which appeared this morning stated that there was some surprise about this measure. However, if I were him, I would not pick up the newspaper and run with every story for the sake of filling in part of the 20 minutes that is allocated to him in the House. I found a couple of other comments which the honourable member made to be somewhat interesting. He did say that it is good business to train. That appears to be consistent with the opposition's view on a number of issues. The opposition says, 'It is a good idea to have superannuation, we just do not want to pass legislation that will guarantee all workers access to it'. The same story appears to apply when it comes to training. The honourable member for Maranoa said that it is good business to train staff. But apparently it is a bad thing for the government to facilitate and encourage that training throughout the work force. It is a good thing only if it happens in some places or for some people. There seems to be a view that it is not a good thing if it is universally available. There is some parallel here with the view which the opposition adopted with superannuation. The honourable member went on to say, 'Good companies will do it anyway'. Mr Bruce Scott-They are spending more.",143
198,Mr BEVIS,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The obvious response to that is that the good companies that are doing it anyway are spending more, as he now interjects, so are not impacted at all by these measures. They will tell him so. The 1112 per cent rate is well below what most firms would be allocating. It is immeasurably below what is expected in international economies of the sort with which we compare ourselves. Some of the material that I have read indicates that economies similar to Australia's economy are allocating between 10 and 15 per cent of their payroll bill to training. The guarantee· levy scheme requires employers to allocate 1.5 per cent-a fraction of the amount which is generally accepted in like countries around !he world. So the good companies are doing It anyway, as the honourable member said, so the good companies are not affected. He then said that the bad companies will do one of two things: they will send their people to training courses-either good or bad-or they will rort the scheme. That is hardly a flattering commendation for the management of Australia's corporate sector. The bottom line is that the honourable member for Maranoa is saying that companies will squander their investors' money, their shareholders' money. . In recent years allegations about those sorts of incidents have been identified in the media and in other places. For instance, there was the case of the training program undertaken on a yacht sailing up the Hawkesbury River. But the opposition conveys the impression in this debate that this all started two years ago; that business executives did not go to holiday resorts on the Queensland coast to undertake in-depth training programs; that they did not go to the Snowy Mountains to see what the weather was like on the inside of a chalet while they did their important accounting and marketing exercises; and that they did not go to Fiji, Vanuatu, London, New York, Paris or any of these other locations. In fact, for some time Hong Kong was a centre for these business trips. Opposition members talk about these things as though they were creations of the last two or three years. What nonsense! There is not one person in this place who believes that. Let us strip aside this facade that opposition members trot out in this debate when we talk about the guarantee charge for training. They say training is a good thing-but not if we facilitate it for everybody; only if it is provided for some-and they would have us believe that the problems that are attached to the system all sprung up two years ago. It· is nonsense and they know it is nonsense. As I mentioned a moment ago, the amendment before the House today honours. a government election commitment to further refine the training guarantee levy. The original act came into effect on 1 July 1990. Since that time, members of the opposition have continually sought to paint the guarantee charge as a tax. Indeed, I heard earlier this evening the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) seeking to do that and other honourable members have done that in this debate. The training guarantee levy is not a Commonwealth tax; it is a threshold which employers are required to meet to provide the skills that their work force needs and that the nation so sorely needs at a time at which everybody acknowledges workplace reform and technological changes are occurring at a pace never before seen. The government has no intention or desire to make any money whatsoever from the training guarantee. It is not a mechanism for generating revenue. It is a system to induce employers to undertake at least minimal training activity; to at least engender employers who have not been fulfilling what are reasonable management respoI)sibilities in this area to think about allocating a minimum amount of their funds for that purpose. The training guarantee is not prescriptive-and deliberately so-as to what It company should train its employees or managers in, since only the company will be aware of its own skill deficiencies and future development strategies, and only the company will be able to determine the requirements to meet those needs. The government, since this levy was first promUlgated some years ago; has been at pains to accommodate various concerns that have been put to it by the business community and by the opposition in this place and in the Senate. A number of adjustments have been made over time which I think have more than adequately met the legitimate concerns that have been raised. Amongst those was the establishment of a minimum threshold to recognise that small - nterprises may not be in a position to meet this requirement. This ensures that a small threeor four-person enterprise is not affected by the operation of the guarantee charge. The payroll threshold for compliance is $226,000 per annum. The honourable member for Maranoa might make note of that in his next training session with the National Party. I think he misread the digits on the page to be $225,000 instead of $226,000. That means that an organisation at the lower end of the threshold, with a payroll of $226,000 per annum, will be required to allocate a training guarantee fee of about $3,300. That is not a lot of money to set aside for work force or managerial training requirements. One and a half per cent on a larger payroll, such as a $1 million payroll, means that a firm would be setting aside $15,000 per annum for training. For organisations with a $1 million dollar payroll, that is a relatively small amount of money. Opposition members tonight and throughout the last couple of years have argued that the training guarantee imposes unreasonable compliance costs. We heard that again tonight from the honourable member for Maranoa. To ,ensure that the training guarantee appears as simple as it actually is, the government has announced its intention to introduce a pro forma to assist employers to meet their compliance requirements. So the rhetoric which those in this debate have sought to muddy the waters with can be set aside once and for all. When completing the pro forma the employer will appreciate that the level of detail the ATO has required to be kept is not onerous and is minimal. Members of the opposition, when talking about the training guarantee, like to talk about tax a fair bit. I will make a couple of quick comments about this tax analogy that opposition members draw. The first and obvious comment is that the documents the OECD released at the end of last year show Australia's taxation revenue, as a percentage of GDP, to be the lowest of all OECD countries. So, if we are going to talk about bits and pieces of tax, let us put it into perspective for a start. We are talking about the lowest tax regime in the OECD. But if we are going to talk about tax, the members of the opposition have a short memory. The GST was a tax-and it was a tax that brought with it more than a little bit of administrative burden. Opposition members have a few worries about the administrative burden of the training guarantee, but that did not seem to be on their minds last year when they supported a system of goods and services taxes. Even the New Zealand finance minister, Ruth Richardson, in the Australian Taxpayer of 10 August 1991, said that she was committed to the GST but as a woman she was concerned that the wives of small business men would have to spend Saturdays or two nights a week doing the book work. It was the finance minister of New Zealand who said that, to implement the GST, which the Opposition wanted, a couple of nights a week or all day Saturday would need to be spent just doing the book work. They have the hide to come in here and tell us that there is a problem with the guarantee charge because there is administrative work with it. They really have developed very selective memories. Of course, if opposition members are concerned about the tax burden I should remind them that, in that same manifesto that they produced and went to the people with less than a year ago, they recommended that these companies they are now concemeli about pay an extra 3 per cent in tax. They were going to lift the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 42 per cent. So they should not come in here now and tell us that this 11/2 per cent training guarantee is some onerous burden when they admit that most companies ,meet it in any event, and, when less than a year ago, opposition members wanted to increase the tax burden of these companies not by one or 11/2 per cent, but by 3 per cent. So the crocodile tears opposition members cry in here tonight about tax burdens and workloads cut no ice with me and, quite frankly, they cut no ice with the great bulk of the business community, which knows only too well the facts that I have been recounting. The training guarantee is a government incentive to business to gain equity and investment in the labour market and to increase the international competitiveness of our industry by improving the pool of skills. It manages also to reduce the considerable costs of on-job injuries, and that is a point which should concern us not just in the economic sense but in the human loss sense. That was a matter referred to in the Age on 1 February. The article stated: Australian employers are endangering the lives of workers by failing to provide adequate training in the workplace, according to a new study. The study, by the National Safety Council of Australia, found that a lack of proper induction training had contributed to more than 600 deaths and 500,000 injuries in workplaces last year. The study, which examined 100 injuries caused by mechanical equipment, found that 56 per cent of employers did not provide employees with induction training and 70 per cent neglected refresher training. Also in that article the Chief Executive Officer of the council, Mr Jim Whiting, said: ... workplace injuries cost Australia almost $2 billion a year in compensation payments. The cost, including lost production and working hours, was $10 billion. In terms of meeting training obligations, leaving aside the important human costs involved, purely on economic terms, there is every reason for the government to continue with the position it has adopted on the need to encourage Australian firms to think more about the training needs of their staff and managers. If we were to adopt the opposition's view, we would be doing a grave disservice not just to the work force and the nation but to many decent managers and employers seeking to do the right thing. Why invest a considerable amount of money in an employee, to train that person, only to face the possibility or the likelihood of losing that staff member to the employer down the road who has not invested a cent in training but is able to appreciate the worth of a worker with extra skills and offer that employee an extra 20 bucks a week as an inducement to change his or her employment? Having been burnt once, does the responsible manager turn around and spend more money and train a new staff member, match the offer from down the road and say, 'Stay here, I'll pay you an extra 20 bucks', or decide just to give the training a big miss in the future? This legislation enables employers to train staff and produce improved goods and services as a result without the fear of paying to train their competitors' next employee. By training Australian industry, we increase our competitiveness and avoid the traditional need to import skilled workers from overseas when our economy is in growth. This amendment specifically increases flexibility and control for employers by allowing excess spending to be carried into the next accounting year. Another provision of the bill gives employers who declare a shortfall the option of either paying the shortfall or electing to make it up through additional eligible training expenditure in the following year. The bill removes the requirement for employers to deduct training subsidies provided by government bodies when calculating their net eligible training expenditure. I think that is a major concessiqn to business. It ensures that those firms that are participating in the various labour market training programs are able to count that assistance as part of their obligation. Allowable expenses have been expanded in a further concession to industry to include rental, hire, lease or depreciation expenses on property or equipment used for training purposes. As the opposition has pointed out, however, this new amendment does not stipulate the training needs that the money is to be spent on, so the flexibility is guaranteed in the scheme. The only requirement the government does impose is that all Australian employers with a payroll of greater than $226,000 a year do the right thing and allocate a minimal, notional amount-l 11z per cent; a fraction of the international comparison-so that from management down their work force is in a position to access some form of training. One of the other provisions of the bill that I think will be welcomed by employers provides for employers who declare a shortfall to have the option of either paying the shortfall or electing to make it up through additional eligible training in the following year. The opposition claims that the government's unwillingness to control specific training in the private sector is inappropriate and a weak point in the act. This government recognises the very important need for Australian business to invest money in its most important asset: the work force. The government also recognises that business is best placed to identify appropriate and individual training needs. The implementation of the training guarantee charge via this bill has enabled many decent operators to organise their training in the knowledge that the people down the road are also obliged to give a commitment. It has improved the skills of the work force and enabled companies who did not think training was relevant to them to discover that it is. (Time expired)",144
199,Mr OCONNOR,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993. In essence, the bill gives effect to two major election commitments made to the business sector by the government at the last election. In the spirit and intent of the government to make this scheme more business friendly, it included some amendments that address two main criticisms levelled at the training guarantee scheme by various elements and sectors in the economy, namely, the cost of compliance and the flexibility of the scheme. To improve the flexibility of the scheme, the amendments permit employers to carry forward eligible expenditure to the next year, which will certainly improve the planning efficiency of the training task within enterprises. The bill also permits employers who have a training expenditure shortfall in one year to make it up through additional training expenditure the following year. Once again, this measure is designed to provide greater flexibility to employers in meeting their training responsibilities. As I indicated before, the bill contains a number of other measures aimed at increasing the flexibility of the scheme and reducing its compliance costs. These include removing the requirement to deduct training subsidies when calculating net eligible expenditure, removing the age restriction for student work experience, simplifying and increasing access to the grouping election, clarifying the meaning of 'appropriately qualified', expanding the definition of 'eligible training expenditure' and reflecting changes to the Australian corporations and securities legislation. In short, the bill will induce important changes to the scheme that will be of positive benefit to employers, employees and, of course, the national economy. When this scheme was first introduced, it met with a great deal of resistance' from elements within the business community on the basis that the scheme would significantly add to business costs and burden business with compliance. That resistance and apprehension-and, indeed, some opposition-is understandable when any new government broadly based scheme is introduced. At the time that the government introduced the scheme it fully understood these concerns that business had. It gave a commitment on an ongoing basis to review the scheme and to amend it where necessary in light of criticisms and shortfalls that were exposed in it. Of course, the opposition opposes this levy. We have come to expect this narrow opposition and lack of vision from the conservative parties in this parliament. Indeed, the difference between the government and the opposition on the issue of the training guarantee levy highlights the deep philosophical differences between the parties on economic policy. This Labor government does not seek to intervene in the marketplace for the sake of it. It does not derive any innate pleasure from regulating economic activity in this country. The government has a long history, since its election in 1983, of removing the onerous burden of regulation that had been institutionalised in over 33 years of conservative government from 1949 to 1983. The primary purpose of its intervention when it has occurred has been the logical pursuit of larger social and economic goals. In the case of the training guarantee levy, the government's economic objectives are fairly clear and very simple: to improve the efficiency and the productivity of the economy in the face significant market deficiency that has emerged in the economy over the previous cades. I refer, of course, to the lack of training of employees by many business enterprismassive es. The social objectives of the government also not hard to understand. They are quite evident. They are simply to improve the skill base of workers in the work force to prepare them for more satisfying jobs-I do not think anybody would disagree with that proposiomy. tion-and to equip them with the capacity to cope with the changes that are occurring our economic structure and which will tinue to occur over the next two decades. The economic argument for the introduction of the training guarantee levy was very compelling when the levy was first introduced in 1990. Previous speakers on the government side have referred to the 1989 ABS survey which confirmed that a high proportion of employers basically did little or no training. That survey made the following concluing sions. The average expenditure on training for all employers was about 2.2 per cent of the annual payroll, which is significantly less than enduring comparable trading expenditures of our major trading partners. It also found that there is uneven spread ·of training levels between within industries. But, more significantly, found that 58 per cent of private sector leap employers with an annual payroll of $200,000 or more spent nothing on any sort of strucnally tured training. But there was an even worse position in the smaller firms. Average expenditure on trainchanges ing by small firms of up to 20 employees was less than one per cent. Over 82 per cent of these firms did not incur any training exa penditllre. This low commitment to training was attributed to the two fairly significant factors-they were referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Brisbane our children will be based.' (- Bevis)-of a reliance by some enterprises on poaching skilled workers from firms that did train and had extensive training programs and an overreliance of the nation generally on migration to meet its emerging skill shortages as it came out of recessions. The Australian economy could not tolerate that situation if it of a was to remain competitive in the global economy and if firms were to grow to their two dereal economic potential. The essential problem seemed to be a deficiency in Australia's business culture-one we failed to rectify at our own are economic peril. That deficiency was simply this: a demonstrable reluctance on the part of many firms to engage in any sort of training, and a willingness of some to poach the skills of other enlightened firms within the econIn the interests of business equity and a in more even sharing of the national training contask between enterprises, the government moved to overcome both macro and micro deficiencies and to introduce the training guarantee levy. There are encouraging signs that we have had a high measure of success with this scheme. It is fair to say that there has been a massive improvement in awareness by enterprises within the Australian economy of the economic and social benefits of traintheir employees. This change in the culture of business is one which will live beyond the life of this measure. It will be of benefit to the Australian economy. There are well documented cases of positive an economic benefits that have accrued to firms and that have directly improved their training it performance. There has also been a quantum in the expertise of training providers and the expansio- of the courses that they exterprovide to businesses throughout the economy. One interesting offshoot of all this is that to the training culture of enterprises have often been the catalyst for other changes that have taken place within the enterprise. In national, overall sense, the development of .a more highly skilled and flexible work force will be one of the basic pillars on which our future prosperity and the future prosperity of , I will highlight a couple of benefits of this scheme that are perhaps not widely understood and. others that have already been mentioned in this debate to date. The first want to mention is the impact of this measure on the training industry itself. It is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that we have seen an increased flexibility and responsiveworkplace ness by the training sector to the needs of Australian economy. We have seen this measure bring more closely together institutions and businesses. The second benefit, which was alluded to by the previous speaker, referred to the occupational health and safety performance within those enterprises that have taken their training tasks seriously. I do not think body in this House would not agree with me that one death by industrial accident is death too many. The previous speaker in this debate referred to this dimension. I will expand a little upon it in my speech tonight. On 1 February, the Age featured an article entitled - Study shows bosses lax on work safety'. It quoted a study by the National Safety Council of Australia, which found that a lack of proper induction training had contrithe buted to more than 600 deaths and 500,000 injuries in workplaces in one year. We ought to pause and reflect on the dimensions of that statistic. Six hundred families have been damaged by the failure of enterprises and accordingly. employers to accept their responsibilities to provide basic induction training to employees. It is an appalling and criminal statistic. When we look further down the line at the production and the wealth creation that has been forgone by the deaths of those 600 people and the injury and the maiming of the 500,000 others, we get a real appreciation the benefits of the training guarantee levy. think it has forced many employers to focus their minds on the training task within enterprises. I say to honourable members opposite: if this measure has saved one life let alone half the 600, or even the 600, lives, it has worthwhile. It is no use coming into the chamber prattling about the economic and compliance costs. Strangely, none of those opposite have talked about the economic costs of 600 deaths in the Australian workplace and the production and wealth forgone because of that situation. This national report quite I clearly states that a lack of proper induction training has contributed to more than 600 deaths. The economic cost has also been computed. In the article, Mr Whiting said that injuries cost Australia almost $2 the bilIion a year in compensation payments. The cost, including lost production and working training hours, was $10 billion. I will now expand a little on the way in which greater links have been forged between the business community and vocational and educational training institutions in my electorate. In Corio, we have a top class facility in anythe Gordon TAFE, which has an extremely high reputation throughout Australia. As some one honourable members know, the government has recently committed over $30 million to its refurbishment and expansion. We are providing over $15 million for the construction of a manufacturing industry training centre to service the needs of Geelong's diverse manufacturing base. As one of the top professional institutions of its kind in the state of Victoria, Gordon TAFE has forged very close links with elements of Geelong's manufacturing community. The relationship will continue to develop as industry identifies more clearly its training needs and the institution responds This government is fair dinkum about training. Where the government perceives a deficiency in the operation of the marketplace, it has no hesitation in intervening to improve the overall efficiency and productivity of the Australian economy. I have listened wit- a great degree of interest to many of the arguof ments that have been advanced by honourable I members opposite in this debate so far. One of the major arguments that they have adtheir vanced is that this scheme ought to be dropped because there is some rorting going on by some employer-. I would like to make a few simple points been here. I do not know of any industry or economy-wide scheme such as this which has been implemented either by coalition or Labor governments that has not been abused to some degree by unscrupulous employers and enterprises. Those opposite should appreciate that this scheme is not a prescriptive scheme. The government does not dictate to business the sort of training it should provide to meet its needs. We simply seek to provide a framework in which individual firms and managers make their own decisions about meeting their training needs. If companies are abusing the system, they are merely short-changing their own shareholders and ought to be brought to account. They are merely exposing the firm to future competitive pressures. They are abdicating their responsibility to their employees. In long-term, they are damaging the economic interests of the Australian nation. I do not think that is a very smart thing to do. I was particularly interested in some of comments that were made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). He was very keen to quote the Kelty task force position on the training guarantee levy. The government now has the opportunity to reflect long and hard on many of the recommendations that have been presented in that report. The Kelty task force seized upon this issue of training and reported some comments made by employers in regional areas on the training guarantee levy. They see this issue from a particular perspective. But are those employers and/or the Kelty task force members really seeing this issue from a national perspective? I suspect not. The honourable member for Maranoa stopped his quote from the task force report at a very important point. If he had gone on and read the very next paragraph, we would have heard that the Kelty task force actiIally recommends a new tax on firms to cover this training position. I am sure the honourable member for Maranoa· and those opposite in this House tonight will be jumping up and down on the opposition front benches howling down that proposal. As many honourable members opposite do, the honourable member for Maranoa has selectively extracted a passage from the Kelty task force report and presented it as an argument here tonight. I want to put a series of questions here tonight: what is the policy response to the historically poor levels of expenditure by Australian business on training by the opposition? What would have been its response to this deficiency in the market economy? How would the coalition have induced those employers engaging in skills theft to train their employees? The reality is there would be no response and the problem would remain. The simple fact is that it is in the interests of the national economy for this measure to proceed. (TIme expired)",147
200,Mr TANNER,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993. Firstly, I will the make some remarks on the issue of training generally and the importance of the broad strategy that the government has brought to bear in this area for the future of Australia's the economy and our skills base and, secondly, I will deal with some more specific matters regarding the training guarantee levy and the legislation that we have before us this evening. It is not often recognised that the Western world is going through a fundamental structural change-that is, a dramatic drop in the demand for unskilled or lower skilled labour. This can be seen right across the Western world. It is at the core of the structural unemployment problem that is faced not only in this country but in most OECD countries. Changes in the production process, in work organisation and in the requirements of skills in economies are leaving millions of workers across the Western world without real prospects of finding employment because their skills, such as they are, are no longer necessary in anywhere near the numbers they once were. Traditional production worker jobs in factories are disappearing very rapidly. Work that used to be done by a mixture of typically Fordist arrangements in factories is now being done on a much more multiskilled basis with requirements for autonomous decision ma""king and skilled activities that were previously separated into very stark hierarchical divisions. The nature of the production process has changed to such an extent that the overall skills profile of our work force has moved significantly out of match with the changing demands of our economy. I commend to honourable members the recently released report entitled Restoring full employment-the green paper on employment-which will obviously fonn the basis of the debate leading to the government's white paper on this issue that is due in a few months time. It is important to understand the implications of this collapse in demand for unskilled and lower skilled work. It can be seen in issues associated with industrial relations and wages. In the United States, the wage levels for unskilled male workers have dropped by roughly 20 per cent since 1983. That is a direct consequence of the operations of the market with too much supply and not enough demand for lower skilled workers. The end result in an effectively deregulated labour market is that the price drops. The response of the government to equivalent trends in Australia has been to, rather than allow the price to drop, try to reduce supply. Rather than saying, 'Let the market clear itself of unskilled labour', it has .said, 'What we'll endeavour to do is reduce the number of people who have no skills or very limited skills and ensure that the two come back into balance, that· the matching of the economy with the skills in our work force gets back into balance'. . Honourable members may be aware of the so-called Beveridge curve which plots the matching of the skills needs of the economy with the actual skills on offer. In effect, it ultimately reflects the vacancies level. The work of Dr Chapman and the Beveridge curve illustrates that during the 1980s the matching gap expanded significantly. I have seen it in practice in areas of Melbourne. For example, in the Ford factory at Broadmeadows, which many people would see· as the archetypal large scale factory, roughly 60 per cent of the production workers are now undertaking further training and education associated with· their work, developing new skills and building up their ability to participate in the production process. We are seeing across the country and the industrialised world a dramatic change in the skills base that we need to run our economy. Associated with that is the shift in mass based manufacturing to the newly industrialised economies in Asia. It is therefore critical that, in order to maintain full employment and to maintain the economic health of our country, we have a highly educated, highly skilled work force. I commend to the House a landmark book called the Work of Nations by Robert Reich, now the Secretary for Labour in the Clinton Administration in the United States. I would like to comment briefly on Mr Reich's theories because they tell us a lot of very interesting things that are food for thought when put into the Australian context, even though they are primarily directed at the American situation. Reich's theory is, firstly, that the nation, as an economic unit, has been crumbling for some time and, secondly, that the internationalisation of the Western wor.ld has meant that the only really important thing remaining in economic policy from a purely national perspective is the question of the work that the people of that nation do. The thing that will detennine the economic health of our nation is the type of work that is being done by our work force. Are we predominantly, in Reich's terms, routine producers; that is, low wage, low skilled workers who perform often fairly repetitive tasks? Are we predominantly personal services workers; for example, people selling hamburgers at MCDonald's? Are we predominantly symbolic analysts; that is, people involved in essentially what may be described in shorthand terms as brain work? I refer to not only what may be seen as the traditional areas of brain work, such as science, technology, engineering and the like, but also more recent areas that perhaps have not quite got the same level of credibility as yet, such as marketing, advertising, consulting, legal and accounting work. Under Reich's theory, because of the internationalisation of at least the Western world and increasingly other parts of the world economically, we essentially have a globalisation of labour markets in two of those three categories; namely, the routine producers and the symbolic analysts categories. His basic argument is that investing in training, education and skills development in order to ensure that we have the highest skilled work force and that the work that our workers are doing as part of this increasingly globalised process of production is bringing in the strongest returns and the highest brain component work is the key to the economic future of any nation. It obviously has some relevance to Australia. The basis of Reich's theories tells us that one of the critical things that Australia needs to do is to ensure that we devote as many public and private resources as we possibly can to training and education. Clearly, it will be an imprecise process. Clearly, none of us can predict precisely what the exact demands of the economy for skills will be in five or 10 years time, even though the training that is being conducted here and now is for the purpose of skilling people to participate in the work force in the production process in five or 10 years time and beyond. By definition, it will be an imperfect process. We will not be able to guarantee that the training that is occurring will necessarily lead to magnificent outcomes. Th9se ate problems which, are simply not able to be overcome. One can see from looking at the changes that have occurred in government policy over the past seven or eight years that the importance of training and skilling our work force has rapidly increased in the agenda of this government, and rightly so. Perhaps this has happened belatedly. We can look back to the early 1980s and before and ask ourselves why so little was done on this front in the pastnot so much why so much is being done now, because I think we should still be doing more. It can be compared with our effort in research and development. We have had a pretty ordinary track record in the past in this area as well. As a result of this Labor government, we have finally placed emphasis on and strengthened this very critical area of training. ,company It is significant that we still lag behind the OECD average in terms of active labour training market program expenditure. So there is still plenty of potential for improvement in this situation.",150
201,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRAINING GUARANTEE, flexibility Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I ask the ministers at the table observe standing order 57 and do the speaker the courtesy of not passing between him and the chair when he is speaking.,152
202,Mr TANNER,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"The training guarantee levy was a critical and early component of the government's efforts to increase the emphasis on training and to ensure that we make this major shift in the labour market structure of our nation. I accept that it was devised and has been something of a blunt instrument. Clearly, it applies uniformly across all' companies that have a given level of payroll. Training needs differ. The benefits of training differ from company to company. So the training guarantee levy is something of a blunt instrument. . It is true to say that many companies were already spending more than the 11/2 per cent on training because of the nature of their operations. Earlier, I gave the example of Ford, which is spending about nine per cent of its payroll equivalent on training for its employees. That is clearly well above the minimal obligation specified by the government. So in the future there is scope to examine making this process perhaps less complex and more sophisticated to try to address that problem and ensure that we have a more targeted approach with respect to pushing companies into engaging in more training and more sophisticated training activities. Certainly, the Kelty report option was one suggestion that will obviously get serious consideration from the government. I floated an alternative approach of using the recent reduction in the company tax regime as a basis Jor giving enhanced deductibility to training somewhere along the lines of the R&D scheme. I think that is worthy of consideration as well. it 'seems to Ine to be a bit strange that a such as Ford does not get any bigger incentive or reward for the amount of that it is engaging in other than the normal deduction that it is entitled to. Therefore, I think we could explore a range of avenues. This legislation is a significant step in the right direction by putting some more into the training guarantee levy by allowing companies to carry over their respecto tive performances ,from year to year to a certain degree so that the rigid, looking at a single year in isolation situation has been relaxed. That is certainly a positive move. I refer to the adjacent area of labour market programs. It is also important to see these issues in the context of the big picture of the government's policy with respect to labour market training and skills. It is quite clear that we have a lot of work to do on that front. We have had a lot of labour market programs emerge over the past five or seven years. All of them are very worthwhile and targeted at specific matters and specific problems. But, inevitably, because we have had this explosion of labour market programs, funding and the like, there are anomalies and problems which need to be addressed. I will cite a few examples. One problem is that skillshares cannot be specific; for example, to a particular ethnic group or a particular disadvantaged client group. One skillshare in my electorate, Crossroads, is run by the Salvation Army. It is a very worthwhile skillshare that has a remarkable record for young homeless people who are inevitably much more difficult to service than the average skillshare client. There is nothing in the charter of skillshare that allows these clients to be treated in a special way, as they should be. The gap for 20-year-olds between traineeships and job skills is another example. Eligibility for programs such as jobskill and jobtrain is based on a given length of unemployment-six months or 12 months. But, even if people have been unemployed for five years and have had a brief recent period of temporary employment, they have lost their eligibility for some of those programs. Many people are very keen to get into some of those programs because they are good; they are effective and they work. They are put in a position where they have a disincentive to take a temporary position because of the fact that, in doing so, it may not lead to permanent work, but it may lead to their losing their eligibility for a particular program that may come up. A range of other areas needs to be looked at. The government's green paper on restoring full employment has identified many of these. There is a need for greater case management on the part of the CES-the ability to deal with people on a more individual basis and the ability to mix and match and put together particular packages of assistance for individuals that reflect their particular needs, rather than trying to squeeze the individual into the rigid guidelines of the program. Many good ideas are floating around and I think a lot of worthwhile things are likely to emerge over the next six months or so in the process that does occur with the green paper and the community consultation that will be associated with it. There is another aspect which I will· also briefly address before turning specifically to the traini!1g guarantee levy and that is the export prospects for Australia in the education and training field. We have seen an explosion of export activity not only with overseas students coming to Australia as full-fee paying students but also with education institutions setting up as joint ventures campuses in places such as Malaysia. We had some unfortunate experiences in the 1980s with fly-by-night operations in the private sector suddenly collapsing and leaving overseas students being owed significant amounts of money and with no training, which has damaged Australia's reputation abroad. To a fair degree, some of those problems have been brought under control, although it will take some time for our reputation to recover. But there is still substantial competitive advantage for Australia there and there is a lot of value in our investing, generally in training and education, in a way that there is a properly regulated private and public sector export effort and trying to ensure that there is a degree of balance there so that we do not unnecessarily divert resources from our domestic requirements. It isa tricky business in ensuring that there is a balance there. I believe that we will achieve great benefits for this country. I turn finally to the precise matter of the training guarantee levy. I can say to the House that I think I am fairly unusual in the respect---,there are probably a few on the other side, and maybe one or two here-that I have actually been in charge of an organisation, as an employer, that had to implement the training guarantee levy when it came into effect. There are probably some others in this House who have had the same experience, but I suspect there are probably a few who complained about the training guarantee levy on the other side who have not. a The levy was bit of a pain in the neck in some respects when it first got introduced. Like many businesses in the recession, my union had lost membership as a result of the recession; our budget was tight; we had a bit of a deficit; we did not exactly have a huge amount of money to throw around on training; at that stage, we had no specific training budget or any framework where we treated training as some sort of separate thing. So it led to a bit of head scratching and people saying, 'How do we handle this?'. Obviously we supported the philosophy of it but we had to cope, as any organisation and business did, with implementing it. We were naturally immediately exposed to the temptations that I am sure a lot of businesses have felt of, 'Let us look at what we do and see what we can describe as training'. I can understand people getting hit with those sorts of temptations. Fortunately we were able to avoid those and in retrospect I think it was to our benefit that we did avoid them. What happened was, we set up a training committee with staff representation on it and we started to realise that our training had been inadequate, that we had failed to seriously address the needs and that we had roughly been spending something close to the amount required so it did not require us to spend a huge amount extra. But it required us to get ourselves organised, to actually look at our total training situation and say, 'What are alI these people doing? Where do we have gaps? Where do we have lack of skiIIs? Where can we get some real benefits?'. The end result was that we had things happening like word processor operators getting trained to do desktop publishing, which is something that proved very valuable as a separate skill. We did a variety of differof ent things. We had people getting properly trained to do reception and, therefore, be able to relieve. People who could not type were being trained to type and so forth. I do not want to gild the liIy too much. It was not that dramatic but it was a worthwhile exercise. On the other side of the coin as a union official representing people in the work force with companies in the same situation, I have found that often it has been a benefit to the company because it has been able to establish a proper training framework where there is employee input where the company actually gets some genuine feedback about what sorts of things people aspire to, what types of additional skills they would like to learn and what sorts of career paths they would like to pursue. The fact that the levy has forced employers to actually seriously address the issue, take some countenance of it and put it into so-e sort of regularised form is a good thing. I think the situation can be improved. This legislation is one step toward improving it, and I think some further consideration of the broader issues that I have identified, accompanied by consideration of the labour market program issues, will only take us further forward. It is a critical part of the long-term economic future of this country that everything possible can be done to ensure that we maximise expenditure on training and education. (Time expired)",152
203,Mr FREE,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (9.54 p.m.)-in reply-In closing this debate on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill, I would like to thank those honourable members who have participated, particularly those from the government side who made thoughtful contributions and also those from the opposition. Those honourable members from the government side who particularly pointed to the policy vacuum that exists in the opposition on training have made some important points. The opposition currently lacks a training policy. It is in that sad position of being able to oppose, but only to oppose-that is all it will do. That is a shame, given the plethora spokesmen that it has now-37 people on its front bench. It really is a case of more means less. One can only express the. hope that Senator Bishop, in her new role as spokesperson on all matters in all places at all times, may be able to assist the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in getting together a set of policies in the education area, but on training in particular. Before turning to the particular comments made by the honourable member for Menzies in the course of his remarks, I make two simple points. The Training Guarantee (Adof ministration) Amendment Bill is concerned with improvements to the training guarantee legislation. It is concerned with which were made in the context of the last election. For that reason, I reject the criticism contained in the Canberra TImes today, or least that part of it which said that employer groups have been caught by surprise by important government changes to the training guarantee scheme. The facts are that these changes, as I said, were election commitments made in response to industry concerns. They were announced in the 1993-94 budget. They were certainly canvassed during the Lateline program on 10 July last year when I took part in a discussion which also included Mr Ian Spicer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Certainly these changes have been commented on by bodies like the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Indusis try. I also make the point that, as part of the consultative arrangements, in 1992 a reference group was established to keep the major stakeholders informed and to seek their input on issues to be considered as the scheme was evaluated. That membership covered the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Indusemployers try and the Business Council of Australia. understand that the Chamber of Commerce withdrew from the reference group later that year, and that may explain why representatives of that body are not as well informed as status. they ought to be. People should also be aware that a review of the levy is currently under way. That is commitment which was made back in 1990 when the training guarantee was first introstand duced. Of course, that review will provide opportunity for interested groups to make comments on its findings. As I said, the primary focus of the bill is concerned with improvements, not whether we have a levy or not. For that reason the government will be rejecting the opposition's amendments. The review itself provides a framework for further consideration of the training guarantee levy. It is a comprehensive review sampling a large number·of businesses-some 6,000some 17,000 households as well as a number case studies and, of course, it will provide useful input into any further consideration of the legislation which the government might commitments choose to undertake. There were a number of matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies which I at should daal with. The particular enterprise that he used at the beginning of his remarks yesterday is not really the subject of the training guarantee. The one thing we do know about it is that its payroll certainly would not have met the required threshold. The honourable member for Menzies made the point that 93 per cent of businesses are excluded from the training requirement. The most important thing to remember is that, while 85 per cent of employers are excluded-that is, those with very few employees75 per cent of the work force is included. It true that some big companies were spending two or three per cent on training. Some companies, like IBM, were spending 10 per cent or more on training. It is important to note that, although some companies did this, before the legislation the majority of companies did little or no training. The 1989 training expenditure survey confirmed that. It showed that 58 per cent of private sector with an annual payroll of $200,000 I or more were spending little or nothing on structured training. In line with the massive . training effort by companies like IBM, the legislation provides for outstanding training As for the proposition that 63 per cent of employers believe that they are spending the a same or less on training since the training guarantee was introduced, we should underthat other things have been happening an to the economy during the period that the legislation has been in force. We can certainly be confident that the training .guarantee has not been a positive inducement to spend less. Many of the 63 per cent were over the threshold anyway, and people should remember that the major thrust of the training guarantee is to lift the tail. By that I mean that those employers who previously did little or nothing are required by legislation to increase their efforts. In times of economic downturn the training guarantee may have been the only mechanism which has maintained any level Of industry training. Training appears to be one of the first corporate functions to be cut during a period of economic downturn. It is most important to maintain training efforts during those periods to reduce the occurrence of skill shortages once the economy moves into recovery. Much was made during this debate of the results of various studies that have been carried out on the training guarantee. The general point to be made about these studies is that frequently they use small samples. This makes it difficult to make any claims of substance on the basis of the findings. Very often claims are made about the findings far in excess of claims which would be made by the researchers themselves. In regard to the Noble study, which produced the result that 81 per cent of employers believe that if the levy was abolished there would be no impact on training, I simply respond that good trainers will always train. But since industry generally would be no longer responsible for training, the onus for funding training would fall back onto the government or onto individuals. For that reason the amount of training undertaken would be likely to decrease. The Henson survey reported that fewer than four in a hundred employers had anything positive to say about the training guarantee levy. Both the Henson and the Beresford studies were taken from very small samples of respondents-138 in the case of Henson and 10 in the case of Beresford. To quote that 60 per cent were minimally effective to not at all effective in improving work place skills is in fact to talk of 82 respondents. In regard to the surveys within the metal industry which purport to show that the levy has been inefficient, I can respond that one survey that we know of specifically covering the metal industry-Waters, Marsh and Thomson in 1992-indicated that the training guarantee appeared to have led to an increase in training expenditure at all levels of the work force in its first two years. Again, the sample survey was small. There were 66 firms in the first round and 42 in the follow-up. I make the general point about criticisms of the levy based on surveys or, indeed, supportive remarks about the levy based on surveys that the really worthwhile evaluation will be thone completed later this year. As I mentioned earlier, it will cover 6,000 employers and 17,000 households. The honourable member for Menzies claimed that 70 per cent of firms believe that the levy has resulted in more administrative work for busineSs. This proposition ought to be examined. The administrative work basically falls into two areas: maintaining records of expenditure and records of training. The records required to' substantiate training expenditure are minimal. In most cases very little more than the records required for normal accounting purposes are required under the legislation. The record of training is simply a record of the decisions made about training that any prudent manager would make-in other words, what skills are needed, how those skills are to be taught and what benefit the new skills will bring. As the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) pointed out in his remarks, there is a valuable effect to be obtained under, this scheme in raising awareness in organisations which have not previously thought about training in particular as it relates to the needs of their organisation. In response to the claim that no money has been spent to assess the impact of the training guarantee and that, therefore, there is no way of knowing whether any goals have been achieved, the evaluation of the training guarantee is now well advanced and a considerable amount has been spent on assessment. The principal da,ta sources are the two major surveys commissioned by the ABS, the training expenditure survey covering the 6,000 employers and the, survey of training and education covering the 17,000 households. These surveys were conducted in the June and September quarters last year and t/le results are expected around April or May of this year. In response to the complaint that bookkeeping is a serious problem, the government believes that the record keeping requirements are not onerous, as has been suggested in the press. This complaint appears to stem from confusion occurring in the early years of the scheme during which employers were not sure what records needed to be kept. The major cause of difficulty in complying with record keeping requirements appears to be the maintaining of records that were well beyond the requirements of the scheme. In that respect, the introduction of Australian Taxation Office pro-form as should help to reduce this confusion as they lead employers through the records which are required to be kept. These are being distributed by a mass mailout. The claims that record keeping for the training guarantee has significantly increased on-costs should cease once employers fully realise how administratively simple the requirements are. Claims about pseudo training and rorts under the scheme are made from time to time, often to add colour to media criticism of the scheme. The figure cited is an unsubstantiated guess and is rejected by the tax office. There have really only been a handful of cases where junkets have been claimed towards the training guarantee obligation. The suggestion that 30 per cent of the funds have been used on overseas holidays is incorrect. Of the 6,000 audits carried out by the tax office, only 60 claims have been disallowed as ineligible. Of these, only 12 resulted in a shortfall under the legislation. That is a one per cent incidence of companies attempting to claim expenditure which was not eligible, with a 0.2 per cent incidence of such claims resulting in the particular company not meeting its obligations. The firms that attend ly have enough eligible expenditure to meet their obligation. Once this is met, any other expenditure is up to the discretion of the company. The tax office has consistently maintained that ineligible expenditure of this kind will be disallowed. The example of a group of motor industry executives going to Brazil for a conference has been misrepresented during this debate. Honourable members will be aware that the motor industry is multinational in scope. The group of executives were attending a training conference. In this case, the major industrial base of their company was in Brazil. It therefore made obvious sense to gather in a country which held the majority of the company's interest. So the form of travel referred to in that particular example is not to be correctly described as a jaunt or rort, but rather a justifiable business trip for which the expenses· can be met and claimed under the training guarantee. The claim that small business is particularly affected by the guarantee fails to recognise the importance of the threshold. More importantly, it fails to recognise that it is just as important, and often more important, for small business to engage in training as for large business. The essential thrust of the training guarantee legislation is precisely to leave decisions like that in the hands of business. It is not a matter of the government saying to business what kind of training it should undertake but to raise awareness of the importance of training to the economic health of the particular business. In closing the debate, I again draw to the attention of honourable members the primary focus of the bill before us. It is, as I said, Concerned with improvements to existing legislation to honour commitments which were made in the context of the last election and which are well understood by the business community. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses I to I8-by leave-taken together, such jaunts usual- and agreed to. Proposed new clause 18A.",154
204,Mr ANDREWS,TRAINING GUARANTEE,"I move: (1) Page 9, after clause 18 insert the following new clause: ""18A. After section lOlA of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: Act to cease to have effect from 1 July 1994 '10IB. Unless repealed earlier, this Act ceases to have effect on and from July 1994.'."". Clause 18A is a very simple clause. In effect, it introduces proposed new section 101B, which reads: Unless repealed earlier, this Act ceases to have effect on and from I July 1994. Clearly, the effect of this clause is to introduce a sunset clause into the legislation so that it brings to a conclusion or a cessation the training guarantee levy on 1 July this year. The reason chosen for 1 July relates to a number of considerations. Firstly, it recognises the relationship between the training guarantee levy and the taxation system generally by designating the end of the financial year as the date upOI) which the scheme would cease to exist. Secondly, in this manner we have recognised that business and industry have entered into training arrangements for this financial year and that an earlier cessation of the scheme could cause administrative and other problems. Similarly, it also provides the government with a period of almost six months to make any bureaucratic rearrangements consequential upon the cessation of the scheme. Finally, it would be open to the government under this clause, if it were agreed to by the parliament if there were compelling reasons, to extend the sunset clause beyond 1 July 1994. However, this amendment clearly raises an important principle upon which the government and other parties can indicate their position-that is, do they support the abolition of the training guarantee levy about which there has been a chorus of disapproval which is, apart from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) at the table, almost universal? I will direct my remarks to some of the defences of the training guarantee levy which have been raised in this debate. We would have expected some government members, apart from the minister from whom one would expect a defence of the scheme, to have addressed the chorus of criticisms of the training guarantee levy. We should recall the source of those criticisms: Firstly, there has been criticism from the business community in this country and that 1 criticism has been almost universal. I note that the minister said in his remarks that the response to industry concerns included the response from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I have in my possession a letter from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which clearly indicates that, whilst it would favour these amendments as a second best option, its clearly preferred option in relation to this scheme, on behalf of its members throughout the nation, is that the levy should be abolished. Secondly, there has been a whole range of academic studies in relation to this particular scheme. Whilst the minister. is. able to point out just one study which says that training may have been improved as a result of this, there is a whole raft of studies which indicate quite to the contrary. Finally, what must probably be the most telling point in relation to the scheme itself and why it should be abolished or come to its cessation on 1 July, is the report of the regional task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to regional matters. Honourable members should remember that the key person on this task force is not from the business community and is not someone from the academic community who is making a dispassionate study of these matters. The key person is none other than Bill Kelty. What does Mr Kelty and his task force say about the training guarantee levy? He says that this levy, because of the impact which it has on business generally in this country, ought to be suspended for a period of three years. In the political language of the day, that is a euphemism for saying that we ought to get rid of the scheme; suspend it for three years, but we will not raise it again after three years. We will just put it on hold for three years. Who knows what will happen three years down the track? It is a bit like the Prime Minister's second round of tax cuts; we will leave them on the never-never. Bill Kelty and his confreres on the regional task force said that this training guarantee levy did not meet the objectives which were ascribed for it and therefore it ought to be suspended, as he says, or, speaking plainly, we are prepared to say that it ought to be abolished. Four arguments have made by honourable members from the government' side and they have been quite flimsy. The first is that there is a need for training in order to achieve safety in this country. It may be true that we need to achieve safety in this country, but some honourable members opposite have said that in order to achieve safety we need proper induction training. That remark in itself, and what flows from it, is an indication, one would suspect, of the failure to some extent of occupational health and safety legislation in this country. There are other means by which one may achieve safety other than simply imposing, as this bureaucratic piece of legislation does, an imposition on. certain employees to meet certain requirements in terms of training. If we are concerned about safety, then safety ought to be addressed directly and not in this roundabout way as a number of honourable members have excused the training guarantee levy. The second matter which was raised related to the green paper on employment and the need for skills. Throughout this entire debate I do not believe that one member of this chamber or the other chamber of this parliament is of the opinion that there is not a need to increase the skills of Australians generally and to increase the training of the Australian work force. The question in relation to any intervention by the government into the economy, which this levy is, is whether or not that intervention is efficient and achieves the purposes for which the intervention was designed, because governments of all ilk, whether formed by members on that side of the chamber or members on this side of the chamber, intervene in the economy. The real question ought to be: is the intervention efficient or is it not? The whole host of reports that I referred to in my speech in the second reading debate indicated that this particular intervention into the economy by the government does not achieve its objectives and is therefore not efficient in terms that were set out for it. The green paper on employment and the government's training reform agenda, of which the training guarantee levy is a part, stated in part that vocational training has been neglected, that existing arrangements have a number of shortcomings and that there are a number of deficiencies in the current system. In question time today we had the Prime Minister boasting about some great revolution in education, that this was the revolution in education. His commitment to vocational education was such that whilst he was Treasurer the Commonwealth funding of vocational education and training in Australia was reduced from a level of $460 million in 198485 to just over $200 million in 1991-92. Mr Ronaldson-Say that again. Mr ANDREWSFunding was reduced from $460 million in 1984-85 to just over $200 million in 1991-92. So, if the Prime Minister has a commitment to vocational education and training, it is a new found commitment. If the truth of the matter be known, the only reason the government has the commitment to vocational education and training that it now has is the commitment that was made by the coalition in its election platform for the 1993 election. It was simply a matter of matching, almost million dollar for million dollar, what the coalition had outlined. . The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said that we need to gain equity in the labour market when the fact of the situation is that those who benefit from this levy are those in middle and senior management while the workers, who are the great majority of the work force, get very little in the way of training. Finally, we have this question about philosophical differences. The reality is that, on any assessment, the training guarantee levy has failed. I suspect that, if there were an easy way for the government to actually back out and repeal it, it would do so. It is easy for the minister to say, 'We have some evaluation going on about it', but the reality is that it has failed. People such as Bill Kelty are saying, if one reads between the lines of the report, it has failed. Business is saying that it has failed. The Downer, A. J. G. workers are saying that it has failed. The only Filing, P. A. * people who are benefiting from this levy are Gallus, C. A. those who are in the industry of training the Howard, J. W. trainers. (TIme expired)",157
