1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Legal Aid",13
2,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is it a fact that the Attorney-General has reached, or is close to reaching, agreement with some states or territories in relation to legal aid funding? Is fact that the Commonwealth is proposing to provide additional funding to those jurisdictions? What programs within the Attorney General's portfolio will be cut to fund those increases? Why did the Attorney not advise the Prime Minister before question time yesterday Â·of this proposed backdown? Can the Attorney-General also confirm to the House that the Queensland government has today decided to establish a separate legal aid service?",13
3,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am grateful for the question from the member for Banks, because it gives me the opportunity to put a few myths to rest. There has been some misinformation in the media today. The government has not changed its mind. The amount of money available for legal aid is in the forward estimates. That remains the sum that will be available, and I am not even going to cabinet to seek any more money. We have to work out the most equitable distribution of the funds that are available between eight different jurisdictions. The eight different jurisdictions have been communicating with us over some time. We have advanced the negotiations on the different fronts in a general sort of way, resulting today in relation to Queensland in an announcement by the Queensland government that they will maintain funding of state matters by maintaining the funding that they have previously provided and they will enter into'an agency agreement with the Commonwealth, which is exactly what we were seeking. I do not propose to reveal all the details of negotiations with individual jurisdictions, but what you might like to bear in mind is that this is a matter where the states are seeking to get more money out of the Commonwealth. A lot of the shenanigans that go on in stateCommonwealth financial relations are going on in this debate as well. We are making progress, we are looking to achieve a cooperative arrangement with eight different jurisdictions and we are well on the way. Corporate Law",13
4,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the it a House whether there are changes that could be made to corporate law to facilitate investment, employment and wealth creation by Australian businesses? Can the Treasurer advise the House of any developments in this area?",13
5,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. Of course, there are changes that can and should be made to corporate law to give it a stronger economic focus and to make it part of this government's drive to encourage business and economic development. The government will be announcing today its corporate law economic reform program-a reform to re-engineer corporate law and to harmonise it with the government's economic objectives. We see corporate law very much as having an economic goal-that goal being to give business the opportunity to get on with low transactional costs with economic development creating jobs and employment. That will be the focus that we bring to corporate law in the future. It will involve looking through a number of areas of the Corporations Law, including fundraising, takeovers, futures, security markets, directors' duties and electronic commerce, and making sure that our laws are up to date and facilitating business. We will be starting by addressing the Australian accounting standards boards in consultation with key interest groups. The trouble with corporate law at the moment in Australia is that it is too prescriptive, too legalistic and not in touch with modem commercial practice. We want to change that. I also emphasise at the same time that this government is a government that wants to encourage confidence in Australia's financial markets. We want to see a wide spread of share ownership in the Australian community. We want to encourage a new class of shareholders to come in over the future year with the one-third float of Telstra, one of the exciting privatisations this country has ever seen. We believe it is necessary to assure all of those new investors of the integrity of our financial markets. We do not want to see a repeat of the corporate conduct that occurred during the 1980s. We have instructed corporate regulators to be vigilant in protecting the honesty and integrity of our markets. We want to make sure that it is safe for honest and innocent investors to take part; that they can with confidence and that business can reap the rewards of a strong economic focus reducing transaction costs with a new approach to corporate law. High Court",13
6,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Did the Chief Justice of the High Court raise with the Attorney General concerns about the Deputy Prime Minister's public criticisms either before or after the Chief Justice wrote the unprecedented letter of 3 January 1997 to the Deputy Prime Minister? What action did the Attorney take following the approach by the Chief Justice? Did the Attorney raise those concerns with either the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister? If so, when and what was their response? Will the Attorney now table all relevant documents, as the Deputy Prime Minister did yesterday?",14
7,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As Attorney-General, I, like my predecessors, have regular conversations with the heads of federal jurisdictionsthe Chief Justices of the High Court, the Federal Court and the Family Court. Like my predecessors, I do not propose to make private conversations public. I am not going to answer any question such as that raised by the member for Banks. Equally, I am not intending to make public any discussions I may have with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister or the cabinet-just as my predecessors would not have done. Sugar Industry",14
8,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister had discussions with Queensland and New most South Wales sugar industry leaders in regard to the tariff on the importation of foreign sugar? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of developments in this reduction of tariff which was initiated and pursued vigorously by the former Labor government?,14
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. He gives me an opportunity to announce the outcome of - discussions and deliberations by the government with the Queensland and New South do so Wales sugar industries and the Queensland government, and in the wake of the sugar industry review, which was chaired in its latest stages by Mr Bruce Vaughan, a very widely respected person in many primary industries. The government remains very strongly committed to a strong, viable sugar industry with a much greater export focus. Ninety-five per cent of Australia's sugar industry is located in Queensland and the remaining five per cent in New South Wales. Mr Stephen Smith-And Western Australia.",14
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept the correction. There is some in Western Australia. I apologise to Western Australian growers for not including them. About the remaining five per cent is in New South Wales. But, don't worry, that is as good as it will ever get for you in this answer. About 85 per cent of Queensland produce is exported while New South Wales is domestically focused. We want, and I am sure all sections of the industry want, a greater export focus in the future. We have worked very closely with the industry in developing a package of reforms. I am able to announce today that the sugar tariff, as recommended by the Vaughan committee, will be removed from 1 July 1997. That decision and that attitude has been endorsed very strongly by the Queensland government. It has drawn on the basis of some other announcements I am about to make. It certainly does have the endorsement of the Queensland industry and, given some of the other announcements, the reasons for the government's decision will be understood by the New South Wales section of the industry. It is our intention to retain the acquisition in single desk selling arrangements that currently operate involving the Queensland Sugar Corporation. That is a very, very important element of the government's decision to remove the tariff from 1 July. We do want the industry to grow on the back of world markets. We will work with industry to develop a national sugar export strategy to give both states the opportunity to benefit. I have to say, specifically in response to the concerns of the New South Wales industry, that the quota, particularly for exports into the United States, enjoyed at the present time is a quota that belongs to the whole of the Australian industry and is not a quota that belongs exclusively to the Queensland industry. Part of the policy that we would like to see evolve arising out of this decision will be very effective discussions between the New South Wales and Queensland industries to ensure that New South Wales growers get a fair proportion of the export market and fair access to the quota. We are going to work with the industry to develop a national sugar export strategy. We are going to spend $2 million on improving the New South Wales transport infrastructure to improve the flow of sugar to export ports. Possible projects will include transfer facilities from road to rail and sections of road which do not facilitate appropriate trucking. We are also going to establish a back bench committee of government members to investigate issues such as the size of the New South Wales quota and transport infrastructure needs. I might also say that the government is somewhat concerned about the rigidity of the existing merger provisions of the Trade Practices Act which were enacted by the former government in the face of opposition from the present government parties. One of t-e consequences of those particular provisions has been to prevent greater rationalisation in the industry which many observers of the industry regard as a necessary step forward. I have in mind the rejection by the ACCC of the proposed merger between Mackay Sugar and CSR. I believe that this represents a fair and comprehensive response. I want to thank the representatives of both the Queensland and New South Wales industries for the forward looking attitude that both of them have adopted. They are not looking for unreasonable levels of protection. They are looking for understanding. I think the arrangement whereby the single desk and acquisition arrangements are retained yet the tariff is removed, as recommended by the Vaughan committee, by I July is a very, very effective understanding. The contribution of an extra $2 million to help the New South Wales industry build up its infrastructure and the guarantee that will facilitate a fair consideration of the New South Wales industry's entry into the quota arrangement taken together represent a very sensible response. They are the basis of developing a sound export based industry that is going to provide both wealth for the participant and also job generation into the future. Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries",14
11,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to an exhibit tendered before the Productivity Commission inquiry into the TCF industries which details a meeting between you, departmental officials and industry representatives, which says: Departmental representatives also emphasised the need to focus lobbying effort upon those members of cabinet known to be totally opposed to the industry view, in particular: Mr Fahey, Mr Reith, Mr MCLachlan, Mr Costello and Mr Downer. The department also considered it vital that industry lobby their local members. Minister, is the report accurate in stating that departmental officials provided the cabinet and electorate hit list to the industry, or was it you who provided that hit list?",15
12,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was surprised yesterday that he was last man off the block to get his question up. Today he is much better; he is up there second off the block instead of being third off the block. He was very inspired by Diamond Jim's comments yesterday. Diamond Jim picked the winner. The leader might not have much fire in his belly, but you sure do. lt might only be a hot curry every now and then, but that is about as much as you can get. You are out of the blocks early today for your question. As a consequence, can I just say this: the Alan Wood article is wrong; we all understand that. On both articles, he neither checked with me or my office, which is pretty sloppy journalism. The article itself was a very sloppy little journalistic edition. Just to put the member for Hotham at peace so that he can contemplate his future, as he did on the Four Corners program, I will quote directly to him a letter which the President of the Federated Tanners Association Australia wrote to me today: Unfortunately, the selected published extracts from the Federated Tanners' Association newsletter issued by our former CEO did not accurately portray the Board proceedings. For my part, you made it very clear that Government would be making its decisions on future policy for the TCF industry in the context of a continuing commitment to the APEC free trade agreement, which will have a negligible tariff regime in place for TCF products by the year 2010. I also understood you to say that in our submission to the Industry Commission inquiry that we should have regard to the economic policies and views of Government. In regard to the suggestion that DIST has told us how to conduct a campaign to lobby ministers and others, this is not the case. The industry has not sought and does not seek advice from you or your officers as to how to conduct our lobbying. I can assure you that we are more than capable of ensuring that the public and Government members are acutely aware of the likely impact of decisions which we consider adverse on our industry. End of story. Stories that go out like this that are not checked are very detrimental to commerce and to those who use them, and those who ask questions based on them show l;!eir ignorance. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the exhibit before the Productivity Commission w.hich reports accurately what the Tanners Association said. Leave not granted. Mr Crean-He doesn't want the document!",15
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat! Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister was quoting from a letter. Pursuant to standing order 321, I ask that he table that letter. Mr Moore-No trouble. It's all yours. Economy",16
14,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer would be well aware of the significant number of retailers and small businesses in my electorate. What do the current account and retail sales data released today say about the strength of the economy? What is the outlook for those small businesses?,16
15,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Today's retail trade figures show a very strong pick up in the month of January, with seasonally adjusted estimates showing a 2.7 percentage increase on December. Also released today were leading indicators in respect of the housing sector, with building approvals imported showing exceptionally strong growth in relation to total dwelling units seasonally adjusted, rising from January of 1996 to January of 1997 by 22.5 per cent. Trend estimates also show a pick up in relation to building approvals for private sector houses. That is consistent, as I referred to yesterday, in relation to the capital expenditure survey and company profits with other leading indicators in the March quarter. What that shows is that there is growing and strengthening in the economy, which is consistent with the government's expectations that the economy will pick up over the course of 1997 and 1998. The December quarter balance of payments release, however, suggests that net exports will detract about one percentage point from growth in the expenditure based measure of GDP for the December quarter. The December quarter national accounts will be coming out tomorrow. While both exports and imports grew in real terms, imports strengthened more significantly. May I say that is not altogether a bad thing because the strengthening in imports reflected strong growth in both intermediate goods and especially in capital importscapital imports which you would expect down the track to contribute to investment growth and ultimately jobs. Notwithstanding that, however, as today's balance of payments figures note, you would expect a detraction of around one percentage point from growth for the December quarter national accounts. As a result, that will be taken in in relation to the figures which are to be released tomorrow. I would, however, emphasise that the national accounts, looking as they do, for the December quarter give us a snapshot of what was happening in the economy several months ago. The leading indicators, including those released today of retail sales and building approvals, give you a snapshot as to what is happening in the economy now. It is still early days in relation to the cuts in official interest rates as they begin to come on stream. As you see that pick up in retail sales and confidence, we would expect a picture of continuing and growing strength in the economy throughout 1997. Economy Mr GARETH EV ANS-My question is to the Treasurer and follows the answer he has just given, in particular in reference to retail sales. Are you aware, Treasurer, that, while today's January retail sales figures show an increase for large stores over the last year, they show a decline for small business retailers-a decline-of over one per cent? Does this not confirm a whole string of recent surveys which show, in the words yesterday of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index's John Marsden, that 'growth has been where small business and jobs are not'? How can you claim that the government is delivering on its small business rhetoric when, to take just one of those surveys, yesterday'S CPA Small Business Health Index assessed conditions for small business, even after all the interest rate reductions, to be at their lowest level since the index began in 1993?",16
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have seen the Labor opposition try to make much of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. Their big point is that, when you get a net figure of approvals and disapprovals, the government comes out at negative two. That is your big knockout point-your biggest knockout point. One only has to go back to get some historical perspective to February 1996. Who was in government in February 1996? It was the Labor Party. When the net figure was taken in February 1996, approvals less disapprovals, the net negative figure for the Labor Party was minus 51 per cent. So what is their big point? Their big point is we are what? One twenty-fifth as bad as you were! Is that your big point? One twentyfifth! We have heard of trying to make bricks out of straw, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is making nothing out of nothing. I was very interested to see yesterday'S AAP wire. You would recall that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition walks into the parliament on a daily basis and calls for an interest rate cut. The dollar has gone up-he calls for an interest rate cut. The dollar has gone down-he calls for an interest rate cut. Retail sales have gone up-he calls for an interest rate cut. Retail sales have gone down-he calls for an interest rate cut. As I said, the first rule of 'Garynomics': call for an interest rate cut no matter what is happening in the real economy. He came in here and said that he had concern over the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's national business expectations survey; that there was not any grounds for confidence; that the government had no strategy whatsoever; that the economy was weak and it was all the government's fault. The same day the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, walked in and said, 'Labor should take some of the credit for the economic upturn.' He said: ... when you've got low inflation, as we managed to create, you create a low interest rate environment, which we created, at the end of the day the economy picks up ... The opposition's position is simple: according to the deputy leader, the economy is bad and it is the coalition's fault; according to the leader, the economy is good and it is all Labor's fault. They are absolutely unable to synchronise their stories, making counter and false claims against each other. They are unable to get a story or a political line because it is an opposition-here he goes!",17
17,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, and it goes to relevance. The fact that the Treasurer cannot stand complexity is a problem for him and his particular orientation, but the complexities that we need are not great in a very simple question. The very simple question went to the status of small business and what we are getting is a generalised rave, which we are used to from him, to his own backbench dorothy dixers. But we are a bit more pointed than that. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I just make this point of order: the fact is we know, because it fell off the back of a truck, that the opposiargument tion caucus last year was advised by the Manager of Opposition Business to run as many points of order as they could dream up during question time. That is clearly a frivolous point of order. It was simply a platform for him to run an argument, not a point of order. There ought to be a general understanding within the opposition that points of order, if they are to be raised, have to be valid points of order and substantiated by the standing orders.",18
18,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is entirely within the standing orders for members on both sides of the House to raise points of order when they see fit. But, if you are going to total points order raised in this parliament compared with the previous one, I would invite you to do statistics on it. You will not come out very well.",18
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question revolved around retail sales, small business and the impact of declining retail sales on small business. The question was being answered by the Treasurer before both of the interruptions. I call on the Treasurer.",18
20,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would just take exception to one of the comments that the Leader of the Opposition made. He said that it was 'a generalised rave to a dorothy dixer from his own backbench'. It might have been a dorothy dixer, but it was not from my backbench, it was from your deputy. If I may say so, questions from your deputy are much more useful than dorothy dixers from our backbench. This is an opposition which has no economic coherence and no credibility. The deputy leader is out there saying the economy is all bad and it is the fault of the government; the leader is out there saying the economy is all good and it is the fault of the Labor Party. There is no coherence. There is no consistency. There is no position. They come into this House and say they are in favour of deficit reduction. They vote against every possible measure that could get you there",18
21,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order-just to encourage a bit of observance of standing orders in the Treasurer. There is absolutely no possibility now that the that is being made by the Treasurer is within the ambit of relevance to a very pointed question, none whatsoever. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: there are many members sitting in this chamber today who for years and years have heard the debate about what is a relevant matter within standing order 145. Based on the precedent, there is no way conceivable that this response from the Treasurer could be described in any other way than as entirely relevant to the very long and argumentative question that we had. According to the Labor Party's minutes, this is what the Manager of Opposition Business is r-corded as saying: 'It of is incumbent upon members to make question time difficult. It doesn't have to be just from frontbenchers who call points of order.' The fact is that this is a spurious point of order. It is the second in a row, and he ought to be required to stick to the standing orders.",18
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the House. I have been listening very carefully to the Treasurer's response. I find the response in order, and he is putting a certain amount of polish onto an answer that he is already part way through. I am happy to continue to listen to his response, although I will not tolerate frivolous points of order from either side.",18
23,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. We do not consider it a successful answer unless we have drawn him to his feet at least once-twice is even better. If we get plenty of them, the more we see you rise to your feet, the more we enjoy it. The big claim of the opposition now is 'Keating is dead'. That is their latest economic claim. The BRW: 'Keating is dead.' They are all protectionists now. The hero of APEC, the man who sat in the cabinet and presided over the winding down of the tariff barrierswe are all protectionists now. If Keating is dead, it was this side of politics that interred him. It wasn't any of you people: it was this side of politics on 2 March 1996 that interred him. Agricultural Subsidies",18
24,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. What is this government doing to bring pressure on the European Union to hon?ur !he spirit of the new Wo-ld Trade O.rga-IsatlO!1 objectives which reqUIre a reductIOn In theIr substantial levels of agricultural subsidisation? Given the damage that subsidisation can do in creating unfair competition in both our domestic and export markets, can our food production and processing industries expect greater EU cooperation in the future?",19
25,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Murray for her question. It is a timely question, because this government stands for pragmatic trade policy and trade liberalisation. We are going to continue that under the Uruguay Round because that introdu-ed meaningful disciplines on agricultural subsIdy practices for the first time and reversed the previous trend of unfettered growth in agricultural subsidies which was so damaging to Australia's agriculture and food exports. However, the battle is far from won, and the government is giving a very high priority to pressuring subsidising countries-notably the EU and the US-for further restraint in export subsidies. Mrs Crosio--He put the answer on the dispatch box before the question was asked.",19
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Prospect, contain yourself!",19
27,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen you do a whole lot like this in the New South Wales state parliament. You have got a lot to learn here. Mrs Crosio interjecting,19
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Prospect! Mrs Crosio--He put it on the dispatch box.,19
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have warned the member for Prospect!,19
30,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say to the member for Murray: most recently we have made representations on specific problems relating to EU support for its wheat gluten, malting barley and canned pear and peach industries, which I know the member for Murray is most interested in. I have taken up a number of these matters and the need for restraint on the use of export subsidies, particularly when I-along with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Foreign Affairs-met with EU Agricultural Commissioner Fischler last month. We will continue to pursue legitimate Australian national interest and Australian trading interest with the EU at every opportunity. We will seek to make further progress on the multilateral front under the WTO arrangements. In 1999 there will be further formal negotiations under what was agreed at Singapore, and I expect we will make additional progress on market access issues, on the tariff issues and, more particularly, on the winding back of the common agricultural policy on which the clock is ticking for a range of factors. The sooner that is completed the better. The Cairns Group is also pursuing its representations as a cohesive group of nations which was set up under the previous governmentand I acknowledge that. It is scheduled to meet in June in Brazil, as part of maintaining a cohesive effort for additional trade breakthroughs. Lastly, thanks to the good work of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, there are breakthroughs occurring in related areas. I am very pleased to inform the member for Murray-because some of hers would be qualifying, as would the member for Mallee's and the member for Farrer's-that late last year we at last won approval for Australian high quality kangaroo meat to be admitted to France and Ireland. This is a very good breakthrough. Mrs Crosio-- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under section 321, I require the Deputy Prime Minister to table the document which he placed on the dispatch box before the question was asked in this House.",19
31,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The document was confidential.,20
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Part of the notes have been tabled. The remainder remain confidential.,20
33,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. You should ascertain that what is left is in fact confidential.",20
34,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is confidential to me, I assure you.",20
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If my recollection is right, the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged that the page he had tabled was without classification. The other remains confidential. Car Industry",20
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. It is as a result of his responsibility for the Productivity Commission. Is the Treasurer aware of growing divisions among his colleagues over the matter of further tariff reductions for the car industry? Does the Treasurer support the views of the group, including Premiers Olsen and Kennett and minister Moore who are opposed to the Productivity Commission recommendations on tariff cuts or is he aligned with Senator Chapman's group which wants lower tariffs regardless of what our competitors do?",20
37,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The obvious answer is: I am aligned with the cabinet group and the government group and the party's group. The position in relation toMr Martin Ferguson-The anti-jobs group. Mr Lee-Respond to it!,20
38,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am only trying to keep you happy. You have asked me to acknowledge it, and I did. The view of the government is quite clear. When the Industry CommissioniProductivity Commission brings down its report in May, the government will announce its position. Until then, we will have a healthy debate about the future of tariffs. We are not afraid of having a healthy debate. We do not find this a difficult question to answer either because, obviously, it is a matter that the government will look at very carefully. I will tell you what question we would find difficult to answer. We would find it very difficult to answer a question like this: what does the Labor Party stand for? That would be an almost impossible question to answer, wouldn't it? What did George Campbell say on Four Corners?",20
39,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: this is of absolutely no relevance to, again, a very specific question. It is obviously in breach of the widest possible interpretation of the relevancy clause.",20
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I know the Treasurer is in the final stages of concluding his remarks.,20
41,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, Mr Speaker, I am giving them a tip-a question that I honestly could not answer at the dispatch box: what does the Labor Party stand for?",20
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are Liberal on that. And that goes to the point of relevance: it is not his obligation to work out what we stand for; it is ours to present it. His problem with this is that he does not know where he stands.,20
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is rapidly concluding his remarks.,20
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As George Campbell said, 'I don't think the party knows or has a clear perception of what it stands for or, more importantly, what it wants to achieve in terms of development of our society.' To George we say, 'Correct weight.' Telstra",20
45,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What is the significance of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision made yesterday that it was beyond its jurisdiction to stop Telstra from advertising and selecting employees for a new job structure?,20
46,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Clearly, the significance of it is that we are now starting to see come through from the commission decisions which reflect the shift in the legislative background, by which the commission operates, from the old reform act under the Labor government to the new Workplace Relations Act which came into operation, by and large, at the start of this year. The decision is important. As the commission has assessed, the claim against the new parameters for what constitutes allowable award matters in the Workplace Relations Act-the section 89 and section 143 reforms for awards provided in the act-are intended to ensure that the award system is more flexible and that there is a much greater emphasis on agreement making. That is why section 89A now limits the range of allowable award matters. It is early days. This is just one of the indications of the changes that the new act is now bringing into the system. There have been a lot of other early indications of these changes. For example, we have an application before the commission now for award simp lific,aticin for the commission to set the principl-s.That is a very significant matter which will, civer time, see the eradication of a ll11necessary red tape and proscription. We are also seeing a couple of section l11AAA applications. This is where the commission is dealing with an application for federal coverage where historically there has been state award coverage. The new act allows the commission, in setting a full bench, to have a commissioner from the state jurisdiction to sit on that full bench to adjudicame cate that particular application, which is part of our general push beyond the legislation to improve administration and harmonise between the state and federal systems. We have also seen around 13 applications under section 127. These are applications seeking a direction from the commission that people return to work and cease industrial action. In broad terms, without going to the details of those, what we are seeing is directions or people settling and coming to an agreement before the directions are actually issued. We are seeing people effect a speedy return to work, which was the design of section 127, and that is very encouraging. Lastly, in the same list of changes we are starting to see come through, we have seen a big change in the number of unfair dismissal applications lodged under the Workplace Relations Act. Up until about the end of February, we have had a 62 per cent drop in the number of unfair dismissal applications. If people have been unfairly treated, they still have a right to lodge an unfair dismissal application. That is as it should be. There is no doubt that there is a shift in attitudes, and that is to be encouraged. The reason it is important is that we do want to encourage small business to get on and create jobs. As Bob Carr once famously said, 'The unfair dismissal system that we inherited from Labor'-wmch we have now abolished-'was a major discouragement to the creation of jobs.' Members Travelling Allowances",20
47,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Administrative Services. In the interests of consistency and fairness, would the minister be prepared to table details of all travelling allowances paid to members of this lot of House since 3 March last year, given that senators' allowances are likely to be under close scrutiny and given the public concern that such allowances are not accountable and should be?",21
48,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The whole situation of travelling allowance is under the microscope at the moment, particularly from the press. In terms of the records that have been kept since we to office last year, I think that members of this House, by and large, are very honest in their claims. There are provisions, of course, within the system, to make those available to the House, but I would not want to do that myself without the concurrence of the whole House. If that is the House's wish, maybe we can look at it. Trans-Tasman Shipping",21
49,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,ANNE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. What new developments have occurred in trans-Tasman shipping since the government announced the illegal trade union accord had ended? What benefits has this had for Australian businesses and consumers?,21
50,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. She has taken an interest in shipping matters since she was elected to the House last year, particularly regard to Mackay Sugar's shipping arrangements which is a very important part of her local economy. For the last 35 years there has been an illegal accord between the maritime unions in Australia and New Zealand to ban international vessels carrying trade between Australia and New Zealand. That has cost this country dearly, it has cost our exporters dearly and it has cost our consumers dearly because of the increased cost of the carriage of goods between Australia and New Zealand. It has also hurt our capacity to create jobs this country because it has made Australian exports less competitive, therefore reducing our capacity to create jobs. At the last election, we brought forward a policy which said that we would do away with this illegal accord upon election to office. Last September, I was very pleased to be able to announce in the House that an agreement had been struck that would enable BHP shipping, in this instance, to carry goods between Australia and New Zealand on foreign flag vessels that they operated. As as our involvement in it was concerned, the government was involved with it from the beginning, right through the middle and to the end of that whole process. The announcement made by me last September in regard to the end of the trans-Tasman accord was reported in the Financial Review in comments by Mr Lance Hockridge, who is the manager of BHP Transport. Mr Hockridge said, 'My view is that this is the most substantial change in the maritime scene in probably 25 years.' I am very pleased to announce that, in addition to BHP shipping carrying goods between Australia and New Zealand on their international flag vessels, two other linesANZDL and Union Shipping-have agreed to operate ships with foreign flags on them carrying trade between Australia and New Zealand. This was reported, again in the Financial Review, on 14 February under a headline 'Trans-Tasman accord scuppered'. It quotes the leader of the New Zealand Seafarers Union, Mr Dave Morgan, who agrees with the headline. He agrees that the transTasman accord is, in a sense, now finished and that we will now have a competitive in regime for the carriage of goods between Australia and New Zealand. Since this initiative was announced last year, I am pleased to be able to report to the House that the cost of freight between Australia and New Zealand has come down by some 20 per cent. We would anticipate that there will be further reductions in the cost of freight between Australia and New Zealand. It must be remembered that Australia exports several times more goods to New Zealand than New Zealand exports to Australia; so this in disproportionately benefits the Australian economy. To answer the last part of the honourable member's question: the benefits of this go directly to consumers who will benefit from cheaper freight costs and therefore cheaper retail prices, to small business people, to exporters, to those people trying to create jobs and to those people who are seeking jobsbecause all of this will mean that Australia will be a more competitive export nation, which will help to reduce our foreign debt. far All of this could have been achieved by the previous Labor government in their 13 years in office. It only came about as a result of a change of government in March of last year which has led to this initiative being put into action, leading to benefits flowing to consumers, to exporters, to people seeking jobs and, indeed, to the reduction of our foreign debt. Middle East Peace Process",21
51,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the Australian government consider the building activities in Hebron sponsored by Mr Joseph Gutnick to be consistent with the Oslo agreements and the Hebron protocol? Does the government concur with the view of Shimon Peres concerning the impact of Mr Gutnick's activities on the Middle East peace process? Given Mr Gutnick's reported statement that he would cease his activities in Hebron if the Australian government asked him to do so, what, if any, representations is the government making to Mr Gutnick?",22
52,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me begin by saying that the House knows only too well that the Australian government has given very strong support to the Middle East peace process throughout. We have made consistent statements in support of that process on many occasions. As far as Mr Gutnick is concerned, I am aware of the interest that Mr Gutnick has in Israel and in particular in the issue, as I understand it, of settlements in Israel. But Mr Gutnick is a private Australian citizen and as an Australian citizen in a private capacity he is entitled to hold whatever view he likes and is entitled to spend his money however he likes as well. Mr Gutnick's activities are a matter for Mr Gutnick. The Australian government's position is a position of very strong support for the Middle East peace process. Whenever we have seen any weakening of commitment by any of the parties to that peace process, we have made it perfectly clear that we think the process should return to its track. Copyright Act . Mr BILSON-My question is addressed to . the Attorney-General. In light of the coalition's promise to make reform of the Copyright Act a priority, can the Attorney General advise the House what action the government has taken to fulfil this commitment?",22
53,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has decided to implement a number of key reforms to the Copyright Act to deliver on our election promises and, on that account, I am very grateful to the member for Dunkley for his question. I know how keenly interested he is in the subject of copyright. The amendments proposed will provide much needed protection for creators and will meet the challenges posed by some technological advances in the newspaper publishing industry. For the first time in Australia, there will be a legislative scheme that properly recognises the moral rights of creators to protect the integrity of their works and to claim authorship.",23
54,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have picked up our initiative.,23
55,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,An initiative that was announced during the election campaign.,23
56,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I announced this.,23
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison!,23
58,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just listen. Under moral rights, an artist will, for instance, be entitled to object to another person cutting up their painting and re-arranging it to produce an obscenity if that treatment of the work would prejudice the artist's honour or reputation. The same painter will be entitled to be attributed as the creator in any reproductions of the painting in, say, postcards or magazines. These rights will give proper legislative effect to our international obligations under the Berne convention. Most other common law countries have enacted moral rights in their copyright laws. Legislative recognition of moral rights represents a major breakthrough. The government's reforms also respond to the challenges posed by the changing technology for the publication of news, entertainment and information. Changes to journalists' copyright will promote the electronic publication and delivery of newspapers and magazines, thus allowing greater access by consumers. At the same time, however, employed journalists will retain traditional rights for independent book publication and photocopying of their works, and freelance journalists' rights are unchanged. These reforms are good news for Australian consumers and publishers of news, current affairs and information. It will assist them in making the most of the new on-line environment. Other reforms will eliminate the use of copyright in packaging and labelling to control marketing of imported articles that are not themselves copyright items. Improved payment procedures for government use of copyright materials will facilitate a government wide compliance with the obligation to pay copyright owners. Other amendments will mean more convenient access to copyright materials for educational institutions and people with print disabilities. The government will shortly be considering further reform of the act to allow for the more effective protection of copyright on the Internet and other new communications networks. The government has also reviewed and refocused the terms of reference of the Copyright Law Review Committee, which is now to report to the government by mid-1998 on simplification of the Copyright Act. Without opening up the basic copyright policy, the emphasis is on making the act more accessible and easier to understand. That represents a significant contribution to the fulfilment of coalition election promises. Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries",23
59,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and it relates to the letter that he tabled in the House. I refer the minister to the fact that that letter shows that DIST did not tell the industry how to conduct the lobbying campaign and that the industry organisation did not seek advice from either the minister or the department on that issue. It does not say, however, Minister, that you did not advise them. I therefore ask the minister: do you deny that you provided a hit list to industry and do you deny that you advised industry present how to lobby in relation to it?",24
60,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The tactics committee must be really short of something to say today. A very explicit answer was given last time to the question asked. I have no more to say. Tourism Industry,24
61,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the projected employment growth in Australia's expanding tourism industry, what steps is the government taking to ensure that the needs of employers and young people seeking work are being met?",24
62,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. As members of this House know, the tourism industry is one of Australia's most rapidly expanding industries, and we expect that there will be something like 685,000 jobs in that industry by the year 2003. It is very important from the point of view of the development of this industry that it be able to draw on a highly skilled and professional work force. I am very pleased to inform the House that the government has successfully negotiated and signed contracts for 2,990 new traineeships in the hospitality industry this year. These traineeship positions will be available in all states and territories. In line with the government's training reforms, the new traineeships have been designed and endorsed by the hospitality industry itself. I am pleased to say that contracts have been signed with some of Australia's largest hotel chains including the Mirvac Group which run the Marriott and Sebel hotels, the Accor group which run Novotel and Ibis hotels, the Radisson group, the Hamilton Island Resort earlier Management Chain and Southern Pacific Hotels corporation. I am sure that the members of this House whose electorates have these hotel chains in them will see the traineeships coming through over the next few months. I am sure that the members for Moncrieff, Dawson and Leichhardt will greet this news with great enthusiasm. It might even cheer up the poor old member for Sydney over there who, I am sure, will see some of these traineeships coming into his electorate. The government is committed to providing young Australians with quality training which is relevant to the needs of Australian industry. This announcement by me today fulfils the government's commitment to young people to bring through more and more opportunitiesnot for the kind of short-term, highly expensive programs that the member for Hotham was responsible for at $'143,000 a job",24
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A hundred and forty-three thousand! Disgraceful.,24
64,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some $143,000 per net job in the new work opportunities program, with its four per cent success rate. The government is committed to bringing through real job opportunities for young Australians. Wage Flexibility",24
65,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, now that the Treasurer has confirmed his views that greater wage flexibility-sometimes downwards-is needed and now that the Minister for Industrial Relations has said that he totally endorses these views, do you also endorse the view that downward flexibility in wages is needed? If so, does this mean that your pre-election commitments and rock solid guarantees about wages and award conditions were non-core promises?",24
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will tell you what I believe: I believe in the policy we took to the last election. I believe in the Workplace Relations Act. The Workplace Relations Act fully honoured the commitment I made about wage levels before the election-and that remains the policy of the government. Rural Telecommunications,25
67,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister outline the benefits to rural phone users as a result of the government's decision to accelerate the upgrade of rural communications infrastructure and the telecommunications liberalisation which will take effect on 1 July? In particular, can the minister give concrete examples of new and proposed investment in rural telecommunications in Australia? "", . Mr WARWICK SMITH-I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Indeed, I can inform the House that there has been a commitment by the government to upgrade the system of exchanges, the vital pieces of infrastructure that make Australia's telecommunications tick and take us into the modem era. The digitalisation process which is now under way is an election commitment made by the government. It is a process called the future mode of operations by Telstra and this was proposed by the Labor Party to see a digitalisation program met to nearly 95 per cent or thereabouts by 2002. But this government, recognising the need to take telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia, decided to bring that program forward. So I am pleased to be able to say that by July 1997,93.7 per cent of the upgrade will be completed. By December 1997-that is, the end of this year-97 per cent of that upgrade will be completed. This obviously contrasts with the statement by the Labor Party prior to the election that this would not be able to be achieved by this government. It is real, it is happening and rural and regional Australia are going to benefit. Furthermore, the member asks: are there some examples where these changes are going to deliver some huge benefits to regional and rural Australia? Last week in Townsville the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra announced that there will be full digitilisation of the exchanges by June this year-1997-and, within 12 months of June this year, surrounding areas in Townsville will get that upgrade. I have detailed in this House at some length to members during the extensive debate we had on the new legislation that there will be real benefits in the development of competitive providers of services. Mr Fitzgibbon-Do you support the review group's recommendations?",25
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hunter!,25
69,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are the apprentice of motormouth down here, are you? Listen and you might learn something. Northgate Communications announced last week that from 1 July there will be free local calls and SID reductions in prices by one-third in the Ballarat area and that within three to five years that will be extended to other areas. There is a $20 million infrastructure investment by this company in that region. The article, which many members would have seen, particularly those members who represent Geelong, Bendigo and Wodonga, also said that Northgate have indicated they are going to proceed in the future to spend a further $65 million to develop further services which will build on what they are going to do in Ballarat. Mr Lee--Do you guarantee to?",25
70,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the member over there in a moment. Austar is another company that has indicated that it is going to proceed to continue with its major roll-out for telecommunications services into regional Australia. They are now connected to 60,000 homes in regional and rural Australia and are spending somewhere in the vicinity of $470 million as an investment, developing microwave MDS satellite services to take entertainment services and other services to these places. Paynet, another company in Cairns and Townsville, will be of interest to the member for Leichhardt. Rocom, another company in regional Queensland, will be doing much the same. The impact is a dramatic increase in jobs. We have already seen the product of telecommunications infrastructure upgrade with the Ansett National Reservations Centre moving with the latest of technology to the regional centre of Launceston. These call centres will be developed right around Australia. Finallyit is important for members to understand itthe commitment by the government to a $250 million regional telecommunications fund will provide the basic infrastructure for those areas of Australia that benefit even further from these roll-outs and new services, which means jobs so that rural and remote Australia will be in touch with the rest of Australia. Only this government has made a commitment to do it-and those opposite ought to get their facts straight. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport",25
71,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is it true that the government is expecting to raise more than $3 billion from the sale of Sydney airport? Does that mean there will be considerable pressure to have more than 80 operations per hour at that airport, once it is sold? Does the government remain committed to introducing legislation to cap aircraft movements to a maximum of 80 per hour at that airport and, if so, when will you introduce that legislation?",26
72,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the honourable member for Grayndler's question is that Sydney airport is not for sale. The answer to the second aspect of his question in regard to the cap is yes. The answer to the third part of your question, 'Wri'en?'soon. Their Service-Our Heritage",26
73,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to the government's new four-year commemorative program called 'Their Service-Our Heritage'. How can my constituents in the electorate of Dickson participate in and contribute to this program?,26
74,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dickson for his question and recognise his ongoing commitment to the veteran community and the work he does to ensure that veterans are recognised. 'Their Service-Our Heritage' is a four-year program which will run up to the centenary of Federation of our nation. It is important as we move towards our centenary of Federation that we acknowledge the service and sacrifice that have been made by our veteran community since Federation. Of major consideration for a federation were defence concerns. So it is very important that we link the service of our veteran community to our centenary of Federation. This program will be funded by the government and, importantly, will be driven by the community. That will allow all members of this House and senators to participate in this program. I will outline a couple of the programs that we announced yesterday. One program we will be running will be the regional memorials restoration program. The member for Dickson since coming down here has been an advocate of the importance of regional memorials and acknowledges that many regional communities have difficulties upgrading and maintaining those memorials because of the limited funds available in local communities. The Australian War Memorial is putting together travelling art exhibitions and artefact exhibitions. It is not about using war or military art for the sake of it; it is about educating the community. The War Memorial currently has about 6,000 works of art and artefacts kept in storage. I think it is only right that some of those art exhibitions and works of art travel around Australia. Many parts of regional Australia will have access to those works of art through those exhibitions for the very first time. Mr Beazley interjecting",26
75,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a good suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition. We will also be funding the education of this in our schools. All schools in Australia will receive teaching resources, which will include an ANZAC kit and a Vietnam War kit. This acknowledges the increasing interest of younger generations of Australians in our military history. We will also be a major sponsor of the national history challenge. In the lead-up to our centenary ation and in cooperation with our defence department, we are investigating ways establishing a nominal roll of all those who have served in this nation since Federation. believe that that nominal roll could form significant gift to this nation on our centenary of Federation. It is' important that in our centenary of Federation we acknowledge that peace in this nation came at a price-and that price is something we must continue to honour in this nation. 'Their Service-Our Heritage' will build on the commemoration program that we have seen in this nation for many years. , MrHoward- Mr Speaker, I ask wether questions be placed on the Notice ---r, . '.

NA Code of Conduct",27
77,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you will recall that in the last parliament an ad hoc committee was established to represent the interests of all members and senators from political parties and the Independents and it examined a code of conduct for members and senators and also for ministers. You will also be aware that the opportunity, I think, has been provided in the Senate for some debate on that code. I wonder whether you might hold some discussions with the Leader of the House and the government to see whether an opportunity might not be provided for that issue to be brought before this House for discussion and also whether you could ascertain whether the government has any intentions in respect of of Federthose various codes of conduct.",27

81,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to provide adequate accountability for the management of the Natural Heritage Trust. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",28
82,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fremantle) (3.14 p.m.)It is very important, as this matter has been the subject of recent discussion, that the House have the opportunity to look at the whole question of how the trust has been established. The community in recent days has been subjected to some pretty high-blown rhetoric from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the Natural Heritage Trust. A lot of this rhetoric actually started during the election campaign, when it was claimed by Mr Howard that the trust would be a huge boost for the environment and it was claimed by the shadow minister at the time that the expenditure would be twice the size as that of the former government. In fact, the Prime Minister described the Natural Heritage Trust in a recent address to the Liberal Party in New South Wales, and there is a fair bit of hubris in this, as 'the greatest ever capital investment in Australia's environmental future'. Not one for understatement our Prime Minister. He claimed that it would be one of his proudest boasts if he could, as he said 'go to the next election pointing to a program of environmental commitment and environmental reform, because that was an area in earlier years where the Liberal and National parties lagged'. You can say that again, but whether or not he will be able to make that boast is quite another matter. What I would argue is that the Prime Minister and his ministers will have to lift their games considerably if these proud boasts are to be any more than hot air, because the clean green image they went to the last election with is already very severely tarnished indeed. It is all very well to point to the Natural Heritage Trust, but there are a whole lot of other areas of environmental policy that are sadly lacking. The record of the government, to date, tells you more than a lot of that proud boasting. For instance, to date, the government has been rolling back environmental protection in the following ways. It has all but given the places. green light to the expansion of uranium mining in the Kakadu world heritage area. It has already cut the environment budget alone by nearly $30 million, not to mention landcare budgets. It has given the green light to Keith Williams's massive Hinchinbrook resort development. I must say that is despite departmental and scientific advice concluding that it would have an adverse impact on the world heritage values of the adjacent Hinchinbrook Channel. What is more, the Prime Minister decided it was worth his intervention. He had a little private meeting with Mr Williams and the Premier of Queensland and he will not tell anyone what was said or what was concluded. So he is very definitely involved. Indeed, he announced it before the minister responsible exercised his statutory powers, under duress, I might say. The government has already given state governments the power to veto the listing of world heritage areas. That is a big step backwards. It has attempted to abolish its export control powers for minerals. That would have seen, for instance, sand mining on Fraser Island. It has approved the largest volume of native forest woodchips to be exported in Australia's history. It has abolished the ethanol bounty scheme designed to assist with the development of cleaner fuels. It has cut labour market programs enormously with significant environmental components such as LEAP. It has already diluted Australia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the list could go on and on. I intend to look at some of the areas where there have been particular cuts. If you look at the record to date, particularly of the Prime Minister, who is fond of trumpeting his achievements in advance, given his Port Hinchinbrook involvement, you would have to say that he is already due a couple of memorial awards. He wants to be remembered for doing the right thing by the environment. Perhaps he should try a couple of these on for size. Maybe the Prime Minister could be awarded the Dugong Memorial Award in honour of his steadfast commitment to species extinction. Or perhaps we should give the Orange Yellow-bellied Parrot Testimonial in honour of Robert Hill's yellow-bellied approach to protecting the environment generally. Or perhaps he could receive the Golden Labrador Award for rolling over when Keith Williams, Rob Borbidge. the Prime Minister, Warwick Parer, Tim Fischer, John Anderson, Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all snapped their fingers. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who is at the table here, should be given the Apocalyptic Landscape Prize for his efforts to create lots of open spaces where native forests once stood. We could give the Glow-in-the-Dark Award to the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) for his commitment to establishing a uranium mine on every comer of this country. That is the record that we have seen to date. Mr Crean interjecting",28
83,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. I must say that the way this trust has been established confirms our fears that it would be a huge slush fund for marginal seat coalition MPs. The money is almost certainly going to be allocated on the basis of political rather than environmental needs. We already have examples of this with $115 million going to buy Senator Harradine's vote on the Telstra sale and a $300 million promise made by Court for a major salinity program during the WA election-and that has not been repudiated. The bill is still before the Senate, but they are advertising for this slush fund. It does little more than establish a bank account. There is no philosophical commitment to the environment or, indeed, to specific objectives in the environment. For example, the loss of biodiversity was established by the State of the Environment report last year as the major environmental problem facing Australia, yet there is absolutely no mechanism in the government's legislation for money to be spent on programs which address this problem or indeed any others. It is completely open to all possibilities, principally marginal seats. It is interesting that the government has ignored calls, including from the Senate committee and its own members in the Senate, to provide some level of public scrutiny and expert input instead of simply relying on the two ministers to have a chat and decide how the fund should be spent. In fact, it has explicitly rejected a board, an amendment that we put forward, and it also appears it has rejected a more modest proposal for an advisory committee to have some input into these two ministers' cosy chats about where the $1.2 billion is to go. If nothing else, that confirms the pretty reasonable suspicion that the ministers want to be unfettered by any public scrutiny at all. They will simply place those funds where they want to. It will not be based on expert advice, and it certainly will not be based on environmental objectives. It is also pretty clear that the funds placed in the trust from the sale of Telstra will replace those formerly applied from consolidated revenue. We have already seen cuts of over 13 per cent in the environment budget, so they are starting well behind the eight ball. Some $70 million in total is already missing. It is very interesting to look at the words of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on this point. He has actually acknowledged that, in fact, this will be replacement funding. We funded the environment programs quite properly from consolidated revenue. What we are seeing from the government is the Telstra fund-the sale of Telstra money-now replacing what was formerly in consolidated revenue. When Senator Faulkner asked in the Senate whether the Telstra money was additional as promised-they made much of this promise during the election campaign: this was all going to be additional funding; it would not be replacing eXlstmg program money-Senator Hill was forced to concede, 'Our objective was the trust fund would be additional money on the forward estimates. Since the election the forward estimates have had to be reduced to reflect savings. To some extent, the trust may be called upon to pick up lapsed programs.' In other words, we were dead right when we said this was not new money, and it is already happening. The important thing we need to recognise is that the real level of funding, if you look at the budget cuts they have already made, is already starting to look pretty paltry. You have the sale of a third of one of our major assets, and what do you get in return? The billion dollar commitment simply does not add up. A careful analysis of the funding shows that the much touted billion dollars translatesand this is a very careful analysis, and it has not been repudiated despite the fact that it has been in the public domain for some timeinto just $84.3 million extra per year over what we had committed in government. That is because they are pulling the funds out everywhere else. Despite promising, with great fanfare, that the funds would be 'additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and sustainable agriculture elements of the primary industry portfolio'-and when pressed on that the Prime Minister said it would all be in addition-the reality is, as we have seen, that cuts to both Environment Australia and DPIE in the recent budget mean that this year's funding is already down by $76 million. Even with the extra funding from the sale of Telstra-because they have lost one year minus $76 million; they have put small amounts in proposed for the next financial year-by the time we get to the next election the government will have spent just $59 million extra per year over and above what the former government had committed in the forward estimates; not even in the election campaign but in the forward estimates. Hardly the great bonanza that was promised from the $10 billion sale of one of our most precious public assets. If you take account of the funds that are exclusively allocated to Tasmania-that little vote buying exercise-the states and territories, apart from Tasmania, Senator Harradine's home turf, will get only $42 million to share between them per year. For my state, that means $4.2 million extra. So much for Richard Court's $300 million for one program alone. It makes it, frankly, a joke. If you look at the community guide for applications to the trust, which has been put out very arrogantly in advance of the bill actually being passed by the Senate, you see that the programs that were formerly funded from consolidated revenue are now included in the trust-all the programs we ran are listed there-and people are invited to apply to the trust for funding for those programs. The national landcare program, the vegetation initiative, Waterwatch Australia, the national fish care program, the national wetlands program and the Murray-Darling 2000 program are all now going to be funded apparently through the mechanism of Telstra and, according to Minister Hill, probably with Telstra funds as well. So what we will see at the end of the time is all the environment funds coming out of Telstra, there will be nothing left in consolidated revenue, and the small amount of money from the balance of the Telstra funds-the $300 million that is to be invested; it will not amount to tens of millions of dollars-will be all that is left for the environment in Australia. The announcement we saw yesterday on the oceans policy--or, more strictly, the intention to develop one-showed too that the allocation will be biased towards industry development and protection, not towards environmental protection. It is interesting that the minister who is apparently going to reply to this matter of public importance today is the minister responsible for primary industries.",29
84,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He's the big gainer. A big pool of dough for him.,30
85,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. He has a whole new bag of money that his department did not have before. The Telstra fund will be used, at least in large measure, for industry programs. We have no objection to good industry programs, no objection to good programs for sustainable agriculture, but this was promised as an environment program-at least to manage rehabilitationMr Crean-They don't have an industry policy yet.",30
86,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, they do not have any policy at all in most of these areas. Telstra is a classic case; we do not have an environment policy here. We have some money-a bank account-w.hic- is repla-ing proper funding. Professor Kitchmg, who IS a well re&pected commentator in this area, said there was an inherent conflict, as he saw it, in having the primary industries portfolio-:--olio is perhaps a good word, the way the mInIster actually uses it-and the environment portfolio together. He said: It is probably true to say that the single activity which is having the most negative impact on the on-going loss of biodiversity in Australia is primindustry, through activities such a- vege-atlOn clearing, the altering of water and nutnent regimes, and the introduction-accidentally or deliberatelyof exotic animals ranging from foxes and rabbits to sheep and cows. I am .not pas-ing judg-ent on any of those things. I am Just saymg that thiS does put the primary industries. portfolio in a v-ry different position from the environment portfoho ... Having them negotiate about those funds will be very difficult indeed. We need to know too whether, in not only the oceans policy but the Natural Heritage Trust generally, they are proposing to rebadge a lot of the former government's initiatives. It is no.t clear how much, if any, is new money. It IS clear, for instance, that they have cut the coastcare program by $4 million, with the result that the Local Government Association, which knows about such things, said in response to the big fanfare yesterday-we had a prime ministerial announcement of a no policy yesterday-that it was disappointed that only $6.5 million had been allocated to coastal planning. You might think that saying you are disappointed with $6.5 million is a bit unreasonable, but it said that it was less than the former government had promised. Mr Crean-Are you going to get a letter of correction off them?",31
87,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. This new policy that we had yesterday was actually. a backwards step. None of this is really surpn-Â­ ing when you understand the way that thIS policy was actually devised-and it is very typical of the Howard conservative opportunism. First of all, a poll driven concern for the environment: during the election campaign, and subsequently, they stuck their fingers in the wind to see just how much th.ey could get away with. They go and stand WIth a couple of well-known environmentalists, stand by the trees for a bit and hope that people accept that as their true image. - hey read the polls very carefully-and AustralIans are very committed to protecting the environment. Then there is the big con of requiring people to accept the sale of Telstra if they want to get any environment money at all. 'Do you care for the environment? Then you accept the sale of Telstra'-a direct leverage. This idea of linking the sale of Telstra to the Natural Heritage Trust was said to be the Prime Minister's own inspiration. It is said that he was walking around the streets of Sydney one day, maybe somewhere in his suburb--I am not exactly sure where-and on seeing the conjunction of the trees and the wires overhead he thought, 'Ah, treestransmission of electricity; there has to be something in that.' Anyway, he was supposed to be the one who thought this good idea up. It is typical of his eccentric, back-of-theenvelope approach to policy making. He gets into trouble one minute and we have a work for the dole program the next minute. During the campaign he has not got an environment policy; he takes a walk through the streets and suddenly he has got a policy. I would finally like to draw members' attention to the real story spelt out in Science and Technology, a little magazine, where a senior government adviser spills the be-ns, describing the trust as a 'blatant and CYnIcal political fraud', knowingly established - nd 'invented overnight' as a means of softenmg reaction to the sale of Telstra. So the government is a long way from earning any accolades. The Howard tactic of claiming the high ground and saying he has already achieved these admirable goals might sound good, but the reality leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth indeed.",31
88,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (3.29 p.m.)So utterly pressing, so utterly essential, to raise this matter of great national importance and integrity before the national parliament, before the Australian people, this matter of such universal interest to the Australian people, that we did not get a single question on it in question time while it was still being broadcast, despite the fact that it was the subject of the matter of public importancethe most important debate of the day in this place. I think that about says it all. We could speculate on a whole range of reasons why the minister who has just departed-not even going to do the courtesy that I always extended when I was",32
89,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am still here. I am not a minister any more.,32
90,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I beg your pardon; you are still here, good, because I would rather like you to hear the rebuttal that I am going to put to some of your points today. So I am glad that you are here. No-one is really prepared to stand by you. You could speculate on just why it is that there were no questions. What we got instead was the trivial pursuit of ministers like John Moore over matters of no substance that he was plainly able to rebutand yet they came back for more. You do not believe in this MPI. Your tactics committee did not believe in the MPI. And your team did not put too much emphasis on the issue at all-just like you haven't on a whole range of other environmental issues over the last 12 months. There have been press releases and statements made outside of this place but no challenges in here, no opportunity for us to highlight how idiotic and shallow they really are. When it comes to credibility gaps, I foreshadow that I will come back to that in a moment. In the meantime, I appreciate the opportunity in this House to clarify aspects of the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust. This is without question, demonstrably, obviously, the greatest commitment to the environment and sustainable agriculture that we have seen in this country-you cannot get away from it. And the trust is essentially a repository for funds and a mechanism for the coordinated delivery of a range of initiatives-very important thought-through initiatives-aimed at the conservation and sustainable management of Australia's natural resources. In fact, those opposite did not support the policy. They were not prepared to vote for what amounted to good communications policy, good economic policies and outstanding environment and sustainable agriculture usage policies-and, for that matter, policies which would do a lot to generate jobs in regional Australia. They were not prepared to support it; they are not prepared now to be objective about it. And that is what we have seen in the evidence of this very superficial MPI and the debate that has gone with it so far. The fact of the matter is that not only is this a valuable program but the way in which it is to be distributed and the accountability procedures are first-class. They are based largely on established models-models that have been around for quite a while, that over many years have proved to be durable and proved to have provided the very accountability that the shadow minister says she is concerned about. And she ought to have a good look at them. In relation to the area that she is trying to home in on-although she did not draw it out-a large proportion of the Natural Heritage Trust funds will be available for distribution to community groups and agencies through a competitive bidding process based on merit. We actually want the communities out there at the coalface that are dealing with Australia's land and natural resources, that know what the problems are, that are committed to putting the problems right, to have a bit of ownership over this. We want to actually tap into their expertise. We do not want to tell them from on top what we are going to do. That was Labor's way. You're the authoritarians. You're the people who reckon that you know better than the people in the community how best to run their affairs and how to best meet the objectives of such important projects as are before us. For project assessment, we have put out a booklet that sets out the guidelines against which those who seek funding must judge their program initially before they even bother filling out the form. Project assessment will be a rigorous process undertaken through community based regional and state assessment panels. Those panels will include appropriate representation from landcare groups, farmers, conservation organisations, industry, local government and state agencies responsible for vegetation, land and water management, nature conservation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests. If any believes that a program that was an obvious rort was going to get through a group of community people like that without somebody blowing the whistle, they have got rocks in their head. It is the very genesis of an accountable system. It starts at grassroots level with widespread involvement of people at the level of the local community. Representatives, I must add, of other relevant interest groups and independent experts may also be involved and separate advisory committees may be set up to provide expert technical advice to the state assessment panels. It is not surprising that the previous speaker, the honourable member for FremantIe (Dr Lawrence), addressed none of these issues, because they undermine her very case. The panels therefore will have a balance of expertise and local knowledge that will ensure that projects address priority issues in the most effective way. Assessment panels will consider the eligibility of each funding application against objectives and eligibility criteria set out, as I mentioned a moment ago, in the application guidelines. Each project will be assessed for the appropriateness of its objectives and the feasibility of its methods. The relative merit of each project will then be assessed according to local, state and national priorities. I repeat: assessed according to local, state and national priorities. It is more than a threestage process because it has to go through an exhaustive localised process first. But if you put that in one grouping, it then goes through the state assessment program and then comes on for final federal consideration, given that we are providing a lot of the funding. We have been at great pains to ensure that the trust has the highest safeguards against misspending of Commonwealth funds. Why wouldn't we? Does anybody doubt, for example, my personal commitment to this program? Does anybody actually think I would put it at risk by exposing it to the sham assessment processes that the previous government did with the sports rorts? Do you actually think we would bring it undone by that sort of approach? Under that approach it was said by the then shadow Treasurer: . .. what we now know is that a person in the days of the previous government only needs three things to administer a taxpayer funded program: a whiteboard, a textacolour and a rubber--especially the rubber, because the rubber is very important to take the details off the whiteboard before the auditor comes in. It is unbelievable. I cannot get over the gall of it all. The trust legislation places clear and specific limitations on the purposes for which funds out of the trust can be used. As the trust board, the Minister for the Environment and I will be required to provide estimates to parliament to report on trust activities and to appear before the Senate estimates committee. I really do not think there is any ground at all for saying that the thing is not going to be thoroughly scrutinised. It just does not stand up. Each of these occasions will provide the opportunity for full scrutiny-parliamentary and outside of the trust activities. In short, the trust will operate transparently; it will be fully accountable, and so will Minister Hill and I. The policies on which this government was elected clearly identified caring for farmland and the deVelopment of sustainable agriculture as major policy objectives. It just happens to be the case-those opposite do not like itthat farmers and graziers manage 60 per cent or so of Australia's land area and use some 80 per cent of available water. It would be absurd to think that substantive overall progress could be achieved in addressing the problems of land and water degradation and loss of biodiversity unless a major effort is directed at sustainable management of agriculturallands with the involvement of the people who own and manage that land. Funding will go principally to groups, not to individuals, and public rather than private benefit will be the objective, but the two overlap. That is self-evident. We want to be fed. We want rural jobs. We want sustainable agriculture. It does impact on the environment. You need an integrated approach. The authoritarians opposite do not want an integrated approach. They do not want to involve the people and have to manage and look after the land, but that is typical of their authoritaryears Ian, on-top sort of approach. It is about more than just improving the management of agricultural land. It will enable the land, water and vegetation used in agriculture to be managed in conjunction with the natural and environmental resources in reserves and on other public land. It will address the decline in the quality and coverage of native vegetation, improve the management of our rivers and coasts and address problems created by weeds and vertebrate pests. The much needed rapid shift towards ecological sustainability for Australia will only be achieved through open, cooperative and effective community based processes and strong partnerships with states, based on trust. If we undermine the trust-the trust of the Australian people-it will fall over. We do not operate from the low base that you do anyway. You would know all about shams in this area. At the very least, give us credit for being pragmatic. We do not want the thing to fall over so we are not going to allow its credibility to be undermined. That was the mistake you made. We learnt that from you lot with the white board affair. In summary, the processes of the Natural Heritage Trust will be accountable, transparent and based on merit, unlike your record in these areas. I have to come to the issue of credibility. I have to say that I am absolutely astounded at the hypocrisy of the member for Fremantle and indeed the whole of the Labor Party in asking this question because, if there is one political party and one member of parliament who ought not raise issues of accountability, it is you lot. Let us just recap on a few things. We had a succession of Labor governments who bankrupted the coffers of state governments around this country. So much for their financial credibility before the Australian people. In Western Australia, the home of the person who raised this MPI about accountability, a former ALP Premier and Deputy Premier have been gaoled for their lack of accountability. We had a federal Labor government which, over 13 years, recklessly handled the finances of this country. Over the last five of their term, the former government spent on behalf of Australians $69,000 million that they did not have. You talk about credibility and you talk about decency, but who do you expect to repay it? Future generations. It is called intergenerational theft. How did they distribute the money they did not have? They did it on a white board. It goes on and on. I really do not think that the member who raised this MPI is in a position to be raising issues of credibility, given that she is plainly attempting to imply that Senator Hill and I cannot be trusted to act with integrity. That is the implication behind the MPI. You can draw no other conclusion. I find it offensive that you feel that you can actually raise it in this way. I think our track record gives us every right to say that that is out of order-it is beyond the pale. Mr Deputy Speaker, you talk to me about credibility. The people of Australia elected the coalition government to clean up the mess made by the Labor Party. We are doing that. I can assure everyone in this House that the government stands for high levels of accountability. It is very important to us indeed. In conclusion, I say that there is no substance to these allegations. At the very least, you ought to acknowledge that, given our very real commitment to these programs, we are not going to blow them out of the water by undermining their credibility. I cannot believe that you are serious. I do not believe that you are serious. I do not believe that you believe it yourself",32
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I assure the minister that I am very serious, and I request that he address his remarks through the chair.",34
92,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"All right, Mr Deputy was Speaker. I repeat that I do not believe that shadow minister who raised this MPI is to serious. I do not believe that she really bearguing lieves the allegations stack up. not believe that there is a case to answer. And I can only conclude by saying that I have far more important things to do.",35
93,Mr HATTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I actually thought it was fairly important for ministers to speak in the House in defence of - ow they are running their departments and m defence of legislation that has been brought in by t.h-ir government. However, apparently the minIster at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), thinks otherwise. Let me begin in this MPI by being generous-not too generous but somewhat generous-to the coalition government in regard to th-Naturai Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. I can be generous because $1 billion will be expended on environmental and sustainable a-ricultureÂ· projects over the next five years, with $300 million remaining in the fund in perpetuity. I can certainly be generous in that regard because that will be devoted to five program areas-vegetation, rivers, biodiversity, landcare, and coasts and clean seas. The other reason I can be generous is that all of the initiatives outlined in the bill are not worthwhile but have the support of the Labor opposition because most of them were contained in Labor's 'Our Land' environment policy announced prior to the 1996 election. I can be generous on those grounds. In see-ing to be generous to the government, I am m fact being generous to Labor Party policy that this government, having been elected about a year ago, is putting into place. In regard to those initiatives, there is praise from the opposition because they are actually putting initiatives into place that were Labor generated initiatives of great point and purpose and are directed towards a sound and sensible balance between the environment and sustainable development. !he MPI questions the very point of why thl- trust was set up. If we are looking for a ratlOnale-a set of reasons-for why this trust put into place, we can look in a number the .of places. The government has been generous itself, but possibly generous to a fault in that the single argument for this t;ust I certainly do being put together is: ... t.o provide - surance that there was a greater certrunty of fundmg for nominated projects over a period of time than would be the case under the normal annual appropriations process. That is a very interesting set of reasons for why we should have this legislation, for why there should be a Natural Heritage Trust-to provide an assurance that there be a greater certainty of funding for these projects in five areas than would be the case under the normal annual appropriations process. For those in the wider community who are listening to this debate, that process, of course, is the budget. What did this coalition government do in the bud-et? Did they - rovide greater certainty of fundmg for the enVIronmental projects that they were supposed to have in place? No. !hey c-t and slashed them. Thirteen per cent m nommal terms was cut from environmental funding by this coalition government in the budget last year. As the shadow minister indicated in her speech, when looking at the performance of the Howard government on environmental issues in this past year we see only that bad environmental decisions have been made one after the other. In the long term those decisions will have a major impact on Australia. We have got bad policy linking into previous bad policy by previous coalition governments, and in this bill to set up this heritage trust there is an admission that the coalition government cannot even trust itself. It cannot trust itself from budget 1996-97 to budget 1997-98 to allocate funds to programs relating to the environment or sustainable land care. We. haye said it from the start. They are saymg It themselves. They have admitted, in the rationale for this bill, that they cannot trust themselves not to further cut funding in those two areas. I do not need to be generous to them in regard to that. They have been entirely generous to us in fully, totally and, for once, honestly admitting that there is no security and no guarantee from this government for major programs in the budget process. What they have done-the shadow minister pointed this out-is take money out of consolidated revenue and place it in this trust. There is a heritage element involved in this. In 1949 the Chifley government brought in the national welfare fund. Workers put into a national welfare fund 71f2 per cent extra of moneys to establish what effectively would be a superannuation fund for the whole of Australia for the next 50 to 100 years. Bob Menzies, as Prime Minister, later took Â£100 million of the people's money from that national welfare fund-an equivalent to this type of trust-and put it into consolidated revenue. And we have never seen it since. The troubles we have had with trying to rebuild the superannuation system go to the theft of that money by the Prime Minister of Australia from that welfare fund and putting it into consolidated revenue. Here we have a situation where money is taken out of consolidated revenue-$1 billion-and then placed into a trust fund and, at the same time, there are direct budget cuts to environmental and sustainable agriculture programs. We have got an exact reverse of the earlier situation. But from one coalition government to another coalition government they are constant in the fact that they have real regard for the working people of Australia or for major environmental and agricultural programs that Australian people depend upon. The coalition have not changed since Menzies. The Prime Minister can be very proud of the fact that he has done a Menzies reversal in this regard. The coalition actually own up to the fact that they cannot trust themselves, so the money has to be put aside in a special fund. What they have not owned up to very well, but what is absolutely, markedly, totally, and completely and utterly clear is that on 2 March John Howard went to the election promising a link between the sale of one-third of Telstra and providing a $1 billion environment package, encapsulated in this bill. He did it for two reasons: firstly, to con the Australian public at large and to con the environmental movement into believing that there really was a green heart in John Howard and a green heart in the coalition; and, secondly, to con them into believing that a major program would be put into place over and above normal expenditure. As the shadow minister has pointed out, there is only $84 million a year over and above normal expenditure. There are a whole string of broken promises in regard to this matter. But that would not concern the Prime Minister. This was a cunning, gulling, deceptive procedure that he undertook prior to the last election, and it was based on trying to work his way into office. Well, he has succeeded, let me be generous in that: he has a great majority at this time. What has now become entirely apparent, even to some of the Liberal advisers-referred to by the shadow minister in a quote from a Science Technology article-is that this exercise was in fact a 'blatant and cynical political fraud'. Opposition members-Hear, hear! "" Mr HATTON-My colleagues say, 'Hear, hear!' I absolutely agree with that. A particular government adviser goes on to say that this plan was devised 'as a purely political exercise' by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb--the person no who comes up day after day with his polling figures, who has a little chat with the Prime Minister and tells him, 'Yes, this one has also gone down well. You have got away with it so far.' The coalition came into government by taking people aside and telling them that they would have a major environmental project. They were successful also in the Senate in using this ruse to get Senators Harradine and Colston to vote with them on the most damaging and the greatest and most violent act against public ownership in this country-the sale of one-third of Telstra. At the end of five years, when the money has run out from this bill, where will they seek to get more money? Will it be from boba-job week? Will they get the scouts on to it? Alternatively, they have still got two-thirds of Telstra to sell. The partial sale of Telstra represents the greatest vandalism that has ever been done to public property. That vandalism has not been directed at the full $1 billion going into new expenditure-which is what they argue-but vandalism directed at the Australian people. (Time expired)",35
94,Mrs STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a most amazing experience to sit here and listen to the opposition talking about responsibility for the environment and about accountability. At the last election we saw landslide voting for members of the coalition to represent regional Australia. In my own electorate, the Labor vote went down from 30 per cent to 19 per cent because people outside capital cities understood that they were bleeding, that their environment which sustains their agribusiness, the biodiversity of this country-the forests, the lakes, the rivers-had received absolutely no attention, no long-term planning and no commitment under the previous government. In fact, on or before 2 March 1996 the votersÂ· bf Australia saw disrespect for the communities who were trying to do right by sustaining agriculture, sustaining the environment. They saw disrespect in the sense of the whiteboard. Remember the whiteboard? We were told that you got yourself some community grants by having your name up in texta colour in the minister's office. If you were lucky, you did not have a quick swipe with a feather duster, you stayed on there and got some funds. What an incredible way to treat people who want a future, whose children look forward to a future, in an environment which is sustainable. We know, of course, about the sports rorts. We know about the fact that in the past, under the present opposition's guidance, if you were not in a Labor seat you could forget about any help or support whatsoever. The electorate spoke very loudly on 2 March last year. Today, we have a government who understands that Australia is extraordinarily fragile in terms of its geographic, geomorphic and hydrogeological characteristics. We have been farming it and developing our urban areas only for the last 200 years, but in those 200 years we have done a lot of things wrong. We, as the government of the day, understand that it is going to cost substantially in effort and dollars to correct has taken place over the last 200 years. In particular, we have to spend a lot of dollars and work cooperatively with the people to overcome the last decade of mismanagement and disrespect from the then government of the day. Let me give you some examples of the sort of disrespect we saw. For example, there was a 2,000-kilometre blue-green algal bloom in the Darling River just a couple of years ago. A minute ago, the opposition-and quite rightly now the opposition-suggested that they were on top of that. A 2,OOO-kilometre algal bloom! They said, 'It can be overcome; we know how to do it.' But they did not have the funds or the commitment to even begin to address it. Lake Mokoan in the north-east of Victoria has suffered an algal bloom every year for the last 10 years. Every year for two or three months that lake is poison. It is a major public health risk. Its biodiversity is substantially diminished because for two or three months every year for the last decade there has been a blue-green algal bloom. The blue-green algal blooms of Australia are a symptom. They are a symptom of a country which is crying out for different land practices, for research and development, for people who can manage the environment who are not so close to the breadline that they cannot do the sorts of investing that is needed to manage the land differently. It was this opposition that sat around on its hands when we had these sorts of crises developing and sitting there in front of us. Let us talk about the wetlands throughout Australia. We had a lot of frog counting going on, and where there was something to be photographed it looked as though some of the opposition's ministers were there to the forefront, but in reality we saw our biodiversity dive. The wetlands of Kerang, in my own electorate, are of absolute international heritage proportions with the biggest ibis rookeries in the world. It is a wonder today that they are sustainable. Again, the algae has got them. There are major problems with feral animals-with foxes, wild cats and so on. There was absolutely no indication that the government of the day had any sense of what where that place was, much less any determination to move any funds towards sustaining it. We heard a little bit of nonsense from the opT1osition a minute ago about the oceans and our coasts and the continental shelf. I have just spent some months going around Australia with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs and we have been talking to the fishers of Australia-the fishing men and women. They were beside themselves with frustration under the previous government, having to throwaway their bycatch because it was not legal for them to bring it into shore to be counted. The industry management could gain no sense of what the biomass was. We had quotas that did not work. We had confusion between state and federal jurisdictions in terms of who was looking after the fish resource. We had exploitation going on with no sense of how many fish and what varieties were there. There was no commitment to ongoing research. So yesterday our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced policy which at last addresses our coastlines, our fishing industry and our international obligations in relation fish that travel from one part of the world to the other. I hope it is not too late-we have had so much damage in the last decade-but at least we are getting stuck in there now. We are making policy decisions and funding them. We are putting the money where our mouth is. Perhaps the opposition is overawed by the $1.2 billion price tag of our environment. Dr Lawrence interjecting",37
95,Mrs STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You see, the member for Fremantle is quite amazed by it. She cannot quite contain herself. She is amazed. Let me explain the value of our environment and the costs of setting things right. For example, the Shepparton region was one of the earliest regions to be irrigated. Therefore, it was one of the first regions in Australia to show signs of high water table damage. There are only 500,000 hectares in this small area and only half of the total area of 500,000 hectares is irrigated, but there is an annual economic output from that small area of $4.4 billionthat is, the annual economic outcome. It exports $800 million annually. There is some $5 billion invested in food processing in that small area and $100 million of that was invested in the last five years in the irrigated agricultural region of that few 500,000 hectares. Some $50 million to $60 million in salinity management is invested each year by the land-holders. The land-holders are committed to that level of investing. With this Natural Heritage Trust, we are proposing to stand beside those land-holders, to respect the work they are putting in, to understand that we cannot impose policy from above. We cannot say, 'You do it right or we'll put the price of your water up, or we'll drive you out of business.' We are saying to them, 'You're being committed to sustainable development. We're going to help you with research and development, with on-the ground, bottom up dollars to revegetate, to look after your streams and river systems, to deal with your feral animals, to put in drainage. We are actually going to sit beside you and cooperate. We respect what you do.' Yes, the funds will be fully accountable. We have a long history of accountability for to the funds that we expend on environmentally sustainable work in Victoria. But our federal government is not simply about dollars for the boys and girls who matter in terms of the party of their preference-not like the previous government. We are not talking about whiteboards. We are talking about someone like the Goulburn Broken Catchment and Land Protection Board using the funds to work with the national revegetation program, the national landcare program and project 2001. They will submit their bid for funds through a regional, then a state and, finally, a federal review panel. We are talking about them being absolutely accountable in terms of annual evaluation of their progress and then an environmental audit every five years to see what they have achieved. There can be no question of anyone not achieving what they aimed to do under these sorts of policy guidelines. As I heard the last two speakers from the opposition I wondered, firstly, if they could be serious, or if this was just a cheap political stunt to get some airplay, because it is a cynical suggestion that they are making. It is cynical when they suggest that Australia does not need a substantial amount of expenditure on the environment. Secondly, I wondered whether they would ever get it right. I think the voters of Australia told us at the last election that Labor was not right for the environment and that they expect a better deal from us-and that is what they are going to get.

NA BILL (No.4) 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December, on nlotion by Mr Mlles: That the bill be now read a second time.",39
99,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to: (1) ensure the Capital Gains Tax rollover relief is restricted to situations where a net increase in employment will occur; (2) closely monitor the integrity of the tax system in light of the Capital Gains Tax changes; (3) reverse the reduction in the minimum proportion of the workforce which must be invited to participate in an ESOP; and (4) reverse the proposed limitation of accelerated depreciation to shipping"". You can see from those amendments that the Labor Party has reservations about this legislation. Our starting point, of course, is to note that it is yet another omnibus provision on tax introduced by the government. I recall in their time in opposition they complained long and loud about the way in which the parliament should always assess taxation issues on like matters, that is discrete groupings of taxation reforms that are related to each other. What we have in this legislation is 10 to essentially unrelated issues all grouped together: first, special depreciation on trading ships; second, Commonwealth education or point training payments; third, controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds; fourth, amendments to dividend imputation; fifth, employee share schemes; six and seven concern capital gains tax amendments; eighth, forgiveness on commercial debts; ninth, tax file number amendments; and the tenth matter, equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. It can be seen there that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996 is a bill which groups together matters that are essentially unrelated. We had, in the last weeks of last year in the parliament, an instance where the government had a similar bill which had eight omnibus provisions. Some of them went over to the Senate for acceptance, others came back to the House and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was put in the embarrassing situation of not being able to deal with those Senate amendments as he would wish because of the time pressures at the end of the sitting period. The government knows, from that experience, that grouping so many diverse taxation provisions together is folly by its own interest, but still it persists with an attitude on taxation reform which is quite disrespectful for the parliament. I note the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has experience on both sides of the parliament, has made this criticism as well. I would have thought they could at least respect one of their former colleagues who points out, from his long history and experience of taxation reform, that the best way for the parliament to handle these matters is to have bills that relate to discrete items of taxation reform. Eight, nine or even 10 essentially unrelated matters complicate this House's consideration of them and make it very difficult in the relations between the House of Representatives and the Senate chamber. The second point I would make in relation to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996 is that the government's approach is essentially piecemeal. The government, in these matters, is directed by a Treasurer who embraces an ethos of incrementalism when it comes to tax policy. It is well known across the Western world that the tax system is changing by virtue of economic change, particularly in the format for business organisation. Throughout Western economies, business form and size is disaggregating. This is a product of outsourcing, of contracting out, of the explosion in the franchise sector. So much of business form is disaggregating into small virtual units. We no longer have the proliferation of large smoke stack industries with an assumption of mass production by standardised means. Disaggregated business form has fundamentally changed the private sector. With that, there needs to be an alert response in government policy. For instance, I always note in Australia with interest the talk about the growth of the small business sector-850,000 business units in Australia. But the key statistic is that 400,000 of them are sole traders-the contractors, the outsourcers, the small virtual units, small to the size of being a one-person enterprise. That indicates that business form is disaggregated. So many people involved in the production process are moving from a labour classification over to a business classification. This has slanted the way in which the small business statistics have been presented. It has also slanted the taxation treatment of small business. We had a High Court decision recently that basically said, 'Anyone can be a contractor and contractors will be taxed at the company rate.' These are massive changes in the composition of business form. The small business sector is not monolithic. The small business sector is very diverse. Those sole traders formerly were taxed under the income or earnings tax regime. They are now moving over to company tax arrangements and they are affected by provisions such as the rollover relief and the capital gains tax in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996. The other thing that is happening in the tax system is that so much of it is moving downstream. With footloose global capital, governments are finding it much harder to tax at the point of earning, either personal or corporate. Many of the taxation issues-we find it in Australia constantly-are moving downstream to expenditure and savings questions. So there have been, in both the disaggregation of business form and this downstream movement of tax questions, fundamental changes in the imperatives for tax policy as a product of economic change in recent decades. The response from the Howard-Costello government: incrementalism. The response to this sea change in business form, economic arrangements and taxation imperatives: a piecemeal response from the Treasurer where, piece by piece, he aggregates, he puts together 10 essentially unrelated matters and rolls them into Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996. There is no strategy, no vision, no direction for the country; just the folly of incrementalism and the folly of a piecemeal approach. Out of that, one needs to regard the provisions in this legislation for capital gains tax rollover relief as rather problematic. Is it appropriate, given the disaggregation of business scale, given the proliferation of these sole trading economic units? Given these shifts of taxation emphasis downstream, is this an appropriate response? To just take a small part of the taxation system and apply, in the context of an election campaign, capital gains tax rollover relief, to do that in March and then amendments in December last year, was again a piecemeal approach. I do not question so much the substance of this rollover relief but rather the approach that the government brings to these matters. It is an approach guided by incrementalism and it marks a total absence of proper strategy and thoughtfulness in the type of radical changes that we have seen in the economic systems and taxation imperatives in all Western nations. I am joined in those reservations by some more specific items mentioned in this morning's Australian Financial Review. These are matters that have been raised by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. They argue that the so-called capital gains tax rollover relief has 'hoodwinked'-that is their word, not mine-the small and medium sized enterprises in Australia. I quote from the Financial Review commentary: Very few small firms would qualify under the terms of the relief, the CP As said, and were eligible would be forced to take the relief only as a trade-off for losing the 50 per cent CGT concession on the goodwill component. The ASCPA's small business spokesman, Mr Greg Hayes, said seven months after the CGT relief was announced in the Budget, the promise had matured into Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 4 and the putative relief looked like a sham. That is a strong criticism, saying that the Treasurer has hoodwinked the small business sector with these particular provisions and that they stand as a sham. Mr Hayes went on to say: ""What has now been proposed reflects an administration seriously out of touch with the reality of the small business community or a cynical attempt to hoodwink small businesses. In real terms it offers little."" From a group who should know-a group of practising accountants that, by and large, represents the small business sector in Australia-they say it is a sham and they say they have been hoodwinked. This is a government, despite all its rhetoric, which is blatantly out of touch with the small business sector throughout the country. That stands in stark contrast with the words that we hear from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), from the Minister for Small Busi from the Treasurer himself. It also stands in stark contrast with the claim that is made in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that these measures will cost in a full year up to $215 million. There needs to be some clarification by the government as to the impact of these measures. Will they cost $215 million per annum or is the spokesperson for the Australian Society of CPAs, Mr Hayes, correct in saying that they are a sham and in real terms they offer very little? 1 notice that the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is in the chamber and that the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson), who is at the table, is also here. 1 do not know whether they can apswer these questions on behalf of the government: is it $215 million in relief or is it a sham offering very little? We do not even have myoid sparring those which partner-the member for Braddon (Mr Miles)-who acts as parliamentary secretary on these matters in here at the table. He usually scurries over to the advice box to get all the answers and scurries back. He is usually here because the Treasurer will not handle tax bills but that, of course, is a different broken promise and a different story altogether. The point is that confusion is running amuck among the small business sector and particularly among the practising accountants who question the government's claim on capital gains tax rollover relief. They question whether it is $215 million and how broad the net of relief will be cast. 1I have moved a second reading amendment in two parts on this particular provision. The first calls on the government to ensure the capital gains tax rollover relief-no matter how big or how small it might tum out to be on the points of clarification-is restricted to situations where a net increase in employment will occur. That is the first part of the amendment 1I have moved. 1 believe it is an important matter for the House to consider; that is, the Labor Party-perhaps the first party to do this in the House-is linking business relief to business outcomes. We are calling on the business sector, whenever it enjoys benefits from the public sector, to ensure there is a socially responsible outcome as a product of those benefits. We are linking socially responsible outcomes to the sort of relief and assistance the government might provide. 1 suppose from time to time economic rationalists call these matters 'business welfare' and some of the old lefties around call them 'subsidies that provide job security' -I am not too sure that is right in a globalised economy. But whether you are economically rational on these things and they represent business welfare or you are out there doling out subsidies and protection in the old style, the truth is there is a big public cost in any amount of business relief. That big public cost represents an opportunity cost for government using that money elsewhere. If there is to be a discharge of public costs that are received by the business sector in Australia, that sector has a social responsibility to ensure a desirable outcome. This provision for capital gains tax relief should not be open ended. It should not be an open-ended benefit for business around Australia that they might hypothetically use to strip down businesses, to employ fewer people, to maximise profits or to even engage in tax minimisation. They are concerns that any member of the Australian public would legitimately have. There is a responsibility for this parliament to say to the business sector: 'Use the benefits well and in a socially responsible fashion.' The day has come in Australia when business concessions-whether they are called business welfare, subsidies or protection-should no longer be open ended as discharged by this parliament. It is an interesting debate because hitherto these issues of social responsibility have been applied primarily to other recipients of government welfare, social welfare. In recent weeks we have heard the Prime Minister using his so-called work for the dole scheme to project an attitude that says, 'If you're an unemployed person receiving assistance from the federal government, you have a social responsibility to make use of that assistance and put it back in by working for the dole, working in the local community.' We in the Australian Labor Party have no philosophical objection to the concept of reciprocal responsibilities. We did it first through the Working Nation program, where it was said that unemployed people needed to carry a responsibility for the assistance through Working Nation. We did it first; and we said it first. We have reservations about the way in which the Prime Minister is administering that scheme now. But if it is good enough for welfare recipients in the social area, for unemployed young Australians, surely it is good enough for the business sector when receiving public benefits to exercise some form of public responsibility. One of the skewed things about the debate in Australia is that so much of these responsibility questions are somehow associated with agendas of the Right. I regard them as fundamental to agendas of left of centre parties. That is, our side of politics would always like to think that citizens are willing to take responsibility for caring for others and for catering for the interests of others. There is nothing antipathetic to the left of politics to say that we want social responsibility. It is part of the bread and butter of our political ethos. But it should not be an ethos that applies to the social sector alone; it should also be an ethos that has relevance to the sort of assistance that government provides from time to time to the business sector. We do not want to see this capital gains tax rollover relief-whether it is $215 million per annum or it is a couple of dollars per annum, as the CPAs suspect-we do not want to see it, irrespective of the amount, used in a socially irresponsible way. The government, with its best advice from its best advisers, should be able to devise means by which the government rollover relief is actually linked to outcomes in practice. If any business in this country abuses the relief, strips down the size of economic activity and sacks people or uses it for tax minimisation or some other socially irresponsible purpose, government should have a mechanism in place to bring them to account and to take away the concession that they have abused, that they have squandered. Just as in the social welfare sector, when it comes to business concessions the Labor Party sees responsibility as a two-way street: the government providing assistance but, just as much, the recipient doing the socially responsible thing with that assistance. In the case of capital gains tax rollover relief, the socially responsible thing to do with that relief is to make sure it employs more Australians, that it actually fulfils the Prime Minister's rhetoric of using the small business sector as the engine of economic growth and employment creation in this country. The rhetoric of real jobs needs to be matched by the sort of provision that I have before the House in this amendment, that is, 'ensure the Capital Gains Tax rollover relief is restricted to situations where a net increase in employment will occur'. That is, responsibility is a two-way street; responsibility reciprocated between government and the business sector for the benefit of Australians seeking work. The second point I make in the amendment is to call on the government to 'closely monitor the integrity of the tax system in of the Capital Gains Tax changes'. I understand there are some concerns in the bureaucracy. Treasury officials have provided the government with advice expressing concerns that these provisions may undermine the integrity of the tax system. Perhaps that explains why in the fine print the provisions themselves do not match the government's lofty rhetoric. Perhaps it explains why the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants has dubbed these provisions a sham. The government may well have found out that its election promise, when it came to the proper administration of the tax system, could not be met and the government had to, in the fine detail, tighten these provisions so they preserved the integrity of the tax system. WbetlJeritis integrity of the tax system or the fqlfIlIllent of the government's promisewhatever the situation is-it is very important for government speakers to clarify the circumstances for the House. We really should know, effectively, what we are voting on in terms of its likely impact. Has the system been tightened so much that integrity in the tax system has been preserved or has the government, according to its explanatory memorandum, kept its election promise and is offering, in a full year, $215 million of relief? Another point I make in my amendment is at paragraph 3, which calls on the government to reverse the reduction in the minium proportion of the work force which must be invited to participate in an employee share ownership plan. That proportion had been, under existing provisions, 75 per cent of an enterprise being invited to participate in the employee share ownership plan. It is reduced in this bill to two thirds. The Labor opposition sees no rationale for that. These plans need to be as broad based as possible. They need to be as inclusive as any enterprise can make them. For that reason, we support the maintenance of the 75 per cent threshold. We will vote accordingly at the consideration in detail stage. The final point concerns the government's proposed limitation of accelerated deprecilight ation to shipping. I know that the shadow minister for the transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), has raised these matters in the House previously. The government, I understand, last year was attempting to wind back the grants scheme for shipping in Australia. That was a matter the Labor Party opposed, led by the member for Melbourne. We note in this legislation that, among the 10 diverse matters, the provision on shipping is a backdoor way to achieve the goal the government first attempted last year. We do not support them on the front door and we do not support them on the back door. We do not support the running down of assistance that might be provided to the shipping sector in Australia. We do not support it by reducing grants. We do not support it by limiting the accelerated depreciation provisions as per the Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996. There are other matters in the bill that are essentially technical or non-controversial. The Labor Party has no problem with those matters. We do call on the government, though, to clarify their intention and the legislative situation with the capital gains tax rollover relief. If they do not want to do it for the sake of the opposition, at the very least they should do it for the sake of answering the criticism launched at them today by the Australian Society of CPAs. I look forward to the government's response and picking up some of these matters in further detail in the appropriate committee debate.",41
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Martyn Evans-It is.,45
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,And you reserve your right to speak? Mr Martyn Evans-Absolutely.,45
102,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and regret the fact that the debate is not being broadcast. I do not regret that fact out of some immodest desire to be heard across AustraliaMr Latham-Come on!,45
103,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No more than the member for Werriwa would share that desire. But I regret the fact that a debate as important as this is not being more widely heard. The only sentiment I will utter this afternoon that the member for Werriwa will endorse is that I also regret that this debate is to be referred the Main Committee. I believe it is significant enough to be debated in the main chamber. Mr Latham-Hear, hear!",46
104,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Having managed a 'Hear, hear!' from the member for Werriwa, I am conscious that at this point our courses may diverge somewhat. I rise to offer him some reassurance about the concerns he aired. He will have been, I know, both amused and pleased to have seen me move from my position in the chamber to get some advice from the Treasury officials, simply because he had almost provoked me to dare to do that in any case. Mr Latham-Acting Treasurer.",46
105,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, I do not pretend or have any ambition-let me hasten to assure the member for Werriwa-to be the Acting Treasurer. In fact, I regret in a sense that not following the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey)-he is following me-because I would rather like to have built on the building blocks that I have no doubt the member for O'Connor would have contributed to this debate. The member for Werriwa has made much, first, of an article in the Australian Financial Review today and, secondly, of what he sees as his socially just proposal to ensure that wherever capital gains tax relief occurs it occurs only where a net increase in employment is likely to result. He is seeing this as socially responsible. It is, of course, a cheap throwaway line. I share with the member for Werriwa a commitment every bit as deep as his to doing something about unemployment. I have no doubt the motive for this amendment is to see that we are doing something about unemployment, but he is sufficiently economically rational-and I do not mean a rationalist-to know that it is easy for a government to create jobs at any time. If this government wished, we could start an employment generating program tomorrow. We could propose that all of my farmers cease using self-propelled headers and bag their wheat. That would generate employment. We could suggest that all my wine grape to growers cease using machines that automatically harvest the crop and go back once again to hand harvesting. That would generate employment and, in the process, as the member for Werriwa knows, we would push those very industries out of the export markets that the parliament so desperately wants them in. I refute this amendment, not because I question the need for employment growth but because it is absurd to tie a government initiative to a proposal specifically for employment growth without first looking at whether or not that employment growth is in the nation's or industry's long-term interest. Mr Latham-You do it in social welfare.",46
106,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Werriwa may interject and suggest that that is in some way socially irresponsible. The facts are that it is socially responsible. This legislation, designed and offering capital gains tax rollover, is not legislation that should be conI am founded by whether or not that business's decision to purchase another business generates with it more employment. This I do know: everyone who chooses to sell a business and purchase another business, and by so doing to roll over their capital gains tax obligations, will do it because they seek both to expand their business and to expand their profit opportunities. What automatically follows expanded profit opportunities are job opportunities across the nation. Mr Latham-No problem, with my proposal.",46
107,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Precisely. For that reason this will happen automatically. It requires not the nonsense of an amendment that further confounds what this legislation is about, as the member for Werriwa well knows. This is a piece of legislation that is in many ways at the heart of the difference between the government and the opposition. The fulcrum of the philosophical differences that we take on all issues is largely covered by these capital gains tax changes. I was a member of the parliament when there was no capital gains tax. I voted against the Hawke and Keating provisions for a capital gains tax, first, because I am philosophically opposed to it and, secondly, because the then Prime Minister Hawke had indicated, as part of his pre-election promise, that there would be no such tax but chose to introduce one on the grounds of what he saw as tax equity. Let us make it quite clear: the difference in many ways between the government and the opposition-and it is a difference that does not burden me; I understand it and I have no doubt that the sentiments on the other side of the House are as sincerely and strongly held as the sentiments on this side of the Houseis that. the government find it much easier to :celebrate success and successful businesses. .The..opposition tend. to treat with suspicion tbQ$e who have ,been successful in a business sense, lest in some way those people have abused the taxation system or abused other Australians in order to generate success. There is a suggestion on the other side of the House that everybody who builds a business will, in the process, have in some way rorted the system. Mr Rocher-Hey, not me!",46
108,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will come to the member for Curtin in just a moment-and to his defence. I think we need to appreciate the need that Australians have right now for successful small business in order to generate jobs and job opportunities. The member for Curtin has already jumped to his own defence. Let me say that I thought the member for Werriwa rather misrepresented the member for Curtin when, in his remarks, he said that the member for Curtin would not be embracing what the government was doing and was identified with the other side of the House. Knowing the member for Curtin as I do, I know that he may not be embracing what the government is doing but I doubt that he wants to be identified with the Labor Party either. In that sense I recognise that the member for Curtin may wish to participate in the debate as an Independent and I defend his right to do so, although that has been eroded by the earlier sentiments of the member for Werriwa. Back to the point of this bill: the facts are that capital gains tax is anathema to those on this side of the House. Let it be quite clearly understood: the government does not propose to rub out the capital gains tax provisions. As a member of the government, I rather liked the system we took to the 1983 election which suggested there should be capital gains tax provisions directly applied to those speculative gains and, in long-term gains, the capital gains tax obligations should phase out. Mr Rocher-The 1990 election.",47
109,Mr ANDREW,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I stand corrected by the member for Curtin who tells me it was the 1990 election. Either way, I liked it. What we are doing today is not as good, but it is a step in the right direction because what we are doing today allows small business men and women to do something to expand their business without incurring a capital gains tax penalty. Everyone in this House should be affronted with the philosophy that says that, if your business gets better and you then want to move to a new site or expand the business in some way, you will find yourself obliged to face a capital gains tax obligation. Why? Because you have succeeded? That runs counter to all I believe in. That is why I welcome these changes, because these changes allow small business men and women to say , 'We will be involved in an exercise of expansion, an exercise of sale and reacquisition. What we acquire need not be a business identical to the one we have and, in the process, we can roll over our capital gains tax obligations.' Personally, the member for Wakefield would like to phase out the capital gains tax, but rolling it over is certainly a lesser evil than the one we currently face where a capital gains tax must be paid. Let me illustrate this point. As most members in the House know, my background is in rural industry. There is a popular view that there is very little opportunity to get into rural industry because of the capital that is needed to start a rural business. Let us clarify some of that. My background was in a labour intensive rural industry, and there are great opportunities to get into horticulture and floriculture without a great deal of need to do all we can in this climate of plenty of horticultural export opportunities waiting to happen to encourage people to take a chance in horticulture or floriculture. Let it labour intensive, not capital intensive. We should allow those people who are prepared to take two hectares or four hectares of land and convert it into an export opportunity for floriculture or for exclusive horticultural crops to expand without incurring capital gains-the very point of this legislation. Much was made by the member for Werriwa of an article in the Financial Review. He indicated that the Australian Association of CPAs was critical of the proposal to change the capital gains tax as is outlined in this legislation. I make the point that the association was critical about the fact that shareholding is not a part of this rollover provision. It is not something that I find myself affronted by at all. In fact, as I said in my earlier remarks, the potential for speculative capital gain ought to be subject to some form of taxation anyway. The member for Werriwa has largely misled the House by his comments suggesting that the CPAs across Australia were affronted by this legislation when in fact they have been anxious to have shareholding included for the simplicity of the bookkeeping that is involved. The member for Werriwa has made much of what he sees as the socially responsible outcomes of the amendment that he has put to the House. If we go out of our way to encourage small business, we automatically initiate socially responsible outcomes. In 1997, with unemployment where it is, we should be doing all we can to encourage Australians to take a chance in small business. I am always mystified about why the b )vernment is expected to find jobs. How is the government expected to be the job generator around Australia? The people who ought to be doing something about jobs are those who are unemployed. They should be asking themselves, 'What can I do to put myself into business?' It might be something as simple as fruit picking or mowing lawns. But the opportunity should be there to do nothing more than acquire a second-hand lawn-mower capital. We and start a lawn-mowing round. If a person succeeds in business and seeks to expand it, under the present legislation they are subject to capital gains tax. We have said be that if you are about expanding a business, no matter how small, we will offer you an opportunity to roll over your capital gains tax obligations so that they do not frustrate your business expansion. That process has a great deal to commend it. It says to Australians, 'Here is an opportunity to get into business and not be frustrated.' In order not to be seen as merely favouring big business, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has dictated that if the business runs at a net value in excess of $5 million then these provisions should not apply. These provisions are deliberately designed to aid Australians in the expansion of their business, and the expansion of every Australian small business brings with it job opportunities, either directly as a result of that business expansion or because of the additional profits that that business generates. That is why the amendments are unnecessary, because all it does is unnecessarily-pardon the repetition-muddy the waters for a proposal that will automatically generate employment anyway. The member for Werriwa may suggest that his proposal is in some way socially responsible, but all he has done is attempt to score a cheap political point. For what we are proposing is a change in the capital gains tax legislation that encourages small business and, by implication, automatically generates opportunities for further employment. The member for Werriwa has made the point that of the 850,000 small businesses in Australia 400,000 are sole traders-sole traders who are assisted by this legislation; sole traders who, having accessed this legislation and used it to expand their business base, may not necessarily employ another Australian but will have built their business, their business base and their capacity to generate profits and, in the process, enhance the national economy and employ more Australians. The proposal before the House is g?od news for small business. It may not do Just what the member for Werriwa has suggested should be done for shares. I am not affronted by that. Those who particip-te in small business now have an opportumty to expand their business without incurring a capital gains obligation. They. can - oll that over pending the sale of their - usmess at some time-who knows when?-m the future. This is not ideal, for I am not a capital gains tax enthusiast, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. It certainly allows take away one of the impediments that has discouraged small business growth. Most importantly, it allows us to say to those who are prepared to take a chance and a risk, 'V!e will reward you for that rather than penalise you.' In that sentiment, it ought to be embraced by both sides of the chamber.",47
110,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996 sets out to amend 10 separate and unrelated elements of existing tax laws. It was introduced on 15 December last, on the eve of the rising of the House prior to the Christmas break. The first of the 10 measures proposed will see an end to a 20 per cent prime cost depreciation rate for trading ships, the co-Â­ tracts for which were signed after 30 Apnl 1996 and which will be delivered and registered after 30 June 1997. The termination date at present in force before this amendment is 1 July 2002. The measure was announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as one of the early decisions of the present government on 1 May last year. Two points may be made. The first is that the change is consistent with the coalition's election platform. The second point is that, despite the minister's assurance in his speech of 1 May last year foreshadowing the scrapping of the 20 per cent prime cost depreciation allowance that a 'bill will shortly be introduced to repeal accelerated depreciation provisions under section 57 AM' of the principal act, it took 7Y2 months. If that is a short period for reasonably straightforward legislation which came into effect on 1 May last, then we can look forward with trepidation to what might be considered by the government to be a long time. Last year there were three bills amending the tax acts in a multiplicity of ways before the one now before the House. Seven and a half months to reduce to black letter law a measure announced on and having the force of law from 1 May 1996 is far too long. The second category in this bill has also been a long time in coming before the parliament. It will affect Commonwealth education or training payments subjected to recovery by us to PA YE collections. The measure was introduced by the previous government and the relevant bill lapsed when the previous parliament was prorogued. Presumably, all the words were there for the present government to regurgitate in a bill much earlier than it has. However, it is of more than passing interest to note that this particular amendment takes pains to ensure that retrospectivity is avoided. Full marks to the government, one might conclude. But given retrospectivity in some of the other measures in this bill, any congratulations should be very muted indeed. It transpires that these amendments to the PA YE provisions are to have effect on the 28th day of the month after getting the blessing of the parliament. This is because of a stated desire to not impose any retrospective PAYE obligations on the Commonwealth's paying agencies. Where the boot. is on t-e other foot, with other measures m the bill under discussion, the taxpayer is not so considerately treated. On the face of it, retrospective application of amendments to control foreign companies, CFCs, and foreign investment funds, FIFs, might not be a bad thing either. There are four components under this heading. Briefly, it is proposed to ensure deemed dividend rates operate correctly, redefine the term 'gross turnover' of a CFC, accommodate changes to the Migration Act 1958 and conditionally change the treatment of a capital loss by a FIF. The four changes have effective commencement dates of 3 June 1990, 1 July 1990, 1 December 1994 and 1 January 1993 respectively. None was foreshadowed prior to the introduction of this proposed legislation on 15 December last. We are assured that each will have either no significant impact on revenue or negligible impact on revenue. If there is be no benefit or detriment to revenue, why bother? Perhaps the answer is that three out of the four changes will, allegedly, reduce compliance costs to be incurred by those taxpayers affected. The last of the four is the odd one out. Passage of that measure will have no significant impact on revenue and have no effect on the compliance costs of either FIFs or government agencies. That being the case, why bother? The principal act is already cluttered to the point of incomprehensibility, so why add another 250 words which confer no benefit on anyone? Changes to dividend imputation and related tax treatment are also one of the 10 disparate measures in the bill. The choice of tax treatment by the selection of one of two approaches to class C franking credits is proposed. It will confer a benefit on affected taxpayers by eliminating an unintended but unquantifiable revenue windfall. Although having retrospective application, the fact that it confers a benefit renders inappropriate any criticism on that score. The fifth category of taxation changes in the bill has to do with employee share schemes. The main ingredient is an increase in the tax free discount from $500 to $1,000 per employee per year for specified types of employee share ownership schemes. Tax deductibility to the employer providing rights or shares to the tune of up to $1,000 per employee per year is a significant measure. Other related or minor changes under this heading do not detract from what is a welcome initiative consistent with coalition policy. The first of two major changes to capital gains tax law concerns movements in the ownership of public companies, public traded unit trusts and mutual insurance entities which dispose of assets acquired after 19 September 1985. Section 160ZZS provides, however, that assets acquired before then can nevertheless be deemed subjected to CGT if the majority ownership of a relevant publicly owned entity changes and that the value of its assets will be deemed the equivalent of market value on the date of change in majority ownership. Howto ever, at present, section 160ZZS, as interpreted by the Commissioner of Taxation in income tax ruling IT2361, only requires that its provisions have application where there is abnormal trading in shares or other instruments of ownership of the asset owner if it is 'activity in the nature of a takeover or merger'. What is now proposed is a much narrower view of what comprises abnormal trading in the wording of the act itself. There is a concomitant obligation on all relevant publicly owned organisations which acquired assets prior to 20 September 1985 to test periodically the levels of ownership regardless of whether there has been abnormal trading in shares. Although the adoption of streamlined rules to test the nature of majority ownership will apply in future, the cost and compliance burden will nevertheless be significantly greater. Greater too, will be exposure to capital gains tax on any assets held prior to September 1985. There will also be other traps, for the wary and unwary alike. If testing should have been done as required under section 160ZZS at present in force, because of abnormal trading and regardless of whether there was a change in the underlying majority interests, public entities cannot simply apply the new requirements. With the narrower definition of abnormal trading in place, the streamlined testing procedures must be completed within six months. If not, all pre-CGT assets will be deemed acquired postCGT. If that happens, the acquisition date of pre-capital gains tax assets will be stipulated at 20 September 1985 and the actual date of acquisition disregarded entirely. Furthermore, if there should be a second or subsequent failure to mandatorily test the nature of ownership, the date of asset acquisition will be ordained by law to be the date that the entity passed the new, much narrower test. In the absence of abnormal trading, that date could be as long as five years ago. So when the government plays down its first and dubious contribution to the complexity of capital gains tax law, it should be with some embarrassment-given its rhetoric in opposition. It might even acknowledge its shamefaced imposition of more burdensome compliance costs, despite its attempts to disguise the extent of those costs. While the government may claim with some justification that simplified methods of tracing underlying interest will be less costly, such a reduction in compliance costs will nowhere near offset the costs of regular monitoring for ever and a day. Furthermore, with the proposal coming into effect from 30 January, an additional $45 million revenue will be raised over the next 3VI years. The seventh proposal in the bill seeks to give small businesses rollover relief from capital gains tax following disposals of certain assets, but subject to the subsequent acquisition of - ve assets. Its objective is noble, sUpportable and purportedly consistent with ooillitionpolicy. It is also a complex and 'a4ministrative nightmare. The first point to make,m'Â·that relief wiU.be confined to net gains of. a capital nature. Certain assets are exclucled.. The. proceeds from small business sold as a going concem and reinvested in new active assets or another small business as a going concern will not automatically qualify-as some who took note of the coalition's pre-election blurbs might still believe. As well, it must be extremely doubtful that the benefits to the proprietors of small businesses will be anything like the financial impact forecasts of $200 million in 1998-99 and $215 million in 1999-2000. As far as an ordinary mortal can discern after reading and re-examining the 25 pages of labyrinthine law proposed, it comes down to something like this. Any capital gain which qualifies starts with the establishment of a 'gross rollover amount'. It is arrived at after tortuous monitoring and record keeping over the existence of the allowable, but nowhere near all, assets of small businesses. Having arrived at a gross rollover amount it might then be reduced by any capital losses both current and recorded in earlier years. The net rollover amount is thus arrived at, and can be then applied to reducing the cost bases of replacement active assets. Having got this far, the proprietor-assuming he or she is still alive and well-should soon become aware that the maximum net rollover allowed to be offset against the cost of buying a replacement asset can be no more than the cost base of the replacement purchased. If someone asks how a capital loss on the sale of an unrelated but otherwise qualifying asset in this equation is figured in, I will faint. I simply do not know-that is the answer. But as they say in the Demtel advertisements, 'Wait, that's not all. There is a set of steak knives coming.' If a taxpayer qualifies for rollover relief, he or she forfeits certain other concessional CGT treatment-for example, concessions attached to gains from the disposal of goodwill. The coalition has backtracked on its election promise to concede the capital gains tax on gains from the sale of an ongoing small business if the proceeds of the sale were applied to the purchase of another 'of a like kind'. Nor is the estimated and so-called cost to revenue of $200 million per year believable. Applying the like kind business test was estimated to forgo $150 million, which itself was probably a stab in the dark. Without the extension of the qualifying period from one year to two, these measures would arguably yield to the small business sector capital gains tax concessions totalling less than if the like kind business test applied. Similarly, by limiting to $5 million rollover relief to taxpayers whose net assets, including the net assets of entities connected with the taxpayer, these measures disqualify many of the proprietors of small businesses from obtaining any benefit. It is funny how the definition of what constitutes a small business can be changed to the advantage of governments, is it not? It is abundantly clear that many small businesses will not come within the threshold criteria. Many individuals in partnerships and sole traders will possibly qualify. But disposal of shares in a small company running a small business, which might conceivably continue under new ownership as a going concern, is outside the scope of these measures. The claim by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his press release of 3 December 1996 that abandoning the like kind business test and restricting the proposed relief to active assets subsequently acquired will be an improvement over what was promised is at the very best arguable. To go on to say, as he did, that the change will reduce the compliance costs of small businesses is his way of telling us that compliance costs will be less but only because fewer small businesses will qualify under the new criteria. Of course, it is true that if you reduce the numbers of proprietors who qualify compliance costs will not be so great. If you were to eliminate all taxes, there would be no costs of compliance whatsoever. But, fat chance. Such claims by the government gainsay the fact that what is now proposed is as convoluted and complex as anything its Labor predecessor dished up. More mind-bending gobbledegook is hard to picture. All 25 pages of it add to the cost of small business compliance in the finest tradition of Labor in government. Finally, in this context we should remind ourselves that these proposals do not deal with the coalition's solemn election promise to provide relief from capital gains tax where the proceeds of the sale of a small business are used to provide for the proprietor's retirement. Perhaps the proposed super charge on higher income earners' contributions to superannuation has put the kybosh on that. Perhaps not. So far the government has been less than forthcoming on the second half of its promise to allow conversion of the proceeds from the sale of a small business into a superannuation fund for proprietors in retirement. What we have is legislation in terms of capital gains tax that goes in the right direction but which nowhere near matches what the government undertook to do during the election campaign. I conclude by mentioning that, as was said at the outset, there are 10 separate measures in this bill. In the 20 minutes allocated to me I have been able to touch on only seven of that 10. It is quite unacceptable that legislation of this kind continues to come before the parliament when there is absolutely no reasonable chance that it can be comprehensively debated in the chamber. In other words, we are legislating under pressure and are unable to cover the scope of the total legislation because there are 10 disparate measures in this bill and it is impossible in the time available to any member to cover the whole lot.",49
111,Mr BEDDALL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill. The capital gains tax rollover changes in this bill are neither original nor part of any real government policy initiative-nor are they an idea from the already discredited Minister for Small Business and Consumer  In fact, this legislation comes from a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which I had the honour to chair in the 36th parliament. That committee underwill took the first comprehensive inquiry into small business policy in this country. The then minister, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), had the good grace to name that report the 'Beddall report'. No government has promised more and delivered less to the small business community than the Howard government. The provisions of this bill are not what they seem at first sight. Obviously, we will want to see what the detail will mean for small business. Already we have seen criticisms from organisations like the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. In today's Financial Review we see the heading: 'Throw out tax relief bill and start again'. The Australian Society of CP As has said that small to medium sized enterprises had been 'hoodwinked' by the fine print of the so called capital gains tax rollover relief. I quote from the article in today's paper where the spokesman for the ASPCA, Mr Greg Hayes, a said that the 'relief looked like sham'. He went on: What has now been proposed reflects an administration seriously out of touch with the reality of the Small Business community or a cynical attempt to hoodwink small business. And this is the clincher for me. He says: In real terms it offers little. The real point in the article is that there are so many businesses that would not qualify for relief that the legislation has become largely meaningless. The opposition is concerned that there is an escape clause inserted by the Australian Taxation Office to limit its application. Before the last federal election, we heard a great deal from members opposite about the needs of small business and how small business would receive a better deal under a new coalition government. In fact, we heard for years and years the same rhetoric from members of the now government; while I was minister for small business, the same hollow platitudes were heard from those opposite. I dare say that new members of the coalition were under the impression that they would be part of a government which would honour its commitment to the small business community. They may have seen this bill as fulfilling - c:;: ofthpse commitments. Unfortunately, - ,-. mustÂ· see now is utter betrayal --- tbi::y, are part of a government which if- $.avil.ged by, the small business commun.ty. AU ;tbosepromises have been smashed and not delivered. The facts are that after. the first anniversary of the election of this government, their own support base has no joy in the celebration. When challenged, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the minister for small business have no response to the calls from the small business community that they are disenchanted with this government. The facts speak for themselves. This bill is, as the Society of Certified Practising Accountants says, hoodwinking small business and is not what it appears. The recent Yellow Pages small business index showed that 80 per cent of small businesses were disenchanted with the new government. We have heard the Treasurer claim that, as a result of interest rate cuts, the small business community should be happy. But when you have a good look at the survey it shows that 71 per cent of those surveyed said that the rate cuts had not improved their fortunes. I will return to the government's record of inaction with the small business community in a moment. This bill covers other areas. The proposed limitation of accelerated depreciation to shipping is an attempt by the government to mirror the termination of the ships capital grants program which was achieved despite the Labor Party's opposition. This proposal will further reduce the incentive for new investment in the vital area of shipping. On page 6 of today's Financial Review we see the Australian Shipbuilders Association blaming the Howard government for $275 million in lost exports due to budget cutbacks. The industry minister's silence on the issue is disgraceful. The government is becoming famous for lowering the incentives for investment in a raft of important and vital industries. As well as containing capital gains tax rollover relief for small business, the bill also contains higher income tax exemption levels for benefits under employer share ownership plans. While there are some equity concerns with the capital gains tax rollover provisions, I would like to make the point that there is no link between obtaining the rollover and aCtually expanding employment as the government would have us believe. There can be a no more important section of Australia's economy than the small business sector. As a former minister, I firmly believe that this government is not taking the concerns and needs of this important sector seriously. It is common knowledge within the industry that the minister has lost the confidence of the small business operators. This is clearly demonstrated again in the recent Yellow Pages survey. I repeat that more than 80 per cent of the 1,200 proprietors randomly surveyed believed the economy was still in recession and nearly 80 per cent believed the government had not helped business. at all. For the first time since its election, the Howard government's policies have received a negative approval rating from small business proprietors. It will have to go much further than this bill to help the small business sector. Twenty-two per cent of small and medium enterprises now say that the government's policies are working against the interests of small business. The most damaging aspect of that survey is that virtually no-one-Iess than half a per cent-felt that this government had exceeded their expectations. We also see that 50 per cent of those surveyed say that the government has failed to live up to their expectations. Coming from Queensland I was disturbed to see that business proprietors in my own state were more likely to believe that the federal government has failed to live up to their expectations and that those in nonmetropolitan areas are more likely to be disappointed than those in capital cities. This is another slap in the face for regional Australia. The survey stated: The primary reasons given for believing that Government has failed to live up to expectations relate to lack of action. This bill does not placate an angry small business sector. There can be no further evidence of that than the industry saying that this government is not living up to the hopes of the small business sector. The Financial Review on Wednesday, 26 February says it all. The headline was 'Small business loses enthusiasm for the Howard way'. The minister for small business claims in that article: We have planted the seed for a very great and prosperous crop to grow. I can tell you now that the seed may have been planted but the crop is going to be extremely barren. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the same day, the headline was 'Howard's honeymoon is over'. We must ask ourselves: why has the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stalled on the government's response to the small business deregulation task force report, otherwise known as the Bell report? Where are the details to finalising the plans to cut red tape in half? This is an embarrassing situation for a government which is relying on this section of the community to cut unemployment. So far we have seen no evidence that this is the case. It is clear the policy direction of small business is out of control. The government has no real idea of the way to regenerate this important sector of the economy. The government is not prepared to make the hard decisions. It is floundering and does not know what to do. Greg Hayes says in the Financial Review today that the legislation we are debating here today takes an extremely simplistic view of the business sale process. It ignores a wide range of common events and locks out a large number of participants and transactions. With so many inconsistencies, it is no wonder that few small businesses will be eligible for the capital gains tax rollover. Relief will only be available in respect of active assets-that is, assets used by taxpayers to generate income from trading businesses. This is an important sector. These measures offer some hope for the small business sector. As I said in my speech, I hope that the the measures are not illusionary and when the fine print has been gone through that we will see that they do offer the capital gains tax rollover relief provision that was promised by the government. This provision has been around since the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology first suggested it some nine years ago. It has appeared in a number of guises. The previous government gave capital gains tax relief to the goodwill sector which was perceived to be the blood, sweat and tears of small business. We hope that this is a further step forward, but there is some scepticism that this measure will actually meet the requirements of the government let alone the expectations of the small business sector. If the Society of Certified Practising Accountants is right, then the government will have to go back and look at this bill again. If the government does not make sure that this provision is correct and that benefits flow to the small business sector then you will find that the small business sector will tum on this government. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1996 is important because it does offer some hope. If it is a false dawn, the governthat ment will reap the whirlwind. No sector was promised more in the election campaign than the small business sector. We have heard many members on the coalition side talk about the small business sector being the engine room of the economy and that if every small business created one job we would have no unemployment. They are all platitudes. What the government has to do is come up with policies and programs that will assist the sector. The member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) will follow me in this debate. She has been involved with me on a parliamentary committee in which I think we will see a bipartisan approach being taken to addressing some of the issues facing small business. It is important that we take a bipartisan approach to the small business community. Despite the fact that probably, on average, 80 per cent of its membership continually votes for the coalition, we on this side of the chamber live in hope that that will change. Any small movement towards us is a significant movement. Perhaps the catch cry for the next election will be, instead of 'the Howard battlers', 'the Beazley small business people' and it will be they who change the government. That will happen if this government does not take cognisance of the important fears that the small business community has and the frustra-J- -1-,- the moment because it has not - Jl - Qf ;tberecovery that has taken place -!-$.-- The recovery has largely been Jl,)h,i8,,,u-n-ss recovery; small business is hQrtjng. . I said quite clearly that I support the amendment moved by my colleague, but I also hope that if the small business sector can prove to the government that this particular capital gains tax rollover provision is too exclusive, the government will try to fix that quickly. I hope that the intent of the government is to make sure that these capital gains tax rollover provisions do work. If they don't, I hope that members opposite, particularly those on the backbench, will bring the matter quickly to the attention of the Treasurer and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.",52
112,Mrs BAILEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is with great pleasure that I rise in this debate today in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996. In particular, I wish to highlight one of the key aspects of this bill which provides capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses. This bill inserts a new division into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow rollover relief for the disposal and acquisition of assets in a small business. This means that rollover relief will be provided not only where a single asset is disposed of but also where an entire small business is disposed of by a taxpayer and another business is acquired. This new measure will apply to the disposal of assets on or after 1 July 1997. This Howard government initiative has been warmly welcomed in small business circles, for it embellishes current capital gains tax relief provisions and provides incentive to small business owners to invest and employ more people. Currently capital gains tax provisions apply where an asset acquired after 19 September 1985 is disposed of. A capital gain arises where the proceeds from the disposal exceed the cost base or indexed cost base of the asset. The capital gain must be included as assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of the disposal year of income. This tax liability relating to capital gain reduces the amount of capital available to acquire replacement assets. This important change to the taxation laws will ensure that a lack of capital does not constrain the growth and development of small business. The new measure will allow businesses worth less than $5 million that are selling all or part of their assets to defer their capital gains tax liability if they are using it to purchase another business. This reinvestment must take place within two years. The Howard government is introducing this rollover relief to encourage small and medium sized enterprises to continue expanding their businesses either by increasing existing assets or purchasing other businesses. These amendments could not come at a more appropriate time-a time when the small business industry needs encouragement and incentive to expand and invest. The capital gains tax regime already provides rollover relief in other circumstances, like when an asset is destroyed and a replacement asset is acquired, or when assets are transferred between related resident companies. So it is fitting that the rollover relief is extended to those businesses seeking to reinvest. This very provision that the coalition government is introducing is a tax measure that small business groups had long been lobbying the previous Labor government for, but without any success. Our predecessors could not fathom how the asset base built up within a small business was almost all the capital that most owner/operators had to purchase a new business or upgrade assets. But the coalition has seen this and it does have vision. We can see how certain business transactions, which would otherwise boost economic activity, were being penalised by the capital gains tax system. Small business owners were being punished for improving their businesses. If they wanted to upgrade an asset, there was no rollover relief available. Unfortunately for small business, the Labor government did not respond to their calls for help. The coalition, however, has listened. It has consulted widely with professional bodies and small business groups and has taken action. The result is an amendment which delivers in full the coalition's policy regarding capital gains tax rollover relief announced before the last federal election. More importantly it will provide a massive $200 million to small businesses. All up this means added incentive for small business owners to invest and employ. Australia's estimated 860,000 small and medium sized enterprises are indeed the backbone of the Australian economy. The small and medium business sector contributes approximately 30 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product and generates employment for approximately three and a half million people or about 45 per cent of the total work force. The previous Labor government failed to recognise the importance of this vital industry. During its 13 years in power, Labor took small business for a disastrous rollercoaster ride. Our productivity tumbled, competitiveness dropped, interest rates for small business skyrocketed, inflation rates soared and business confidence plummeted. Keating's recession, the one we had to have, produced record levels of bankruptcies which killed the hopes, dreams and ambitions of thousands of Australian small business owners and their families. I remember quite vividly driving along the streets of many towns in the electorate of MCEwen and seeing countless vacant shops, a sad legacy of the shackles placed on them by Labor. These were businesses that provided a living for family members and many local residents, businesses that despite valiant attempts could not survive under the heavy burdens of Labor's rule. Under Labor, Australia suffered its worse unemployment level since the Great Depression with jobless rates peaking at 11.2 per cent in December 1992. Under Labor, home mortgage rates reached 17 per cent, business loans were over 20 per cent and credit card rates were around 25 per cent. Labor failed to deliver much needed industrial relations reform choosing instead to pander to its union mates. Its failed economic policies resulted in record foreign debt and record current account deficits. As mentioned before, bankruptcies during the Labor years reached record levels with 16,780 businesses going under in 1991-92 and 14,000 businesses going under in 1994-95 when, according to previous Prime Minister Keating, for small business 'this is as good as it ever gets'. Instead of helping small business, Labor buried the small business industry under a mountain of paperwork, red tape, regulation, taxation complexity and draconian industrial relations laws. Labor's budget and policy decisions, its failure to cut spending and its reliance on high interest rates undermined Australia's small businesses. As a result of that decimation, they have been struggling to recover from that recession ever SInce. Where Labor failed, the Howard government is determined to succeed. During our first 12 months in government, the coalition has already set in train a series of measures designed to instil confidence in the small business sector to give them the opportunity to invest, to grow, to make a profit and to start employing more Australians. The Howard government recognises that small business is the key to economic prosperity. We are committed to creating the right environment in which growth can occur. We promised a 100-day plan of action for small business and delivered it in full and on time. This included convening the small business summit, establishing the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, having the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am a member, inquire into fair trading and setting up the Micro-Business Consultative Group. This group is advising the government on the specific policy requirements of the micro-business sector of the small business community, many of whom are small family run businesses. I am pleased to say that Mr Gary Pollard, a pharmacist from Yea in my electorate of MCEwen, is a member of this group. The coalition has also reformed Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws to encourage more productive relations between employees and employers. We heard in question time ttJda)'l of the level of improvement that has already started to occur in that area. Â·('Ptovlsiona1Â· taxÂ· became a nightmare for sMlf'business under Labor with the uplift factor set at an unreasonably high eight per cent. The Howard government has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent, saving sional taxpayers $180 million in the 1996-97 financial year. The government will allocate $2.5 million over the next three years to look at the viability of alternative equity markets to help firms secure investment capital. Our business equity information service program, which helps match investors with small businesses needing equity finance, will receive $490,000 in the 1996-97 financial year. We have also provided tax breaks to banks that want to invest in equity in small and medium businesses. Labor's contentious plan to force subcontractors into the pay-asyou-earn arrangements has been scrapped by the coalition. This government has recognised that the only way to create jobs is to involve small business. We will provide more than $1.7 million over the next four years in incentive payments and wage subsidies to employers of apprentices and trainees. These will be targeted at small and medium businesses. Small businesses have benefited from large reductions in interest rates under the coalition. We came to government 12 months ago. The variable interest rate for small business loans was 11.25 per cent. It is now down to 9.75 per cent. More pressure must be applied to banks in order to make sure that they are passing on these lower interest rates to small businesses, especially those in regional areas. For small businesses with a loan of $500,000, that drop in interest rates means an interest saving of around $7V2 thousand a year. Remember Labor's record? Remember that small business interest rates spiralled up to more than 20 per cent? Under the coalition, the difference that can be seen is vast. It is down to around 9.75 per cent. That is money that small business can better spend on expanding and creating jobs. The Howard government is committed to reducing the paperwork burden on small business by half. Under Labor, paperwork cost the average small business almost $7,000 a year and took one day per fortnight to complete on average. To achieve its goal of cutting paperwork by 50 per cent, the coalition established the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, which has reported back to provi- the government with some key recommendations on how to make life easier for small business-ideas like simplifying the fringe benefits tax and introducing one annual compliance statement for all income tax and business tax obligations instead of forcing small business to lodge up to seven different returns. The government will deliver its response to the task force report shortly. As well as the rollover relief being debated here today, the government is introducing further reforms to capital gains tax with up to $500,000 from the sale of a small business being exempt from capital gains tax to fund retirement. When the coalition came to government last year, it vowed to help restore small business to prosperity. In 13 years of power, Labor had ripped away every last shred of confidence remaining in the small business sector. Once that had gone, Labor cruelly abandoned the small business sector. Destruction of that magnitude takes time to repair, but the Howard government has already started to help small business onto the road to recovery, as the initiatives I mentioned earlier clearly show. Small business owners and operators in my electorate of MCEwen appreciate the support and action of the Howard government, as do many other individuals and professional organisations throughout the nation. In the Financial Review of 4 December 1996, Mr Robert Bastian, Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, described the capital gains tax rules changes as: ... fabulous, an excellent gesture for small business. In the same article, Mr John Martin, Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: It's an important step in increasing confidence in smaIl business and freeing up investment. Again in the same article, Mr Kurt Rendall, small business spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said the decision highlighted the difference between the coalition government and its predecessor, saying: These guys have a really good understanding of smaIl business. In a press release issued in August last year, Mr Jonathan Ilbery, National President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, said in relation to the capital gains tax relief: This will obviously assist small business which would otherwise have incurred a tax liability disposal of the original asset. It will go some way to reducing the already heavy tax cost for smaIl business. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the Howard government's first budget would be good for business confidence and the entire Australian community. The Housing Industry Association said allowing small business owners to fund the growth of their businesses by rolling over the sale proceeds of business was most welcome. The Motor Traders Association of New South Wales said the capital gains tax rollover relief on the sale of business assets to fund the purchase of another enterprise would put real value back into small businesses. The New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce has said the Howard government has come good on its promise to support the small and medium sized business sector. It described the capital gains tax changes as a positive taxation measure. While the opposition continues to knock small business, there are plenty of positive signs and reasons for small business owners to feel confident about their futures. A survey conducted by Business East among businesses in the eastern and outer eastern Melbourne area-which includes the Yarra Valley region in my electorate of MCEwen-found that 81 per cent of businesses expected positive economic growth, 37 per cent expected an increase in capital expenditure, 49 per cent expected profits to increase, 24 per cent expected the size of their work force to increase and 55 per cent anticipated increases in the volume of their sales. In a November 1996 report by Jobs East, entitled 'Industry links, skill needs, recruitment practices and work force projections', 32.7 per cent of businesses projected employment growth over the next 12 months, while 38.1 per cent projected employment growth beyond the next 12 months. The Labor government had 13 years to help small business, and it failed miserably. In contrast, the Howard government recognises the importance of small business to the Australian economy and has responded in kind by introducing initiatives that will lead to greater investment, strong and steady on the growth and more jobs. We are not naive enough to believe that we can tum 13 years of Labor destruction into a small business miracle overnight, but we are committed to ensuring that any changes we make are for the better and will lead to long-term prosperity for small business. The bill before the House contains an amendment which will bring substantial relief to thousands of small businesses across Australia and in my electorate of MCEwen in particular. Already, I have had representation from a farmer from Molesworth in the north of my electorate who is anxious to see this legislation passed so that he-as well as countless others-can take advantage of the rollover relief that it will provide. The opposition can whinge, moan, deride and talk down small business all it likes, but the Howard government will not follow their lead and abandon small business. The Howard government will continue to support the small business sector of our nation and provide the right environment for growth. This amendment is yet another step toward creating that growth. On behalf of the people of MCEwen, I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman) agreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1996, and Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Co4es)aiJl1997 ' : iLI !Jt6UNfY LEGISLATION - il;',-;,-;,----NT BILL 1996 (Si: G'; j>f,-ifsecondReadiDg ;-batel%suri1eaffrom 7 November, on motiotl by Â·1,\fr Moore: "" That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Crean moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill"".",55
113,Dr LAWRENCE,COMMITTEE,"Fremantle) (5.37 p.m.)I think it is important for the House to realise that we are debating here an industry which, 10 years ago, did not exist. I am referring, of course, to the shipbuilding industry. Australian shipbuilding of any description at alleven the defence forces-had all but disappeared. But today, thanks to energetic entrepreneurs and government support, we have a competitive and technically sophisticated industry which, at the moment at least, represents a significant proportion of the world high-speed ferry market. For instance, Austal and Incat, two of our major companies, have between them 70 per cent of the total worldwide market. That is a very significant achievement in a very short period of time. I have a great interest in this industry, not least because a great many of the people who work in it live and work in my electorate. The Henderson shipyard is now renowned around Australia and around the world for a number of very innovative companies, employing very highly skilled workers and generating considerable employment in the Fremantle region and beyond. Indeed, it is one of the great success stories of value adding manufacturing, using our brains rather than digging up and shipping away our resources, which Western Australia, in particular, can be proud of. As a former Premier of the state, I am very proud too of the assistance that we were able to provide, particularly in infrastructure. The former federal Labor government provided bounty support to enable it to grow and to grow quickly. This industry was set to grow even further and faster until the recent decision by the government to cut the bounty. Now what we have seen is dithering and, as a result of that dithering and the partial extension of the bounty, we are going to see a lot of uncertainty in this industry. I will refer a little later to the reaction of some of the key industry figures. The government initially proposed to do away with the bounty altogether. It is part of bill the general approach they have taken to industry policy, in other words, to have none and to remove what was formerly there. In this legislation, the government has, indeed, partially reversed its original decision but, in our view, it simply does not go far enough and is continuing to harm the industry. That is one of the reasons why the shadow minister will persist with our amendment which seeks, in part, to rename the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 the 'Bounty (Export of Australian Jobs) Legislation Amendment Bill' because that is what will happen. Someone else will take up this industry, someone else will be doing this work. It will not be the people of the electorate of Fremantle, it will not be the people in Tasmania; it will be people in Europe and various parts of Asia. The government likes to claim that its backdown on the ships bounty means that the shipbuilding industry will now be aligned with key overseas competitors. I think even they know that this is completely wrong because Australian shipbuilders will only receive the bounty for ships completed by 31 December of this year, even though our main export, the average car ferry-and they are very large now, these boats in constructiontakes at least 12 months to construct. They are losing orders because they cannot be guaranteed that bounty beyond the end of this year. Yet we know that, at the same time, European and other overseas shipbuilders will continue to receive bounties of between nine and 25 per cent for at least another three years and perhaps even beyond. This, of course, has lead to some reaction from people in the industry who do want some sort of level playing field. That is not what they are getting. As Mr John Rothwell, now the chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders' Association, and from the Henderson shipyards, said earlier this year: The effect of extending the ship bounty would be negligible and would not prevent extensive downs and loss of substantial contracts worth a total value exceeding $275 million. The government is prepared to put that industry at risk and to see those jobs lost. It is important for members to recognise that industry output at the moment exceeds $500 million per annum. This is no pipsqueak. It has already created over 10,000 jobs, is highly labour intensive and requires very skilled labour. Industry output at the moment is $1.186 million and household income generated is $248.5 million. All of this is generated from the bounty expenditure to date-that is, during all of this period-of $167 million. An industry of that size is generating those jobs with that level of export performance and, of course, income to Australians-$167 million. That has, in the main, been used for research and developmentsomething this government also seems to be set against-investment in infrastructure and work force training, which is absolutely critical for this highly skilled industry. The need for continued assistance is very clear. This is not special pleading by some rust bucket enterprise; this is the front end, or it should be the front end, of Australian industry. It is important to recognise that the major competitors in Europe, as I suggested earlier, have direct government support ranging from nine per cent to 25 per cent. The current Australian rate, the one that will be in place until the end of the year, is five per cent. So they are already operating with less industry assistance. It now seems unlikely that this support will continue beyond the end of this year. Indeed, this bill prevents it. What we have to be aware of is that the OECD shipbuilding agreement, which might have removed subsidies has, in my understanding, still not been fully ratified because the USA is holding out. There might have been some change on that front but, in any case, the three years support is going to continue with our major competitors. Why, you might ask, would we do this to a local industry? You would have to say because of blind pigheadedness, blind ideology and a refusal to admit that you are wrong. The Minister for Industry, Science and standTourism (Mr Moore) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should now sit down and say, 'We cannot afford, in a climate where we have high unemployment, to lose more jobs, particularly jobs that are paid well and are highly skiIled.' With the current level of assistance-and I think it is worth pointing this out-until these decisions were made by the government, production value was set to double to $3.4 billion and employment was set to increase to over 20,000 by the year 2001. This was not an industry that was just steaming along; it was set to go even further and faster. It was projected that there would be boosts to industry exports of $1 billion annually, again, all for an additional expenditure on top of that amount that I mentioned earlier of $170 million. The government is apparently prepared to remove that and sacrifice a very substantial export earner and employer. It is worth nothing that, through tax payments, both personal and company tax, the amount that the former government paid in the form of a bounty has already been exceeded by the amount of those tax payments. So the taxpayers have got their money back well and truly. In future it would have been so called money for jam. For example, in 1994-95, tax paid was in the order of $62 million compared with $22.9 million in bounty payments for that year. Why the government would act, again, is a mystery, because it cannot justify it on the grounds that there is not a benefit for the There is a direct benefit, and the coffers of the Treasury are already receiving that benefit. When the industry were asked about their attitude to the government's proposals, this is what they said to the government, 'Do you want to see this industry continue to expand as dramatically as it has done in the previous decade or do you want to see the industry contract and possibly even fail?' Some might say that was just a rhetorical question and they didn't really mean it, but it is already quite clear that, as a result of the reduction this bounty and the failure to continue it beyond the end of the year, orders have slowed. Why? Because we are already a long way from the markets. It is estimated, as I understand it, that it costs at least an additional million on top of every ship ordered just to transport the vessel to the place it has been purchased. The European countries and most of our Asian neighbours do not have that disadvantage. So Australian shipbuilders are already operating from behind in terms of their total costs. Yet this industry are now asked to bear a European subsidy of somewhere between nine per cent and 25 per cent when they get nothing at all. It is interesting to see that the government was prepared to reverse its decision on shipping grants-a decision which would benefit overseas shipbuilders and major multinationals-while letting this industry hang. Why cripple an outstanding local industry which adds considerable value to Australian materials and which employs workers in my own state? We have not had a sensible, coherent answer from the government--except it seems to be the case that if the former government had policy in a particular area and was making expenditure on particular programs, it therefore should not be continued. That is bad policy. You should look at the best of what your predecessors do and build on it. In this case, there was every justification for this very modest expenditure. In its submission to the Senate, Austal Ships damns the government's failure to consult-they certainly have not done thatcost. to heed arguments and to visit facilities. Things have now moved on a little and I would have to say that, generally speaking, the shipping industry has made its views very clear. The industry has lobbied hard and has had a partial success, but it does not go nearly far enough. The industry's view of the current legislation can be seen in today' s Financial Review, where the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association very clearly blames budget cutbacks for $275 million in lost exports. As a community we can ill afford in that sort of loss. The association claims that lost export orders are directly the report of those budget cutbacks. The article reads: In a stinging rebuke of Government policy, ASA chairman Mr John Rothwell has told the Industry Minister, Mr John Moore, that Australian shipbuilders were now at a ""huge disadvantage"" to their $1 European competitors and warned the Government ""to expect further job and investment losses in Tasmania and Western Australia."" ""To avoid further cutbacks, the industry requires your assistance in removing the uncertainties in relation to the continuation of the [shipping] bounty as a matter of urgency,"" Mr Rothwell said. As I say, the government has partly relented but, even with that small concession, we are still going to lose $275 million in lost exports. That will inevitably mean the loss of jobs, and I understand there are imminent standdowns. When you are in a position of not being able to match the prices of your competitors because you know you will not get a bounty beyond the end of the year and they willand in any case they have improved their competitiveness partly by mimicking our success here-you are obviously going to be in a very difficult position when it comes to getting new orders. It is very hard to convince purchasers that you should get the job ahead of others who are offering a lower price. So the shipbuilders have been put in a very invidious position. Austal, at the time when the original decision was made, quickly lost a major contract with Stena Line for two vessels and an option for two more, which then had a total value of around $225 million. It was far too expensive without the bounty. Now, with the fact that the bounty is only going to the end of the year, most of these vessels will not be completed in that period of time; so Austal cannot actually guarantee that they will get the subsidy beyond the end of the year. Austal and other companies have submitted very clearly that planning will now be, as they put it, for survival-not for the sort of growth I talked about earlier-that jobs will be lost and that some companies will move their operations offshore. That is no idle threat. The only way for these companies to survive, in many cases, with the substantial financial disadvantage that they face is by moving their operations offshore where they can get cheaper labour than in Australia. The government is basically saying with a nod and a wink, 'Well, you can go offshore. You can take your business elsewhere. You can employ labour, particularly in the near region. You might have to spend a bit more money on training. We don't much care if Australians lose their employment. So what?' This is all for those miserly sums of money that I talked about-$170 million to the year 200 I-to support an industry that really does deserve the support of the wider Australian community. I know from talking to my constituents, the taxpayers, the so-called mainstream Australia, and I wish the Prime Minister would listen to what they have to say, that they believe it is important for governments to intervene; it is important for governments to provide infrastructure; and it is important for governments to provide tax breaks or bounties to ensure that Australians have jobs-jobs that are well paid and that build on their skills. You do not have to be an economic genius to know that those funds then go straight back into the community. These people buy houses; they buy whitegoods; they walk into the local supermarket; and they purchase education and health services. The money then circulates in our community, and other people have jobs as a result. The spin-off effects from this high value added, highly skilled labour is very considerable. Much more so, for example, than with the mining industry-a very important industry and one that as a former state Premier I have supported strongly-because I know that the multiplier effect in the mining industry is relatively small compared with these high value added, high labour industries. My constituents tell me very clearly that they want to see government supporting industries which add value. They are sick of seeing Australian ideas go offshore; they are sick of seeing the skilled work being done . elsewhere. While they recognise that we have a competitive advantage in mining and agriculture, they are also sick of seeing those products going offshore where the greater value is in someone else's hands. It is all very well to export iron ore, but what about a bit of value adding? It is all very well to export agricultural product, but why don't we, for instance, manufacture pulp and paper here? Government should be intervening actively to ensure that those next stages are taken-whether it is by reducing energy costs, by improving access to the resource, by providing tax breaks or by providing bounties sensibly-not out of kilter with the rest of the world and not in breach of our international agreements. But it can all be done, and Australians know it. They look at the ideology of this government and they shake their heads in disbelief. Why on earth would you do it? It does beggar your imagination. I think this is one clear area where the government has failed to perceive what the majority in the community want. With the rest of the time available to me, I want to put on another hat not as a local member but as shadow minister for the arts, because part of this legislation relates to the book bounty. The coalition will now, according to this legislation, abolish the book bounty seven months ahead of its original expiry date. All the feedback we have had from the industry suggests that this could cause up to 1,500 job losses with a particularly severe impact on regional centres such as Maryborough, Victoria. A lot of people have said-I think without exaggeration because there is a big increase now in the cost of publishing locally-that up to 50 per cent of Australian book production may be lost to overseas printers. One of the key things that industry needs is not only the ability to operate on a level playing field, at least where there is some justice in comparing them with overseas producers, but also some atmosphere of certainty. In the case of the book bounty, their understanding was that this would be in place until the end of 1997. Instead, we have had it dropping out six months ahead. The government should have been asking now or even six months ago whether it was necessary to e?ltend it beyond the period, or whether it was actu-ly desirable to do that. But no, we see them c\lttit-- it ahead of time. It has been difficult for firms in the industry to make any sensible investment decisions. In my view, since the budget the industry has actually given up on new local orders. The bounty is not even being allowed to run for its legislative term let alone there being some active input from the government about whether it is desirable for us to have most of our publishing done overseas. The export of books under the bounty arrangements has increased by 200 per cent over the past 12 years. I think that is something we need to look at. How has the industry performed? Has it hidden behind the shelter or has it gone out and actively exported and promoted Australian wares and jobs? The answer is a 200 per cent increase over 12 years. That is a pretty good outcome for a very small investment. The ending of the bounty prematurely will cut this growth short and significantly reduce employment in the industry, particularly in regional Australia. This has effects in my own electorate. A lot of Australian written material will now have to be published overseas. The Fremantle Arts Centre Press, for instance, have indicated to me that if they were to continue to have their books published in Australia-something they want to do for a whole range of reasons, not least of which is timely access-they would find that their print costs would increase very substantially indeed. They indicate that the elimination of the bounty will increase their print costs by $18,000. This is a small publishing firm but, nonetheless, one that is very well regarded. In the following 12 months, their print costs will increase by $39,000. The net effect will be that either books published and printed in Australia will cost more or, again, they will be faced with having to take their publishing offshore. There is already far too much of that going on in my view. What we are seeing in this legislation, and what our amendments are suggesting that the Australian people should see in this legislation, is that this is not about whether you have bounties and for how long. It is about a sensible industry policy-something the government lacks-which supports investment and Australian jobs and a sensible industry very policy that the government appears to want to repudiate. If you do not like the previous government's policies, I beg of you, put something decent in its place and stop exporting Australian jobs.",59
114,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"I oppose the government's amendments that have been circulated to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and support the amendments circulated in the name of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The bill and the government's amendments are bad for Australian industry, they are bad for Australian jobs, and they are bad policy. They reflect a consistent course of conduct in that, since the government came to office, it has not helped Australian industry; it has abolished or substantially reduced assistance to Australian industry in a range of programs for trade and export enhancement. These bills adversely affect three industries: the shipbuilding industry, the computer industry and the book publishing industry. They are three industries which, to greater or lesser extent, are successful export industries. That is particularly the case so far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, you do not wear your Tasmanian cap in the chair but when you sit in this parliament as a Tasmanian and when I sit in this parliament as a Western Australian we know that Australia's shipbuilding industry is an export industry and almost exclusively carried on in Western Australia and Tasmania. This piece of legislation is bad for that industry and bad for jobs so far as people who live in Western Australia and Tasmania are concerned. The consistent course of conduct that we have seen in industry and trade enhancement since the government came to office covers a range of areas. We saw the government in the run-up to the budget last year hinting substantial cuts to research and development funding, hinting at substantial cuts to export market development grants scheme and hinting at substantial cuts in the bounty area, which we see reflected by this legislation. those hints-very many of them in breach election commitments-are now coming to pass and to fruition. We have seen $2 billion cut out of approservices priations for research and development. How many times have we seen the criticism made of Australia that while we might be very good in pure science we have been historically weak at turning good scientific ideas into manufactured products or developed ideas. The research and development tax concession arrangements were the most effective policy incentives that had been put in place to achieve that. We now see substantial diminservices, ution of that program to the tune of $2 bilproducts. lion. In the export market development grants scheme, a scheme which has been successfully in place since 1974, some 22 years, we find the government about to introduce legislation which will cap that scheme, substantially reduce its focus, and substantially narrow the range of export activities that be eligible under the scheme. That scheme has been of particular assistance to the book publishing industry. Courtesy of this piece legislation and the Export Market Developmantle ment Grants Bill-which the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) presented to the House last week-the book publishing indusmentioned try gets hit with a double whammy: the bounty goes and the EMDG arrangements are substantially narrowed so far as that industry is concerned. In addition to R&D and the export market development grants scheme, we have seen a range of export and trade enhancement programs abolished by the government. The lTES scheme, the international trade enhancement scheme, the lAMP scheme, the international agricultural marketing scheme, and a range of Asia business links schemes have all been abolished, as I said, primarily in breach of election commitments. All this is a consisat tent course of conduct which is saying to Australian industry and Australian exporters the that this government is not interested in enhancing Australian industry or in seeking to develop Australian industries or ideas here All and is not interested in seeking to enhance of . our trade and export performance. One thing which exemplifies the three industries that we are discussing in these bills-the shipbuilding industry, the computer or software industry, and books-is that they are all areas of export potential for Australia which follow the shift of international trade. We saw in the trade outcomes statement which the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, tabled in the House on 5 February that, on the government's own analysis and on the analysis of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is a continuing shift in international trade to manufactures and value added Australia needs to follow that shift. Unlike the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), we on this side of the House do not subscribe to the view that we should continue an overdependence on our traditional raw commodities, whether they be agriculture or minerals. This bill adversely affects the scope of will those industries to enhance our value added performance and our other services export performance, particularly in the case of the of shipbuilding industry. The member for Fre(Dr Lawrence), who spoke before me in the debate and within whose electorate some of these shipbuilding companies operate, the comments that have been made publicly by the Chairman of Austal Ships from Western Australia, Mr John Rothwell, who is also the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association. Mr Rothwell has made the point on any number of occasions since the government announced its decision to terminate these bounties and announced its amended decision in December last year that the effect of the abolition of the bounty-the direct effect of government policy on the shipbuilding industry-will be to reduce exports, lose contracts and lose jobs. As late as today in the Australian Financial Review an article under the heading '$275m in lost exports: Angry ASA chairman blames Budget cutbacks' we find an article by Steve Lewis who reported: In a stinging rebuke of Government policy, ASA chairman Mr John Rothwell has told the Industry Minister, Mr John Moore, that Australian shipbuilders were now at a ""huge disadvantage"" to their European competitors ... The article goes on to say that the ASA, through its chairman, Mr Rothwell, has 'warned Canberra to expect further job and investment losses in Tasmania and Western Australia' . Mr Rothwell is quoted as saying: To avoid further cutbacks, the industry requires your assistance in removing the uncertainties in relation to the continuation of the [shipping] bounty as a matter of urgency. Mr Rothwell goes on to say in the article, in a direct quote from a letter he has written to the minister: Minister, it takes 12 months to build a vessel of the car ferry size, which are the majority of exported ferries from Australia. What this means is that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build a ship with the aid of the bounty, as not be possible to complete the ship by the end of this calendar year. The substance of the comments by Mr Rothwell goes directly to government policy in this area. It is the termination of a bounty which has been very successful in producing exports and producing employment in Western Australia and Tasmania. The Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association has made the point that a direct consequence of the abolition of the bounty so far as ships are concerned will be the loss of jobs and the loss of exports. It is not just those on this side of the House who have made this point: I noticed in the West Australian on Wednesday, 26 February an article entitled 'Warning on ship jobs'. The story by Wendy Pryer starts: More than 500 workers in WA's shipbuilding industry would lose their jobs soon if the Federal Government did not soften its stance on industry subsidies, companies said yesterday. It refers to a couple of Western Australian shipbuilding companies, Wavemaster and Austal, and says that Austal warned of 300 job losses. The key point of the article is that Western Australian Minister for Commerce and Trade, Hendy Cowan-who is the Deputy Premier of Western Australia and leader of the National Party-described the federal policy as 'bloody nonsense'. Hendy is never one to mince his words, as the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, found out last week. But, when you look at the evidence of loss of jobs, loss of exports and loss of capacity of a successful export industry in manufacturing and value adding to be internationally competitive, you cannot help but come to the view that Hendy is absolutely correct. So far as the book publishing industry is concerned, I notice that the Australian Publishers Association conducted a survey of their members in February this year. Without going through the survey response in great detail it is clear from that response that the two areas of government policy which the Australian Publishers Association and members of the book industry regard as most important to their exports' success are book bounty and the capacity to access the export market development grants scheme. These are precisely the two areas of industry support it will which the government in the course of this week with, today, the bounty legislation and, listed for Thursday, the EMDG Bill is proposing to either terminate or substantially gut. In a position paper dated 12 February, under the heading 'Abolition of the book bounty will result in a $28 million cost to revenue, not savings of over $7 million in 1997-98 as indicated in the explanatory memorandum to the bill', the Publishers Association made the following comment: If one of the principal reasons for abolishing the Book Bounty was for the publishing and printing industries to ""make a contribution"" to winding back the National deficit, then terminating the Bounty will have an overwhelmingly different outcome to that intended. As indicated in the attached Paper, research conducted on behalf of the Printing Industries Association of Australia indicates that 50 per cent of bountiable book production or $l35 million will be lost to overseas printers on termination of the Bounty. Total job losses for book printing and upstream industries are estimated at 1500. That is the assessment of the industry, and it government. rings consistent with the public comments that we have heard from the shipbuilders about net consequences of this piece of legislationare loss of jobs and loss of exports. This bill is consistent with the course conduct we have seen the government take since it came to office-no interest in develpursue oping Australian industry, no interest in enhancing Australian exports, no interest in trying to support Australian industry, no interest in providing incentives to Australian industries to export, no incentive for research and development, no incentive for developing Australian industries here and no interest seeking to follow the continuing shift international trade towards value adding to services and to manufactures. These bills are bad bills. They reflect bad public policy. They are bad for Australian industry and are bad for jobs.",63
115,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMITTEE,"I rise to join with other members on this side of the House to oppose what we regard as in essence the job cuts and export losses inherent in the coalition government's Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. Despite delays in some of the cuts due to the wideia, spread community campaign and opposition for that has occurred since the original announcehave ments, this revised bill will still remove cogs from the machinery of support for Australian industry. In essence, the bill is a clear statement again of this government's lack of industry policy. From the Australian Labor Party's point of view, it is time that this government faced up to the fact that support is needed generate jobs in the areas of Australia most need them at the moment. There is a role for government to actually involve itself and to assist in generating jobs. There is role for government to roll up its sleeves embrace the need for a decent industry policy in Australia. The bounty legislation bill says in black and white that the question of support for jobs, pursuing exports and reducing imports, doing something for welfare and creating a decent standard of living for all Australians is not high on the list of priorities of the current The government has already slashed fundthe ing for what I and many Australians believe essential industry support programs. They are fundamental programs. First, there is the of tax incentive for research and development. A country that prides itself on a capacity to decent employment opportunities and to create opportunities for Australia at an industry level depends on support for research and development. Since 2 March last year the Howard government has clearly walked away from its responsibility to support research and development. The second program decimated in by the Howard government is the export of market development grants scheme, which will be subject to further discussion in this House later this week. Third, the government has undermined, so far as we are concerned, they the importance of the development import finance facility. Now this bill seeks to remove the bounty for books-a fairly fundamental industryships, machine tools, robots and computers. These are industries that throughout a range of areas across the states and territories of Australia, and importantly in regional Australhave created important job opportunities Australians in the past and industries that a capacity to grow and create additional vital job opportunities in the future. As I have said in this House before, the Howard government truly knows the shortyet term cost of everything and the mediumand long-term value of nothing. That is the problem with this government. It is big on a shortterm view of life but it really lacks an imagito native, forward looking program for the future which development of Australia as a nation. That is not just my view or the view of the Australian Labor Party or the Australian a Council of Trade Unions; interestingly, it is and the view of the recent past chief executive officer of the leading employer organisation in Australia, namely, Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association. Not long before his retirement, he said that 'everything is a cost and nothing is an investment to the current government'. In a nutshell, that statement by Bert Evans-a leader in Australian industry who is respected by both sides of the parliamentclearly says what Australia as a nation is thinking: the Howard government approaches policy from the point of view of cost and is not prepared to invest in the future of Australia. Bert Evans is right. This government does not understand that sometimes you need to spend a bit in order to create something much bigger for the future. I suppose it is about an investment strategy, which involves risk. The problem with the current government is that it is not prepared to take risks unless the polls that they conduct on a regular basis argue that to make an announcement on a particular policy will not involve a risk in respect of occupying the government benches. The real problem for Australia is that that cautious approach for the development of industry will not produce the necessary jobs that Australia is so much looking for at the moment. In that context, the industry bounty scheme provides grants. That is what it is about-grants to offset the production costs of companies involved in making high quality products, companies that are prepared to make risky investment decisions based on trying to create jobs and wealth for this nation. I believe that the role of government is actually to assist those companies and to get involved and help push and prod sales to ensure that their investment decisions are successful and, in turn, they create opportunities for Australians. The most important opportunity that is bound up with the question of bounties is quality jobs in quality industries-industries such as books, ships, machine tools, robots and computers. I can only say that, from the point of view of this side of the House, to abolish bounties will be a short-sighted measure which will badly affect particular sections of Australia, especially regional Australia. Take, for instance, the town of Maryborough in Victoria. Those on the other side of the House think that Maryborough is in Queensland. Those of us who come from Victoria know the importance of Maryborough in that state. More importantly, we know that the issue of bounties and the book industry are exceptionally important to the future of that town because it, in essence, depends on the book industry for the job opportunities that exist in an area of high unemployment. It is interesting to note that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has not been on his feet in this House demanding that this government maintain its support for the town of MaryborÂ· ough and maintain its support for the bounty system that maintains decent job opportunities in areas of high unemployment such as the town of Maryborough in Victoria. The town of Maryborough has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the state. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said on - the eve of the last federal election, if he does not do something about reducing youth unemployment, then he ought to be condemned. By his own actions with respect to this bill he ought to be condemned, because in the town of Maryborough in Victoria, an area of high unemployment, he is effectively rooting out a system that gives support to jobs and industry in that very town. It needs special attention to overcome its chronic lack of jobs. It needs support from Canberra. That is what it needs. But what does this government offer? Instead, with this bill, Maryborough is going to suffer a full frontal assault on its principle remaining employer in that town, the book publishing industry. One quarter of the local work force in Maryborough depends either directly or indirectly on the book production industry. That is not insignificant-one quarter of the work force. There are two big printing firms, the Australian Print Group and MCPherson's, and they are clearly central to the local economy. They have been part of the big success story related to the success of this scheme in the past. There has been an increase in book exports in recent times, an increase that shot up over 200 per cent in the last 12 years. What we are talking about in relation to this bill is a measly $4 million. It is not much when you consider that those opposite were prepared to pay half a million dollars as a government to move the Speaker's chair from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House. Now they say that $4 million is inappropriate to try to save 25 per cent of the local jobs that are so important for the future of the town of Maryborough in Victoria. The real problem is that the government would sooner see the jobs go offshore to Indonesia or the Philippines than invest and create job opportunities in rural Australia. More importantly, the book bounty has a multiplier effect in the economy in the order of 13 times the initial outlay. That is not a bad investment. But, as Bert Evans said, everything is a cost for this government, not an investment. If you were prepared to take a risk and you cared about jobs and if you really cared about youth unemployment, an investment of $4 million with 25 per cent of the local town's jobs and a multiplier effect in the private sector is not a bad investment. The fact that this government is prepared to rip away this system not only means that they ought to be condemned but it shows what a short-sighted, narrow minded government they are. It is about time the member for Bendigo stood up for his local region in relation to Maryborough and 25 per cent of the jobs. What is worse still is that unemployment in Bendigo in January was 10.5 per cent. That is pretty bad. You ought to go back a couple of months. It was 8.1 per cent in November of last year. Where is he? He was silent on tariffs. There was a commitment to the city of Bendigo prior to the last election which meant a further investment in the form of construction of a new art gallery with additional jobs of benefit to the local community. But he has gone missing when asked questions about the future of that art gallery since the federal election. Now he has gone missing on the question of the future of bounties and support for key jobs in the town of Maryborough in his electorate. Let us go beyond Victoria. Let us go, for example, to the state of Queensland. Queensland, like Victoria, also has an unemployment problem at the moment. It unfortunately has the highest unemployment rate of any of Australia's mainland states. At 9.6 per cent, it is way above the national average. I suppose that is why the Premier is not talking about jobs. He is only consumed with one job at the moment: who might replace Senator Colston. I know it consumes him, but that is one job and one job alone. What is more important to the future of Queensland at the moment is not whether or not Senator Colston resigns but the fact that in Queensland, where the coalition government is overrepresented, there is an unemployment rate of 9.6 per cent. I say to this House that it is high time the coalition government and its mates in Queensland got their priorities right. Attacking the Australian constitution is not the priority; the priority at the moment is jobs. The priority is a decent industry policy that means that jobs are created not just in metropolitan Australia but also in regional Australia. You ought to go to regional Queensland. Go to towns such as Townsville, which is like Maryborough. No wonder the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is trying desperately to mislead his electorate by playing down the extent to which local government jobs are going to disappear. To overcome high unemployment in Queensland we need to broaden the industrial base beyond its traditional reliance on mining, resources and tourism. In particular, manufacturing industry projects are vital to the future of Queensland. I suggest that abolishing industry bounties will take Queensland in the opposite direction to what is needed for its future development. If this legislation is passed, Queensland businesses will lose nearly $7 million a year in assistance from the federal government. Two hundred and fifty-one Queensland businesses benefited from the industry bounty scheme last financial year. It might not be a priority to the Prime Minister, it might not be a priority to the Premier of Queensland, but I tell you what, it is a priority to ordinary Queenslanders and their families at the moment with an unemployment rate of 9.6 per cent. As with the member for Bendigo, I am waiting to see how the coalition members in Queensland, such as the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, and the member for Capricornia, Mr Marek, stand up with respect to this bill. Are they prepared to vote to defend government assistance to Queensland aimed at trying to reduce unemployment or are they going to put their heads in the sand and walk away from their responsibilities to the local electorates? Places such as Townsville, Rockhampton, Mackay and Cairns stand to lose jobs as a result of this legislation. Unfortunately, the loss of those jobs would be devastating for the local economy-not just the direct loss of the jobs related to the factory that would lose the,iBSsistance from the government but also those;who depend on the multiplier effect out of the&e'initial jobs. I know it does not concern the government at all. Just take the potential job losses in Telstra. Take the job losses that have already occurred with respect to government employment in Queensland, such as the Family Law Court in Townsville or the closure of tax offices or the CES office at Mareeba-all important local employment opportunities. We know what the multiplier effect is in Queensland at the moment as a result of this government's policies: an unemployment rate well above the national average-an unemployment rate of 9.6 per cent. In essence, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill will make it much harder for local young people to get places-decent job opportunities-and it will build on the already savage impact, for example, of other government initiatives such as the increase of higher education costs in towns such as Cairns and Townsville in Queensland. Then we go to the issue of Tasmania, another state affected by this legislation. We go to the question of Incat, one of Tasmania's most successful shipbuilding enterprises. What this government is doing, by this legislation, is sabotaging its plans for expansion and sabotaging its plans to create additional jobs in a state of high unemployment. But it is worse. The decision of this government on bounties reinforces previous government decisions to walk away from its responsibilities to reduce unemployment in Tasmania. The government likes to talk about youth unemployment and apprentices. One of the problems confronting Incat at the moment goes to the government's abolition of incentive payments for new apprentices to firms with more than 100 employees. So much for support by this government for reducing youth unemployment in Tasmania. I take the view that Tasmania's extremely high rate of unemployment needs companies such as Incat. It does not need a coalition government that is more consumed with looking after mates-a retired Victorian National Party politician on the payroll, for example, such as Peter Nixon. We rip up the legislation on bounties which give assistance to create jobs. We close CES offices. We have a Premier of Queensland consumed with one job-who might replace Senator Colston. But on the way through we create a few jobs, including one for our mate, Peter Nixon. Unemployment is a big problem in Tasmania. So what is the government's response? Put their mate on the payroll to do a report on the issue of jobs in Tasmania. I think it is more important that they maintain support for legislation such as the bounties legislation-not pay big consultancy fees but actually do something: invest in the future of jobs in Tasmania, invest in the future of industry in Tasmania, invest in decent companies such as Incat. A job for the Prime Minister's mate, whilst unemployment grows for working people in places such as Maryborough, Hobart, Townsville and Cairns, to name a few! They are the types of towns that depend on the bounty legislation. The time has come for the government to face up to the fact that business is out there wanting to do the right thing by this nation. John Howard and Andrew Robb ought to start listening to business. They ought to start facing up to the fact that the so-called free labour market and the so-called reform on the industrial relations front are not going to create those jobs. There is a role for government to actually get their hands a bit dirty, to actually take a few risks, to actually make a few well thought out investment decisions. It is not about picking winners, as some would have you believe. It is actually about putting in place schemes that push and prod industry, that actually encourage them to invest and that encourage them to take risks. That is what industry policy is about. It is not about throwing money around. It is about well thought out schemes such as the bounty legislation. The results are there to be seen. Look at the improvements in industries such as the book industry, the robot industry and the shipbuilding industry. That was not a wasteful investment. That was an investment that produced results, an investment that increased our export income, an investment that really meant a better standard of living for a lot of Australians, not just in metropolitan Australia but also in regional Australia. I put this to the Prime Minister: the time has now come to act. The time has come to halt cuts in vital industry assistance, including the bounty scheme which this legislation threatens. The time has come to reinstate funding for regional development programs and to accept the need for a well thought out regional policy. The time has come to halt job cuts in the Public Service. It is time for the government to resume the rate of growth in traineeships for young people, which was happening under Labor. It is time for the government to restore at least some Working Nation job programs to stop the blow-out in long-term unemployment. And it is time for this government to actually take a risk and to set a jobs target. The Labor Party believes the Commonwealth government should play a positive role in encouraging jobs in regional Australia. We do not support withdrawing assistance from where it is needed. Our regional task force is out there talking to industries in regional Australia, in places such as Maryborough and Townsville and Cairns; and the feedback is clear. It is one of frustration with the current government's lack of support for regional Australia; one of frustration with its lack of support for industry; one of frustration with its unwillingness to face up to its requirement to support young people and to create real job opportunities, not halfbaked, ill thought out work for the dole schemes.

116,Unknown,COMMITTEE,"I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). That amendment reads:the House rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, you and I come from regions of Australia, you and I hear the rhetoric that is mouthed by this government about jobs in regional Australia, and you and I observe the numerous measures being taken by this government which will retard and reduce employment in regional Australia. The provisions of this bill are just another one of those measures, because the shipbuilding industry in Australia is in regional Australia-in Fremantle, in Tasmania essentially and some of it now in Adelaide. But the principal parts of the high-speed catamaran ferries aluminium vessel building are in those areas that I have indicated. I will come back to them a little later one by one. It was in the budget presentation last year that Minister Moore and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced the abolition of the computer, book, machine tools and robots and ship bounties. On 16 December, following widespread opposition to that announcement and to the government's intentions, the government partially changed its decisionnot fully, only partially. As an opposition, we will persist with the amendment we have put and we will persist with giving a greater chance and opportunity and a greater level of support to the Australian shipbuilding industry. By the provisions of the legislation before us, Australian shipbuilders will receive bounty. only until the end of this year. That seems to be predicated on an expectation that the OECD agreement that mayor may not be signed will ensure that overseas competitors will cease to receive subsidies for their shipbuilding operators later on. My understanding is that the United States in no way will ratify that agreement. You cannot import into the United States ships constructed in another place. They have a very high level of protection and, because the United States is not prepared to sign, to ratify, then similarly the EC will not follow through. But here we have this valiant government going ahead blindly and putting our heads on the chopping block, reducing bounty and assistance to Australia's industries, and expecting them to be able to compete with shipbuilders in other countries that are subsijob dised with a range of support from nine per cent up to even 25 per cent. The Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilde-:AAAOCWion, John Rothwell, has said that the""-Xierisive stand-downs and the loss of substantiiiloonttitcts would exceed some $275 million were this legislation to go through in the form that it is in. We want to see the bounty continue until such time as the agreement to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies in our competitive nations abroad actually come into effect-whenever that may be. We do not want Australia going forward again leading the charge, reducing our subsidies and so reducing our competitive ability while we wait for the bigger nations to maybe change, maybe not change. Personally, I do not think the United States will change at all, because of the support that they give to their shipping and to their shipbuilding industry. The 1994-95 ABS statistics on the shipbuilding industry in Australia-they were the latest I could get-point to employment in the industry of 6,270, wages and salaries paid in that industry constituting $273.4 million per annum, a turnover of $1.376 billion per year and a turnover per person employed in the industry of some $219,500 per year. It is a substantial industry and, as I said at the outset, it is in regional Australia, not in Sydney and Melbourne. The industry has an enormous multiplying effect in the areas in which it is situated. I was fortunate enough to attend the Ausmarine Exhibition in Fremantle on 5 November last year. That was a high-class exhibition of Australia's shipbuilding wares, the component industries and the suppliers. There were both domestic and foreign suppliers because the aluminium from which these ships are constructed is imported. It is a highly sophisticated industry. But the minister declined the opportunity to attend and to open that exhibition at Fremantle. As I said, it was a very high quality exhibition, very well presented, successful for the exhibitors that were there and very well conducted. The exhibition was ultimately opened by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and a very good he did. But the important thing to note is that even at that stage no member of the government could find the time to go across to Fremantle to at least show a presence-not in a party political sense but to show that support for Australia's growing shipbuilding industry. I put that with the attitude of this government towards the shipbuilding industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard me say many times that for the life of me I do not understand-although I can find reasons-the antipathy that the National Party and the Liberal Party have had for decades towards Australia's shipping and shipbuilding industries. The smart countries of the world, the developing countries of the world, see the jobs that are generated, see the commercial opportunities, but the National and the Liberal parties at the federal level in this nation do not. There is an excellent directory entitled Australia and the Sea. It outlines the capabilities of Australian marine exporters, the Australian firms, involved in this industry. If you look at the first category 'Boat buildingaluminium', you see the number of firms involved in this area, such as Adelaide Ship Construction International, Austal Ships, the Australian Ferry Builders Association, Cougar Catamarans, Ferries Australia, Geraldton Boat Builders and Incat Australia from Tasmania. They are all regional Australia firms, not Sydney or Melbourne firms. Others in the 'boat building-aluminium' category are Legend Boat Builders, Oceanfast Marine Group from Fremantle, SBF Shipbuilders, Seaflyer Boats, Wavemaster InternationalClifford, another major firm with a very good export record-and so the list goes on. It is interesting to look down the list products that these exporters supply. In the boat building area they supply products in aluminium, fibreglass, steel and wood. I will not take the time of the House to list them The associated spin-off industries from building of these ships are in areas such marina construction, marina marina design, propulsion and engines, publications, refrigeration, safety, scientific research, submersible craft, waste systems, winches, interiors of vessels, engineering and financial and legal services. One of the things that this government cannot comprehend is that whatever the business, whatever the activity, there is a huge multiplier effect into shore based indusian tries. It is not just the ship you the support and related services that other countries are so clever to develop. There are opportunities for professional jobs, highly paid jobs and rewarding jobs for Australians. That is why I keep driving this issue home. That is why as an opposition we are so the committed to Australia's shipbuilding induswelding. try. Other associated industries are in the areas of consultancy, education, electronics, coastal engineering and fishing equipment. have already mentioned the construction the interior of the vessels and scientific research. They are some of the related activiquality ties that help Australia perform so well in international shipbuilding industry. In today's Financial Review there is a reference to the Australian Shipbuilders will Association's chairman, John Rothwell. He says in that article that, as a result of this legislation, lost export orders are expected be to the tune of $275 million per annum. He makes the point that it takes 12 months to build a vessel. There is a long lag time. cut Australia off at the end of this year without the other nations having committed themselves is sheer lunacy. This government has set this industry on a self-destruct course. One can see the tremendous performance and export achievements of those you look at Incat from Tasmania and Bob you find a great story of success and achievement as a result of sheer hard work, commitment and persistence in designing a of product, building it up and leading the world market----Dnly to see the kind of legislation we have before us now. He says that Wavemaster has more than $80 million a year in export all. sales. But Wavemaster is now 70 per cent the Malaysian owned, which fits in with the as government's policy of flogging everything consultancy, off to those abroad. We could also look at the exports of other shipping companies. This is a very tough industry. There are other nations that are trying to copycat Australia. To construct a high speed, wave piercing, aluminium catamaran vessel you require a high-tech, special grade of aluminium. What is at stake and what makes Australia so successful is Australknow-how in the design and the construcbuild; it is all tion of the vessel. Austal Ships in Fremantle has sold some 26 ferries-a record number-to China. There are firms in China which are trying to copycat those vessels, but the difficulty they have is very high level of skill required for the I was told at an exhibition that you can have lower labour costs. I said to one of the major manufacturers, 'How do you cope I with this?' He said, 'You can have your $100 of per week wages, compared to $300 or $200 per day wages, but you do not get the high skill in terms of the specialised aluthe minium welding.' That is part of the key to Australia's success in this area. We will have to fend off the copycats. We have to fend off those nations that subsidise their industry to make it more competitive. This is not a handout to the industry, but to that is the way it is being treated by this government. I am sure that this measure is not the result of an initiative that came out of the To department. The portfolio departments do not put forward these kinds of proposals. This is a doctrinaire, economic dry, economic rationalist proposal that has come out of good old Treasury and Finance. I am sorry to say that I see this government as Treasury-led. It firms. If is the same old thing. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from regional Australia, see this so often with regional industries. They do not have a clue about growing industry or a recognition that in world markets you not only have to be the best designer and the most efficient and reliable manufacturer-price reliable as well as quality reliable-but you also have to deal with the support provided by foreign governments to their industries. They pursue government interventionist policies of selecting industries and supporting those industries to break into world markets. Here we have not a handout to an industry but a very modest contribution to an industry to enable it to try to match the support given by other foreign governments to their industries. I have mentioned that the figure for that can vary from nine per cent to 25 per cent. The Commercial Vessel Yearbook 1996-97 _ 0\1\ all of the Australian ship manufacturers and boot builders. There is a reference in the preface of the report which states: The local market, whilst sound in most sectors, will be unexciting for a year or two. The rising Australproposition Ian dollar means that the yards will have to become increasing efficient to remain competitive. That indicates what the market is. As if that is not enough-that is the tough part of it, with the copycat in the low labour cost countries-to be stabbed in the back by the government of our own country for what really is a relatively small amount of money that generates a very large level of export income is really something that the industry should not have to tolerate. As I said, the Australians that work in this industry are Australians who have got very high levels of skill. They are regional Australians; they are not the Sydney! Melbourne Australians that we referred to earlier. I have a newspaper report stating that Australian ferries lead the way in the Baltic, and there is an outline of the performance of those vessels. Austal developed its original export market through Asia and its first ship, which I referred to earlier, was delivered in 1989-some eight years ago. John Rothwell, who is now President of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, was one of the driving forces behind the development of the aluminium hull design. Austrade figures show that 70 per cent of Australia's high speed marine vessel exports now come from the Henderson industrial area, south of Fremantle. So exports are essentially coming from the Fremantle area and, to the extent that some building has started in Adelaide, from South Australian shipbuilders, as well as Incat in Tasmania, which is run by Bob Clifford and his team. When we look at we can do with this industry and how we can develop it, we see that it has to have government support and it has to have the benefit of the bounty that we have been providing to it. That should continue until such time as our competitor nations cease the support they give to their industries. The abolition of the book bounty some six months ahead of its original expiry date resulted in job losses in Victoria, with some 1,500 people in the Maryborough area being affected. We are committed to our original for the expiry date for the book bounty. There should be an immediate inquiry into future assistance for the printing and publishing industry. That inquiry would look at the total picture, not the bits and pieces that come forward with this Treasury-led approach to our manufacturing industry. In the area of computers, the shipbuilding subsidy, machine tools and the books bounty, we are giving preference to Australian industry. We are committed to Australia's regional industries. I strongly support the amendment that is now before the House and hope that it will be taken heed of by government and given its support.",70
117,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE,"The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, coming so early in this new government's life, is a bit of deja vu, because it echoes the approach and the mentality of the coalition when last in government. In 1982 in Newcastle we were experiencing a substantial problem in the steel industry. The response of the then Fraser government and the then Treasurer Howard was to refer the matter to the Industry Commission, as it was then called. They said, 'Don't do anything about it. Give it to somebody else. Send it to a committee.' What would they come back with? They would come back with the idea, 'If it can't survive, let it go.' That basically displays the coalition's ignorance of industry and manufacturing. This is not accidental. If we look at the figures, in one year-1982-manufacturing industry in Australia lost eight per cent of its work force. That was not under a Labor government, but under John Howard as Treasurer. The ignorance and lack of understanding of the government of that day left us a legacy that we are still recovering from. So what was one of this new government's first actions? They were back into industry with what they now call 'business welfare' - the new phrase. It is interesting to read in the second readfacturers ing speech that the overriding objective is to eliminate the budget deficit. How about that? Since this was first announced the deficit has gone up by $3 billion. Well done, Mr Treasurer! What a wonderful knowledge of industry and what a wonderful knowledge of budgeting! The fact is that since the 1960s there has been a problem with Australian manufacturing. In its day, the Black Jack MCEwen proposal for tariffs, in principle, was a reasononly able concept. The idea of increasing the cost of imported goods was never the best way of doing it, but in its day it had some merit. It had some major weaknesses, the most critical of which was the fact that most of our manufacturing was made under licence; it was not native. An overseas owner of the licence brought in the tools and made the goods. We never actually controlled it, we never actually owned it. At least by having tariffs there was a prospect of developing a native industry. But that would have required a lot of other things to happen. The government of the day kept the tariffs and when things got tough added a bit more to the wall; it built the wall a few bricks higher and then it went to sleep. Behind the wall, our industry has neither invested nor developed. That all came to a crashing climax in 1982. In one year, under John Howard as Treasurer, eight per cent of people in manufacturing lost their jobs. That was the finale of 25 years after Black Jack MCEwen. He raised the concept, and the coalition went to sleep. It kept adding bricks to the wall; it raised the tariffs higher and higher. Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, therefore allowing local companies to compete. But the domestic price is then higher. It is very difficult to export from a base that is dependent upon high tariffs, because the domestic price is always the problem. The obvious alternative was to use bounties, because the objective always is to get the cost of our goods down so that they compete in other markets. We have known since the year dot that we were a very tiny market in a very big world. We were tied in firstly, thanks to those opposite, to industries where our manuwere allowed to sell only in Australia or Australasia. The wonderful example of that was Ericsson. The great success story for the coalition was the establishment by Ericsson of a factory in Australia for telephony, for communication technology. That was a wonderful success story-until you discovered in 1983, as I did-absolutely amazingly-that Ericsson Australia was not allowed to sell into Asia. From my recollection, it was designed for Australasia and perhaps New Guinea. It was designed for a tiny market, a tiny volume, and therefore had a high unit cost. Any Ericsson equipment in Asia came from Sweden. It bypassed us, and that was basically the case right throughout our manufacturing sector. So the concept of a bounty was basically saying, 'Get domestic prices down.' If there are impediments to the cost of production, the idea of a bounty payment towards the cost of production is for assistance but, as with tariffs, it does not work forever. Eventually, industry in Australia has to be good, not the world's cheapest but the world's best. We are very good at selling the world's cheapest of everything. Whatever we sell in bulk, whether it be wheat, coal or iron ore, it is usually the world's cheapest. We sell on price. This country has some of the world's finest people, some of the world's cleverest people. Look at our ratio of inventions to population. We have a highly educated community with great intellect and great capacity. Why can't we be the world's best at things rather than the world's cheapest? So the bounty concept of getting domestic prices down makes a lot more sense than tariffs but if you take it away when industry is not ready to compete all you are going to do is wipe them out. I remember these arguments by economic rationalists about competition, which were before my time and now they are coming back with great strength. Let me tell you a story I picked up in 1983 from the then CEO of the MTIA, Bert Evans. When I first met him, Bert Evans said to me, 'The MTIA used to stand for the Metal Trades Industry Association, but now it should stand for the Metal Trades Importers Association because virtually all of our members are importers, and why wouldn't they? You just buy it and then you sell it. All the hassles of designing, developAustralia. ing, servicing, maintaining and guaranteeing are all gone. It is much easier just to buy it and then sell it. Why would our people want to make things?' The fact is Australians like making things, that is why, but the point he was making is a very valid one. We have become a nation of importers, yet as a country we have great engineers. We have some of the world's best engineering skills. How many Australian engineers are working around the world on great projects? Look at some of the great schemes like the Snowy Mountains scheme. Across the countryside you will find great examples of Australian creativity, ingenuity and engineering and manufacturing skills. Right now there is rolling stock going into Thailand which was designed in Cardiff, south of Newcastle, and part of it was built in America and part of it was built near Taree. We have great capacity. By all means, these bounties were due for review-of course they were-and the review was to assess what to do next. If you set things in place forever and a day, you are giving your industries the wrong message. What do we do next? Are we now competitive? Have we now built up to a stage where we can do it without the bounty or other measures? The answer is no, we are not ready yet. The industries have told us that very clearly. The government uses the argument that these were due for review and therefore they are going to be wiped out. That was never the case. The aim was always to have a sunset clause so industries and the government are actually working out how to keep those industries growing. It may well be that what we need to do next is look over intellectual property rights. It may well be that we need to look at research and development-I am sorry, you have already done that. That has been gutted. That is one of the areas that helped these industries grow. The R&D tax write-off has been one of the best things that has been done in 20 or 30 years, or since Black Jack MCEwen, because it gave incentives to people to put their intellectual resources in this country, to put their intellec.tual property into I must recount a fascinating meeting I had in the UK last year with one of their major negotiators on intellectual property matters. I was trying to point out to him that intellectual property is actually quite a dangerous concept, unless it is matched with fair trading provisions as well. He could not see the point because he was saying that England gets so much money in royalties from intellectual property and, therefore, we should all enforce these laws around the world. The point I was trying to make was that the people who own the property are actually mobile. I asked the gentleman what had happened to their shipping fleet because they once had the world's biggest commercial shipping fleet, a merchant navy. Where had it gone-to Liberia? He almost fell off his chair. It had never occurred to him that intellectual property was portable. The owners can move to where the lowest taxes are, and the fact is they will. At the moment, we would attract them to Australia because of the R&D tax write-offs. So that was one example of where bounties can be replaced by other measures. Depreciation is another but, of course, they are both business welfare, are they not? I have asked this question of Treasurers and Treasury for a long time now: when is business welfare neutral? What is the balance point with R&D, with depreciation? When do you say it is neutral? No-one ever seems to answer it, but here we have this new catch cry 'business welfare'. The fact is that, if this country is going to have a future in designing, manufacturing and exporting, we are going to have to learn to be a lot cleverer than we are now. If you come in and say that a budget deficit in the minuscule amounts that are involved here, in the seed money that has been taken away in these bounties, is a more important issue, very simply the people who are doing those things now will start importing or they will export the production. Why would they not? Why would they persist in an industry in this form when the government is so determined to undermine them? I am flabbergasted that those opposite, who seem to live by the motto on matters constitutional, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' walk into office and a lot of things that are working very well, and this is one of them. The message that has been given to industries in Newcastle and the Hunter is a very bad message. There are a number of people who raise with me the issue of R&D because I understand it. When we came into office in 1983 one of the great problems we had was the lack of investment in research and development. The lack of attention to quality, the lack of marketing skills and the problem with designs: those were the issues-and we tackled those issues front on. We said, 'These are national priorities. These are matters that should be resourced by the government of this country because our companies are too small to do it themselves.' And they had never been encouraged to. If you want to change the culture, you have to change it internally. These were culture changing issues. Well, you are changing it again-backwards. We have gone back 20 or 30 years and you wonder why people are worried. You wonder why people are apprehensive in business. The government says, 'It's okay, fellas. Don't worry because we are getting a big investment surge. That is terrific; look at the figures.' Well, let me tell you about that. In the resources area, exports increased by 128 per cent between 1982-83 and 1993-94. The number of people working in it reduced by 10 per cent. In other words, the more they invest, the less people work. That is great; the figures for investment are up, so let's all cheer. But where I come from, big investment does not necessarily mean jobs; it may actually mean fewer jobs. On the other hand, the export and manufacturing increases in the same period were 400 per cent. As for the old notion that we are going to have an investment led recovery that will help unemployment: I am sorry, the Treasurer is about 10 years out of date. We see the announcement this week by GMH that it is selling Holden engines to Korea. Who would have thought it possible? Back in 1983, we had just lost eight per cent of our work force in manufacturing-in one year. After that, who would have imagined it possible that little Australia would be exportbreak ing high technology engines to Korea and then to the world? How did it happen? Not by cutting things but by being proactive. The car plan was not an accident, it was thought through. What were the impediments? What was needed? What was the role for government? What was the role for the work force? What was the role for the companies? All of those issues were thought through and negotiated. It worked. As evidence, look at our components industry. Of course, I am delighted that last week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) announced his commitment to a freeze of those tariffs. Some of those people opposite now clearly understand the problem and have actually learned a bit about industry. But the problem is that the coalition do not come from manufacturing; their background is either law or finance. The current minister is a stockbroker. He knows about share trading. He sees companies as numbers on a bit of paper; he does not see them as places where people put their heart and their commitment. This legislation is bad because its message is bad. It is bad because the results will be bad. And it is bad because it displays absolute ignorance. You were out of office for 13 years. You left us with an absolute disaster in manufacturing. I can tell you that in Newcastle in 1981 and 1984 we lost thousands and thousands of jobs. Thank you very much, John Howard. You would not even come to a meeting. We could not even get a minister to come to Newcastle to talk to us about the problem. We had public meetings with thousands of people saying, 'What the hell is going on?' Where was the government? They would not even come. They referred us to the Industry Commission. And you know what they would have said? What they are saying now- 'This is not appropriate.' Their words were: ... no longer considered to be an appropriate cost effective means of industry assistance. We hear it again. I heard it in 1982. You have been out of office for 13 years and you have watched the revival of manufacturing. We have a long way to go but we are doing it. We are producing high quality, welldesigned products for world markets. We are now a sizeable country in a number of fields. What are you doing? You are saying, 'Sorry, felIas, they're not wanted any more.' It is not just that the bounty is being reduced; there is nothing to replace it. There is no industry program-nothing proactive. Just the chop. While they are doing that they are also doing it to a few other things as well, like R&D. It is not just the bounties that are important here: it is the whole mind-set. I can tell you that Treasury have always hated that R&D tax write-off. We used to get story after story of how it was a rort. But, I tell you what, it underpinned our development. I can recall some years back talking to the pharmaceutical industry about how on earth we would get pharmaceutical development in this country and how we would get research. We were exporting our research all the time. So we were trying to find ways to get it done here. Of course, that came with factor F, which is currently under consideration, and there were three or four components to it. The fact is that we went to the industry. We talked to the department. Treasury's view was, 'This is all business welfare. Forget it.' But look at the strength of our industry now. These things do work if you Â·think them through. The black and white of saying it is no longer appropriate or that the overriding objective is the budget deficit is such a hollow statement now given that, between August and January, the deficit blew out by $3 billion. And that is not right either. It is more than that because the growth from the budget will not occur. The deficit for this budget will be in excess of $3 billion-it will be closer to $4 billion or $5 billion more than projected at the last budget. Mind you, we may never know it because we will not have the figures in when the budget comes out in May. So we will have a budget in May based or on a 30 June finish. You watch the rubber come into those figures as it came in in January for the projection on growth. Where the Treasurer could fiddle, he did-and he will again. The fact is that we will not achieve last year's growth. The deficit will be much greater. In the meantime, industries are screaming and crying out for government to at least understand them. They want to be productive. They do not want to be mendicants hanging off the system; they want to be doing things. But they need to be understood. This legislation displays an absolute ignorance; and an ignorance of this nature by a government so new in office is reprehensible. It is an outrage to the country. In the months and years ahead it will come back to us over and over again. This is one of the examples of where they are so wrong. (Time expired)",73
118,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEE,"The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 should be rejected because of the hardship it is going to cause Australian industry, particularly those industries that have been assisted in order that they can look at expansion and innovation. We are living in times that require us to be smarter, more efficient and more original than ever before. We need to be able to experiment, expand, develop our products and ideas, to keep in touch with the new industries and new opportunities of the Asian market economies that are coming around us. What the Labor government did was to look at ways in which the government could assist and increase the capacities of a company to take risks and to be smarter. Whether through restructuring, addressing the market access issues or encouraging innovation and commercialisation across the industry sectors, the federal Labor government relied on industry to say how they could and would most efficiently be helped. Intervention varied. Some chose the leverage of government purchasing. Others preferred a bounty situation. Some looked at the research and development packages and there were a number of programs that offered advice, assistance and financial help for projects that were seen to produce more jobs and assist our export drive. The marketplace can no longer be relied upon to ensure that the best survive. The playing field is unequal. It is tilted this way and that, depending on how other countries support and subsidise their enterprises. If our industries are flung prematurely into this atmosphere, they may not survive or their export potential may not get off the ground. One company in my electorate is quite capable of competing around the world in the development of heavy machinery but, because so many obstacles are being stuck in its path, the owner is saying, 'Why should I bother? I can do enough business now to keep my own people employed and make a good living. Why should I train youngsters for other people and why should I export if it is going to be a hassle?' So what he has done is export the jobs offshore. He has sold designs and the rights to build to other companies all over the world. The stupidity of this in Australia is crazy. We have the ability, the young people seeking jobs and the innovation. But what do we do? Encourage other companies from around the world to obtain our ideas and our technology and build themselves jobs, thus increasing their export potential. This government has gone crazy to allow this sort of thing to happen and this bill just highlights Manufacturing must be an important part of our economy. How otherwise do we value add to our natural resource base. How do we encourage companies to create more jobs in our hard-pressed regions? How do we encourage new ideas to develop into fully grown iridustries in this highly competitive age in which we live? What we need is an industry policy to help grow our industry. All this is a mutual exchange between a government and industry that actively works within a country. Companies are just as dependent on the government as the government is dependent on the economy to be active. Government provides infrastructure such as roads, rail, communications and the social infrastructure for those who are employed in such enterprises, or facilitates that. Government's role is to assist where the marketplace cannot provide. Yet this Liberal government does not seem to understand this - the government of business. This particular bill cuts four industry bounties-ships, books, machine tools and robot bounties. It also includes the computer bounty but, for some reason, this is not until 1 July next year. Let us look at the ships bounty. In Tasmania, my home state, we have Incat, which currently employs 1,060 people, including 172 apprentices and 84 trainees. That was the figure at about Christmas 1996. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, often comes into the parliament at question time. When answering questions, he talks about his new apprenticeship schemes and how many apprenticeships he is going to create, et cetera-very short on detail. Here is an industry, Dr Kemp, that is already producing many apprentices with new skills in today's age. Welding aluminium is a new skill being utilised greatly at Incat in Hobart. But they need to be able to survive in the economic climate of competitiveness that applies in shipbuilding around the world. The management has said that, if the bounty goes, they will drop 10 per cent of the work force very quickly and, as the boats that have attracted the bounty are finished, they will shed more staff as they are not able to comit. pete successfully without the sort of bounty that this bill cuts out. Their competitors in other parts of the world still receive a bounty and assistance. The growth in traineeships and apprenticeships reflects the growth in this company because it has had a bounty to allow it to grow against its competitors throughout the world. When I was overseas recently looking at regional development, I was amazed to find so many countries with catamarans that were built in Tasmania. I saw the boats in Vancouver, Seattle, England, Gothenburg and Holland-to name just a few places. Sitting on the waterfront in Gothenburg, I saw three catamarans within the space of an hour running across to Denmark or Germany. I came back to Tasmania, and there is none operating in that state. Why should companies stay and be loyal to Australia if we treat them like this government is starting to treat them? Can you blame Incat for looking around the world for opportunities in other countries that look more favourably on industry development? I can tell you that the Swedes would have them like a shot! I understand that the member for Swan, Mr Don Randall, suggested some months ago that the Western Australian Liberals should cross the floor rather than allow an idiotic decision like this one to be implemented. I hope he stands up for the industries that he has on his side of the country and has something to say about that here. But it seems that he is not on the speakers' list for the debate on this very important bill, which will affect possibly his electorate but certainly his state. Tasmanian senators and members should do the same. It is stupid and short-sighted to think that Incat will remain in Tasmania because it is a nice place. They have to have some incentive to remain in Australia if the market forces threaten to take them away. The book bounty is being abolished. A lot of these bounties are directed to work forces in regional Australia, and those regional areas benefit greatly. In one such company at Maryborough in Victoria, 25 per cent of the local work force is dependent-either directly or indirectly-on the book production industry. Abolition of the bounty will undoubtedly put huge pressure on the company and it may have to close, sending all those jobs offshore. What will happen to this town in regional Australia when 25 per cent of the work force is thrown onto the dole queue? In the past 12 months the book production industry increased its exports by over 200 per cent. With the abolition of the bounty the work force employed in bountiable publishing will be cut by almost a third. As any businessman knows, one of the key requirements for long-term business investment is an atmosphere of certainty. By cutting the book bounty from this industry, which is where long-term orders are given, it is impossible to create that atmosphere of certainty. The government acted against these companies without having any understanding of how this industry operates. It is marvellous to see this industry competing against Asian countries in printing and publishing books and then putting them back onto the export market. Many years ago, before we got the bounties in order, we were certainly heading downhill. We would not have had any publishing taking place in Australia. The bounties have given an opportunity for many industries to grow to an extent where they can compete at a competitive level in the export trade. That is what the bounties were all about in the first place. The reason the Labor government organised them in the way that they have been operating was to give those companies the opportunity to reach a size where they become competitive on the world market. In the case of the book bounty, printing and publishing firms were operating on the clear understanding that the measure would be in place at least until the end of 1997. The decision to end it some 18 months earlier means that they have experienced difficulties with their budgets, their long-term planning and their long-term strategies. Another madness which is being perpetrated is in the Australian machine tools industry, which has become increasingly internationally competitive and is showing an encouraging increase in production of tools for export. Australian production of bountiable machine tools has increased from $95 million to $144 million, while exports have doubled over the same period. The Industry Commission, in its recent draft report on the machine tools and robotics industries, recommended that the bounty be retained until its agreed expiry date of 30 June this year. In scrapping the bounty in the budget last year, the government has once again shown that it commissions reports but then ignores them. It was a silly decision, a mad decision, which went against many of the industries which have been expanding because of the bounties they were receiving. They were expanding into exports and doing everything that Australia needs to happen. Australia needs companies that can expand and compete on the world market with countries that produce similar products. But they have to be of a certain size in order to make that critical leap. If an overseas company is receiving assistance from its own government to be competitive on the world market, then there is no reason why we should not be doing the same thing. We should be doing the same thing. It is very hard to come to grips with why this decision was made, other than to say that it was just through plain ignorance and not having an understanding of where Australian industry is today. I saw today in the Australian Financial Review that the Australian Shipbuilders Association has claimed a loss of exports totalling $275 million following last year's budget decision-$275 million export earning dollars lost to the country, let alone the number of jobs and the activities that come from them. The Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, Mr John Rothwell told the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, that Australian shipb-iIders are now at a huge disadvantage to then European competitors. What message does this send out to all our industry leaders? What response does the government have for industry leaders when they hear people saying that the government is responsible for making some Australian industries uncompetitive and that they are at a huge disadvantage to their European competitors? This government, through its actions, has caused this to occur. Mr Rothwell stated that he believed Australian shipbuilders must substantially complete construction of vessels by the end of 1997 in order to receive the bounty that is in Ie> lce now. The Europeans have given their shipbuilders three years from the contract date to the completion of the ship in order to - e-eive the .bounty whereas in this country if It IS not fInIshed by the end of 1997 there is no bounty. We are at a huge disadvantage to a competitor if that competitor is stilI receivAustralians ing a bounty-some sort of an assistancefrom their government and our government has r-moved that assistance from the industry. In hIS letter to the minister, Mr Rothwell stated: Minister, it takes 12 months to build a vessel of the car .ferry size, which are the majority of exported femes from Australia. What this means is that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build as-ip with the aid of the bounty, as it will not be possIble to complete the ship by the end of this calender year. That shows the stupidity of the government. This government has shown no initiative on industry policy. It brought this measure in in the last budget and pushed it through. Our industry spokesman, the member for Hotham, Mr Crean, has moved an amendment, which I will certainly be supporting, to try to put some logic into the government's thinking. I am also very pleased with the position the opposition has taken on tariffs in the car industry. Our recommendation and policy position is to keep a 15 per cent tariff until 2-0- and not accept the present Industry CommlsslOnlProductivity Commission recommendation .that it be cut to five per cent by 2004. I belIeve that is the right direction for us to go. This government should start to look at the way in which it is acting and at how it will need to act in the future on industry policy. There is no going back to building tariff walls around Australia. As a country we cannot afford to let other countries-our competitors-have an advantage. We should be able to compete on an even playing field. We should use our own tariff position as leverage to get them to bring down their tariff walls-which are all much bigger than oursin the future. I believe the amendment is well worth the government picking up. I am sure they will not do that. I think people out there understand that this government has failed industry with this bill. I am sure that the government is sending the wrong messages to industry. I support the amendment.",77
119,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"At this time of night, there are probably only a few listening to this broadcast. But I am certain that those in my own state of Tasmania have listened with great care to what the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) has said. My colleague the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) is now Deputy Speaker, so there are three Tasmanian Labor members in the House. There are no coalition members in the House. Mr Miles-I am here.",80
120,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"Mr Miles is here. He snuck by the side door. All Tasmanians, whatever their political colour, will be dismayed that number of important Tasmanian job creating industries are at risk as a result of this government's decision. There is nothing more brutal than the realisation that jobs in your own electorate may be lost. That is something that confronts me very directly in the case the Incat operation, which I see from my back window. . I live at Jepp Parade. I look across the water and on still nights sometimes I can hear that work plant operating. I am troubled by the fact that this government cares so little about the future of what is the one single bright light of my state in terms of new employment generated over the last 20 years that it will put at risk that operation. I do say that casually; I say quite deliberately that this government moved to make some shortthe term savings but with no thought as to the impact it would have on those who were not dependent upon the continuing operation of the bounty schemes and the job training schemes so that they could be competitive a very competitive and tight international market. Incat is a very good example. Incat grown from a small operation established by Bob Clifford, an entrepreneurial Tasmanianone of a very rare breed; Tasmania has not brought forward many home-grown entreprenot neurs. At the time when the bridge collapsed after it was struck in the mid-1970s, Bob Clifford, through a realisation that there must be a better way to cross water such as the Derwent than by the kind of ferries he was then operating, parlayed his business from operating ferries into a major international business. The greatest part of that growth been over the last 15 years, 13 of which were contemporary with the period in which Labor was in government at a national level. In that period of time, his operations have flourished against the stiffest international competition. His vessels have been sold overseas. They are marketed in a whole range of European and Asian environments where they are sold against locally produced products. How has that been able to happen? in How has be been able to put together that enterprise and to provide employment for so a many of the people who live and work in my electorate-and, of course, some who live in the electorate of the member for Lyons? He has been able to do it because there was a framework of industry policy in place which recognised that Australia needed to move of forward in certain value added areas; a policy that realised that without a framework that was designed to provide encouragement and a basic background of support those industries would not have got a foothold; and a policy wfiich realised that without an adequate appreciation of the international circumstances in which they operate they would be allowed to go to the wall. With the change of government we have not seen in place a government that would appear to be quite ready to see these operations go to wall. It is true that in reaction to some very strong representations from shipbuilders, only Mr Clifford but other shipbuilders in Australia who have been at the cutting edge of production, the government has made a in small backwards step by allowing the operation of the shipbuilding bounty to continue for a short time. But they did it in such a way as to present an apparent benefit without any has concession to the industrial realities. Mr Adams-It was a con.",81
121,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"Maybe it was a con that was intended to be so. But if it was not intended to be so it shows a complete misapprehension of the nature of the production process of large ocean-going catamarans. Those vessels are not dinghies that are put together in a week or two; they are vessels that require long lead times in production from time of order to being trialled and sold. has The reality is that with the short wind-down period that was provided it is highly improbable that Incat will be able to access the bounty in the manner in which it was intended. So if it was not a con-in the sense that it was not intended to be a fig leaf to retain budget savings whilst, at the same time, appearing to appease the pressure-it shows a dismal lack of understanding of the industry in which the shipbuilding bounty operates. The other blow to Incat flows from the way in which their training needs have been inadequately responded to. Incat is a company which really needed to develop a whole system of new skills and new training for those who would work in aluminium fabrication. There are few people in Australia with trade skills in aluminium fabrication. ly in my own state of Tasmania there were hardly any people who were fit to undertake the work required when Bob Clifford first started to move from smaller vessels to the large scale operation he now has. What he needed was a system which enabled him to put in place on-site training of people who would then be able to have a career in aluminium fabrication. He did it by accessing the training programs the federal government had put in place. For months after the election of this new government Bob Clifford was unable to get any answers about whether or not his arrangements for training and apprentices would be able to be sustained under the new arrangements that this government has announced. I do not believe he has an answer as yet. That is an extraordinary situation. There was high anxiety about his production facilityDr Kemp--He does have an answer. You should talk to him.",81
122,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"over a period of many months because the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) who is at the table and who seeks to interject failed to visit the site and give the necessary assurances and understandings in relation to the training needs of that company. So we have a complete demonstration of a lack of interest in the future of the most important new industrial operation that our state has generated. I am certain that Mr Clifford, were he here in this House and able to speak for himself, would express the contempt that he has expressed both publicly and privately about the attitude of this government. Why does he express that view? He expresses that view because in both instances not only was the policy wrong and in need of adjustment but also the manner of approach of the government and its ministers was lacking concern. The only reason changes occurred to the bounty and to other matters which have been the subject of debate is that the Labor representatives of Tasmania, concerned about the future of employment in their own state, made this into a political issue and the government was shamed into Certaintaking some action. Dr Kemp interjecting",82
123,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"As the minister at the table says, we did take political action. We took political action because those opposite performed economic vandalism against Tasmania. They were putting at risk those people whose employment depended on it. As to the matters that are most at issue in the community with respect to Labor's plans and the phase-out of tariffs, there are large employers in northern Tasmania who have responded very positively to Labor's announcement that it wishes to see action on behalf of other trading partners of Australia to match the downward 'movement of tariffs that we have committed ourselves to under the APEC arrangements. There is a real concern in the community that we have been played for mugs and will continue to be played for mugs if we are driven by ideologically motivated ministers who are not prepared to consider the employment impacts in regions of Australia. Coming from Tasmania, one does not have a great deal of hope when one is confronted by a national government that gives so little concern to the employment consequences of one's own state. It is very hard coming from a region which suffers the worse unemployment outcomes around Australia, the worse social welfare demographics of anywhere in Australia and the greatest number of aged and dependent pensioners of anywhere in Australia to find that where entrepreneurs do pick up the opportunities that exist and create niches that give some rays of light the national government does not nurture those but treats them as if they are expendable in the greater order of things. That was plainly the way that Mr Clifford was dealt with, plainly the way the executives of his company were dealt with and plainly the way those employed by that company were dealt with throughout the first months of this government. It was only the representations of people like Dick Adams and Harry Quick that put this issue on the table. Dr Kemp-Who?",82
124,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"If the minister wishes to be contemptuous of the Deputy Speaker in the chair, he may. But that is a matter for him. He is a rude and discourteous man who has shown no concern for people and their employment. His discourtesy now reflects the j nature of the man and the nature of the 'tpvemlllCn.....agovernment which has no concern for its employment outcomes. We hate a situation where Australian shipbuilders, after strong representations backed by the political action of the Australfor Ian Labor Party, and supported by the minor parties in the Senate and by Senator Harradine, have been able to force an unwilling government to face at least some of the realities that confronted us. But we face the situation where Australian shipbuilders will receive the bounty only for those vessels which are completed by 31 December this year. That means that there will be a signifiThey cant shortfall on budget line expectations that company-a significant shortfall. Mr Clifford may make good the threats that he made-though I do not think he is a threatening man; he is a businessman. He has no particular desire to export production facilities offshore when he can continue to operate them in Tasmania. I believe that he is a man genuinely committed with the best of his heart to continuing employment and having his operations in our state. There are more lucrative opportunities for him to invest overseas, but with the support of the industry policy that we had in place he was able to maintain his base in Tasmania and to contemplate expansion overseas at the same time. If he has now moved, as a result of these matters, to shift some of his existing production facilities offshore to the new expanded operations which he has committed himself to, then it will be on the heads of this government. It will be on the head of this minister at the table. The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) is sitting at the table quietly in association with the minister who was responsible for these misadventures in the training schemes, the inability to provide any information and the confusion and anxiety of the work force. If Mr Miles stands at the next election in the circumstance where Tasmanian jobs have been lost as a direct consequence of these measures, I am certain that he will have a little bit of explaining to do to his electorate. It will not be just a matter of what school his wife is at and those sorts of matters; there will be some very direct issues about people losing their jobs. It is put up or shut up time for those Tasmanian Liberals who for so long have put themselves about in the community as standing up for Tasmania. These people stand up Tasmania like a piece of spaghetti in boiling water: as soon as their feet go in, their knees go to jelly and their spine softens. It is about time they got a bit of spine-it is about time they grew one-to stand up to their own government. It is outrageous that when they go home to Tasmania they are heroes in the backyard. They are the king of the castle in Tasmania. go around the place touting themselves for as the great defenders of Tasmania's economic interests. But when they come here, they engage in complicity. They are part of a government which step by step, root and branch, is undoing so many of those infrastructure needs that are important for Tasmania. No other state has suffered as much as Tasmania has through the direct job losses flowing from reductions of Commonwealth public sector expenditure. No other state has suffered in that way. No other state has the same proportion of members of the coalition in the ministry and in the executive. They have been bought and sold by the economic rationalists of their side-signed up in blood with their preselections to go along with the process that is depriving Tasmania of employment opportunities for the future. Every one of the jobs of those Tasmanians who have been affected directly through cuts to Commonwealth employment, indirectly through cuts to government services and indirectly again through the failure to provide an appropriate industry base for ongoing employment in the private sector in Tasmania is on their hands. Is it surprising that there have been 5,000 Tasmanian job losses just in the last 12 months in a work force which already suffers the highest unemployment in Australia?

125,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE,"As the member for Lyons says, these problems are not peculiar to my own electorate in the south, although it has been deeply affected by those cuts.

128,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I wish to make a few remarks about the proposed government amendments to the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. Without going back through the substantive debate, there are a of an number of issues which have been raised in these amendments which require attention. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to those provisions in clause 60 which relate . to the changes the government has made so that funds which are deposited with banks on behalf of a third party are no longer required to be held on trust. I drew attention to this matter in my speech within on the second reading. I made the point that it seemed extraordinary that the government would be proposing a system which so undercuts the common law basis that exists whereby funds that are deposited on account of another person are dealt with under a trust arrangement. The law requires, in the absence of any other provision, that if, for example, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were to deposit my funds in a bank and to hold them on my account you would do so under what ,is called a resulting trust. In the ordinary course of this legislation, employers would deposit funds into RSAs, retirement savings accounts, for the benefit of their employees on the basis that that was the employees' money and, therefore, there would be a trust relationship and the management of those funds would have to be under proper trust arrangements. This bill sets that aside. So, for the first time ever, property held by a third party on behalf of another-funds that are not that person's-are not now to be held in trust. I understand regulations are proposed to govern how that money is to be held, but thus far we have not seen those regulations and we do not know what those regulations will provide. This is a very real concern to the many hundreds of thousands of workers who may find themselves in circumstances where their employers choose to make payments into an RSA rather than an alternative superannuation fund. Of course, in an ordinary superannuation fund there is a trust deed which governs the manner in which those funds are to be applied and the manner in which they are to be held in trust. If an employer uses this vehicle, then we find that there are no provisions relating to the holding of those funds and the requirements that normally flow as a trust obligation. They will be held simply as part of the ordinary deposits of a bank. That is not acceptable to the opposition. We find great reason to be concerned about this. There are very real reasons to be extremely concerned about the prudential arrangements that should be put in place. This is supposed to be a simple and fair system for the holding of funds-particularly small funds-but we have not been able to see the regulations and I believe that there are genuine issues with respect to the proposed alterations of clause 60. We do not believe that it is appropriate to allow an employer to open an RSA on behalf of an employee. But most importantly, if that is to be allowed, we do not believe that it is appropriate that it be not governed by a trust relationship. At least in the original bill, amounts in those accounts were to be held in trust by the financial institution until day cooling off period was over-when the employee would be notified and would be able to make an election as to where those funds would ultimately be placed. The money was intended to have precisely the same protection afforded to ordinary super money. Obviously the financial institutions, which have this government in the bag in relation to this measure, were concerned by this very reasonable proposition and have persuaded the government to change it. I do not understand why the institutions would object to holding other people's money on trust. The people concerned are not even aware that their money has been dealt with. (Extension of time granted) The people who are the subject of these arrangements will not even be aware that there are funds held to their account under the RSA system. Of course, that kind of blind investment made with another person's funds should always be the subject of a trust relationship. This is a very major change to the government's legislation. The opposition believes that the public is entitled to a full explanation of the need for these amendments and how the government arrived at the decision to put them forward. It is not possible to digest all the ramifications of this bill. The amendments have been brought forward at very late notice. The opposition notes that this bill, which is supposed to be simple and effective, is in fact complex and tendentious. It is hard to read; it is impossible to get over in the time that this parliament has been given to understand all the ins and outs of it. I said in my speech in the second reading debate that these funds should have large block letters lit up in lights stamped right on the front of those forms, 'Warning-this product is dangerous for your wealth.' I find it extraordinary now. I think it should also say, 'Warning-this pf0duct is so dangerous to your wealth you won't even know your funds have been used by others in circumstances where that investment has been made on your behalf.' Again we have a government discharging its electoral obligations to the banksrepaying its political debts-by setting up the the 14RSAs, which will be a cash cow for those financial institutions. They will not offer adequate rates of return. They are not a proper improvement to the superannuation scheme. They are a fringe addition to it which does not add to the general good. Most importantly, in these amendments we even see abrogation of the normal legal principle that applies right across the rest of the financial sector-that where you receive moneys on account of a third party, you must hold them in trust. We have very great concerns about this precedent. I am sure the legal and accounting professions would have similar grave concerns. We do not understand why the banks, with all their sophisticated administrative mechanisms, would not be able to offer the same kind of trust protection as other institutions offering super products. We are extremely angry' that this government has sought to descnbe the products that it is now advocating as convenient investment vehicles for small investors and for the aged as 'safe simple systems' when in fact they are unlikely to be of any economic benefit to those who will invest. They will be marketed ruthlessly by the banks. The new legislation does not even contain proper legislative protection for the trust arrangements that should be inherent in this.",85
129,Mr HOCKEY,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I am very grateful to the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for providing me with an op-ortunity to refute some of the hypocritical claims that have been made by the opposition. I want the members of the opposition to go out to the 45,000 unit holders in Estate Mortgage and tell them that the trust structures provided in that system-in Estate Mortg.age's case-were in fact hole proof. That IS what the opposition are telling us today. They are saying that a trust structure is infallible; that a trust structure ensures that you will never lose any money. I want them to go out to some of the sup.erannuation policy holders who have put theIr money into various superannuation accou-ts, not had capital guaranteed and paid exc-sslve. amounts of their money-their savmgs-mto fees and tell them that their capital investment is guaranteed. Go and tell the .unit holders in Estate Mortgage that their capItal was guaranteed because of the trust struc-ures set up under the Bums Philp trusteeshIp. It was under Bums Philp, who were mea-t to be reputable trustees, that the people who mvested their money in Estate Mortgage, who were meant at the time to be reputable too, - ere basically ripped off by a system that provIded no protection. - nde- the RSA accounts, what we are saymg IS that people will of course have prudential supervision of the RBA-<:ertainly in the case of the banks-and the various other prudential supervision bodies that cover the building societies and the credit unions. That prudential supervision is very important because there is one fundamental point that the opposition is failing to grasp. That is that at the end of the day we all know-and it may be disputed by Wallis when he comes down with his report in March-that there is an implied guarantee by the RBA of all the moneys placed on deposit in Australia. Thankfully, we have not seen a bank f! under in Australi- witho-t a. state or federal government standmg behmd It. That certainly has been the case-even with the Pyramid Building Society. Do you remember when your friends down in Victoria, the CainKir:ner government, actually shot to death an entIre economy through the mismanagement of the building society supervision practicesthe net result being that hundreds of thousan-s of investors in the Pyramid Building SocIety chain lost their investments? Only after we had that classic equivalent of a poll tax were the Victorian people able to save their savings or some semblance of them. Do you remember that? That was great prudential supervision at the time by a Labor government as well. And yet the Labor Party has the gall to come into this House and lecture us on whether a trust structure is a more appropriate for- of prudential supervision than simply havmg the RBA, an implied government guarantee, backing the investments in RSAs. The bottom line is that there is no infallible structure that is going to defend the savings of ordinary Australians. There is no legal structure that does not have its complications, no legal structure that is foolproof or, in the case of some of them, fraud proof. But what we can say is that with the benefit of RSAs we are going to provide investors and people who are out to save money with an optionthrough compulsory savings, through lodging their money with banks, building societies or credit unions. We are going to give them the option so that they do not have to pay the excessive fees, the entry and exit fees, that are so much a part of the excessive charges of superannuation funds in Australia. Superannuation fund managers have had a monopoly for far too long. All of a sudden they are going to get some competition and, whilst competition may be quite a foreign concept to some members of the opposition, it does provide great benefits, particularly when it comes to savings. It gives people the opportunity to protect their capital. And that is exactly what RSAs will provide: some form of protection through better prudential supervision by the RBA or whatever equivalent bodies Wallis may recommend and the government may adopt some time in the future.",87
130,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) must be smarting at his defeat at the hands of the former Attorney-General on the squash court this morning, because he has bounced in here and made some extraordinary statements which are just plainly wrong. Mr Crean interjecting",88
131,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"I was there. The only institutions that can currently receive superannuation investments are the industry funds-the superannuation funds. So what this new scheme will do is open up the provider of these services to the credit unions, to the building societies, to the life insurance companies or to whatever is called 'prescribed financial institutions'. They are the very institutions that the member for North Sydney says are vulnerable to collapse. It is not banks, it is the whole range of financial institutions, and they are now being given exemption from the normal trust arrangements that apply. The member for North Sydney was probably not in the House when the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) spoke and made the point about his own government's legislation that these so-called capital guaranteed funds are not absolute guaranteed funds. In the community there is a real sense of a misunderstanding. People believe that a capital guaranteed fund means that they cannot face loss if the fund collapses. That not true. These funds will be marketed as capital guaranteed but they are not absolutely guaranteed. I think that the confusion that has been advanced by the member for North Sydney suggesting that this is in some way a prudential improvement is a complete and utter nonsense. The truth is that if you were going to have a competitive investment environment you would say to the existing industry funds, 'You too can offer these RSA products.' But we are not having that; we are not having a level playing field. We are not allowing those funds which currently operate superannuation accounts and which have proper trust arrangements to offer protected safe investments. What we are havingbecause this government has a pathological hatred of the industry funds-is a repayment to the banks. They will be the main marketers of these products. They will be out there aggressively selling these products to people who ought to be able to make better long term investments than these kinds of low return accounts. And that is why I said in my speech that these should have big warnings on them-'These products are dangerous for your wealth' - because if you keep your funds in these products your long-term rate of return is about one-third of what it would be if you made a similar capital guaranteed investment in one of the range of prudentially sound superannuation funds. And there are capital guaranteedMr Hockey-There are some.",88
132,Mr KERR,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"The member for North Sydney just says, 'There are some.' So how do we advance the benefit of the ordinary consumer by putting onto the market a low return product which does not require the normal trust arrangements that the industry has hitherto taken as a norm? No wonder people are very concerned about what is being opened up. No wonder the Consumer Association of Australia has come out warning about the dangers of these schemes. No wonder everybody other than the self-congratulatory government and the banks that have fed it and are benefiting from this are saying, 'This is a lemon.'",88
133,Mr MILES,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary is Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.38 p.m.)-I want to pick up on one or two comments made tonight by the opposition spokesman, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), on amendments 15, 16 and 17. He has said that this legislation is 'dangerous for your wealth'. I point out that many of the people who are going to be putting their money in RSAs are the people who, under your government, put their money into schemes where the administration costs took away every cent they put in. A person came to me and told me that he had had put away by his employer about $47.10 into his superannuation fund. Two years later he came to me and he had not a cent left in that account. We have the opposition spokesman coming in here and saying that everything they did in regard to the superannuation system was guaranteed. Under your government, it was guaranteed to fail for the ordinary battlers out there in Australia. That is why RSAs will be very beneficial to thousands of Australians.

139,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"by leave-I will be brief. An additional amendment-it is in two parts-has been circulated. The first part was originally moved by the opposition when this bill was last before the House. It says: ... whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House (I) rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of a view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill. Since that time, because of our effective campaigning and hopefully some of the eloquence in this chamber, the government has seen fit to amend its original position and to restore some of Labor's bounty commitments that they had promised to meet but then reneged on. They broke that promise in the last budget. We campaigned to have those decisions overturned and the government went some way to overturning those decisions, but it has not gone far enough. We will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage of the bill. But, because this aspect of the ships bounty goes to the issue of requiring, if it were to be passed, additional appropriations, this amendment has to be moved as a second reading amendment. So the second part of the amendment which I am about to move by leave-because I have already spoken in this debate-states: ... the House (2) calls on the Government to keep the ships bounty in place until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement comes into force, recognising that arrangements entered into by Australian shipbuilders prior to the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement coming into force should be subject to the same transitional benefits as allowed for overseas shipbuilders under the agreement. The proposition that Labor had in place was for the ships bounty to remain in place until the middle of this year. That commitment was abolished in the budget of last year but reinstated and extended to the end of this year, 1997. In discussions with the industry and in a press release that was issued accompanying this announcement, the government indicated that this commitment put the Australian shipbuilding industry on the same footing as its overseas counterparts. It does not do that, because under the Australian requirement a vessel needs to be completed by the end of this year whereas, in the case of the competitor nations with whom we operate, all that is required is for the contract to have been entered into before the end of the ship bounty period and then the ability to complete the vessel three years thereafter. It is that ability to complete and the time period that is out of sync. It is the reason we are moving this amendment at the second reading stage. Obviously, we will take the opportunity in the consideration in detail stage to go to this, but I do say that not only has the government not restored that which Labor had in place but also we believe it has dishonoured an agreement it entered into with the industry and, indeed, negotiated through the Senate to get its R&D cuts through. We believe it has reneged on that agreement and it is our intention to hold it accountable to the original commitment. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the BiII a second reading, the House (1) rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill; and (2) calls on the Government to keep the ships bounty in place until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement comes into force, recognising that arrangements entered into by Australian shipbuilders prior to the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement coming into force should be subject to the same transitional benefits as allowed for overseas shipbuilders under the agreement"". We will be seeking to pursue the interests of the shipbuilding industry and Australian jobs and the ability for this industry to grow. I know is very important to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, because the catamaran operator down in Hobart is the largest single private employer in the whole of south Australia. If the ships bounty goes, effectively, that largest employer goes. I do not think anyone should underestimate the impact of this government's broken promise in the last budget. We are on the side of regional development and jobs and the shipbuilding industry continuing to flourish, and for that reason we move this additional amendment. It is our argument that what the government has brought back to this place does not go far enough and we want it to go the full extent possible.",92
140,Mr JENKINS,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I have pleasure in rising tonight in support of the amended amendment of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and in support of the sentiments that are contained in that amendment in so far as they outline the opposition's position in relation to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. The debate on this bill goes on at a time when within the coalition government's ranks there is much debate about industry policy and what it really means. Regrettably, because of the ideological bent of the coalition, industry policy is very much a hands-off phenomenon. I remind those that sit opposite that, when we talk of industry policy, we are really talking about a jobs policy-industry policy as part of a jobs policy. When the opposition comes before the House with suggestions about legislation, suggestions about the way forward in industry policy, it is our real interest and desire to be involved in the creation of policies that will lead to sustainable jobs that is important. We often hear that phrase 'real jobs' in this chamber. I am not in particular having a go at the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table. He has often used that terminology, but what does he really mean? A discussion about that should be held and is important. As I have said in earlier debates in this place, it is the nature of those jobs that can be sustained not only for this generation but in generational terms that is important rather than using the terminology as a cheap debating point. Within the policies that we discuss in this place, there should be a growing realisation that we are protecting Australian jobs. In protecting Australian jobs, the opposition says we should ensure that we know what our trading partners are doing and that, if they are not moving towards a notion of free trade, we should travel slowly in the changes that are being made because too often, whilst we use the terminology 'free trade', we ignore the fact that we should really be talking about fair trade. The piece of legislation that is before us, which is in its exact form before even the government moves its amendments in the consideration in detail stage, arises out of measures that were announced in the budget last August. One might term them catastrophic announcements. These announcements were made not as part of what should have been a considered approach within an industry policy; they were announced in the guise of the overall fiscal consolidation targets of the budget. Of course, it is with some pleasure that we can now enter into the debate, as it has been resumed some three months later, knowing that there will be some partial reversal of the initial decision. After considerable pressure from the opposition and from industry groups, there will be adjustments made to decisions as they relate to the book and ship bounties. We should not forget that, in the case of the computer, machine tools and robotic industries, there will be no relief in this amended bill. As my colleagues on this side of the House have said, while there has been an extension to the book and ship bounties-and they will ultimately disappear-without international agreements in place, those industries cannot feel secure within Australia. The treatment that has been dealt to the industries that rely on bounties is very typical of the government's approach. The government has no industry policy and no vision for industry. It creates a large amount of indecision and uncertainty in the industries concerned. As I said earlier, basically the real problem is that the government does not believe it has a role in intervening in the economy to create a supportive network and framework of assistance. It is really prepared to allow innovative and export focused industries to suffer. The government's original decision just simply as an aspect of its physical consolidation and then the subsequent backflips are indicative of this slaphappy attitude. The minister responsible for industry policy, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), the honourable member for Ryan, is quoted as saying that even the village galah is calling for industry policy and went on to say that industry policy can mean a lot of things. Certainly I do not think the Australian people, when they elected the Howard government, would have thought they would have the village galah appointed as the minister. But that may be a little unfair because, as we read in the paper, the minister and his department mayor may not be involved in trying to ensure that industry knows the ministers within cabinet who need to be targeted and the types of lobbying tactics they might undertake. Unfortunately, despite the backflips that will be part of the amendments made in the consideration in detail stage by the government, the government still wishes to terminate the book bounty some six months prior to the original expiry date at the end of 1997. The effect of this measure could potentially be devastating. Part of the rationale for abolishing the book bounty is based on the premise that printing has changed over the years and that the book bounty is no longer appropriate. If we look at the levels of the book bounty over time, the bounty has been as high as 33% per cent of printing costs and fell to 25 per cent in 1985-86. The bounty stood last year at 7.2 per cent and fell to 4V2 per cent of printing costs on 1 January. These quite drastic drops in the level of bounty paid would indicate that nobody should be in the position to claim that the book bounty has not been amended along the way to reflect the modem realities of book printing or, indeed, that the printing industry has been unresponsive to productivity changes. As reported in the Financial Review last Friday, the Australian Publishers Association believes that the government's decision to abolish the book bounty will actually cost the budget some $28.6 million over the next 12 months rather than be a saving of $4.1 million. This is due to the lower tax revenue from the industry and the higher costs of resultant unemployment. This is a classic example of a false economy and of the government's narrow economic cost to budget view of industry assistance. What is the relatively minor cost to budget of the bounty as opposed to the cost to budget of increased unemployment, loss of tax revenue and damage to the balance of payments? Australian publishers spend around $210 million printing books. About two-thirds of that amount is spent here in Australia. If this level of investment is to continue, there needs to be a form of government intervention to maintain it; to ensure investment in this industry. If we tum to the shipbuilding industry, the bounty of five per cent of the contract cost of vessels began at 15 per cent in 1991. The Bureau of Industry Economics found that it had helped to transform Australian shipbuilding into an export oriented industry. The postbudget amendment by the minister and the government will extend the ship bounty by six months until December. The press release jointly released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism said: The extension of the shipbuilding bounty to 31 December 1997 aligns assistance for the Australian shipbuilding industry with key overseas competitors. It goes on to say: In the interim, Australia will closely monitor progress towards implementation of the OECD shipbuilding agreement. The OECD agreement for the elimination of shipbuilding subsidies was to come into effect on 1 July this year, but not all signatories have ratified it at this stage. For example, the United States has yet to ratify it. Yet the amendments proposed by the government to their own bill make no commitment to extend the ship bounty if the agreement is not ratified. The shipbuilding industry requires, amongst other things, this certainty. It is not good enough to say that the support framework.is going to be t-n away and there may orlmay not be an OECD agreement in place w1lJ<;b ;,can )relp the industry. The government's' equivocation on this issue-as on so many others-is creating uncertainty for the industry. The ship bounty needs to be extended until such time as there is international agreement about the level of government assistance. Therefore, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has amended his original second reading amendment to include the following paragraph, which reads: calls on the Government to keep the ships bounty in place until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement comes into force, recognising that arrangements entered into by Australian shipbuilders prior OECD Shipbuilding Agreement coming into force should be subject to the same transitional benefits as allowed for overseas shipbuilders under the agreement As a consequence of the joint release of the Treasurer and the minister for industry of 16 December, the Australian Shipbuilders Association has indicated that the government has failed to address the issue correctly and the industry faces turmoil and a very uncertain future once again. A news release by the AS A-the Australian Shipbuilders Association-states: In a revised and still yet to be ratified OECD agreement, contracts signed by European shipyards before 31 December 1997 will continue to receive subsidies of between 9 and 25% on vessels completed within three years. Australia's 5% subsidy only applies to ships that are completed by 31 December 1997, which results in subsidy removal up to three years ahead of the OECD agreement. As the association says, because of the lead times in entering into contracts and in planning these things, shipbuilders need a degree of certainty not later on-after we find out whether countries are going to ratify the agreement-but now. That is what they are seeking. If one thinks that the ASA is some form of uncooperative industry lobby which does not consider these things carefully, I am reminded of the May 1992 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, entitled The shipbuilding industry: in the wake of the bounty. I want to quote a couple of things from that report, because they are important. The evidence from a north Queensland shipbuilding firm quoted in that report is still appropriate to the situation that the industry finds itself in today. Representatives of the firm said: The almost hackneyed phrase 'the level playing field' does not apply in the international new ships market. Our company does not have a philosophical problem with the phasing out of bounty; however, doing so is most unwise, unless competitor nations are doing the same things at the same time. That is the basis of what the opposition is trying to put to the government. This is the important thing: until we have the type of certainty-that there really is a level playing to the field-which those countries from which competitors to the players in the industries in question in this bill have, we should be making these changes much more slowly. The following comment was made to the inquiry at that stage by the ASA: . . . the industry generally supports the planned reduction in the Bounty provision. Back then, this industry thought-under the various discussions that were happening under the aegis of the then GATT-that this notion of fair trade really would reveal itself as being fair trade. In the intervening five years, that has not been the case. If an association can at this stage still be cautioning and voicing real concerns on behalf of its industry about this direction, we should be taking what they are saying into account. It has been suggested that when the ship bounty is terminated European shipbuilding competitors will be receiving a subsidy of around nine cent. The effect that the government's proposals would have on the Australian shipbuilding industry would be most destructive. Shortly after the budget announcement, major players in the industry like Austal, Incat-which the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) mentioned earlier-and Wavemaster indicated that they might have to consider relocating a sizeable portion of their operations overseas. When successful Australian companies are moved to have to make those sorts of assertions, the alarm bells should be ringing in the ministerial wing about what direction the government's policies should take. Australia has found a niche market for the construction and export of high-speed aluminium catamaran ferries. This industry deserves to be supported. The debate on bounties must be understood in the context of a much wider debate about the need for government intervention. Bounties are only one of the policy tools available to government to set the right environment for industry. Whether it be bounties, tariffs or taxation concessions, the government continues to let industry down and continues to cause confusion. With each policy tool, the government has demonstrated that it does not accept that it-the government-has a role in creating a supportive environment for manufacturing industry in this country. Last week the opposition announced its policy with regard to supporting the automotive and automotive components industries in Australia. The opposition's six-point plan for this sector stands in stark contrast to the government's unwillingness to support a vital manufacturing sector. In return for the creation of the favourable environment, the industry will be required to commit itself to firm targets on exports, investment and employment. The opposition's plan is an example of what role governments can play in partnership with industry. The government creates the appropriate conditions for the our industry to develop and the industry is restill quired to reciprocate. per The role of taxation concessions can be important for assistance to industry and also to promote a wider social objective. That was part of the rationale behind the taxation concessions for research and development. While Australia traditionally has had relatively good levels of publicly funded research and development, it has had low levels of private sector funded R&D. The introduction of the 150 per cent taxation concession and syndication arrangements by the previous Labor government were designed to lift Australia's performance in this area. They were successful in helping to raise business funded R&D from 0.24 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1991, but this government will fail to take this into consideration when it enacts this legislation to cut the concessions down to 125 per cent at a time when Malaysia is offering 200 per cent concessions. I note that, in an interview with the Financial Review, the minister indicates that this is perhaps one of the areas that government should be supporting and looking at. But the government's attitude and the way that they have looked at tax concessions on R&D is to take a sledgehammer to a very small problem when they try to whip up political credo in what they are doing by saying that there are rorts. The role of government here is to set a priority, to say that a particular outcome is worthwhile and that expenditure on achieving that outcome will be rewarded. (Time expired)  pleased to speak on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and, in particular, to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) that: ... whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House (1) rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill; and (2) calls on the Government to keep the ships bounty in place until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement comes into force, recognising that arrangements entered into by Australian shipbuilders prior to the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement coming into force should be subject to the same transitional benefits as allowed for overseas shipbuilders under the agreement. It is of most interest to ordinary Australians that the matter that the House dealt with prior to dealing with the bounty legislation was retirement savings accounts. You need to put the whole view of this government into context. The principal benefit of RSAs is to reward Australian bankers who, so much during the 1980s and early 1990s, terrorised small and medium sized business. Of course, it guarantees the working men and women of Australia of a minimal return towards their retirement income package. In fact, it rewards the very same banks that have had a distinguished failure to develop Australian industry.",93
141,Mr SLIPPER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Distinguished?  ing. In fact, you are worsening it. You are rewarding them, you are paying them off, by implementing this retirement savings",97
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl}-The member for Chifley will ignore the interjection by the member for Fisher.  happy to, but you will understand that I was provoked by an interjection. I think it is important to place on record that the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) is quite happy to reward the Australian banks, the very same banks that feel they are doing poorly if they do not earn $1 or $2 billion, the very same banks that are screwing Mr and Mrs Average Australian with a whole raft of fees and charges that are actually unheard of. But my complaint is that there is no vision about Australian industry, and that is significant in this Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The government does not seek to argue that they did a review of how the various industries are performing-that is, the shipbuilding industry, the computer industry, the book industry, the robotics industry-and to say that, as a result of these reviews, as a result of talking to the industry, as a result of trying to understand where they would like to position these industries into the next century, that these measures are necessary. What they have really done is to say that they had an urgent business task and these were easy targets in terms of reducing expenditure. Ordinary Australians are going to be dismayed when they understand that the impact of this bill will be to diminish Australian employment opportunities not only for the workers currently employed in these industries but also for the future employment prospects of their children and their grandchildren. I think they are going to be absolutely dismayed at that. Quite rightly, the opposition is moving that the bill be entitled the 'Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill'. I must say that, when I was chairman of the employment, education and training committee, we had a reference and we visited Incat in Tasmania. If there is anything that government members coming from Tasmania ought to be proud of, it ought to be the success of that firm. Incat produces Australian designed ferry cats and has pioneered the use of aluminium in the construction of the ferries. It has also developed in-house training for workers. They have taken on a whole variety of people who had no experience in ship building and trained them there on-site to produce world competitive ferries. I would have thought that government members from Tasmania would be very proud of this Tasmanian industry. Given the state of unemployment in Tasmania, I would have thought they would want to see Tasmania able to fully exploit whatever production facilities, whatever employment facilities and whatever export facilities were available. And of course they are not. Government members often talk about a level playing field, but the impact of this bill with the reduction of the ships bounty is going to put those Tasmanian workers at a distinct disadvantage in the export field. It is almost as though the government wants to punish one of the most successful companies in Tasmania for being successful. Frankly, I think all Tasmanians ought to be concerned about the cavalier indifference that the government is displaying towards workers in this industry and towards the prospect for growth that this industry and this company had for Tasmanians. We may say that we ought to shipbuilding just in its commercial activities. I have an interest in defence matters. It is case that Australia has a significant shipbuildWe ing capability for defence. Defence is always wanting to shift some of that production into the commercial sector, but that is not always possible. My understanding is that, to achieve self reliance in the defence of Australia, we were supposed to look at what sort of capability we needed to have. This continent is the largest island. We have an enormous shore line. You usually have to go by ship to get to another country. I would have thought that, from defence point of view, it is critical to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable shiptogether. building capability in country. If you are interested in exports, if you are not interested in the jobs and the potential for jobs in shipbuilding industry, then surely you will accept that keeping the commercial sector export oriented is critically important to defence of this country. But of course there is nothing about that mentioned in the legislawas tion. I just want to make the point that European and other overseas shipbuilders will continue to receive bounties of between nine per and 25 per cent for at least another three years. It will be most interesting to hear minister sum up and explain this level playing field where Australian producers are expected to be able to compete, when other countries are getting much more in subsidies than our own Australian companies. Alternatively, the government may also wish to comment about where the performties ance has been lacking in our commercial ship building industry. Is it disappointed at phenomenal rate at which exports have growth, developed over the years? These that the shipbuilding industry has performed particularly well: production has increased by some 200 per cent, exports by some 150 per cent and employment levels by 50 per cent. Does the department or does the minister find this performance disappointing? Is this why commercial shipbuilding and Australian jobs are going to be cut? If he does, what is his nominated figure and where does he see the look at industry going in the future? We know what the shipbuilding industry is the like today; we know what its record has been. on the Labor side think the performance of the industry has been outstanding. Could the minister please tell us where he believes it will be in five years time and 10 years time, and could he tell us how many Australians he thinks will not have an opportunity to find employment in the shipbuilding industry. Under the legislation, the computer bounty is also going to be attacked. In the previous government I had a little bit to do with the communications industry plan. It is a truism a that the computer industry and the communications industry are coming closer and closer What did we try to do under Labor? not Under Minister Button we developed the partnership program. The idea was that we the would be able to specify or negotiate with individual companies what their export performance would be, what their level of R&D the would be and what their production would be. I want to be quite frank with the House. I critical of the partnership program because it was done between individual companies and it was secret. I always had the feeling that we could push the industry even cent further. But it has been a success. When you start hacking away at the comthe puter bounty, you are saying that the very small presence we have in Australia will be even smaller. The computer industry, the communications industry, is amongst the fastest growing of any industries in Australia. So you are really saying to young Australians, 'You will not get the employment opportunior the career you may have envisaged in this rapidly growing industry. In every other the country it is providing higher employment but Australia is not going to be part figures show of the action.' The cutting of this bounty has nothing to do with talking to the industry. It has nothing to do with the vision about where you want to position this industry into the next century. It is all about slashing and hacking at public expenditure just to fix the bottom line. I am sure that government members-although none of them are actually participating in the debate-might have a view that this is very worthwhile and necessary in the short term. In industry policy terms, we should be concerned about the short term but we should really be fixated on the medium and longer term. This is where these actions are so damaging. You are getting into some real conundrums. If you do not produce components, then you are dependent on overseas countries for importing them and if there is a shortage you run into delays. Admittedly, we have not had a components industry. Why, I am not sure. I certainly believe it is possible for us to specialise and develop our own chip industry. I think it is important that we do because computer chips are in a whole variety of products now that were never envisaged, but we do not have that capacity. Other countries have seen it as a priority to develop that industry and ensure it is viable. I could give you quite a number of examples of that. We do not have that. With computers, this will make us even more reliant on imports, more beholden to them, and will make us compete with other customers when we want to import them. What we will find in the future is that there will be a time when we want to import them but there will be a shortage, supply lines will lengthen out and the components will be critical in the development of other products-and we will suffer. I should say that as a result of partnerships for the development program, the computer bounty for the information industry, exports trebled in the last five years. I do not believe that anyone on this side of the House is saying that we have reached the full potential of the industry. I would be interested to hear whether the minister believes that we have reached the full potential, that it is a mature industry and that we need to now shrink it back and look at some other industry. I am sure the departmental advisers in the House would not want to propound that particular point of view. We certainly feel that there is a real difference between the opposition and the government in relation to industry policy. It is not about being prescriptive about every industry but, as the name of the partnership for development program suggests, it is really about governments trying to understand, talking to industry, seeing what stage they are at and trying to develop and intervene if necessaryas we did with the partnership for development program-to ensure that we are optimising what opportunities there are in Australia. We are no longer the lucky country. Every industry that we truncate and every industry established in this country that we allow to go out of business, we will not be able to reproduce somehow in the future or bring back. If you miss the opportunities-and this is what is so devastating about this export of Australian jobs-they will be gone forever. It really gets down to asking, 'What size do you think our manufacturing industry should be? Are you as a government really so unhappy that it represents only 16 per cent? Do you want to take it down to 10 per cent? If you do want to take it down to 10 per cent, what does that mean for working Australians? What does that mean for the young and future workers of this country?' Because by taking actions today, you are denying them jobs in the future. You can develop industry programs-and these bounties often involve financial assistance-but not every industry program means that a government has to be involved in government expenditure. It can often, for example, be in partnership with an industry. As the partnership program did, it can insist upon a certain legal of exports, insist on a certain level of research and development and insist on a certain level of production. Not every industry will require the same prescription. The opposition, when in government, had a record of working with industry. Some of us might say we did not go far enough, but we had the record. Whether it was the car plan, whether it was plastics, whether it was in communications, whether it was in information technology or whether it was in defence industry, we had that record. We are committed in opposition to ensure that we are concerned about developing more jobs for Australians and developing more jobs in the future for young people. We will be developing a rigorous partnership approach with industry and with workers to ensure that each and every sector we have optimises its potential for exports and for job growth. Debate interrupted. NA",97
143,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 and p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Gambling  p.m.)-On 14 December 1996 at 3.10 a.m. I addressed the House on what I saw as the enormous damage being done to Australian families by gambling and the government promotion of gambling throughout Australia. I sheeted that home to the action of state governments and state agencies. I am pleased that since that time there has been quite a deal of discussion about gambling but it has been an argument about the revenue and gets the revenue. What I want to see is action to reduce the encouragement of gambling. The point I made was that there is government promotion of gambling, not just gambling. There are a number of aspects to look at this. One is what I see as the extremely taxation dangerous environment that involves the sale of liquor, automatic telling machines, EFTPOS, and gambling machines. We in this chamber know that someone who is halfis charged, has their credit card with them and an ATM machine beside them is not the greatest judge of their wisdom and performAustralian ance. Will they know when to go home? People are weakened and susceptible. that combination is a direct ambush for Australian families, those who are home while the pay packet is being put down the poker machine or whatever gaming device it is. It ill becomes governments of whatever political complexion to be lecturing the rest of the community about good social behaviour, good conscience and a good approach to one's responsibilities when those kinds traps are set. I am told it is about convenience for people who frequent casinos and that kind of thing. I want to say in this parliament-and I hope I can encourage some support from around the chamber-that these kinds of practices have to stop. I now tum to the promotion and advertisement of gambling. I am sure some of you have seen in New South Wales that glorious, exciting advertisement on television for Lotto; how it all finishes up with the car and the beach and the beautiful scenes and the travel abroad-and a ticket to freedom if you buy your Lotto ticket. But it is not a ticket to freedom; it is a ticket to misery. Mr Hardgrave-What about the losers?  losers because it is encouraging the mugs, it is treating people as if they are mugs. I will not go through the odds; I went through them in my speech of 14 December. But when you go back and calculate the odds, you see it is millions to one. I think the best odds you can get are about 4V2 million to one. That is your chance of winning. So I hope that out of this who chamber we can do something about it. Today I looked through the figures that came out from the Australian Grants Commission. These just make me all the more appalled. When you look at the 1995-96 state own-source revenue, you see that across in Australia the government take in gambling is $3,414,228 million. If you translate that across to a per capita basis what you see or is that in New South Wales the take from gambling per capita is $200.46, in Victoria it $240, in Queensland it is $149, in Western Australia it is $129.74, in South Australia it is $163.79, in Tasmania it is $115, in the Capital Territory it is $172.14 and in the Northern Territory it is $132.11. In I think each case that is per annum. The message to drive home is that in New South Wales the per capita take per annum from gambling taxation runs second only to payroll tax. It is the second highest source of revenue per capita in state taxation to payroll taxes. In Victoria it is also second-$214 to $451. In Queensland it runs third, in Western Australia it runs third and in South Australia of it is the second highest per capita charge across all forms of state revenue. I want to see state governments out there telling people what their odds are when they are advertising these takes, when they are trying to con people into starving their families and wasting family income, tell them what the state government take is and also publish what the odds are so we are not encouraging gullible people into squandering family income and bringing suffering and devastation upon their families. I seek the support of the chamber for that. University Scholarships for Singaporean Students",100
144,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to advocate the establishment of a scholarship scheme whereby elite Singaporean students, in effect the future leaders of that nation, could be encouraged to study in Australia, thereby building the important linkages which will benefit our bilateral relationship. Australian university graduates fiUÂ· prominent positions in the government, civil service, military and business in Singapore. The link provided by these Australian alumni forms an important plank in the bilateral relationship. Among the more than 30,000 graduates of Australian educational institutions in Singapore are the President, Mr Ong, and his wife, the Deputy Prime Minister, three other cabinet ministers, a senior parliamentary secretary, Deputy Speaker of parliament and two permanent heads of government departments. In the private sector there are numerous Australian educated CEOs and general managers. This heavy penetration of the Singapore establishment has been of invaluable benefit to Australia over the years and remains so. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will address leading alumni during his forthcoming visit to Singapore. The large number of Australian alumni in Singapore has built a strong mutual understanding between our two societies, allowing for problems in the relationship to be handled more easily. The restrained Singaporean reaction to the recent debate generated by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is a good example of this phenomenon. Almost all of the prominent Australian alumni in Singapore were scholarship students, the majority being Colombo Plan scholarship recipients. These students are among the best and brightest in Singapore and many of them have gone on to fill senior positions in the public and private sectors in that country. The Colombo Plan scholarship program has now ceased for Singapore and with the rapid growth of the wealth of Singapore, Singaporean students are no longer eligible for other Australian scholarships such as ASTAS or ADCOS. In spite of this the numbers of Singapore students studying in Australia have continued to grow. The difference is that the vast number of these students are fully self-funded and instead of being the scholarly elite of Singapore they are not in this category. They are the future accountants and chemical engineers of Singapore, not aspirants to the Singapore political elite. Singapore society operates on an academic and meritocratic basis and young people are selected for public office on the basis of their academic achievements. In the case of the ruling PAP government, almost all of their MPs and every single minister in cabinet has a record of high academic achievement. They were approached by the PAP to form the government and did not work their way up through the party ranks. In fact, it is more akin to corporate the head-hunting for the brightest and best. Given this controlled and meritocratic basis of Singapore's political and bureaucratic systems, the vast majority of Australian graduates in Singapore are unlikely to fill the upper echelons of the PAP system of government in the future like their Colombo Plan Scholarship fellow Australian alumni did a generation ago. The simple fact is that the top Singaporean students, in the absence of an elite Australian scholarship, will take their Singaporean, US or UK scholarships in America or Britain. This has been considered at length. The major conclusion reached, which has been backed up by authoritative advice from various Singaporean sources, is that if Australia wishes to attract the future leaders of Singapore to Australia as students, the Australian government will need to institute a prestigious merit based scholarship scheme to offer some of Singapore's top students undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships to Australia's most prLStigious and internationally respected universities. The value of such a scheme is manifest and essential to Australia's future diplomatic and economic plans in Singapore and the region. Other countries have already recognised this. The British have instituted the Raffles Scholarship for 10 or 11 top Singaporean students annually who are likely to reach high levels in government or the private sector to go to the UK for a postgraduate degree. In the selection guidelines for the scholarship, the British government has specifically said that candidates who are likely to be of influence in the future and would be useful to Britain should be given priority in selection. Academic excellence is the other major criteria for selection. The scholarships are a mixture of full cost and tuition only scholarships. The US has allocated seven postgraduate Fullbright Scholarships to Singapore. According to the US embassy in Singapore, the prospects in government of an applicant is a major selection factor. The Americans want to catch rising stars and future leaders. The American embassy is claiming success with four of the six new cabinet ministers over the past five years being former Fullbright Scholarship winners. The ideal scholarship scheme would offer five to 10 full-fee scholarships plus stipend to Singapore citizens to study at the best universities in Australia. The scholarships and bursaries should be open to students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels across the sciences, humanities and engineering disciplines. Selection should be based on the academic and intellectual achievements of the applicant as well as a judgment of the likely future position and influence of the applicant. As with the US and UK scholarships, selection of the students should be carried out by our nation's diplomatic representatives. In keeping with Singapore practice, save for the above mentioned judgment of future influence, the scholarship should be based solely on academic merit and there should not be any quotas based on gender or race. Such quotas are likely to undermine the value of the scholarships in most Singaporeans' eyes. The scholarships could be termed the Australian Prime Minister's scholarships, the Menzies' scholarships or maybe the R.G. Casey scholarships. I anticipate that a scholarship would cost between $22,000 and $29,000 per annum. That is $66,000 to $87,000 for an undergraduate degree. The total costing for 10 scholarships would be $250,000 per annum-peanuts when you look at it. It is really important that we do this. (Time expired) Working Class Poor",101
145,Ms HANSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise here tonight to bring to the attention of the House an issue that every Australian should get very angry about and an issue that this offered government should be addressing as its highest priority. Last week the Ipswich Regional Family Resource Centre in my electorate released a discussion paper that should be a document of shame for the governments, both previous and current, of Australia. Titled 'Australia's Working Class Poor', this discussion paper concerns itself with the plight of that group of people who once made this nation great-those Australians we all know as Aussie battlers-but who now by circumstances and through no fault of their own are emerging as a new social phenomenon known as the working class poor. These are the people who have strived to remain self-sufficient and in work and able to pay their way in society, despite the contrived machinations of governments in their headlong flight down the totally unworkable paths of economic rationalism which has seen ordinary, hard working Australians being gradually reduced to navvy status, unable to meet their normal living commitments and falling progressively further and further behind economically. But the most frightening issue to arise from this report is the lack of incentive to remain in the work force that has been faced by the majority of middle to low income earners in this nation. In an effort to cover up its own disastrous economic mismanagement of this country, the previous ALP government had allowed the situation to develop where many workers in full employment would be better off on the dole. Unfortunately, the current tenants of the Treasury benches are doing no better in addressing Australia's totally unacceptable unemployment problem as they follow the same failure-strewn path of economic rationalism and continue to practise total contempt for Australian workers and small business people. 'Australia's Working Class Poor' should be required reading for every member of this House if they want to try to understand the real problems faced by Mr and Mrs Average Australian. But, no, this government continues to pander to international business, to unworkable socialist engineering doctrines and to the political correctness that Labor perfected While it was in power. Don't any of you understand how much our people are hurting out there? As a person who has worked hard all her life in raising four children, much of the time as a sole parent, I find it absolutely insulting that, as detailed in one of the five real life case studies included in the report, in 1991 the then Labor government allowed into Australia and immediately on to our social security system a person who had worked a grand total of two years out of the 31 years since he left school at age 15. While one Aussie battler couple, with a husband working and trying to pay off a less than average mortgage on a home, ends up with a net disposable income of minus $1,309 per annum, our social security-dependent immigrant rates as one of the highest earners in the five case studies, with a net disposable income of $9,355 a year after living expenses. That is $9,355 to spend on luxuries-a concept a battler couple cannot even contemplate. What has this country come to when a young couple who are doing the right thing by their community, who are working hard and contributing all that they are asked to are on a rapid road to bankruptcy, while a professional social reject, whether they be Australian or from elsewhere, earns just under $30,000 a year for doing absolutely nothing? Even more frightening is the fact that if our Aussie battler couple took the soft option and went onto the dole and into public housing instead of maintaining their pride and fighting to survive, they would be $7,000 a year better off. Where is the incentive to work? There is something drastically wrong with the government's management of our society if this is to be the future of this nation. As the discussion paper concludes: The Working Class Poor is a class of Australians that has only recently been recognised by governments. In terms of household income figures obtained from the 1991 Census . . . the Working Class Poor are the majority of Australians! Heritage Country Development Agency",102
146,Mrs JOHNSTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the attention of the House the work of the Heritage Country Development Agency in my electorate of Canning. The agency was established in August 1993 by the cities of Gosnells and Armadale and has since been joined by the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale. This was in response to an ongoing concern within the various spheres of government as to the region's history of appallingly high levels of unemployment. The agency's mission is to promote regional economic development through identifying and promoting small business, employment and investment opportunities. It also provides encouragement and support to all business, industry and investors, with membership of the agency strongly focused on the region's business community. Since I was elected to this parliament one year ago, I have worked closely with the Heritage Country Development Agency. Together we have focused on a number of projects such as the establishment of a business incubator in our local area and the development and implementation of a regional transport strategy. This week a delegation from the agency is in Canberra meeting with ministers and their advisers from both sides of the House to discuss these and other matters affecting the Canning electorate. Topics for discussions include Green Corps funding, regional employment development opportunities, a transport strategy, urban water management and the feasibility study into the establishment of a centre of research and teaching the environment near Forrestdale Lake. This lake is one of only two Ramsar convention wetlands in the Perth metropolitan region. It has been described by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency's directory of important wetlands in Australia as having the potential for 'the education of students, residents and tourists on the ecology of waterbirds and brackish wetlands'. Mr Jay Hardison, the Regional Facilitator of the Heritage Country Development Agency, leads the delegation, along with Councillor Tony Pisano from the City of Gosnells, who is also chair of the agency, and Councillor Henry Zelones from the City of Armadale, who chairs the South Metropolitan Development Agency. These three gentlemen are tireless workers for the heritage country region in the electorate of Canning. Canning has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Western Australia. Figures provided by the Parliamentary Library show that Canning has the highest level of unemployment, second only to the electorate of Brand in my home state. Sadly, this region has a history of unemployment rates that are consistently higher than the average of the state. It is therefore pleasing to note that just two weeks ago the Heritage Country Development Agency received nearly half a million dollars in grant funds from the federal government to build a business incubator in the Gosnells locality. Upon completion, the incubator will provide accommodation for up to 40 new businesses. This, I suggest, is a positive for small business and employment in the electorate of Canning. In partnership with the South Metropolitan Development Agency and the South West Group, the Heritage Country Development Agency is currently working on a project titled 'Linking industry' which is being developed to increase the viability and employment potential of the region's industrial estates. It is fitting that I put on the record praise for the work of the Heritage Country Development Agency in helping to address unemployment and other issues in my electorate of Canning. I eagerly await the release of the interim report on the project's development, which will set the direction for future regional industry. As the people's representative, I look forward to a close and continued working relationship with the agency in the years ahead, and I am sure that together we will achieve very much for the unemployed of Canning. Overhead Cables",103
147,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I have raised before the inadequacy of the regulations covering that problem which so many communities have of overhead cables from Optus and Telstra and, indeed, possibly others. But I feel the need to do so again, as the government clearly is not listening. Last Friday, I and other local MPs met with the City of Moreland to discuss issues of common concern. The issues which the City of Moreland put before me and before others Were essentially that, while the new telecommunications code includes some improvements to the present situation, these improvements are largely of a cosmetic nature and contain a considerable downside. The most significant point is not the marginal changes included in the code, whether they be for good or ill, but rather that the code allows the Commonwealth government to take a further step away from responsibility for the substantial urban blight already created throughout Australian metropolitan areas by the cables. In other words, the code is virtually ineffective in addressing the real issues and threats for Australian communities created by the cable roll-out. The focus must be on a plan for the undergrounding of all cables. It is not just the City of Moreland. Kerry Stokes recently publicly criticised what he described as the political ineptitude and commercial greed which has led to both carriers unnecessarily spending about $4 billion each on identical cable roll-outs across Australia. Indeed, the City of Moreland has my expressed the view that perhaps rejection of the new telecommunications code by the Senate would force national attention on the inadequacies of the Commonwealth's policy framework. What the City of Moreland has said is that the new definition of maintenance, the new definition of tower and the new definition of broadband aerial cabling represent significant backward steps and, indeed, are worse than the existing code. So they have raised that question of disallowance. I understand that the opposition is taking the view that these matters need to be addressed in legislation. But, irrespective of the best legal way to resolve it, something needs to be done, and there is this widespread community concern, reflected as recently as 24 February this year with the Australian Local Government Association writing to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) seeking a telecommunications round table. I have a copy of the Australian Local Government Association's Â·,letter to theÂ· Prime Minister, and it states: Strong opposition is being voiced against the current rollout by Optus and Telstra of aerial cables in Adelaide, and the Western Australian Government is threatening legal action over telecommunications towers. Deep dissatisfaction persists in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. As a Melbourne based MP, I can testify to the accuracy of that. They further point out that recently we have had completion of an agreement between Optus and the Booroondara Council in Melbourne. That agreement goes far beyond the requirements of the new national code, which indicates that, quite clearly, other councils could have done better had they had support from the national government. So the Local Government Association calls for a national round table to address these issues. They say: This is seen as an essential step to gain a real commitment by governments to the objectives of undergrounding new telecommunications cables immediately, and developing a national program for the progressive undergrounding of all aerial infrastructure by about 2010. The telecommunications Code and bills fail to meet these objectives, and the provisions in the bills to transfer some control to the States simply the need for a national consensus on how telecommunications infrastructure is to be regulated. Otherwise inefficient and costly fragmentation is inevitable, to Australia's economic disadvantage Senator Alston's proposal for a working party is not sufficient. A working party without prior governmental commitment to key objectives would be at best an exploratory exercise, and at worse merely a debating club ... I urge youthe Prime Minister to reconsider your position and convene the Roundtable. You would be assured of Local Government's full support and cooperation. I endorse that call by the Australian Local Government Association. It is clear that the government has not satisfactorily addressed these issues. There is a pressing need to develop a framework for the undergrounding of all cables by the year 2010. I think the Local Government Association is in tune with the needs and concerns of communities right around the nation, and I therefore urge the government to adopt their proposal for a round table as soon as possible. Clean Up Australia Day Environment",104
148,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"On Sunday, 2 March 1997, I was one of the thousands of Australians who participated in the Clean Up Australia campaign. I congratulate the organisers of this annual event and wish to place on record my appreciation for the work done by two of the local service clubs in my Makin electorate. Members of the Modbury Lions Club mounted a tremendous effort to clean up the area surrounding the Tea Tree Plaza shopping complex in Modbury. I was pleased to join these people at 9 a.m. on Sunday, along with a group from the Makin Young Liberals. The number of cigarette butts we picked up was astonishing and very disappointing. I call on smokers to show more consideration and concern for their environment by disposing of their cigarette butts in a more appropriate manner. My team later joined volunteers from the highlights Modbury Apex Club in an area along Mcintyre Road in my electorate. We collected a trailer full of rubbish which included a car door and broken windscreen. Glass had been scattered everywhere, so it took some time to collect it all. I wish the House to note the work done by Mr David Jeffs, who coordinated the effort by the Modbury Lions Club, and Mr Ashley Packer, who organised his Modbury Apex Club members in the Clean Up Australia Day effort. They deserve full praise for the work they did to clean up their local area. Their community-mindedness and sense of responsibility is a credit to them. I also mention the contribution made by Makin Young Liberals, led by their president, Matthew Dycki. Young people played a large role in the Clean Up Australia campaign, proving their understanding of the need to protect and rejuvenate our environment. Providing a cleaner place for all Australians and their families is a key priority of the Howard Government, as illustrated by the recent launch of the largest commitment to environmental action by any government in Australia's history-the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust. The theme for this year's Clean Up Australia Day was 'Lend a hand' and it is a theme also worthy of the Howard Government's Natural Heritage Trust. Individual Australians and community groups can now join in with the effective revitalisation of our environment and natural heritage, thanks to funding through the trust. I am inviting local community groups within my Makin electorate to be part of this exciting venture and, judging by last Sunday's effort, the people of Makin share my enthusiasm for the task ahead. Australians support measures to protect our natural heritage and rebuild that which has been damaged. This support was clearly demonstrated at the last federal election when Australians voted overwhelmingly for the coalition and its policy of establishing a trust out of the part sale of Telstra. The establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust will provide the capital needed for projects which will protect and replenish our natural environment. These projects will include the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling 2001 project, the national reserve system, the national land and water resources audit and the coasts and clean seas initiative. Members will note the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday of the coastal and marine planning program which will be established as Australia's first ever oceans policy. When young people write to me of their concern for the environment, I am proud to be able to list the many positive and practical measures that will result from the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. This is a far cry from the committees and talkfests that took place under the previous Labor government when more was said than ever done. Just like the thousands of men, women and children who participated in the Clean Up Australia campaign last Sunday, this government is doing something positive to fix the problems and provide a lasting future for our environment and our nation. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.58 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Anderson to present a bill for an act to amend the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Act 1996.

Mr Beazley to move That this House: (1) takes note of the Government's decision in the 1996 Budget to cut $1.8 billion from labour market programs funded under the Labor Government's Working Nation program; (2) notes that the Labor Government's Working Nation labour market programs were an unprecedented commitment by an Australian Government to assisting the unemployed to find work; (3) notes that Working Nation labour market programs were very successful in offering work and training opportunities to the most disadvantaged in our community-young unemployed people and long-term unemployed people; and (4) notes that Working Nation labour market programs resulted in many thousands of unemployed Australians successfully finding work.

In the concluding moments, may I say that, legislation initiated by the coalition government is certainly an improvement on the current a more clearly integrated approach by the government and its place in public savings, taxation and a strategy has yet been as well Government must ensure that there is real industry through RSAs. In my opinion, this competition between existing and prospective accounts do address the three main problems of choice; the small balances in many superannuation by fees and charges and by the number of accounts our society's more mobile work habits. In the past I have been a substantial critic guarantee. This was a move or perhaps a concept unfortunately in its application it turned employees. We had the situation, as I am sure their constituents, where particular employees that their superannuation accounts had been fees and, of course, at the end of the day, in their potential retirement accounts. This see that the coalition has taken this on board. The necessity for an integrated approach Anybody who has been involved in the industry some of the range of regulations and rules and know only too well that, in order to remain marketplace, you have to have considerable with or abreast of the changes that have been 1923 Australian government to prevent state public who are convinced that the coalition, like its their superannuation. They believe that because they cannot trust governments let them make the long-term financial commitment to withdraw their funds or not place further it will definitely become more competitive. This is also a danger that some smaller or less wellable to compete and thus may fail. perhaps a good thing, as the benefit of larger players can bring to the industry should that in getting to a restructured, efficient and savings value as less competitive funds either explore all avenues available to it to despite my reservations, I believe that this is certainly heading in the right direction. It situation. What I would like to see, however, is to the whole question of superannuation the national economy. I do not believe that such demonstrated as it could have been. competition provided in the superannuation would be better served by promoting fair service providers. I agree that retirement savings that exist under current super arrangements: lack accounts; and the erosion of balances an individual may have by the nature of of the previous government's superannuation that had some merit in it in some ways, but out to be a nightmare for many employers and many members would know from inquiries from moving around in their employment life found eaten up by these charges and account keeping in one or two instances, had a negative net asset obviously needed to be changed. I am pleased to to superannuation savings is absolutely critical. or, for that matter, has attempted to look at the variety of differing products available would abreast of the range of products available in the expertise. The problem is that to keep in touch introduced almost continuously over recent years NA 1924 requires an extraordinary effort on the part the professional advice to their clients, It is perfectly understandable that many idea how superannuation or retirement savings be vulnerable in some instances to the wrong complexity and the more variety there is in, more difficult it is for people to be It is absolutely critical, in order to encourage that people must feel confident that when they to get a reasonable return for their money and away in more and more tax taken by the federal government's take on retirement savings these that I think anybody who is perhaps contemplating retirement, into things like property or other when you consider the complexity of the area in relation to retirement savings.

I commend the government for making this the changes and I hope, at the end of the day, like the previous government to continually meddle fall into the same trap as did the Hawke savings, and the products that are available, national savings.

I have registered my concerns about that this government is not going to be tempted with retirement savings. If it does, it will and Keating governments and bring retirement into disrepute. We need to be able to encourage that, when they invest in superannuation and, hopefully, will be able to have a reasonable and live on their retirement income .. cognate debate on the Retirement Savings (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Bill, I am happy to follow the member for thoughtful presentation on matters pertaining sensible criticisms, some of which he has garnered we have put forward in regard to this debate. for a more integrated approach from government There was a time in the history of this country to retirement savings for the Australian in the National Welfare Fund. That involved Australian worker into the National Welfare in Britain, Germany, Holland and the other major in terms of what needed to be done to provide pension fund, which this one was. The were clear, open and entirely transparent. The one fund to be invested for their future benefit. NA Tuesday, 4 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE In being invested in that way, the key element, funds, was the fact that they would enjoy Britain, which adopted those systems, had the a century. They had very, very strong funds. In Australia, the last Labor government had superannuation system. People on better incomes, provided superannuation packages, did reasonably Australians, apart from the pension, which a superannuation mechanism in place. So for the member for Moore made whilst he was a with so many coalition opposition members government made to superannuation, the core were starting from a partial system. They were which existed in the National Welfare Fund. The reason they did not start with that-and, National Welfare Fund in 1984 or 1985-was of its funds in the early 1950s by the Prime and a funds crisis. It was his determination Welfare Fund, contributed out of workers' pockets into consolidated revenue. The National Welfare So we in Australia have not had half a century contributing to their own retirement and contributing workers have not had the compound interest that and Europe. They have not had the unity and Holland that people could retire on 80 per the guarantee-whatever their income-that, a superannuation system or a retirement system be assured-whether they were earning $200 in retirement would match very closely what The reason we do not have that system is out of the national welfare fund, crippled consolidated revenue and the coalition, while Gorton and MCMahon, has not repaid one penny had helped to fund their own retirement. That the past 13 years, has had to start from a partial towards those in self-employment or towards 1972 to 1975, Prime Minister Whitlam offered the pension. The offer was made for that very crushed by Prime Minister Menzies. In recognition had been stolen from those workers who had a pension for people over 70. So we start to talk about this bill, a new of an entirely unified and integrated approach more than half a century in which the people for their retirement. We have a country in 1925 apart from the good management of those compound interest. The European countries and benefit of compound interest for more than half to undertake a series of reforms for a partial people who worked for companies which well. But for the vast majority of was non-contributory and unfunded, there was not all the, at times, heavy-handed criticisms that member of the coalition in opposition, together over so many years, of the changes the problem that the government faced was that they not starting from the unified holistic system in fact, had to end the legislation for the that the National Welfare Fund had been bled Minister, Mr Menzies.

He put that money into it was in government under Menzies, Holt, of that Â£100 million directly to retirees who is the reason why the Labor government, during company based system, directed in large part those who enjoyed company packages.

That system needs to be built The commitment on the part of the coalition has not been evident to me during the past 14 increase in award superannuation was manifest top to the bottom. Equally, with this retirement savings account more than window-dressing to show that the people to save for their retirement, because I is an agenda that does not demonstrate a commitment that does not admit to an extension of that system future, and to making sure that that system continues legislative fabric so that it cannot be whittled away. The three bills before us are not being opposed have indicated that we would like a series of Senate, but we are concerned about a whole think this may simply be another attempt by the good work done during the past 13 years government sought to increase national savings Australians with an equitable and secure retirement coalition has been a part of their platform for we were in government, but, on Treasury This is not a policy that will benefit the that has a series of beneficiaries, but the primary have looked jealously at the great pool of superannuation that could be levied on those funds.

There were new players in NA Tuesday, 4 March 1997 However, we know that the banks have had A part of our argument is that it is because with award superannuation and with the major coalition has a predilection to open up other vehicles. We understand-because we understood the for itinerant workers, those who move around seasonal work, and for those people who come to have children and then come back into the people, but those problems were addressed in at the main reasons that are being put forward superannuation funds would not bleed down charges. We have seen throughout the period and others that, unless they are regulated, unless will attempt to get away with ripping off excessive charges. We heard no great complaint back in by the previous Labor government as but lots of complaints about their There are a number of questions related guarantee that the banks will fully disclose will provide the maximum possible return to superannuation bodies?

The government has always acknowledged, RSAs may yield a lower return than is available People invest in a whole range of things respect, the RSAs are not any different investments. In this respect, I was interested opposition who were indicating that we were competition. Opposition speakers seemed to be did not have the ability to make choices about reject that. I think most Australians have investing their money. Particularly in regard to RSAs, what happened people were forced to put their money into little have all disappeared now. It would be interesting money was put into these small accounts, the lot disappear. The battlers in Australia, who their money disappear over the last three realise that there is no money and, as somebody That is quite unsatisfactory.

It is on that basis that I sincerely hope the industry is not a forerunner for their broader industry and our country as a whole cannot afford to oppose this bill.

To that end, I urge honourable members employee share acquisition schemes. It is perhaps member for Bradfield, Mr David Connolly, who schemes in 1995.

Main Committee adjourned at 10.10 p.m. NA j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j The following answers to questions were circulated: Share Trading Impropriety (Question No. 855) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 October 1996: (1) Is the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) in possession of evidence provided by Cambridge Gulf Exploration showing a share trading impropriety occurred and implicating Country Nat West. (2) Is the ASC able to say whether Country Nat West has been shown the evidence. (3) Has the ASC advised Cambridge Gulf Exploration or its lawyers that the complaint will be investigated; if so, is he able to say why Country Nat West says iUs not under investigation. (4) Has the WA Regional Commissioner of the ASC said that the Perth Office of the ASC is to be congratulated for its efforts; if so, to what efforts is he referring. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am advised that the ASC is conducting an investigation into matters connected with trading in securities of Cambridge Gulf Exploration NL. As the investigation has not yet been completed, it is inappropriate for me to comment on, or release information concerning particulars of, the investigation. (3) I am advised that the ASC advised lawyers for Cambridge Gulf Exploration NL, by letter dated 12 April 1996, that it was going to commence an investigation. I do not propose to comment on why County Natwest may have said what it is reported to have said. (4) I am advised that the answer is Yes. I am also advised that the then WA Regional Commissioner of the ASC, Mr Allen, was referring to the enforcement efforts generally of staff of the Western Australian Regional Office of the ASC since the ASC's inception in 1991. NA Community Based Child Care: Fees (Question No. 1005) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: (1) Is it a fact that the fees for (a) community based child care centres in Broome are $160 per week per child and will rise to $210 per week following the Government's budget cuts and (b) the Jalygurr Guwan Aboriginal Day Care Centre are $115 per week and will not rise; if so, Why. (2) Did the Government take into account the higher costs imposed on some country day care centres because of district allowances paid to employees when it decided to remove the operational subsidies to community based day care centres; if so, how is it factored into the formula; if not, why not. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The setting of fees is a matter for centre owners and managers. The level of cost increases in community based long day care services will depend on services' ability to achieve efficiencies in a competitive environment. Measures have been announced to help services restructure their business to improve their efficiency, reduce costs and budget for the removal of operational subsidy. From 1 July 1997, $4m a year will be available for services in areas of disadvantage, particularly in rural and remote areas, to compensate for the loss of operational subsidy and to ensure that working families and children in those areas maintain access to child care. Multifunctional centres and Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services (such as the Jalygurr Guwan service) provide a flexible range of services which may include long day care, family day care and outside school hours care. These services are located in areas which do not have a large enough population to support individual services and which would usually not attract private child care services. The retention of operational subsidy for these services ensures that families in these areas do not lose their access to child care. (2) No. Operational subsidy is currently paid to services on a per place basis and is not linked to the salaries of employees. Department of Transport and Regional Development: Hire Car Costs for Ministerial Travel (Question No. 1022) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: What were the hire car costs to the Minister's Department for ministerial travel between I March and 1 September (a) 1995 and (b) 1996. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There were no hire car costs incurred by the Minister's Department for ministerial travel between 1 March and 1 September (a) 1995 and (b) 1996. APEC: Competition Policy (Question No. 1028) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: (1) What progress has been made by APEC in 1996 towards competition policy convergence. (2) What action has the Government taken to accelerate progress referred to in part (1) as a aspect of fair trade liberalisation. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although a new issue on APEC's trade liberalisation and facilitation agenda, work on competition policy has focused on enhancing the competitive environment in the Asia-Pacific region through improvement of dialogue on trade and competition policy, promotion of cooperation and the provision of technical assistance for those economies which have not established competition policy regimes. This need for enhanced transparency and cooperation will increase with greater globalisation of production and the use of domestic policy actions which impact on trade. Work in APEC on competition policy in 1996 was carried out on two fronts: one, the Individual Action Plans (lAPs) of the eighteen APEC member economies; and two, the Collective Action Plans developed by the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI). As part of the lAP process several developed economies have undertaken to maintain a competitive domestic environment and enhance transparency, while some developing economies have undertaken, over time, to either draw up competition policy rules or consolidate existing rules and practices to prevent anti-competitive practices. As part of the collective action agenda a workshop was held in Davao, Philippines, in August 1996 to develop an understanding of the interrelationship between competition policy and deregulation and trade and investment policy and to explore the interrelationships between regulatory policies and trade liberalisation. Officials from the Treasury and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) presented papers at the Davao workshop. Another workshop on competition policy is planned for Quebec City in May next year. (2) Australia strongly supported APEC work on competition policy in 1996. As part of the lAP consultation process the Government has raised with other member economies commitments made on competition policy in their individual lAPs and sought to improve these commitments over 1996. At the recent APEC Ministerial and Leaders Meeting in Manila and Subic Bay Economic Leaders asked APEC economies to work towards improving their respective lAPs in all areas covered by the Osaka Action Agenda, including on competition policy, by the time they meet in Vancouver, Canada next year. APEC Trade Ministers, after taking into account the views of the business community, will review lAPs in mid-1997. At the same time Australia is actively supporting the collective action agenda, particularly in the key provision of technical assistance. Australia is currently participating in a technical assistance survey, which aims to share experience in the operation of competition policies and laws with other economies and is supporting a Chinese Taipei proposal for the establishment of a regional competition policy database. At a bilateral level Australia was also involved, through the ACCC and the Au sAid Support Program, in providing training for competition policy practitioners from the region. Chinese Boat Persons: Compensation (Question No. 1048)  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon no.tice, on 9 December 1996: (1) Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 6935) concerning 38 Chinese boat persons, is he able to say (a) who acquainted those persons with their rights of action under law for compensation and access to legal aid, (b) who decided, and where was it decided, that those persons, as illegal immigrants, were entitled to legal aid and compensation and (c) whether action has been taken against the Commonwealth officers who made decisions to detain those persons beyond legal time limits. (2) What have been the total costs to the Commonwealth associated with the (a) arrest, (b) detention, (c) accommodation, (d) surveillance, (e) legal expenses, (0 administration, (g) compensation and (h) other expenses associated with those persons. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) I do not know who acquainted the persons from the Isabella boat with their rights of action under the law for compensation or access to legal aid. This would obviously be a matter between a client and his or her lawyer or adviser. (b) I do not know what arrangement there was between the lawyers and their clients regarding the payment of their legal fees. In accordance with usual practice, my Department provided funding for assistance with primary and review applications through Australian Lawyers for Refugees Incorporated. In respect of the entitlement to compensation, Justice Wilcox of the Federal Court determined on 11 April 1996 that two representative persons from the Isabella group had been unlawfully detained. That finding by the Federal Court meant that compensation would be ordered by the Court following a hearing to determine the quantum of damages. Such a hearing was listed to commence on 4 December 1996. Prior to that time the matter was settled. (c) No action has been taken against Commonwealth officers in relation to the detention of the Isabella group. The detention provisions were applied by my Department in good faith in accordance with the then understanding of the legislation. Justice Wilcox accepted that there was no evidence of any mala fides on the Department's behalf. (2)(a) I am unable to provide details of the total cost to the Commonwealth of the search and rescue operation. My Department incurred costs of around $43,000 for the transport of the Isabella boat group from Darwin to the Port Hedland Immigration Processing and Reception Centre (lRPC), and for overtime worked by the WA Police Service during the search. (b-d) and (f) The cost to the Commonwealth of keeping the 38 persons in detention at the Port Hedland IRPC is estimated to be $960,000. This amount was calculated using a per diem rate of $44 per day, based on actual costs incurred at that time, for the provision of health care, edm;ation, welfare, interpreters, security, administration, general maintenance, utilities, catering and cleaning services at Port Hedland. (e) Legal costs to the Commonwealth incurred to date have totalled $587,329, including payments of $118,016 to Australian Lawyers for Refugees Incorporated for application assistance. These expenses do not include a small number of costs associated with the Australian Government Solicitor receiving instructions in several 'Isabella' related matters which did not progress, and in-house legal costs incurred by my Department. (g) The parties to the settlement agreed that its terms should remain confidential. (h) The Commonwealth also incurred a cost of appro x $21,700 for fares from Port Hedland when these 38 persons were released from detention. Department of Defence: Purchase of Paper Products (Question No. 1064) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 December 1996: What sum has the Minister's Department spent on the purchase of paper products since 1 April 1996, and what proportion of those purchases was Australian made. Mr MCLachlan-The amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Defence information management systems do not readily capture the information sought, and hence the following information should not be viewed as definitive. The level of Australian manufacture has been difficult to quantify. The figure below may include Australian manufactured products using foreign material, and may exclude foreign manufactured products using Australian raw material. Defence has identified the following expenditure estimate: Expenditure: $3.443 million Australian Content: 52.5% has been identified as Australian made. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Territories Expenditure (Question No. 1122) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: Did the Minister's Department or instrumentalities under the Minister's control expend sums in 1995-96 in respect of (a) the Australian Antarctic Territory, (b) the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, (c) the Territory of Christmas Island, (d) the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, (e) the Coral Sea Islands Territory, (f) the Territory of Heard Island and MCDonald Islands or (g) Norfolk Island; if so, what (a) sum was expended and (b) what was the purpose of each expenditure. Mr Tim Fischer-As indicated above, the honourable member has asked identical (a) the Australian Antarctic Territory Total amount expended in 1995-96 on the Australian Antarctic Territory (b) the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands (c) the Territory of Christmas Island (d) the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands (e) the Coral Sea Islands Territory (f) the Territory of Heard Island and MCDonald Islands (g) Norfolk Island No other areas of the portfolio have Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Territories Expenditure (Question No. 1123) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: Did the Minister's Department or instrumentalities under the Minister's control expend sums in 1995-96 in respect of (a) the Australian Antarctic Territory, (b) the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, (c) the Territory of Christmas Island, (d) questions of both Ministers.

Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Australia has a global non-discriminatory immigration program made up of two components: the Migration Program and the Humanitarian Program. The Migration Program seeks to contribute to Australia's economic and social well-being. The Humanitarian Program provides resettlement for refugees and people in humanitarian need. All applicants, including those from East Timor, who meet the relevant entry criteria under either program are eligible to come to Australia. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Seven. (2) All. (3) Two. Both perform the duties of one position under a job-share arrangement. (4) The positions of the staff referred in part (1) are as follows: Title Manager, Passports Office Authorising Officer Customer Service Officer Customer Service Officer Collector of Public Monies/Customer Service Officer Passport Allocator Passport Allocator Since 1975, some 7,000 people of East Timorese ethnicity have been accepted as humanitarian entrants to Australia. This includes some 1,000 people resettled under a Special Assistance Category which was introduced in 1991 to provide an opportunity for East Timorese, who had better prospects of adapting to Australian society, to be reunited with family members in Australia. As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, Australia has an obligation to provide protection to every person in Australia in a nondiscriminatory manner who comes within the Convention's refugee definition. Whenever such persons raise protection claims, their claims are considered carefully on a case by case basis against Convention criteria and according to relevant legislation. Office of Multicultural Affairs (Question No. 1257) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) How many persons were made redundant as a result of the closure of the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OM A) and the setting up of a new unit in his Department. (2) What are the functions of the new unit. (3) Will functions previously undertaken by OMA cease to be performed: if so, which functions. (4) Have the Access and Equity functions been reduced. (5) Will the new unit only monitor what other departments do in relation to Access and Equity objectives rather than give direction to those other departments. (6) Why has administration of the Access and Equity program been removed from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were no redundancies as a result of the closure of OMA and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). (2) & (3) All functions previously undertaken by OMA are performed in DIMA following the transfer of functions. (4) Access and equity functions have not been reduced since the transfer of functions from OMA. (5) The Access and Equity Section in DIMA both monitors and sets policy regarding access and equity directions on the basis of considered dialogue with other Government departments and agencies through the Interdepartmental Access and Equity Advisory Committee, the Access and Equity Intergovernmental Working Group and bilateral negotiations with departments and agencies. Hurstville Rockdale Kogarah These estimates are from the DEETY A publication Small Area Labour Markets which provides estimates of the number of unemployed persons and unemployment rates at the Statistical Local Area (SLA) level. (In most instances SLAs are identical to Local Government Areas.) It should be noted that these estimates have been derived using the Structure Preserving Estimation (SPREE) methodology and are based on Department of Social Security (DSS) data on unemployment beneficiaries and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) labour force survey data. As such, they are not exact and accordingly should be used with caution. The SPREE methodology produces small area labour market estimates that reflect the regional disparities of the DSS data while being consistent with ABS labour force data. (6) The access and equity program, since its inception, has always been part of the Government's multicultural agenda. Therefore, responsibility for access and equity was logically transferred to DIMA following the transfer of functions from OMA. Unemployment: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 1281) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: What were the unemployment (a) numbers and (b) rates in each of the local government areas of Hurstville, Rockdale, Kogarah, NSW in (i) 1995 and (ii) 1996. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Unemployment numbers and rates for the local government areas of Hurstville, Rockdale and Kogarah, NSW are as follows: (a) Unemployment Numbers (b) Unemployment Rates (i) June 1995 (ii) June 1996 (i) June 1995 (ii) June 1996 1586 2284 4.2% 6.6% 2525 3752 5.3% 8.1% 1052 1568 3.9% 5.9% It should also be noted that the data are original and are not, therefore, seasonally a,djusted or trended. Original data are subject to greater variability because the effects of normal seasonal variation have not been removed and the effects of other irregular impacts have not been reduced. East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement (Question No. 1289) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: Has the Government announced that the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement will lead to the creation of 400 new jobs in East Gippsland, Vic; if so (a) in what categories of employment and in what numbers will jobs be created, (b) how many persons are employed in those categories in East Gippsland at 10 February 1997, (c) by what date will the jobs be created, (d) how many jobs will not be permanent jobs and (e) what will be the average duration of non-permanent jobs. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 3 February 1997 the Government announced that the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) would provide greater certainty of access to timber resources, providing the basis for investment in the timber industry and the potential to create to 400 jobs. However jobs created as a result of the RFA may not all be in East Gippsland, for example, jobs generated in export handling would probably be in Eden or Geelong. The announcement of potential employment implications of the RF A was based on a probable industry development scenario, which reflected a number of industry proposals to use low grade wood presently being considered by the Victorian Government. This scenario is outlined in a publication titled 'East Gippsland-Towards the Regional Forest Agreement' and involves the potential use of an additional 650,000 tonnes per annum of residual wood which is presently unutilised. However, it should be noted that other possible scenarios, with consequently different employment implications, may also prove to be feasible. (a) The scenario would provide for direct employment increases in a number of forest industry categories and construction activities. These may be summarised as: harvesting and haulage--48 thinning-25 domestic processing-154 export-25 construction of domestic processing facilities-95 The scenario would also provide additional employment from multiplier or flow-on effects in the regional and state economies. These may be summarised as: flow-on effect from harvesting and haulage-38 flow-on effect from thinning-40 flow-on effect from domestic processing-l77 (b) Due to data limitations, it is difficult to ascertain the precise number of persons employed in forest industry categories in East Gippsland as of 10 February 1997. However, as of July 1996, it was estimated that there were approximately 555 persons directly employed in the wood based industries in East Gippsland. These included: harvesting and haulage-106 forest management and planning-88 domestic sawmill processing-361 These employment estimates are outlined in the publication titled, 'COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL ASSESSMENT EAST GIPPSLAND: RESOURCE AND ECONOMICS REPORT'. These figures were derived directly from industry, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment. It is also important to note that approximately 30,000 cubic metres of residual wood is sourced up from the East Gippsland region for use in pulp and paper making at the Maryvale mill. Hence there would be additional employment outside of the East Gippsland region linked to these wood flows and processing activities. (c) Under this scenario new jobs in the thinning, export and harvesting and haulage categories would be generated after the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment finalises long term wood supply contracts for the utilisation of residual logs. Employment generated from the construction of domestic processing facilities would be expected to start about three years after the extraction of residual wood commences and employment in domestic processing would then commence after a further two years. (d) Under this scenario jobs associated with the construction of the domestic processing facilities would not continue beyond construction of the processing facilities. (e) Under this scenario the construction phase would last about two years'. Most construction jobs would be expected to last for the duration of this phase. Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility: Treasurer (Question No. 1304) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Does the Ministerial Code of Conduct require Ministers to be present in the Chamber during the debate on his or her Bill and, whenever possible, be present in the Chamber to guide the legislation through the various stages of debate; if so, what action has he taken against the Treasurer for his failure since May 1996 to attend the various stages of House debate for legislation within the Treasury portfolio. (2) Does the code only excuse Ministers from the House debate if their absence is unavoidable; if so, is he able to say why was the Treasurer able to attend the division on the second reading of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 on 10 February 1997 but, immediately thereafter, unable to participate in the consideration in detail and third reading debates.",138
163,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) 'The Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility' requires that ""The minister should be present in the Chamber during the debate of hislher bill. If the minister's absence at this time of the debate is unavoidable, the minister should ensure that a duty minister of parliamentary secretary is sufficiently briefed on the detail of the legislation in order to guide the bill through the Parliament in the minister's stead."" Because of the Treasurer's substantial workload, including legislative load, and the fact that both the Assistant Treasurer and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer were Senators I agreed, prior to the commencement of the current Parliament, that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet), the Hon Chris Miles, MP, would be available to introduce bills in the Treasurer's portfolio and respond to debate on those bills. I considered that it was important that there be continuity in the handling of the significant legislation in the Treasurer's portfolio; this has been the case with Mr Miles introducing and being available during debate on most of the Treasurer's legislation.",149
