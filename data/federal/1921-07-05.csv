2,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Has the attenvoted tion of the Acting Prime Minister been called, since I last addressed a question to him on the subject, to the .very' inconvenience that' has been caused in some of the States by the application the provisions of the Navigation Act to overseas shipping companies?",19
3,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have been I asked absent from Melbourne since Eriday, when, I think, the honourable member drew my attention to this matter. No doubt the Act is causing some inconvenience, and will do so until readjustments have been made. Compliance with its conditions, means, among other things, the provision of more space for the crew, and that on some ships will lessen the ever, so far. passenger space.",19
4,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The effect is that some ports will be shut out altogether. The Act is going to affect Tasmania very seriously.,19
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There will be inconvenience until matters have shaken down, as, no doubt, they will within short time. CUSTOMS PROSECUTION.",19
6,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs any information to give the House about the case of Smith v. Hudson, .in which his Departfined ment is alleged to be defending an action for a refund of duty paid under protest, on the ground that the word left out and only the words ""under protest"" used? Mr Justice Pring is redo ported to have said that he was ashamed to think that any Government would take such a point, and that what had occurred was astounding. I am sure that neither the House nor the country desires that any Department shall be like a small pawnbroking establishment.",19
7,Mr GREENE,Unknown,"I understand that the case is not finalized, although a formal verdict has been given. When the proceedings are finished, I shall tell the House what was done. M. PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCE.",19

10,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Some time ago, when if it were the intention of the Government to be represented at the British last Empire Exhibition of 1923 that is to be held in England, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that when he was in England he would make inquiries on the subject. Has the Acting Prime Minister any information about the matter?",19

12,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister if it is true that the Administrator of the Northern Terri- . a tory has suspendedthe constitutional means of settling disputes, and that a Mr Nelson has proceeded against him for assault, the Administrator being fined £1, and costs?",19
13,Mr WISE,Unknown,He was not fined. o,19

15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , I shall so; but m.ay I suggest to the honourable member that he, for his part, might well send a communication to Mr Nelson, asking him to behave better than he did when he interrupted a public function in the Northern Territory, and suggesting run that he might use some other occasion for distributing his Bolshevik literature! DUTY ON FENCING WIRE.",19
16,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"An ad valorem duty has been imposed on wire of 14-in: gauge and under, which includes fencing wire of small gauge. I understood from the Minister at the time that such wire when used for fencingwould be admitted at the fencing-wire rate, but this morning I have received a letter from the Department stating that only when used for making wire netting or barbed wire will 14-in. gauge or-smaller wire be admitted at thelower duty. We were given to understand that a duty of £18 per ton will have to be paid on this wire, and I ask the Minister, therefore, if he will take prompt action to correct this anomaly ?",20
17,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes ; we shall do so. EXPORT OF COAL. Mr. CHARLTON - I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether there is an embargo on the export of coal from the Maitland mines, and whether the Government, intend to extend it to the coal from the Borehole seam? - Is the right honourable< gentleman aware that the Prime Minister, when the matter was being, dealt with, gave the undertaking that the Borehole coal should not be interfered with, so that those who were chartering mightprovidefor vessels coming toAustralia for coal for foreign ports? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - There is an embargo on the. export of coal, or, at least;, control is exercised in regard to coal exportations. It was found necessary toi impose that control in order that. Australia might have enough coal for her. own purposes. The price of coal overoseas is now so> high that, were there no control, this country would have .to go short of coal, because it .would be exported to countries where it could be sold ar. higher rates. Eor some time past there has been a very strict control in regard to the coal won in the Newcastle district; though at-first control was applied only to the Maitland coal. understand that the Maitland coal was originally put under control because the representations of persons connected wdth"" industry in Australia showed that it was best suited for their requirements. ; However, only 4,000,000 tons of Maitland coal are produced per'annum, while - TS the requirement of Australia is from 6,500,000 to 7,000,000 tons. Therefore, there is not enough.Maitland coal to meet our needs. Maitland coal has had to be sold in Australia at the price fixed some time ago by the Court, namely, 21s. per ton, while Borehole coal, could, be exported overseas - without restriction and - sold for very much more. That did not seem fair or right, and, therefore, the - control has been extended to the Borehole coal, to put it on the same footing as the Maitland coal. Later:",20
18,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Is the Acting Prime. Minister aware that the coal produced in New South Wales is upwards of 1,500,000 tons per annum over and above the requirements of the Commonwealth, and, if the Government are going to control both of the seams named, will he make arrangements whereby the colliery owners will be able to charter vessels for the overseas trade so as to prevent the closing down of mines? Sir JOSEPH. COOK - The action I am taking-is at the suggestion of Commander Fearnley, who is in control of matters up there, and who emphatically assures me that by taking control of both kinds of coal he can do very much better for both Australian requirements and the overseas trade than would otherwise be possible. OVERDUE STEAM-SHIPS'. COMPLAINT AGAINST NAVAL BOARD. ME. HECTOR LAMOND .T-^IS the Minister for the Navy in a position today to make a statement regarding the severe criticism, levelled agaiust his .Department for its alleged failure to send out'vessels to search for-steamers-overdue at* theport of Sydney ?",20
19,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The Naval Board has a policy from which it is most difficult to depart without interfering seriously with the training of our men. When the vessel which the honI orable member has in mind was reported to be overdue, the Naval Board immediately caused wireless messages to be sent out to all ships at sea, requesting that a strict lookout be kept for the miss-' ing vessel. Some of our own ships which were; at sea at the time were also so instructed by wireless, and asked to carefully watch for an SOS. message, on re; ceipt of which, one of them should be despatched at once to the assistance of the missing steamer. No one is more anxious than I am that every assistance shall be given to those in peril .on the sea; but I think I may safely say that almost every - week, or at all events at least every month, a ship is reported missing from one or other of the Australian ports. If , whenever such a report was received, a naval vessel were sent out to make a search, it would be practically impossible for our training arrangements to be properly carried out. It is our desire that our ships shall be kept as effective as the limited funds at our disposal will allow.",20
20,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"A r e vessels of the Navy able, then, to train only in calm waters ?",21
21,Mr LAIEDSMITH,Unknown,"The i r operaasked tions are carried on in all vessels of the Australian Navy carry crews of from 200 .to 400 men, and are without any accommodation for passengers. Would it not be unreasonable spatch a vessel, with a crew of 400 men and with a coal consumption costing £300 viser'? per .day, to look for a.ship, for which any tions ordinary vessel, with a crew men, might very well search ?- The Naval Department cannot undertake salvage work, since that would .mean that we should have no traiuing for a case, however, - such as that which happened off the New South Wales coast a of few days ago, when we knew that crew of a vesesl was in distress, we at once sent out a ship. More than that, however, the Naval Board cannot do. AUSTRALIANFLOURFORGREAT be available BRITAIN. SHOBTAGE OF FBEIGHT S. Sir JOSEP H COOK - The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) on Friday last asked whether, if other (vide page 9633). vessels were not. available, some of the steamers of the Commonwealth Government Line which were held up for lack of cargo could not be used to convey flour to Great Britain , so that Australian millers might fulfil their orders. I have had inquiries made, and find that the rate of freight on flour to Great Britain is so low as to make it entirely unremunerative to load a ship for the United Kingdom in-view of the fact that . there appears to be no prosDect of obtaining back loading. In the circumstances, it does not pay to take a cargo of flour to Great Britain . PAPERS.

24,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Then , instead of moving for a duty of 40 per cent, under the general Tariff, I shall vary the proposal that I made on Friday last by asking that such imports shall be free under the British preferential Tariff, and dutiable at 15 per cent, under the intermediate and per general Tariff. I want an ad valorem instead of a fixed duty. My proposal will returns the mean, with the price of paper at £25 per ton, a preference of £3 15s. per ton for British imports. ""With a further fall of colours £2 per ton, it will mean a preference of That is what I want. I 7s.; That sub-item (C) (1) be amended by adding the following :- "" And on and after 6th July, 1921, atl val., British, free; intermediate,. 15 per cent.; general, 15 per pent."" Mr HECTOR .LAMOND (Illawarra ) [3.20] - I do not think that the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey) will achieve the object which he has in view. The method which will be adopted by the American Combine to k ill the British paper business in Australia will doubtless be to sell newsprint here for a few months at a low price, so that the ad valorevi duty will be decreased proportionately. It is quite possible, therefore, that within the next month the ad valorem rate advocated by the honourable member will be less than the fixed duty proposed by the Minister.",22
25,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,No . The price of paper would have to fal l to the pre-war price before the ad valorem duty which I propose would be less than the fixed duty proposed by the Minister.,23
26,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Wit h paper at £ 1 0 per ton the ad valorem duty advocated by the honourable member would represent only 30s. per ton, whereas the Minister has - proposed a fixed duty of £ 2 per ton. the cost of paper were £ 1 2 per ton, which represents a little more than its pre-war price, an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent, would therefore be less than the duty proposed by the Minister. We have also to consider that the pre-war price of"" newsprint is quite easy of realization by the Combine. The cost of production at the mills in America is 3£ cents per l b . , so that as between the two propositions I prefer that submitted by the Minister, although I would like him to increase the duty a little. Britain is entitled to a preference of at least £ 3 per ton as against the American Combine. Combine practically controls the whole of the newsprint supplies from America, irrespective of whether they are produced in the United States or in Canada. This organization exhibited very little regard for Australia during the war, and nothing whatever can be said in its favour. Upon the other hand, the British manufacturers of paper are entitled to our support in their efforts to recapture the markets which they have lost, owing to their patriotic action during the war. honourable members only realise the position, I feel sure they will provide an opportunity for the British manufacturers to re-establish and extend their Australian market. I am satisfied that if the necessary encouragement be forth coming they are in a position to supply the whole of our newsprint requirements. Some persons have urged that the British manufacturers do riot send any newsprint here. As a matter of fact, I was using British newsprint years before the outbreak of war, and so"" also, were the daily newspapers of Melbourne. Lloyd's Agency had considerable contracts in Melbourne, and the British manufacturers today are able to supply the whole of our requirements at a reasonable price. Of course, I know that a lower price will be quoted by the Combine so long as there is a competitor in the field. But the position of the British paper industry is such that if wo do not go to its aid there will be no competitor with the Combine. in the near future. In my opinion the newspaper proprietors of Australia are acting very unwisely in permitting British competition to be driven entirely out of our market. It was a short-sighted policy on their part which led to some of the troubles experienced during the war, and If a similar policy, if pursued today, will eventually result in the handing over of the Australian market to the - tender mercies of the American Combine without the possibility of there being any other competitor in the field. I hope that the Committee will grant a substantial preference to the Old Country- a preference which will enable its manufacturers to produce newsprint to the advantage of Australia, and one to which they are - entitled because of the services they rendered us when it was necessary that somebody should produce the paper required for war purposes rather than exploit the That markets of the world, as other countries did. I intend therefore to move That the following words - be added to subitem (c) :- "" And on and after 6th July, 1921, per ton-British , free; intermediate, £ 3 : general, £ 3 . """,23
27,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Bourke) [3.26] - The honourable member's amendment will suit me, and I am quite willing to withdraw my own in its favour. But I understand that the ad valorem duty must be settled before we deal with the fixed duty. If",23
28,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I do nob know what is the procedure.,23
29,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am willing, to withdraw my amendment, but if I do so, and the honourable member's amendment be defeated, I cannot afterwards propose an ad, valorem rate of 15 per cent.,",23
30,Mr BAMFORD,FREEZING PLANT FOR,But the> honourable member may vote for a lower fixed duty.,24
31,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I desire to know precisely where. I . stand. An . ad valorem duty of 15 per cent, represents a pre- ference to Great Britain of .about £ 3 15s. per ton.",24
32,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Upon the norlarge importer of newsprint. mal, price it is more than. £ 3 . per. but upon the. price which is now being quoted it is not.",24
33,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Before the ad valorem duty can f all to less than the fixed proposed by the Minister, the price newsprint will have to decline below pre-war price: "" Mr HECTOR LAMOND - It will decline to' almost nothing if that course be necessiderable-increase sary to kill the British industry.",24
34,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I quite agree with the and 10 per cent. honourable member's statement. I shall, therefore, adhere to the ad valorem which I have proposed, namely 15 per cent. If my proposal be defeated, honourable member for Illawarra^ will afterwards be at liberty to move .for imposition i of a duty of £ 3 per-ton, if he> does so, I can assure him of support.",24

Yet,, i3i th& course which he is adopting in conr nexion with the paper industry, notwithwould, standing that B r it a in . has to import very large proportion of. her own newsr print. If we grant this special preference, the British manufacturers, for some time at least, will' be able to manufacture paper for which our' newspaper propriefirst tors, will have to pay an increased price, although British newspaperproprietors will be obliged to import-newsprint for their'own'requirements. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - T-That is hardly a fair statement..",24
37,Mr GREGORY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It is a correct statement.. Britain, has always been a. fairl y I know ton, the effort she is making to render herself - absolutely independent in connection with, the.' manufacture of this class of paper. She has acquired large forests in duty Canada, with the view to securing pulp. I of amglad to know^that the Minister agrees its with the proposal that newsprint from Great - Britain should be admitted free. - A duty .of 30s. to 40s.. per ton is a conon. the old duties of. free and 5 per cent., and, later, of 5 per cent, During, the past few months. British"" agents have been taking duty orders-under the 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, duties, with a view to obtaining abthe solutecontrol of the market, and they have been touting within Parliament the House for such' a large Tariff against and other countriesas to makei t impossible my for the latter to compete. The whole of the* burden is placed on the newspapers of this country, and it has been particularly we felt by the country newspapers, which, unlikei the, newspapers of the big cities, the cannot passi t on. In m y opinion, a duty of. 30s'. to40s - is ample . When we 1 know that Britain will have to import - newsprint, it ismost unfair, to propose that, the newspapers of this country 1 should, bet penalized to theextent of £ 4 per ton. in. addition to the cost of transbe port. . Last year the output in Norway for andSweden, of newsprint was about not 300,000 tons, and. of that 195,000' tons This might be due to the: fact:that the-British manufacturers have - not. yet been able to by resume their old output; at the - same . time, it . is clear that, even if British manufacturers had nothing to do with the Australian market, shewould still have that to' import; for her own requirements. While m y own idea is that a duty of 30s. be sufficient, I am prepared to go a with the Minister to the extent of ,40s., though an increase of 300 per cent, on the original proposal seems - too great. The higher duty will not mean any more employment in Great Britain , because the d u t y of the British manufacturer.' is to supply .the British people before exporting. What is asked, for is a special and unfair preference. No one would deny that right throughout the consideration of this Tariff , I have consistently supported preference to Great Britain , but now it is proposed to go beyond what is just to the.newspapers of this country. If it 'could be :shown that Britain was an exporter of .newsprint in the /sense that she is .able to supply her own requirements .and have enough for.export, and that 30s. to 40s. would not afford her protection, the further proposals might be worthy of consideration; but not one argument, has been advanced to .show that this increased .protection is necessary to enable the British manufacturer to fight a fair .battle. . I specially plead for the country newspapers, which were "" h a r d h it "" during the war. The Minister has specially investigated their - case, and has come to the conclusion that what is necessary is a duty beyond what I consider a fair t h in g ; but, as I have said, I pared to accept 40s. I understand that it requires about 1^ tons of coal to make 1 ton of newsprint, and, with the enormous price of coal, the cost of the paper has been somewhat higher. There is no doubt we were exploited during the war, not only in connection with newsprint, but in connection with almost every other commodity. I had some wonderful statistics prepared showing .the enormous in creases in prices; and a remarkable fact disclosed was that the only machine that did not show an increase was the oil engine. In many cases combines were created - for the purpose of exploiting the public;"" and there is no doubt that, in this direction, we shall have some serious matters under our consideration shortly. We hope .that conditions will gradually approach the normal, .and we ought to take a reasonable stand in* preparing our T a r i ff so as to give fair protection to our own people, with preference to Great Britain . What is a fair preferenoe to give to Great Britain? I do not mean - a preference that would result in a monopoly, 'but a preference which would give Great B r i tain a chance of competing on fair terms. Prior to the war, and in the very early periods of the war, Great Britain , with a free and 5 per cent. Tariff, and, later, duties .of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent., was able to hold her own in "" the Australian market; and I can see no ground for the proposed increase of 400 per cent. hope the Committee will consider caref u l l y before accepting either the amendment of the.honourable.member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) or that suggested by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . Hector Lamond).",24
38,Mr FOWIER,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Perth) [3.40] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) is unnecessarily - concerned about the interests of the country newspaper proprietors. It is_not so long since the Country Newspaper Association was .very anxious that the Minister should impose a duty on newsprint-of '£3 per ton.,25
39,Mr LISTEE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,-That is so.,25
40,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The .Prime Minister had to intervene to secure - any paper for them at all at one stage.  have made is correct, there can be no great objection on the part of the country am pre- newspaper proprietors to the proposal of the honourable member for Hlawarra (Mr . Hector Lamond). The speech made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr An stey) on Friday afternoon was of so sensational a character that I wondered if there had not been some little exaggeration ori the honourable member's part, due to the enthusiasm-with ""which he usually presents a case. I waited with some in terest to see what the newspapers, and especially .the metropolitan newspapers of this city, would have to say on the matter Their silence in this regard is. very suggestive indeed. The Age was particularly silent. It cut the report of the speech of the honourable member for Bourke down to about halfa-dozen ""lines, and those "" lines, of course, give an altogether incorrect idea of the honourable member's .speech. .The other newspapers have treated the honourable member's remarks in much the same way. It occurs to me that, .in view of the fact that .there has been no refutation of them, we must .take the accuracy of the remarks of the honourable member for 0 granted. That being so, it is, I think, quite clear that the duties proposed, will inflict no undue hardship on the. newspaper proprietors, whilst they will give effect >to .'the principle of preference to British products, which, I understand,.is"" the policy,"" not only of the Government, I but of ""the country as a whole. "" What : we have heard with regard to the possibilit y of the establishment of the manufacture of newsprint in Australia is another reason why we sliould give the preference to Great B r it a in which is proposed. There is, I believe, a substantial prospect of the manufacture of paper in Australia from our own wood pulps. Western Australia has taken a keen in terest in the matter, and with assistance from other States, has carried its experiments forward to such a stage that they promise very well indeed for the future. When a British paper manufacturing organization makes a promise, as I understand is the case with regard to the development of the manufacture of paper in Australia, .that is a sufficient justification for the preference now proposed. In view of the fact that the country press proprietors suggested a duty of £3 per ton, I shall have no hesitation whatever in supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Illawarra.",25
41,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Maribyrnong) [3.44]. - I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), if he does not see his way to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey), will accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond). Since the House rose on Friday, I have made some in quiries concerning the matter referred to by the honourable member for Bourke, and, according to my information, it is not only probable, but practically certain, that in the not distant future, if we adopt the duty now proposed, there will be a combination of British and Australian interests which should enable us before very long to manufacture in Australia a considerable portion of the paper we require. One thing which the Committee should take into account is that there are great organizations in other countries of the world backed financially by millions sterling, and the organization concerned in the manufacture of paper is one of them. B y those who nave personal knowledge of Canadian paper mills we are informed with absolute confidence that those mills are dominated to a large extent by United States capital.",26
42,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,To the of 90 per cent.,26
43,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That being so, it is quite time that we in Australia attended to our own interests in this matter, and secured the establishment of the manufacture of paper in this country. I have in my possession a letter from an authority on the subject, in which it is stated that in Japan, the United States of America; Italy , Germany and Switzerland, in connection with this and other industries, there are great combinations which, with their practically unlimited financial backing, are in a position to do pretty much as they please, as the honourable member for Illawarra has said. If we made arrangementsfor supplies of newsprint fro m Great Britain , there can be little doubt that the United States Combine, as I prefer to call it , in conjunction with those interested in the in dustry in Scandinavia, would dump paper into this country at a loss, with the object of defeating British competition and preventing the establishment of more paper mills in the world. Having attained their object, they would then be in a position to fleece Australian newspaper proprietors. If those requiring this class of paper in Australia do not know how to protect themselves, the Committee will show wisdom in stepping in to protect them in spite of themselves. I ask honourable members to listen to the following quotation from a letter I have received: Japan has broken her agreement made at the Labour Congress at Washington in 1919, by which the Government - of Nippon undertook to abolish child labour, and to reduce working hours, so as to bring Japanese conditions more into line with those of her Allies. The Bill was ready for introduction into the Japanese Imperial Diet in. January, 1921, but was postponed for one year to enable the Nipponese manufacturers' to create a foreign market for their goods. That foreign market includes Australia Furthermore, the Imperial Government of Japan has established a Bureau of Foreign Trade, which financially and otherwise assists Japanese manufacturers to place their products on foreign markets, .including those of Australia. As I said on Friday last, having almost absolute control of the great Siberian forests, Japan today "" stands on v e l v e t "" so far as the production of paper is concerned. Unless we are prepared to protect both British and Australian manufacturers, our industries must go by the board. I hope that the Minister will accept the suggestion which has been made to him, if he cannot accept extent the amendment submitted by the. honourable member for Bourke,' which would mean a duty of £ 3 15s. per .ton. In the course of competition, as the honourable member for Illawarra has said, the foreign manufacturers might cut their price down to £ 1 0 per ton, and, in that case, the ad valorem duty would be less than that suggested. If the Minister will accept the suggestion which has beeu niade, he will give effect to the desire of the people of Australia.

44,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Illawarra ) [ 3 . 5 5 ] - I move That the following words, be added to subitem (c) (1) :- "" And on and after 6th July, .1921, per ton, British, free; intermediate, £ 3 ; general, £3."" It is idle to talk of giving preference to Great B r it a in if the .Committee accepts the argument advanced by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I desire British paper to have a free market in Australia, and that foreign competitors shall be compelled to pay a substantial duty. W it h respect to the complaint concerning the heavy burden which will be placed on the country press, the suggestion that £1, added to the cost pf newspaper, will prove insuperable is absurd in view of the fact that the country press proprietors have had to pay to a monopoly during the war years, not 15 per cent., but 500 per cent., 600 per cent., and 700 per cent. Some of these gentlemen - are now so short-sighted as to believe that, because the monopoly has undergone a change of heart, and is prepared to give a price a little under that of the British manufacturers,, it will be to their interest The to encourage the foreign monopolists. They will be fatally short-sighted if they 14 do not hold out a hand to British firms 24 to re-enter the Australian market and so keep prices down.. The proposal of the 10 British manufacturers is reasonable; and had it been made by their foreign AYES. competitors during the war, Australian users of paper would have escaped the heavy imposts Whicli these foreigners forced upon them for several years. I warn the local newsprint users that, as soon as they succeed in killing British competition in this market, they will bo once more at the mercy of the foreign NOES. Combine, which has different prices according to the circumstances of different countries. The law in America has had to be invoked to counter its rapacity. Newspaper can there be had at one-fourth the price paid in Australia; but here w.e have not the protection of the Courts against the demands of the rapacious foreigner. For the country press to speak of saving a few shillings per week reminds one of the p it if u l cry of the "" poor struggling widow."" On this occasion, it is the poor struggling country newsr paper proprietor- a man who uses, generally, not more than 10 to 20 reams of papereach week, and who will be required to pay only a few shillings to save himself from the exploitation of the war years. The country proprietor has to thank » the British newsprint-makers for the fact that there is any such thing as a low price today. If the British makers had not offered to make contracts in. Australia equivalent to the cost of manufacture in Britain , plus 15 per cent, by way of return for special knowledge, expert superintendence, & c , the price would have been about where it was six months ago, ancl would have remained there for so long *a3 we were unable to find some competitor whose intervention would have reduced the rates. The choice is between the price .paid during the war, and whatever price British competition may now bring about. And the whole case, both from the commercial and patriotic viewpoint, should be to strengthen the British competitor in our market. ' That is certainly the - strongest commercial argument. As to the national consideration it is our duty, as .a people who benefited by the heavy sacri,fices of the newsprint-makers in England during the war years; to see that the - latter are now placed in a position to regain their former trade. The degree of protection indicated in my amendment is the lowest which can be granted with any prospect of - giving British firms a chance to-regain their Australian business.",27

It is quite true, as he states, that I have had very littl e to say on n t i l - many of the items 'that have 'already been passed, by the Committee. On many occasions, when I am not here, I have found that there are other places in thevicinity of this chamber which are more pleasant. At the outset - of the discussion on the Tariff I think I stated fairly, clearly, and distinctly, that I stood for two things. On© was. that I was in. favour of the highest possible duties being imposed upon articles that could .be manufactured in Australia, and the other v/as that I was in favour of a British preferential Tariff, and for that I would vote without talking. To that extent I have adhered to my promise, and the only instance in which I have faded away was in connection with films, because I do not believe that a r t can be produced by means of a Tariff. I have said that if Bill H a r t comes to Australia there is no reason why Ginger Mick and the Sentimental Bloke should not go to New York. stand by what I have said. occasion, when the interests of the country were really at stake, and when "" in creased duties "" were necessary, an honourable member who moved an amendment was not in the chamber when a division was taken-. That honourable-member faded away, he - was not here. I am not that gentleman. Does' the honourable member for Dampier know'him ? Mr GREGORY. - Yes ; I do.",28
50,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"When - the honourable member can - find an. excuse for being; absent on. such an occasion, it will be time enough for h im to criticise others who may be here but.who do not enter, into the discussion. This honourable member has pointed out that Great Britain cannot supply her own needs in connection with paper. What is the reason for making such a statement? Where is the evidence ?",29

55,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Has the honourable member the British figures'?,29
56,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I shall deal with the - statement of the honourable member - for Dampier.,29
57,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Whil e the B r i tish mills were doing war work: Britain was importing: paper*,",29
58,Mr ANSTEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The - honourable member for Dampier says that Great Britain was unable, to supply her own requirements because she was importing certain products. Is-the quantity of commodities imported, into this country proof that we cannot supply our own needs? Is it not true that in this country, as well as in others, there are people who will always purchase a foreign product in preference to that produced locally ? As a matter of fact, the bulk of the British newspaper proprietors are loyally helping the producers to get back to-pre-war conditions. But there are others who do not wish to use British paper and who desire the cheaper foreign product. At present, Lord Beaverbrook and others are bitterly opposing the use of British paper, and are importing surjDlies, I because they can get .them, cheaper. On one One of the reasons why British manufacturers are appealing to the Government to place aduty upon imported paper is that they are being, annihilated by the disastrous foreign exchanges, which enable the Scandinavian countries to flood the market with their papers in the endeavour to.drive the British manufacturer out of business. But here is a fundamental fact : When in the early part of the year paper was £75 per ton, plus £3 duty, the. newspaper proprietors were paying that price, and were not complaining of ruin. Then came the intervention of British manufacturers and their offer, and that has been, followed by the foreigner selling paper in this market £5 per ton cheaper than in the country of production. . In order to smash up British, competition, the foreigners dumped their goods into Australia, reduced the price by £50 per ton;, and. the people in this country who were prepared a few months, ago to pay £75 per ton, plus £3duty, are now objecting to pay £25 per ton, plus the duty. I said on Friday that not only had paper been i m ported from. Japan, but that a ship was en 'route to Australia with a cargo of Japanese paper, and there is a section of the press which, while mouthing it s ' loyalty and prating of its patriotism and love"" of Empire, is printing and circulating its sentiments upon this cheap foreign paper. The London Daily Chronicle, the Manchester Guardian, and a number of other important B ritish 1 journals are supporting the productions . of their own country. I have here The Times Trades Supplement of the lGth April, which includes a special Japanese issue, on which is priuted pictures of great machines for the production of paper T>ulp and newsprint in Japan. The machines are shown at work, and there are two or three pages of descriptive matter. It is there stated that Japanese manufacturers are producing all classes of paper, and that, whereas before the war 60 per cent, of Japan's requirements of paper pulp came from Canada and 40 per cent, from Scandinavia, during the war the Japanese people were shut out of the Canadian market; but out of the northern islands of Japan, Korea, and the maritime provinces of Siberia they are now producingpulp so cheaply that it will yield the cheapest paper in the world. Such is the abundance of material produced by Japanese labour .in Japanese territory that they are able to not only supply their own requirements, but to export a large proportion of their product to other countries. Sixty pulp mills have been established, and they arc today entering into competition with the world, sending paper to India, China, South America, and Australia. And at this critical juncture, regardless of the position in Great Britain and Scandinavia, when we are asked to put a duty of £3 per ton on paper which' is selling today at £50 per ton cheaper than it was three months ago, we find certain members objecting to it. From the beginning to the end of the Tariff, through scores of items, there has been one clearly-defined principle of preference, namely, to maintain a difference of 15 per cent, between the duties on the British and foreign products. If we placed a duty of 30 per per cent, upon British good3, we made the general Tariff 45 per cent.; if the British duty was 15 per cent., the foreign was 30 per cent.; if British goods were admitted free, the general Tariff was 15 per cent. But when we come to this particular item of newsprint, that affects a powerful section, who claim to be the propagandists of a particular faction, because of their power and influence, and because they want the cheapest paper they can get from any part of the world, the Minister refuses to impose more than Ur. Anstey. , a revenue Tariff. I have been unsuccessful in getting any amendment of this item carried) but I hope that the majority of the Committee will vote for the proposition made by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond).",29
59,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Henty) [4.15] - I hope the amendment will be carried. As the honourable memher for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) has remarked, in respect of most of the items throughout the Tariff we have given a marked preference to Great Britain. Even the representatives of the country press have emphasized the need for a fair margin of preference to the British manufacturer in connection with paper; the additional burden imposed upon any newspaper by so doing wpuld be very small indeed. The proposed duty of 15 per cent, is 5 per cent, more than the Minister has proposed, but that difference will mean a great deal to the British manufacturers. We have been told that during the years of the war the British mills were not able to supply us with newsprint. That was on account of the industrial disturbance due to war conditions. But now that we are returning to normal times, it is only fair to allow the paper mills of Britain to set their wheels in motion again. Although the Old Country may not have been able to supply us in the past, we are given to understand that she is in a position today to send us all the newsprint we require. Australia, like most young countries, is now expecting a big influx of population, and we have tried to encourage immigrants to come from Great Bri tain. Increased production will mean increased newspaper circulation, and a bigger demand for paper. I hope the time will soon arrive when the Australian Paper Mills will be able to supply the local requirements of newsprint. The strides which these mills have made already is a matter for congratulation. They have endeavoured against great odds to build up an industry that will be a credit to this country. So far they have been handicapped by the necessity for importing all their machinery, but the time is approaching when the machinery, too, will be produced locally. While we are, so to speak, feeling our feet,, we ought to see that the wheels of industry are kept going in Great Britain to supply our needs here. Surely if is essential to give preference' to Great Britain in one direction it is equally free, general 5 per cent. essential to give it in another, particurate larly when the paper mills of that country have given us the promise that they will supply the whole of Australia's needs. £534,000. Our big daily newspapers, who tell us that it is in the interests of the country to foster its industries by means of protective duties, should readily recommend the granting of a preference to Great Britain in regard to the newsprint they require. I u any case, the preference asked for is very small, and I trust that existing rates of duty. the Minister (Mr Greene) will see fit keep the flag flying and show that Ausinterviewed tralia is prepared to do again what it in the time of Britain's t r i a l, that help her to keep the wheels of industry going, and to encourage her to send us namely, the country press. not only immigrants, but also the goods we unfortunately cannot manufacture selves, ourselves.",30

I do not it say that these people have done this. The representative of the British manuroom facturers with whom the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has been in touch asks for a duty of £ 3 per ton as This what he says in a letter directed to the the Provincial Press Association: No If you could recommend that a flat rate of at least £3 per ton be placed on foreign paper, with a free Tariff to the United Kingdom, or, for the purposes of revenue, £4 to the one and £1 to the other, I feel sure th* Government would . accede to your He represents a number of British manuhad agreed facturers.

63,Mr JOWETT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That would be a good thing; would it not?,32
64,Mr GREGORY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Yes ; but the fir3t question is: What is a fair preference to give to Great Britain? No honourable member has touched that point. It is of no use to wave the flag and say, ""We want to give all this preference to Great Britain."" What we should do is. to be fair and just to our own people, ancl then give a preference to the Old Country. There has. been no greater fighter than myself for preferential treatment of Great Britain throughout the consideration, of this schedule.. I wanted to give a preference, and I was pleased when the Minister proposed that imports from Great Britain should be free, and that the rate of duty on imports-from other countries should be 40s. per ton, although I thought at the same-time that 30s - per ton would be quite fair. We have no evidence to show that .with a preference of 40s. per ton Great. Britain willmot be able to hold '.her own against, thei competition of the world. On. the other hand, if we make the - preference too high, we: may create ai monopoly in favour of Great Britain. One evil might bo just as bad as the other'. Honourable members should act fairly to their own people, and then; in fixing the preference to Great Britain, consider what.is a fair amount in order that, the Old Conntrymay be able to hold her own fairly and equitably as against the foreign trader.

The better grade, known as kraft and sulphite papers, are made almost entirely of wood pulp, which is imported from Canada and Scandinavia. In addition to"" wood pulp, the chemicals used are soda ash, caustic soda, sulphate of alumina, lime, and bleach. Wood pulp is in the early stages of development in Australia. The manufacture of unglazed, or mill glazed), sulphate of alumina is now being established, browns, caps not elsewhere specibeing and supplies of the Australian article are now fied, .casings, sealings, nature :or produced used.

We have heard a great deal of the comance petition of Japan, and no other country in a better position to compete with our paper manufacturers. The honourable it. member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has poses to decrease them. told us that there are sixty large millst in Japan, and there are also smaller mills there. Many of these mills large amount of capital behind them, and the Japanese Government is subsidizing shipping companies and taking other steps to extend its foreign trade. In Auslished tralia, unless our manufacturers are properly protected, she could easily sell the local manufacturers. The duties proposed by the Minister are too low. hoped that he would propose fixed rates per cwt. of 8s. 6d., 9s., and '10s., and valorem rates of 35 per cent., 40 per and 50 per cent. I am afraid that effect of the amendment may be bad for our Australian paper mills. I have exceptional expert knowledge, but I know a little about the quality of paper, ,that of wrapping paper, strawboard, cardboard. In Victoria, the paper-making industry is decentralized. There are several mills in the country districts of the State. needs. Two of the mills are within the city boundaries, a third is at Broadloss ford, some 50 miles up the northGreene) eastern line, and there is also a mill at. Geelong. It will thus be seen that the element of decentralization is sociated with the industry. We are using, in the manufacture of wrapping paper, large quantities of straw which would otherwise go to waste, and the Broadford mill today is turning out a very much better paper than it did .a few years With anything like reasonable ment, the industry would be able to supply the whole of Australia's requirerates ments in the matter of wrapping papers and strawboard.

I hope that he has not conceded anything, because, under the existing duties, this industry has been pretty well established. The increased power of production which it now possesses is also the power of more economical production - I am speaking, of course, of the proposal which has been outlined by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill). To my mind, the duties proposed in the schedule are sufficient. We must always remember that every increased duty which we impose upon any article renders it more difficult for the 'succeeding industry to successfully carry on operations - If we unnecessarily increase the cost of the raw materials of any industry we may, perhaps, be handicapping it to a greater extent, than we are encouraging the industry which supplies it with those materials. A much stronger case will require to be made out before we shall be justified in altering the duties which are enumerated in the schedule.  glad that the amendment proposed by the Minister (Mr Greene) will not decrease the direct duties levied upon the articles comprised in paragraph 1, subitem G, but will, make for simplicity by reason of an alteration being effected in the ad valorem rates. We have paper mills in Australia which do very great credit to this country, and I am quite satisfied that, eventually, they will be able to manufacture the particular papers mentioned in this 6ub-item, in competition with other countries. The duties proposed by the Minister seem to me to be adequate, and it behoves the Committee to consider the interests, not merely of - the few paper manufacturers in Australia but of those persons who manufacture articles out of cardboard and strawboard. They are entitled to reasonable consideration. I am very pleased that the Minister is willing remove the duties upon f r u it wrapping which are set out in the schedule. bulk of the f r u it wrapping manufactured is exported, so that if a duty be placed - upon this article, it would be only sonable to allow a rebate in the case of cutting price exported f r u it wrapping.

Before 1918-19 the importations were grouped under another item, and I cannot now say what they were; but in1919-20 all. imported was practically from the UnitedStates of America, and' its value was £4,404. My notes show that inquiries have been made,, and conclusive evidence gathered to show that Australian-maderoofing felt is of good quality and gives satisfaction to users: Application was made to the Department to have admitted under departmental by-law the paper used in the manufacture of roofing felt, but it was refused in view of the output in Australia, which is practically supplying the whole of the local requirements, and will doubtless increase as the demand grows. Tho locaL production, in 1920 represented £22,000, as against £4,404, the value of the imports, and employment was directly given in the manufacture of the paper and so forth required. My notes also say that the Australian roofing felt is selling cheaper than the imported.

Some cover papers are works of art in themselves, ana to tax them in the way proposed is like taxing high-class pictures and engravings. While I agree that we should encourage the production of all kinds of cover papers that can be made here, these ad valorem duties represent an enormous tax on a few enterprising people who like to use a superior article.

I wish the M in ister would agree to make the rates respectively 8s., 9s., .and 10s., or to increase the ad valorem duties to 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50 per cent. Such additional protection would mean new life to this key industry, - which has installed much Australian-made machinery,. as well as costly machines which could only be secured from overseas. I would be prepared .to give the highest possible degree of protection. The raw materials are produced in Australia from matter which otherwise would be waste; and from that waste there is manufactured an article used in connection with a number of associated industries.",40
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Is the honourable member proposing a 50 per cent, general duty ?",40
131,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That is what I would like; but I am prepared to hear the M in ister offer a compromise. Failing any such indication, I move That the item be further amended by adding the following words to sub-item (Q) :- "" And on and after 6th July, 1921, ad val., British, 35 per cent-; intermediate, 40 per cent.; general, '50 per cent.""",40
132,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I l l a w a r r a ) [5.58] - This is a very desirable industry,' and one which should, of course, - be encouraged. Under existing conditions, however, it has been-enabled to - establish itself thoroughly, and make satisfactory profits. These latter have been largely and very wisely employed to extend the industry itself. During the war it had .a good run ; but it should not now be overlooked that it produces the raw material for a large range and^ variety of articles. D u r in g the war period the cost of some of these went so high that, in respect of certain particular lines, the cartons ordinarily used had to be dispensed with, and the abnormal conditions created considerable inconvenience to the consumer. I emphasize the fact that the returns derived by the industry ""have""been quite sufficient to enable it not only to stand against outside competition, but to extend, apparently, as far as its controllers have deemed necessary. It would be unwarrantable to add to the cost of the""raw material of associated industries, and I deprecate any alteration of the present schedule. Mr Francis* - Will the Minister agree to insert under sub-item Q reference to corrugated strawboard, which comes under sub-item s?",40
133,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That would mean a lower rate of duty.,40
134,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"- If the Minister cannot see. his way clear to accept the amendment of the honourable member for. Henty (Mr Francis), a slight increase in the general Tariff would be acceptable.",40
135,Mr JOWETT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Grampians) [6.1] - I suggest that the British rate remain at 25. per cent., and that the Minister agree to increase the intermediate aud general Tariffs to 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, respectivelyWe do not want to give higher protection against the importation of materials from Great Britain, but there is very heavy competition from foreign countries.",41
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I ' am willing to agree to increase the general Tariff from 35 per cent, to 40 per cent.",41

138,Mr FOLEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Kalgoorlie) [6.3] - I aiii sorry that the Minister has departed from the schedule rates. During the war the producers of the. class of board under discussion served a useful, national purpose; and, for that reason, they should be commended. But the. industry has. been built up well, and present profitsare - such that it may beclassed as >a really good one. It. should not be - forgotten, that this is .a key industry, and that if the Committee adds to the cost of the raw rnate^ rial certain minor industries will perhaps be seriously affected - And,, in any case, if the latter have to pay more for their working material, it will be, as usual, the general consumes who .will bear the brunt. Almost all lines of grocery and sweets, as well as dozens, of other articles, are put Hp nowadays in cardboard cartons, and, generally, in the most expensive style. I know, of course, that it will be useless to suggest a reduction of duty, but it should be borne in mind that the present rates h,ave assisted to make the industry stable and profitable - What, further degree of protection is needed,, therefore? Here: is an. instance of Protection run. mad,, to the limit, practically, of. prohibition-.. Amendment agreed to.",41
139,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Nepean) [6.7] - I move That the item be furtheramended by adding the following words to. sub-item (R) :""And on and after 6th July, 1921Millboards and leatherboards, ad val., British, free; intermediate^ 5 per cent. ; general, 15 per cent."" My reason for including leatherboard with millboards, so as to bring the former under the existing rates upon the latter, is that imported leatherboard is a productemployed in the manufacture of special boxes. Among its uses is the manufacture of a type of box used, for example, by jewellers and electroplater's. of Leatherboard is employed also for making boxes which have to carry heavy weights, and which have metal corners. Nothing but this type of board will carry metal corners; at any rate, there is no satisfactory substitute. Leatherboard is used, moreover, in tailors' boxes, and for heavier classes of foodstuffs; for instance^ :- in the putting up of tea in 71b., or 14 lb., or -21 lb. packets. Leatherboard is also largely used in respect of packages which must be posted. This class of material is the only product of its kind which is accepted by the Postmaster-General's Department without requiring that it be supported or stayed with deal battens. Bat-_ tening. of other kinds, of. boxes makes postage rates very heavy. There - is acertain amount of corrugated strawboard used, in the grocery trade as. a substitute for leatherboard; but. I do not think that the admission'of-.leatherboard free,, under. this sub-item^, will have the effect of 1 creating unfavorable competition against corrugated strawboard. All this material, I understand, is imported at present from Holland, and the duty I propose would be 15 per cent. What has been remarked concerningcosts added to certain other lines applies also in this instance. Fluctuating exchange rates affect ex? porters, and freights and handling charges are so much higher than in pre-war days that leatherboard is now costing in the vicinity of £70 per ton. As local chipboard is about £26 per ton, there is every probability of that material being substituted forleatherboitrd wherever that is - possible-. I . have before me a letter written by a customer of a large manufacturer, who says, that he will be compelled to cease using leatherboard packages for tea unless lower prices are charged. The letter continuesWe can now purchase tin containers foT prac- be packed. tically the same price as we have to pay for boxes, and unless there is a considerable drop in the price we shall use tin, which is preferable to boxes at any time. Please advise me if you are prepared to do business in this matter, otherwise we must close the account. Unless there is some relief in this direction this particular type of box will go out of use altogether.",41
140,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"They do not use leatherboard for tea packages. Mr BOWDEN / - I have been in formed that they do. I have already mentioned the different purposes for tvhich leatherboard is necessary, and I trust the Minister will be able to include it under the sub-item relating to m ill boards.",42
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.14] - The honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) must realise that if leatherboard was in cluded with millboard it would be substituted for boards which are made here. I have before me a letter from one of the principal manufacturers in Sydney to the directors of the Cumberland Paper Board Mills. It reads:During the period when it was impossible' for us to secure leatherboards from overseas, and our customers were clamouring for it j we used Cumberland leatherboard in the manufacture of boxes. We found it anexcellent board to work. Its use enabled us to keep our customers supplied, who have expressed themselves thoroughly satisfied, and have not asked again for the imported board. It is some considerable time since we first used it, and our output of boxes made from it is increasing. The communication is not-referring to a true leatherboard, but a substitute which has been produced in large quantities, which can be used for all purposes f which leatherboard is used. The honor6d., able member referred to the increased cost which duties involve. But what is the position ? Supposing an additional duty of £2 10s. were imposed-w e have manufactures. not imposed that-o n the boards required for boot boxes. The total weight material in ono gross of boot boxes is 45 makers have got? lbs., or equal to a Is. per gross of boxes, which would pack £150 worth of boots. honorablo member referred to jewellery boxes, but the total weight of a gross of these packages is2 lbs., .so that the in creased cost per gross is £d. for boxes in which, say, £150 worth of jewellery could The total weight of the material in a gross of suit boxes is 126 lbs., and the extra duty . would increase the price by 3s. l £ d . per gross, and thus make the extra cost of packing £d. per. suit. When we . get down to such details we discover the absurdity of increased charges which higher duties involve. If we adopted the proposal of the honourable member it would mean that leatherboards would be vised instead of boards produced locally, aiid much of the good that a Protective T a r i ff has done would be rendered useless.",42
142,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Nepean) [6.19] - The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr ' Greene) said that if leatherboard was in cluded with millboard the former would be used instead of boards produced locally. Wherever the local article oould be used it would be used, and only where the local article was not suitable would the leatherboard be used. Amendment negatived.",42
143,Mr JOWETT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Grampians) [ 6 . 2 2 ] - I suggest to the Minister the advisability of increasing the duties in sub-item s relating to strawboard. It has been suggested that the duties should be 4s., 5s., and 6s., respectively. I understand that the Minister will not agree to those in creases, but I ask him to realise that the manufacture of strawboard is an important industry, and that, on his own showing, these increased duties affect the community very slightly. I move That the item be further amended by adding the following words to paragraph (1) of sub-item (s) :-""And on and after 6th July, 1921 (1) strawboard, plain not lined, per cwt., British, 2s.; intermediate, 4s.; general, 5s.""",42
144,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Nepean) [ 6 . 2 4 ] - If and that amendment is defeated I shall move o r to make the duties Is. 6d., 2s., and 2s. respectively. There is always a good deal of difficulty in connection with this item in balancing evenly the assistance to be given to two different classes of",42
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,How much duty does of the honourable member think the box,42
146,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The duties do not The affect them; very much, because the freights are so high and the parcels are so bulky that very little of their manufactures can be imported.' This is one of the items in which the Committee has to try and hold the balance evenly between two classes of manufacturers. We have, on the one hand, the strawboard manufacturers, and, on the other hand, the boxmakers. When we give consideration to one set of employees in one industry we do not wish to forget the other set of employees in the other industry. The present price of strawboard is at least three times as high as it was in the pre-war times. In a pamphlet that has been distributed to honourable members the manuf acturers claim that the box-makers are indebted to the Australian mills for their existence during the war period. That argument sounds all right, but. the converse is equally true, that the millers are indebted to the boxmakers for their existence during the war period. Although it has been said that the niill-owners did not take full advantage of the war period in order to raise their prices to the level of. the rates for the imported goods, the fact remains that during that period the price of strawboard rose from £7 to between £20 and £25.",42
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,How much did the price of the raw material increase?,43
148,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,-The price of straw increased by about 20s. per ton.,43
149,Mr HILL,FREEZING PLANT FOR,The price of straw rose to £5 or £6 per ton ,43
150,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Not during the whole period of the war. But even if the prico of straw was £5 or £6 per ton, that did not justify a charge of £25 per ton for strawboard. It must be admitted that during the war the Australian mills supplied to the box manufacturers strawboard at a price below that at which Dutch, or even Japanese, board could be imported.",43
151,Unknown,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr BOWDEN"" - The Australian of paper mills have an ample market for all the strawboard they can make, but the box-makers find their market decreasing. In the boot trade less boxes are - formerly, and pastry cooks are employing paper bags instead of boxes. Sargent and Company, of Sydney, are now putthe ting all their small purchases value in bags. Their order for boxes is only one-third of what it was.",43
152,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That is because there is some cheap material coming from Japan.,43
153,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The material imported from Japan in-the past may have been nasty, but it was not cheap, and was only used because there was no other strawboard available. One Sydney firm which made a large purchase of .Japanese strawboard found that its quality was so bad that they could not use it, and eventually they sold it on the market at a loss of £5 or £6 per ton. I do not think that we have any need to fear the competition of strawboard from Japan. The Australian box-makers will not use inferior material if they can get a better article. In a circular issued to honourable members, the box-makers intimate that they are quite willing .that ,the importation of strawboard from Japan should be prohibited, but I do not see how this can be done unless the prohibition also extends to Dutch strawboard. Various opinions have been expressed as to the ability of the local mills to produce sufficient strawboard to meet the requirements of the box-makers of .Australia. The box-makers declare that the local mills cannot supply them with all their requirements, and that, therefore, it is necessary for them to import. On the other hand, the mill-owners declare that with the new machinery they have installed and are in the process of installing they may at some future-time be able to furnish all the strawboard needs of Australia. - Mr Wise - They say that next year one ""mill in Australia will be able to turn out 16,000 tons per annum, and that another mill will be able to turn out 5,000 tons per annum.",43
154,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I hope they will do so, because the Australian box-makers will use their output; but if , as a result this Tariff, the price of the strawboard is increased, it will be a case of killing the goose that lays the golden egg. ' It will kill the industry for which strawused than board forms the raw material.",43
155,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,What justification has the honourable member for saying that increase in the duty will put up the up to Is. in price of the article?,43
156,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"In every case where a duty has been increased, the price of the article has also increased. I have to admit that during, the war the Australian strawboard makers Mr ""WATKINS - Kep t Australia going.",43
157,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,No more than the box-makers kept the mill-owners going. Bothare mutually dependent upon one another. I do admit that during the war the strawboard-makers. did not put up their price nearly to that of the imported article.,44
158,Mr JOWETT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,They were very moderate.,44
159,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Yes , they were very moderate; they merely asked for a 350. per cent, advance on pre-war prices. The paper mills which are now asking for an 1 increased duty on strawboard are among the most prosperous concerns in the Commonwealth, and they became prosperous under the old Tariff.",44
160,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Why envy an Australian firm that is prosperous?,44
161,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am not expressing any envy. I am simply pointing to the fact that we have, ample evidence that the old duty was sufficient to establish the strawboard industry, and that, therefore) there is no need for an increased, duty, which may have the effect of crippling the boxmaking industry, for which strawboard is the raw material.",44
162,Mr WATKOTS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I suppose that .the honourable member knows that the Japanese, factories. are equipped with the most up to-date machinery for this kind of work?",44
163,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The answer to the honourable member's interjection is that the Australian manufacturers should also get the most up-to-date machinery fo.r. this sort of work. I believe that are installing new and modern, machinery, but .I am sorry that it is not of a larger type, beeause for very little more expeuditure a 128-in. machine could be secured which would turn out a great deal cheaper product than can a 64-in. machine. Our experience is that the strawboard turned out by Japan is so bad that our boxmakers will not use it if can get-anything else.",44
164,Mr WISE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Is that the reason why the Japanese people increased their price so greatly ?,44
165,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"They increased their price because they had our market at their mercy. The Australian mills could, not: turn out enough: strawboard.",44
166,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The honourable member is willing to excuse the Japanese, but he will not excuse the local manufacturers.",44
167,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I do not excuse the. Japanese...' In every case where Japanese, goodscame into our market, the Japanese ; manufacturers exploited usfor all we were worth, I would exclude - all Japanese goods on the ground that, they ""are absolute rubbish, not only .their, straw-board, but. also their silks, cotton, glassware, crockery, and so on. The Japanese, goods have never been up to sample. Inmany cases, the lengths were not what they were guaranteed to be. Our merchants were required to pay cash before any goods were shipped, and in nearly every instance that has come under my notice, there were short shipments and wrong shipments, or the goods were not up to sample. In fact, although the Japanese had a splendid opportunity of getting a firm hold of the Australian market, they abused it to such an extent that I do not know of any people in Australia 'who will buy Japanese goods now if they can get others. In. reply to the contention of the millowners that they have been able to supply, the. demands of the boxmakers, I hold in my hand a number of letters, datingback to 1917, written, by one firm in Sydney to the Australian Paper Mills. Each contains-.a complaint that the. firm's orders: had not been supplied. The mills wera given an order-for 40 tonsa month. They replied that they could not. supply that quantity, but would supply 20 tons; they they did not even supply that quantity. Almostevery-month a letter was sent from this firm to the mills asking and' pleading for more strawiboard, in orderto enable it to supply the orders it had for boxes. Therefore, when honourable members point out that strawboard has been coming into Australia from Japan and Holland, the simple explanation is that they it could not be got anywhere else. If the local manufacturers can supply the. demand with new, up-to-date machinery, they ought to be able to do it at less cost, and if 'they can do this, what foundation, have they for their request fora higher duty than theyhad under the oldT a r if f ? The Sydney - boxmaker, '.to whose letters I have just referred, told the Australian Paper Mills, as far back as 1914, after the last Tariff was passed, that he would take all the strawboard he required at a price £ 1 pet ton higher than that which he was paying for Dutch strawboard. Although he said that, he had to get other board, because the mills oould not supply him. These mills started in a small way, but have gradually built up their trade until they have become quite flourishing and-prosperous under the old Tariff. They were paying 25 per oent. and 30 per cent., and have watered their stock in two or three instances, yet they still pay good dividends. If they have carried money to reserves, and otherwise capitalized their profits, it shows that, in addition to the dividends they have paid, they have also made other profits. If the bonus shares represent capitalized reserves, those reserves must have been profits at some time or other. The mills are not in a doubtful or unstable position. They are not threatened by any competition that will crush them, but the box-makers, on the other hand, are losing their' trade week by week, because the price of the article they produce is - too high. We ought to go back to the old Tariff, which was sufficient to enable this industry to grow into the flourishing concern that It is now_. There is no need for the duty which appears in this schedule, and certainly no need for the increase proposed by the honourable ""member for Grampians. Amendment, by leave, amended by leaving out the words "" plain, not lined.""",44
168,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Henty) [8.20] - The honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden), who has been putting the case for a reduction of the duty, has made out an excellent case for an increase. He has saved members who are in favour of an increase a great deal of time, and we are thankful to him, as we all desire to finish the schedule, so that we may deal with other important matters for which the country is calling. The question of strawboard is more important to the Commonwealth than it may appear to any one who has not considered it , or inspected the great factories already erected or in course of erection. We recognise that other industries depend - upon the production of strawboard. A great deal has been said of the box-making industry, which is naturally concerned, but the in creasing or decreasing of the duty on strawboard has, - in my opinion, nothing to do with Sargents or any other firm putting their pastry up in bags instead of boxes. The strawboard industry is responsible, for converting into a useful manufactured article a great deal of material that might otherwise go to waste. It uses between 30,000 to 40,000 tons, and perhaps 50,000 tons, of straw per year.",45
169,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,They get it cheaper here than they do in Holland.,45
170,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am not concerned about the price of straw in Holland or Japan. I am concerned about the uses to which we are going to put our raw materials, especially when they can be manufactured into articles which will give employment to many men. Honourable members know that there is quite enough unemployment at present ; but if we do not give protection to this industry I venture to - say that the .machinery which has recently been installed will not be used for the purpose for which it should be used, fro m an Australian point of view. The industry also uses coal, thus giving employment to more hands. This coal has to be carried by sea or rail, and, altogether, the strawboard industry, considered in . relation to other industries which it helps to support, is undoubtedly worthy of the protection which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) proposes. The honourable member for Nepean said that one firm advertised for sale a quantity of Japanese strawboard. I am given to understand that there is a firm who are box-makers and also deal in strawboard. They have purchased a great deal of strawboard from' Japan and, not satisfied with making their boxes of ib, are offering it for sale in competition with the Australian-made board. What we should be concerned about, as an Australian Parliament, is the building up of Australian industries, even at a slightly increased cost, which will be spread over the whole community. I venture to think that 90 per cent, of the people will never object to that so long as it helps to push along the country pf which they are all so proud. The box-makers who are complaining about the additional cost do not complain about the quaility of the Australian boards. The honourable member for Nepean has admitted that the Australian-made article is far superior to that of Japan, . and wo .appreciate that .admission from him. We contend that it is most unfair for the box-makers to put before this Committee a case for the reduction of the duty, under the pretence that otherwise boxes will be made dearer, when they are really entering into competition with the local strawboard manufacturers by i m porting aud re-selling stuff in bulk, and not using it for box-making, the purpose for which they are supposed to . buy it . We most decidedly object to that, because that traffic in foreign strawboard has nothing to do with keeping in work any of the employees in the box-making in dustry. Australia may congratulate it self upon possessing the prosperous industry of strawboard making. It has been said that it has been paying fine dividends, aud alsothat it has watered its stock. The latter is a very bold statement to make 'without sufficient evidence that the industry has been doing anything of the kind. An y one who cares to look into the details of the working of the Australian mills will be satisfied that they have made good profits, but they have placed the whole of those profits, and even double those profits, back into the industry. They have not sent their money to Japan or elsewhere, as the boxmaking industry is doing to a slight degree, but have re-invested double the amount of money they made, by building factories and installing machinery which is a credit to Australia.",45
171,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That shows what a good ""spec."" it is.",46
172,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It is much better to have a good spec, in our own midst than in Japan. It is better to have Combines in Australia than in any foreign country. We are better without Combines altogether, but if there are any let them be here, so that we can deal with them. Unless this industry is given more protection than it has now, it will be at the mercy of the Japanese by means of dumping, although the proposed Bill may prevent dumping to a certain extent. Most honourable members have seen at Fairfield a factory in which machinery which is undoubtedly a credit to the Commonwealth has been installed.",46
173,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"We should have a quorum. [Quorum, formed.']",46
174,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It has been, said that during the war the Australian box-makers were not able to get from the local makers all the strawboard they needed. But since then new machinery has been installed, and the Australian mills will now supply the needs of the box-makers if tliese will place their orders with them. Bad as the quality of the Japanese strawboard is admitted to be, even by those who are asking for lower duties on that article, no less than 2,500 tons of it have been imported during the last nine months. I hope that the Committee will see that those who have invested capital in an industry which is employing Australian labour, and using up Australian raw material, are properly protected.",46
175,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Maribyrnong) [8.32]. - I think that the case for higher duties on strawboard has been full y made out, and I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment. The honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) supported his - argument with quotations from the letters of box manufacturers, but many of these are also importers of strawboard. This is. the advertisement of Messrs. P. J. F i r t h Limited, boxmakers, f)aper and twine merchants, of Newcastle, Sydney, and Brisbane-^We can offer Japanese strawboard 10, 12, and 14 ounce, size 25 _x 30 at 21s. per cwt. (5 cwt. lots), delivered'to your store, and subject to the usual discount of 3 per cent, for prompt cash, or' 2J per cent., monthly account.",46
176,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That is only one firm out of many.,46
177,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"When a big firm of boxmakers is an agent for Japanese strawboard, it naturally wishes to have the duties on strawboard reduced. Years ago the cry was that Australia could not make strawboard equal to that imported from Japan; but today even the honourable member himself admits, that the Australian mills turn out strawboard as good as that made in any part of the world. I remember the strawboard that was made at Broadford nearly twenty years ago, when the first T a r i ff was under discussion, and I am amazed at the i m provement of their manufacture shown by comparing their present output with that of 1902. This m ill and others have completely answered those who said that Australian strawboard was not good enough for our boxmakers. Our paper mills are the foundation of the great paperrmaking industry, which is a key industry. It has been admitted that during the war the local strawboard was sold for less than the imported strawboard, although, at that time, nearly every other manufacturer, Australian and foreign, was charging for his goods very much higher prices than we had been accustomed to pay. Our makers of strawboard, on the contrary, although they had practically the market to themselveS) dealt liberally with their customers, though, of course, they did not fail to make a profit on their capital. Within the last few days many honourable members have visited some new mills which have been equipped with the latest machinery for manufacturing strawboard to meet the demands of boxmakers and others, and today Australian mills can supply all the strawboard required in the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill ) , the honourable member for Indi (Mr Eobert Cook), and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) must admit that these mills are now using in large quantities what was once a waste product of the farm by turning straw into strawboard. I have seen the fire-stick put into great heaps of straw.",46
178,Mr LIVINGSTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That is done now. Mr Fenton"" - It may be done in South Australia, because there is not a straw mill accessible, but thousands of tons of straw elsewhere are taken to the mills and converted into strawboard. This gives employment on the farms in compressing and handling the straw, makes freight for the railways, and produces an article equal to the imported article. Why should we destroy a magnificent industry such as this? It is a natural industry of the country, and many Free Traders have said, ""We feel inclined to stay our hands in regard to native or natural industries."" The honourable member for Nepean has today resurrected opinions which died years ago, and should have been buried too deep to ever again see the light of day. If the Minister will not alter the intermediate duty, why should he not at least alter the general duty? The honourable member for Nepean put in a plea for the Dutch; [390] but they would do nothing for Australia during the war, or even in peace. When the Dutch strawboard could not be sent here, and the stocks of Japanese strawboard were short, Australian makers, as I have said, were selling their strawboard to the boxmakers of the country at what were not excessive prices. I . have here a circular, in which it is stated thatBox-makers are indebted to the Australian mills for their existence during the war period.",47
179,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Does the honourable member want me to state the other side of the case? We have all seen that circular. „,47
180,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It contains facts that are worth placing on record. It is stated, further, thatBox-makers were supplied during same period with strawboards at 100 per cent, less in price than they paid for Japanese boards. Mr - WATT-How could a thing be"" 100 per cent, less in price?",47
181,Mr HEOTOB LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,They would be ruined if they sold at that price very long.,47
182,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am merely quoting from a circular on the paper and strawboard industry. It is stated further in it - thatBox-makers were compelled to purchase Japanese boards, as the Australian mills' capacity was not equal to their demands, owing - to want of pre-war support. Before the war, orders were intermittent, box-makers sometimes using the local article and sometimes the importedBox-makers can now obtain all they require in straw and other box boards, as new mills and machinery have been erected and installed with an increased capacity of 20,000 tons per annum, at a cost of £400,000. Surely such an industry is worth protecting. Box-makers say they prefer Australian boards. They cannot obtain Australian boards cheap if through ineffective protection large importations of foreign boards cause Australian mills to run only part time or close. Box-makers can obtain cheap Australian boards if effective protection be given. I would remind honourable members that if any of these manufacturers seek to fleece the Australian public the Tariff Board will be able tb deal with them effectively; but, as is shown in this circula^ they have never attempted to do anything of the kind. Box-makers used in 1914-15 2,460 tons imported strawboards, of which Japan supplied 398 tons. Box-makers used in 1919-20 1,234 tons imported strawboard, of which Japan supplied 1,037 tons. Box-makers used in 1920-21 (nine months ending31st March) 2,514 tons imported strawboards, of which Japan supplied 2,000 tons. The figures in regard to the employment which this industry affords have already been mentioned, and I shall not repeat them. We know that it converts into a marketable commodity an almost waste product of one of our great primary in dustries, and I hope that the Oommittee will decide in favour of an increased",47
183,Mr WISE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [8.44].r-The Minister"" (Mr . Greene) has carefully considered all the representations that have been made to him in regard to'this sub-item, and while he is strongly of the opinion that the in dustry requires increased protection, he thinks' that the duties of 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s. fid. per cwt., for which he has provided in the Tariff are ample. On the price to which strawboard may be expected to come back the duty of 3s. 6d. per cwt., under the general Tariff, will be something like 35 per cent., and that, he considers, a reasonable proposition ",48
184,Mr GREGORY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Dampier) [8.45] ^ The Committee, and particularly honourable members opposite, should hesitate before increasing these duties, since the employment of a very large number of people in the box-making industry is in volved. A large number of these employees waited upon the Country Party about a week ago, and pointed out to us° that the manufacture of strawboard boxes had been popularized in Australia, with the result that a large number of men were employed in the industry, but that, owing to the present high prices of strawboard, some five hundred of their number were out of employment. It is quite possible that if we unduly increase these duties on strawboard the goods made from them will so increase in price that their use will be very much restricted. I have no personal interest in this matter. Primary producers are in terested to only a small degree in respect of the straw used in the manufacture of the boards, and the case put before us by the box manufacturers shows that they have not been too well treated by those engaged in the local strawboard industry.",48
185,Mr JOWETT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,No r by the people supplying the imported strawboard.,48
186,Mr GREGORY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"They said that the Japanese strawboard was cheaper than the Australian article, but was not satisfactory. I was pleased to hear them say that the Australian strawboard was far more satisfactory than that coming from Japan, but they pointed out that the price of the local article had in creased from £ 7 a ton before.the war, to £24 10s. per ton, and that the present price was £ 2 3 per ton. An enormous duty. quantity of coal is used in the manufacture of strawboard, iind, having regard to the rise in the price of coal - and the"" difficulties in the way of obtaining adequate supplies, there may have been some justification for that increase, but it is hard to say whether or not the whole of it can be .justified. I had a letter from a Perth trader, who states that in pre-war times strawboard made in Melbourne was sold in Perth in small quantities at l is . per cwt. Prices were raised during the war, and the strawboard manufacturers made "" a very good thing "" out of it. The writer adds that, not content with that, they secured increased duties, and, ultimately, the actual prohibition of imports of strawboard, with the result that the Victoria n article rose in price to- £45. per ton, and was sold in Perth at 57s. 6d - per cwt. My correspondent states further that there has been a good deal of profiteering in connection with this product. As to that I have no personal knowledge; but, in view of the facts I have stated, I think that the duties proposed by the Government, which, apparently, were quite satisfactory to the local manufacturers u n t i l recently, should be ample, and I hope that no further increase will be granted.",48
187,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"He n t y ) [8.50] - As there seems to be some misunderstanding as to the price of strawboard today, I desire to point out that, during the war, Dutch strawboard was selling at Home for as much as £8 0 per ton, whereas the price here today is only £ 1 9 per ton Throughout the war the price here never exceeded £ 2 0 per ton.",48
188,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Nepean) [ 8 . 5 1 ] - I would not have spoken again but for certain remarks by. the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I do not think he was quite fair in some of the statements which he made. His insinuation that the box-makers of Australia will not buy, the locally manufactured strawboard was unworthy of him .",48
189,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I did not say that.,49
190,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The honourable member said that our. mills were idle because the local box-makers would insist upon buying the imported article. May I point out that they are compelled to do so, owing to a shortage of Australian board. Only last year Mr Robert N a i l wrote to the Australian Paper Mills: We do hope that you will be able to get away some board for us this week. We have had to work-our hands short time on account of your shortage, su you understand our position.",49

194,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am quite sure that the honourable member is misinformed. The circular which was read.by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) related only to the Japanese board to which I have previously referred. The manufacturers could not use it themselves, and they endeavoured to sell it , but without success. That was twelve months ago, at the very time that Australian board manufacturers could not supply local demands. of Australia are prepared to take every ounce of strawboard which can be made in our own mills.",49
195,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Does the honourable member know* that the Sydney Morning Herald sends its waste paper to Japan?,49
196,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I do not. know that our paper mills are getting from our box manufacturers their cuttings at a very much lower price than they can be purchased at elsewhere. I understand that the average price is £ 2 3s. 6d. per ton. I do not know how that amount is made up.,49
197,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It is the result of investigation, I am assured.",49
198,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am told that the figures have been checked, but there is not a single box-maker that I know of who is getting that price. Mr Robert Nail, one of the biggest manufacturers in Sydney, receives only 10s. per ton for his waste paper, and though he has asked for more he has failed to get it . [390]- 2",49
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That is for only one transaction.,49
200,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"No ; every b it of his waste paper during the past five - or six years has been sold for 10s. per ton. The box-makers in Brisbane get nothing for their waste product"", although the. board mills will cart it away for them. In Melbourne, the box-makers receive 22s. 6d. per ton for their waste cute, and in Adelaide they get from 5s. to 10s. per ton.",49
201,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,If they did not get that they would have to burn it .,49
202,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That may be so. Upon the other hand, this waste is the raw material for certain mills.",49
203,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Strawboar d is cut into sizes for commercial use, so that there is very littl e waste in it .",49
204,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It is not always cut into sizes for commercial use. Mr Nail has informed me that in connection with his particular work, there is a good deal of waste. It is not true that the Australian box-makers as a whole are anxious to secure a reduction of the duty upon strawboard in order that they may use the imported article. But they fear that if the duty be increased, the price of strawboard will rise even higher than it is. S'hould that result be brought about, the industry will be killed.",49
205,Mr WEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"East Sydney) [8.56] Box-makers The statements made by some honourable members have caused me at times to in dulge in some very hearty laughs. Speaking of strawboard, I may mention that only a littl e while ago I saw an advertisement relating to a theatrical artist who had come to Australia for the purpose of getting rich quick. I am quite satisfied that if But I he knew the returns which are being obtained by the manufacturers of strawboard he would rush like a madman to invest his money in the industry. I presume that the figures in my possession contain a certain amount of truth , although during the Tariff debate it has been exceedingly difficult to arrive at the truth. Some honourable members have been very anxious to quote figures, and whilst figures do not lie, the members who quoted them have often been absolute liars-the greatest liars that one can imagine.",49
206,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That is unparliamentary language.,49
207,Mr WEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It is parliamentary truth . The honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), who desires to obtain an increased duty upon strawboard, does not know much about the balance-sheets of those engaged in the industry. For the year ended 31st December, 1919, I learn that the profits of the industry amounted to £39,000 upon a. capital of £236,425, ""notwithstanding the serious industrial disturbances which compelled the cessation of work."" Within a period of six years and six months of troublous times those engaged in the industry wiped out the whole of their capital liability. During four years and nine months their net profit was £27,409 upon a capital of £129,969. The second machine of the Australian Paper and Board Mills, according to their balance-sheet, commenced to run in April, 1920, and according to the mills should have reduced the cost of production. But the prices were not reduced. ""With all these new appliances we' are told that prices should have declined. prices have not come down, and these enormous profits have been made. I understand that some honourable members opposite are connected with public companies, but I do not think they know of any company in a better position than this one. Why, even public houses do not return anything like such profits. The only excuse I can see for honourable members who desire to raise these duties is either that they or their friends are shareholders, or they know nothing whatever about the subject. The honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) is a Free Trader, whereas I am a Protectionist, but I should like to endorse some of his remarks. An affidavit has been shown to me by a firm in Sydney to the effect that the Broadford mills received an order for 40 tons of strawboard per month, the order guaranteeing that payment wotild be made twenty-one' days after delivery. That surely is not a bad order, and yet, two years and a half after, it has not been fulfilled, those who gave the order being thankful for what they can secure, and praying to God for more next month. I have no personal interest in the Sydney industry; deed, I do not suppose that the gentleman At the head of the company, if he lived in my electorate, would give me a vote. Personally, he and I are very friendly, but I feel sure he would not vote for my party; nor would he, I believe, give a vote to some honourable members opposite. Mr West. In 1911, when the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs, and we rectified some of the anomalies in the Tariff, the duty on strawboard was reduced because the mills in Victoria could not produce the necessary supplies. At that time,"" the company promised that the mills would be so improved in the next few years as to be able to meet the requirements of all Australia. However, no improvement has been made to the mills; and this I do not quite understand, for Mr Macdonald is a shrewd .Scotchman, and always anxious for a share of the '-'bawbees."" In connection with this company, we must also remember that all the profits are not shown in the dividends.",49
208,Mr FRANCIS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"How does the honourable member know that the company, paid dividends? The Mr WEST - The honourable member is a "" new chum "" here, ancl has much to learn. Under all the circumstances, although I am a Protectionist in regard to some items, .and a prohibitionist in regard to others, I shall vote for a continuance of the present duties. This industry provides the raw. material for the boxmaking industry, which will be greatly assisted if strawboard be kept at a reasonable price. To make the price of strawboard prohibitive would benefit none but the strawboard manufacturers, and if these can get all their invested capital returned in something over four years, they must be gluttons not to accept the present Tariff.",50
209,Mr WATT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I wish we had more speeches like yours on the Tariff.,50
210,Mr WEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"When I took part in the general debate, I showed why I am a Protectionist ; I do not wish Australians to be mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, or just pick-and-shovel men. We all know the universal use to which strawboard boxes are put. If you buy a pair of boots they are put in a box,, so in- with a dozen handkerchiefs, and so with the chocolates when you take your best girl to the opera. It is well to encourage this sort of thing.",50

When the last Tariff was under consideration the Committee refused to .increase the rates, but certain increases were included in ' the 1908 Tariff. When piano parts were under consideration, I reminded honourable members that the price of pianos ab the present time is almost prohibitive. It has been said that the Australians are a musical peopleaccording to this morning's newspapers, the Victorians are-particularly so-and , if such is the case, every consideration should be shown those who desire to acquire the art of piano playing by allowing instruments, particularly those of British manufacture, to be imported at a reasonable price. The piano is a most popular instrument, its use tends to brighten the home life, particularly of inter- those who live in the country, and in teaching the pianoforte many thousands earn their livelihood. In 1908, the shop price of the average imported piano, in Germany or Great Britain, was about £20.",53

On previous occasions, when the duties on pianos were under consideration, we were informed that the industry was languishing,and that, if higher rates were not imposed, the manufacturer would have to suspend operations. Higher duties have not been imposed for some years, but local production has increased, and with the present natural protection of approximately 80 per cent., there is no justification for increased duties.",53

The present duty, added to the other costs of importation, represents a total protection of from 144 per cent, on the cheaper piano down to 113 per cent, on the most expensive piano. In this way a proportionately greater burden is borne by the people who can afford to buy only the cheaper instrument. I do not think that any one will say that the piano industry in Australia needs protection to anything like that extent.",54

(showing an excess duty on account of the exchange of £ 3 10s. 4d); total landed cost of the instrument, £79 8s., which represents a natural protection, without duty, of 81 per cent., and with duty the protection is 144 per cent. Another piano costing, at the factory, £94 12s. l i d . , at the ordinary rate of exchange, cost at the present rate of exchange, calculated at $3.95 to the £ 1 , £ l i 6 9s. 2d, The freight was £16 6s. 6d.; commission, insurance, and wharfage, £10 17s. 9d.;. duty, £56 7s. 10d., at the present rate of exchange, instead of £45 16s. 9d., at the ordinary rate, so that there was an additional duty of £10 l is . Id., due to the. adverse exchange. These charges made the landed cost £200 Is. 3d., representing, a natural protection of 52 per cent., and, with duty, a total protection of 113 per cent.",54
244,Mr WATT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,What make of 'piano was the latter?,54
245,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"It was an American grand, but of what make I cannot say. Those figures show that the Committee is justified in reducing the present duty. That duty was quite sufficient in ordinary times, and I am quite sure that, having regard to all additional costs that are now borne by the importers, the Australian manufacturers will be fully prois so. tected by the lower duties I am suggesting.",54
246,Mr CORSER,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Wide Bay) [9.50] - I would like the Minister to agree to reduce the duties on pianos; I think the protection suggested' in the amendment will be quitesufficient. We should remember that there are, in the far west country, a large number of people who cannot go to picture' shows and theatres, and whose only means of entertainment is the piano in their home. They do not desire to buy cheap pianos, because the freight and charges in connection with their transport to the interior are just as high as on the more expensive instruments. A piano is a necessity, in outback homes where children are taught by. governesses. We want population in these outer districts and we ought to encourage people to settle there by giving them this: facility not only for entertainmentbut also for educating their children musically. Therefore I suggest a reduction of this duty. No doubt the Inter-State Commission has recommended these high rates, bub I doubt if they took into consideration the aspect of the question I have just put forward. A duty of 45 per cent, adds £ 2 5 15s.. to the price of a cheap piauo costing £ 5 0 at the factory.",54
247,Mr LAIEDSMITH,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I understand that the local piano makers get most of their wood from Queensland.,55
248,Mr CORSER,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Yes . I have no doubt they find the Queensland timber a most suitable one. I have no desire to kill,, eleven retard, the local piano-making in dustry, and I want to see pianos made in Australia, but I understand that a large proportion of the instruments turned out of the local factories are merely assembled in Australia tmd not manufactured wholly. There are no piano factories in some States - However, the plea I am putting forward is on behalf of the people m the outer districts and some 20,000 teachers, also scores of thousands ofchildren.",55
249,Mr LIVINGSTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Barker) [9.54] I hope that the duty will be reduced on these instruments which are so much used in the, back parts of the country. By letting people get cheap pianos we shall encourage a liking for music.",55
250,Mr WISE,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [9.55] - It is rather interesting to note that the Inter-State Commission, which no one could imagine to be a Protectionist body, recommended a duty of 35 per cent, against the United Kingdom aud 40 per cent, against other countries. The local manufacturers made an application for an increased duty, and after hearing the evidence tendered the Commissioners recommendedThe Commission thinks that the industry is worthy of special encouragement, - and that there appears no reason why the greater proportion of the Australian demand should not be met by local manufactures. The percentage cost of labour to factory cost is. greater than in most industries, and a large proportion of skilled labour is necessary. It is probable, with the successful establishment of the piano industry in Australia, that the present excessive price tb the consumer, largely due to distributing expenses, &c, and to the present competition, necessitating expensive advertising and heavy commissions, will be substantially reduced. Tbis, it has been asserted, has been the case in the United States of America. Tariff. . [5 JUL Y, 1921.] Tariff. 9675 There is one large piano factory in Sydney and there is another in Melbourne, where still another is about to be established. I propose to adhere to the rates of duty as set out in the schedule.",55
251,Mr WATKI NS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Newcastle) [9.56] I do not know why honourable members are worrying about a reduction in these rates .of duty, seeing that Queensland timbers are used in making Australian pianos. The keyboards are made of Queensland ebony.",55
252,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I l l a w a r r a ) [9.57];-Honourable members are probably worrying about these duties--because.they want the working people to get pianos as cheaply as the honourable member for Newcastle got his when he bought it at about one-third of the price his son will, have to pay if he buys one for his children. I expected to hear some explanation of why this enormous tax is to be put on the users of pianos in order to establish thepiano making industry in Australia. We have in this Tariff gone through the whole range of Australian industries, and nowhere has any one been able to point out.anything approaching the increased cost of these particular in struments. A piano that costs £ 3 4 to manufacture abroad cannot be purchased in Australia today for less than £ 9 5 or £100, and the - Australian-made piano cannot be bought for much under that price.",55
253,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Hear , hear!",55
254,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I do not know why the honourable member should say. ""Hear, hear"" to the fact that an article posts nearly three times as much to manufacture in Australia as it can be! made for elsewhere. It certainly is not due to the increased cost of the Australian timber or to the fact that the Australian labour used in its manufacture is three times more costly than labour in America.",55
255,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Do you object to that?,55
256,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I do not object to a thing that does not exist. Australian labour is not three times as costly as that of America. But I object to paying this enormous amount of money to establish an industry when the money is not spent either in wages or in material, and I think that the cost of this article ought to call for condemnation., from the men who pretend to represent the working classes. The idea that we should consent to the payment of a duty amounting to twice as much as the actual cost of the commodity abroad is utterly repugnant to my idea of what is a fair deal. I see no reason why the piano industry should be picked out for this special favour. It is protected by the cost of freight and by the conditions under which it manufactures, and it has every reason to be satisfied with a fair deal. This Tariff goes very far beyond a fair deal. The amendment of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) still leaves an immense margin for the manufacturer to work upon. While one would go a long way to assist in the establishment of the industry in Australia-and it has had a great deal of assistance-it is not right in matters of music that we should place imnecessarily high duties on pianos of different kinds and different tones, which may be preferred by artists visiting this country, or by. Australians who become experts in piano playing. matter what degree of perfection the manufacture of Australian pianos may attain, there will always be in the community a number of people who prefer an instrument' of a different tone, just as there are people who prefer certain English, American, or German makes of piano. We should not put an unnecessarily heavy tax on those who wish to have the instruments which they think better suited to the expression of their reading of different musical compositions.",55
257,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,That applies to everything. It is the old prejudice against the Australian article.,56
258,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The honourable member is very apt to attribute to other people prejudices that he does not feel himself, and that he has.no right to attribute to me, at any rate. ' He cannot charge me with failure to appreciate things Australian. I have done just as much for Australian industries as he has, but I have not forgotten the lessons I learned when following the leaders he was following. One of them was that some manufacturers reach out for a great deal more than they are entitled to. Here is the evidence of it. We have no right to ask the Australian workman or any other man in Australia who wants to buy a piano to pay £2 for every £ 1 of its original manufacturing cost. ,I am certain that the higher-class pianos in America are not produced by cheap labour or under conditions that make it easy to produce them cheaply, except the one condition, that they have a larger output. The Australian manufacturer employing Australian workmen, who are amongst the best in the world, ought to be able to produce a piano pretty nearly as cheaply here as it can be produced in America. If a piano can be produced in America for £34, it ought to be possible by efficient management to produce and. sell profitably a similar instrument in Australia for £50, at any rate. To say that they cannot produce and sell a piano in Australia under from £95 to £100 is asking me to believe altogether too much. I shall vote for the amendment of ths honourable member for Nepean, although I should gladly support a further reduction in the duty - .. No Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [10.5] The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) does not appear to be aware that the American worker is protected by. a much higher Tariff than we are asking for. No one will deny that in America the manufacture of pianos is well established. The Steinway, for instance, commands a higher price tb an any other make in the world, yet in America the duty on pianos in the 1918 Tariff was 35 per cent., and that rate has been since raised.",56
259,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Our protection is higher than that. It is 45 per cent, against America.",56
260,Dr MALONEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Our duty against the United Kingdom is 30 per cent. In America the duty on parts is 35 per cent. Here the duty is only 15 per cent, on keyboards.",56
261,Mr BOWDEST,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"No ; it is'30 per cent.,. 40 per cent., and 45 per cent.",56
262,Mr WATT,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"The duty is 15 per cent, only on keyboards prescribed by departmental regulations.",56
263,Dr MALONEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I want a fair duty which will give our own workers a chance as against the Home land, and then I will give to the Home land as big a preference as this Committee dares to vote. I say ""dares to vote"" because there is too much lip-loyalty and too little real desire to help the Home land. I do not believe that the workers of Great Britain want the Australian workers to be placed at a disadvantage. Let us meet them on equal terms by means of a fair duty as against Great Britain, and then impose higher rates to help us against other countries, especially the late enemy countries. I should like to see the duty on keyboards raised to 35 per cent. Our rates are not as high as tliose which obtained in America in 1918, and it must be remembered that all the duties in that country have been greatly increased since the war. The great danger we have to guard against is dumping, especially what is known as "" difference of exchange dumping."" The honourable member for Nepean spoke about a piano costing £35 in Germany. In Berlin, in 1914, a very good piano could have been bought for £20; but, for the sake of argument, let me put the figure at £30, and assume that the cost of production in Germany has increased since that date by 300 per cent. That would make the cost of that piano in Germany £120 at the present date. The sum of £30 sent from here to Germany by the permission of the Minister for Trade and Customs, or by credit through Great Britain, would realise twelve and a-half times as much, which means that it would be worth in Germany today £375. Therefore, £30 to day would buy three German pianos in Berlin equal to one which it would have bought before the war. What chance would our piano manufacturers have if German pianos were allowed to come in on that basis? It would be an infamy. The High Court of Australia has ruled that the special regulation which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) wished to impose in regard to exchange is ineffective. No doubt, the honourable member for Nepean conscientiously believes in Pree Trade, but no country ever grew great under that policy.",56
264,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Grea t Britain did.,57
265,Dr MALONEY,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"No . When Queen Victoria came to the throne, there were seventy-six Customs offences for which death was the penalty. Great Britain was a revenue-tariff country; never a Free Trade country. Any one who consults Mulhall's Statistics will find that, with the exception of the two Scandinavian countries, .Great Britain levied more taxation at the Customs House, per head of population, than ""any other European, countrymore than France, Germany, or Italy took from their' peoples-and the poor were' not studied by the British Tariff. As Protection built up Germany, under the wisdom of Bismarck, and as it built up the United States of America, so I want Australia to be built up. I want this country, which has benefited by Protection, to have a still better chance in the future; and, therefore, I shall vote to increase, rather than to decrease, duties.",57
266,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Maribyrnong) [10.13]. - During the last year before the war,' Great Britain exported to this country pianos worth about £60,00.0; Germany, pianos worth about £80,000; and the United States of America, pianos worth about £47,000. These figures make it evident that if the duties were reduced, Germany would practically have the field, to herself. I understood the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) to complain that the rates would amount to. £17 10s. on a'grand piano and to £9 10s. on an upright piano.",57
267,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FREEZING PLANT FOR,I do not object to those rates; it is the ad valorem rates that I object to.,57
268,Mr FENTON,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I shall vote to protect our manufacturers from the competition ofthose of Germany and the United r States of America. Great Britain, I think, is given a fair preference. Although in the United States of America the price of pianos averages about £40, an American piano cannot be bought in Australia for less than £90 or £ 9 5 . Therefore, it is evident that if there were no duty, American pianos would still be very dear here.",57
269,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Nepean) [10.15] When duties are increased, the price of the imported manufactures on which they are levied is increased, and the prices of the local manufactures increase in keeping with them. New Zealand imposes a duty of 20 per cent, on pianos, and yet her people manufacture them as successfully as they are made here, where, it is said, a protective , duty of 45 per cent, is needed.",57
270,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,On e buys a piano only once in 30 years. *,57
271,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"That is no reason for having to pay for it twice as much as one ought to pay. The two makers of pianos in Australia keep the whole of their business in their own hands, making themselves the middlemen.",57
272,Mr WATKINS,FREEZING PLANT FOR,Because they sell direct to the public.,58
273,Mr BOWDEN,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"No ; they do not. They have their own shops, their own salesmen, and their own overhead charges. It is no cheaper for them to sell them than "" for any one else. dealers are not supplied by them, because they want everything for themselves. Apparently, the Committee is willing that they shall entirely control the piano trade of Australia. If , in New Zealand, pianos can be made profitably with a protection of 20 per cent., that duty should be high enough, to protect our piano makers, who have a much larger home market..

But I am in receipt of a telegram from - my friend in the Territory, which I propose to read, as it tells us what has recently occurred there. The telegram is as follows:- "" Echo of Minister Poynton'e ""at home"" prior departure Darwin. Local court today Harold Melson sued Francis Urquhart, Administrator of Northern Territory for £31 damans for assault. Trial took place before Special Magistrate and special jury. Plaintiff alleged that on the King's Birthday, in afternoon, be was outside Government House delivering dodgers, when defendant came out of his residence towards him in a threatening manner and struck him three times on the shoulder, wanting to know why he was sending niggers into hia place with such rubbish. Defendant was very excited and heated. Five witnesses corroborated plaintiff's evidenoe in various particulars. Defendant denied the assault, and claimed he merely tapped Nelson on forearm with his twofingersto draw his attention. Jury after brief retirement Teturned unanimous verdiot for plaintiff, awarding £1 damages. Magistrate enteredverdict for same, with costs. Norman Barratt for plaintiff and D. Roberta tor defendant. In course of proceedings Administrator interjected and was aalled. to order by the Magistrate. Seeing that the Territory is the only part of Australia which was recently free from industrial disturbances, and that its affairs were admirably administered by Mr Staniforth Smith, .without any complaint on the part of the local residents, and in view of the terrible ordeal to whioh they were subjected under the regime of Dr Gilruth, Judge Bevan, and Mr Carey, all of whom have been sent to the right-about, I ask the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) to stop the little fiddling prosecutions which are being instituted there for the non-payment of taxation until the Minister for Home.and Territories (Mr. Poynton) returns here. The Northern Territory residents have no representa' tion in this Parliament,, although they f reviously had representation both in the .egislative Oounoil and House of Assembly of South. Australia. They have the honour of haying contributed the largest amount per head of population to the Bed Gross Fund, and they also'hold the premier position amongst those who offered their fives on behalf of the Empire during the recent war. They are fighting only for the principle of no taxation without representation; and I hope, therefore, that the Acting Prime Minister will accede to my request Let us, as Australians who love our country, give them, and even the residents of Papua, the right to be represented in this Parliament.",59
281,Sir JOSEPH COOK,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) { 10.35] - In reply to my honourable riend, I merely wish to say that this Government have attempted to' give the residents of the Northern Territory representation in this Parliament, but without success. The only way in which that can now be done is by the election of a Parliament whose members are in favour of granting them such representation. Meantime,, it is impossible for the Government to remit taxation in the case of theso people-taxatio n purely for local purposes. I do not think anything can excuse what, on the face of the press report, Nelson did upon the day in question. I put it to my honourable friend, the good doctor, whether, if he were hold-? ing a little social function, celebrating his GXBSOU, Standard. birthday, for example, he would like an enemy to hire blackboys to scatter objectionable literature amongst his guests? The honourable member would be the first to resent that. , Dr MALOPnrr - I would have asked him into the. house and given - bitn the best seat that I had, because I love him for what he has done up there.",59
282,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,FREEZING PLANT FOR,"I am speaking of his action upon the particular day in question. Nothing can excuse or justify it - However,, the Administrator took matters into his. own hands, with the result that he has had to pay £1. If he merely tapped Nelson lightly upon the shoulder, he did not get much for his £1. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.37 p.m.",59
