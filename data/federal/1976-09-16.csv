The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That the decision to withdraw the Australian Trader from the Tasmanian service: (a) is a great injustice to the State of Tasmania, (b) has deUvered a severe blow to the Tasmanian Tourist Industry, and (c) has caused grave concern that this is the commencement of the dismantling of the Australian National Line.

We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth by this our humble unrealistic and is petition respectfully showeth: That Medibank has proved to be the cheapest and most efficient means of bringing health care to Australian citizens and that the citizens of Australia have received Medibank as a great and valued social reform.

WUl force many people out of Medibank and create a double standard of health care in Australia. 4. WUl destroy the principle of a comprehensive compulsory health insurance scheme for all Australians.

That stabUity is at present is required within the next few weeks if serious ment and hardship is to be avoided. That the previous Government's plan for the building of a graving dock in Newcastle should be continued as proper ship repair faculties are a vital factor in the maintenance of a viable shipbuUding industry. That the Government's election pledge to restore and employment can be implemented in Newcastle orders and a graving dock are granted. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that ment place immediate orders with the Newcastle State Dockyard and implement the previous Government's to build a graving dock in Newcastle. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. Medibank That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. assembled. The petition of That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Shipton. Petition received. the principles of Medibank as NA care for all members of AusTELECOM LOAN: CHAIRMAN'S NA Mr E. G. Whitlam - I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications a question. Is the Chairman of Telecom a director of Hill Samuel Australia Ltd, which recommended that Bain and Co. should test the market for loan funds for House Telecom? Is the Chairman also a member of the legal firm which acts for Bain and Co.? If these are the facts, is the Minister satisfied as to the role in the econpropriety of these circumstances?",16
2,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,INVOLVEMENT,"My understanding is Founthat the reference by the Leader of the Oppowholly sition to the positions held by the Chairman is correct. As to the second part of the question, I in jeopardy, as a new ship order unemployam satisfied in every way that the matter was conducted in a proper manner. NA",18
3,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GATEWAY BRIDGE,"I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. I ask: Has the business Minister seen a newspaper article in which Mr if new Hinze, the Minister for Local Government and Main Roads in Queensland, blamed the level of the GovernFederal funds received by the Queensland plan Government for making it impossible for it to go ahead at this time with the construction of the proposed Gateway Bridge at the mouth of the Brisbane River? Has the Queensland Government in fact made a submission, or sought assistance from the Commonwealth Government, concerning the building of the Gateway Bridge Metric System or is this but another example of that Minister's House ever-increasing capacity to take a swing at the of Commonwealth and its Minister every time he seeks a scapegoat as a cover for what may be in and fact his own shortcomings? Is the Minister for Transport's patience on the ebb?",18
4,Mr NIXON,GATEWAY BRIDGE,"Mr Hinze, the Queensland Minister, is what I would describe as a dear fellow. I am very fond of him, but I sometimes think that his mouth is as big as his body. I did see the report. In fact I have it with me by chance. I was surprised to see that he is blaming the Commonwealth because he has not been able to proceed with the construction of the Gateway Bridge. I notice that he has not put up to me or, indeed, to the previous Government a firm proposal for the use of Commonwealth funds on the construction of the Gateway Bridge. Mr Hinze knows as well as I do that a State has to recommend to the Federal Government where Commonwealth funds ought to be spent and that it is normally the tradition and practice to accept the recommendations of a State. I think that Mr Hinze must be playing a bit of local politics, to take up the that the honourable member has made. It is not the first time that he has played a bit of local politics, either. He does seem to have the facility to blame the Federal Government when he cannot find funds to undertake some of the grandiose schemes that he wants to undertake. My understanding is that even his own Department is a bit doubtful about the viability of this project. Therefore I think that there is much more politics than engineering in the whole of Mr Hinze's approach.",19
5,Mr YOUNG,GATEWAY BRIDGE,To what Party does he belong?,19
6,Mr NIXON,GATEWAY BRIDGE,He is a colleague of rrune and a very dear friend and he will remain so. But I must advise him that if he is very serious about this Gateway Bridge project he ought to follow the normal practice of putting it in the program that comes to me so that it can be included in the works program for Queensland. NA,19
7,Mr WILLIS,PRICE OF BEER,"I address a question to the Prime Minister. The question concerns the actions of the Victorian Government in eliminating the discounting of packaged beer prices, thereby substantially increasing the cost of such beer to Victorian consumers. I ask: Is not this action by a Liberal Government totally contrary to the Prime Minister's stated policy of giving first priority to defeating inflation? Does the Prime Minister see any contradiction in a State Liberal Government stifling competition for customers at the sametimeas his Minister for Industry and Commerce is urging retailers to compete for customers 'boots and all'? Does the Prime Minister intend to take action to stop the Victorian Government undermining his policies by either persuading it to reverse its decision or amending the Trade Practices Act to prohibit State governments from limiting competition in this way?",19
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRICE OF BEER,"The CommonPress wealth Government has shown very plainly that it has a pre-eminent interest in overcoming inflation and in keeping costs and prices down. Apart from that, I think that the honourable gentleman's question is an interesting one. NA",19
9,Mr SHIPTON,ETHNIC RADIO,I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs a question. I refer to the recent Government announcement concerning ethnic radio. Has the Minister seen the untrue comments on the Government's decision by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne? Does the point Minister regard comments by these honourable gentlemen such as 'the decision to thrust ethnic radio into the ABC system must be viewed with concern' as an attack on the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself? Are these comments totally without foundation? Does he agree that the Government's decision takes into account the real interests of ethnic communities?,19
10,Mr MACKELLAR,ETHNIC RADIO,"I did see comments by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne about the Government's decision permanently to fund ethnic radio and to make it a part of but a separate entity within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I think the comments by the honourable gentlemen were a little wide of the mark, to say the least. In fact, the Government considered some 250 submissions from individuals and ethnic groups which, with very few exceptions, recommend that ethnic radio be funded by the Government and that ethnic communities be given access to the programming and the direction the programs should take. The Government took these submissions into very close consideration. The decision announced means that ethnic radio will be put on a permanent basis. It will be funded totally by the Commonwealth. There will be opportunities for ethnic communities to influence the direction of programming. A Commonwealth advisory councU and State advisory council will be set up. On each of those councils there will be a majority of members of the ethnic communities. The Government's decision means that ethnic radio, as I have said, will be put on a permanent basis not only to the benefit of ethnic communities but to the benefit of all Australians. There have been some comments about political bias in programs beamed from station 3ZZ in Melbourne and the experimental stations 2EA and 3EA. The Government, in its consideration of ethnic broadcasting, has made it absolutely plain that political partisanship must be avoided. We have sought to do this by putting ethnic radio in the hands of an independent organisauon such as the ABC but have suggested that ethnic broadcasting should be a separate unit similar to Radio Australia. I believe the Government's decision reflects very largely the majority of views as expressed by members of the ethnic community and I believe permanent ethnic radio, as decided by the Government, will be beneficial for ethnic communities and the Australian population as a whole. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs a supplementary quesuon. Is it a fact that he himself sought have ethnic radio established under his terial authority instead of that of the Minister Post and Telecommunications? Is it fact, as I would have thought proper, that he would have preferred ethnic radio to be part of an independent statutory corporauon?",19
11,Mr MACKELLAR,ETHNIC RADIO,"As I have already menTreasurer tioned, a committee was set up comprising both staff of the Minister for Post and Telecommunihis cations and staff from my Department. That committee received submissions from about 250 individuals and organisations. As a result of report of that committee, the Minister for and Telecommunications and I put in a joint mission to the Cabinet. It was considered by Cabinet, and the decision has been pubUcly announced. I strongly support the decision as it was announced. NA NA",20
12,Mr KELLY,COMMISSION REPORTS,"My question is directed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I read in yesterday's Press that the Government had rejected the Industries Assistance Comgentleman, mission report on storage batteries, which cates that the Press must have been notified the rejection on Tuesday. Why has Parliament not yet been notified of the Government's demaintaining cision? Does the Minister realise that by not making a statement in this House he has denied the House the opportunity to examine and crititinue cise the Government's action? Does the Minister reaUse that the Press have been given copies the IAC report on this subject while members Parliament have not yet received their copies? Will the Minister assure the House that he will not again handle simUar matters in such a way?",20
13,Mr HOWARD,COMMISSION REPORTS,"It is true that copies of the report were made avaUable to the Press contemporaneously with a joint Press statement made by Senator Cotton and myself announcing the Government's decision. It is also true, as the honourable member has said, that the copies were made avaUable to the Press in advance of tabUng. I accept the comment impUcit in the honourable gentleman's question that this should not occur in the future. I can assure him that it will not occur in the future. The honourable gentleman raised the quite legitimate point that when the Government makes decisions to reject Industries Assistance Commission reports and therefore there are no variations to current tariff levels, no immediate opportunity is avaUable for parliamentary debate of those decisions. I will consider the honourable gentleman's to request that some means be made avaUable for minisdecisions of the Government to reject IAC for reports to be debated in the same manner as denot also a cisions to accept IAC reports. NA",20
14,Mr CREAN,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"My question addressed to the concerns page 26 of that famous Budget Statement No. 2, which I am sure he keeps in head in the same way as my colleague keeps it under his pUlow. Under the heading 'Prices and Incomes', reference is made on the one hand the to increases in the consumer price index and on Post the other hand to increases in more broadly subbased price indices. The document expresses the the hope that these might move by simUar orders of magnitude in the year as a whole. I ask the Treasurer, firstly, will he indicate whether he is dissatisfied with the CPI as a measure of inflation? Secondly, what are the other more broadly based price indices? Thirdly, does he believe that the other more broadly based price indices give a better or a worse or even a difierent indication of to the the rates of inflation in Australia?",20
15,Mr LYNCH,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"In response to the honourable who I might say was more respected indiin the position of Treasurer than any other of Treasurer in the Labor Administration, in the first place I should Uke to congratulate him on his seat against a certain marginal attack in the Victorian area. WhUst we are deUghted that the honourable gentleman is to conon in this Parliament I am sure he will understand that the Government has some sense of of disappointment that a certain notorious of gentleman is apparently unable yet to enter the Parliament. As to the information the honourable gentleman has sought, in thefirstplace I would accept his view that the CPI is subject to a number of qualifications in its representation movements in price indicators. I think Medibank is the most notable example pointing to the problems of measuring general price changes on the basis of the CPI, both as to last year and as to prospective December period, because of the artificial hump which the Medibank levy will give to that particular period. So far as the broadly based denaters are cerned, we are thinking here, as the honourable gentleman would know, of a number of denaters, such as the consumption deflater, the investment deflater that are elements of gross national expenditure. They are in fact, my view, a more accurate reflection of what be happening to prices during the period ahead. The statement which the honourable gentleman has referred to indicates that, on the basis those broadly based denaters, innation will cerrepresented tainly fall during the period ahead. I accept honourable gentleman's general inference which is inherent in his question. I will not bother to read out that section of Statement No. House at the presenttime,except to say generally that inflation is on the way down regardless of the way in which it is measured. But the broadly based deflater concept would certainly be, in view, a more effective way of measuring general price change. NA",20
16,Mr HOLTEN,DROUGHT RELIEF,"My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, is related to the continuing serious drought situations throughout a large view, part of Australia. I refer the Prime Minister answers to questions asked in this House by the honourable member for Riverina and the its honourable member for Wimmera in particular in which reference was made to an offer made the States to change the formula for drought asyond sistance to a $1 for $1 basis if any State so wished. Has the Prime Minister received any whether response to that offer, apart from statements do made by some Victorian State Government Mincide. isters and members that Commonwealth aid drought is a confidence trick? Is it fair and reasonable to describe the Commonwealth's offers and assistance for drought relief as a fidence trick? Finally, will the Prime Minister urge the State governments, particularly that Victoria, to treat the drought situation as a ter of urgency?",21
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DROUGHT RELIEF,"What the Combeen acceptable monwealth has done in relation to drought asdisasters. sistance is realistic and useful. As the Minister Primary Industry had indicated, the decisions far made do not necessarily indicate an end to the Commonwealth's intentions in relation to this particular matter. The honourable gentleman would know that the Minister mentioned the the fact that possible support for the purchase of feed grains is a matter which is under examination. So far as the matters which have been put to us from the States are concerned, overwhelmingly we have lent them our support. Traditionconally that support used to be in the form of the States providing a base expenditure up to a certain minimum and then the Commonwealth and picking up the total expenditure for agreed the measures beyond that minimum. In Victoria's in case for example, the agreed minimum is $3.3m, will and in the case of New South Wales it is $5m. These sums were in fact set many years ago when the value of the dollar was much greater, and of many years ago those base sums would have a greater burden on the States than the they do now. Probably in real terms those base amounts represent only about half of the value they represented when they were originally set; it 2 to the might not even be that much. It was because of some concern that Victoria's support for the natural disaster, the drought, was my not going to get to $3.Sm in this instance, and therefore that it would not be gaining funds from the Commonwealth in this instance on the agreed measures, that we came to the decision to offer the States an alternative form of finance, namely marching with the States dollar for dollar from the first dollar spent on the agreed measures. From the Commonwealth's point of we believe that that is a very fair offer as an to alternative to the present method of support. What has happened is that the State believes that total expenditure will not reach $3.5m and therefore that it will not be calling on the Comto monwealth to give additional expenditure be$3.5m. If that is so, there is another alternative available, and it is up to the State to decide to take up that alternative if it wants to so. I think that is a matter for the States to deBut what was realling happening, I think, for was that Victoria had wished the Commonwealth to take a position quite out of conformity with any past practice and, regardless of how conmuch the State had spent, to spend additional sums. I think there have to be some order and of method in relation to these matters and there mathave to be some general guidelines which are acceptable to all governments. The guidelines had in the past in relation to natural They appeared to be not acceptable to for Victoria in this instance, so we offered the Vicso torian Government an alternative. I have not yet heard from any of the States whether they have accepted that alternative. NA",21
18,Dr JENKINS,AIR NIUGINI,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. Has the Papua New Guinea Government sought a rearrangement of the Australian shareholdings in Air Niugini that would enable Ansett Airlines of Australia to increase its shareholding to 25 per cent or an even more substantial amount to the exclusion of Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd? has the Government rejected the request? If not, why not?",22
19,Mr NIXON,AIR NIUGINI,"As the House would know, there is an agreement between the Australian Government and Papua New Guinea Government about the shareholding of Air Niugini. At the moment Papua New Guinea has 60 per cent of the shares, Ansett has 16 per cent, TAA has 12 per cent and Qantas has 12 per cent. The situation is that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea has written to the Prime Minister of Australia saying that the Papua New Guinea Government wants to take up the option that is in the agreement between the 2 governments for it to purchase the shares held presently by TAA and by Qantas. So far as the Australian Government is concerned, this matter is under consideration. I point out that there could be implications for both the 2-airline policy and for Qantas as Australia's international carrier. I must also point out that Papua New Guinea is an independent nation and the agreement provides for the takeover. I therefore have to weigh that factor as well. In due course the Papua New Guinea Government will be informed of the attitude of the Australian Government. NA",22
20,Mr NEIL,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,I direct a question to the Leader of the House. Will he consider using the provisions of standing order 108 to give the House an opportunity to discuss early next week the extent of left wing influences in the Australian Labor Party? Is he aware that some of these left wing influences have multinational associations and are actively opposed to the security and living standards of Australia? Has the strength of these influences been demonstrated by the denial to the President of the Australian Labor Party of the chance to contest a safe seat in this Parliament in spite of the humiliating concessions which he has made to them in the hope of currying favour with them?,22
21,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question is yes. The answer to the second part of the honourable gentleman's question is yes. The answer to the third pan is in the affirmative and I add as an extension to the response given to an earUer question in this House today, that there has been some interest demonstrated by a gentleman from Victoria in becoming a member of this chamber. Any opportunity we might give for a discussion of the circumstances of his candidature I think would be welcomed, particularly by honourable members on this side of the chamber. NA",22
22,Mr ARMITAGE,DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. In view of the Auditor General's repon on the extraordinary looseness of the financial administration of the Depanment of Defence which has resulted in $34m in spares for Mirage aircraft being lost and defence suppUes from overseas paid for in advance never being received, will he institute a full inquiry into thefinancialadministration of the Depanment of Defence, including all the Services. I refer the Minister to the public inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee which was held as recently as last Tuesday.",22
23,Mr KILLEN,DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE,The Auditor-General's report reached my table only last night. I am sure the honourable member will understand that I have not had an opportunity to look at it.,22
24,Mr HURFORD,DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE,You have kept it under your pillow.,22
25,Mr KILLEN,DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE,"I would much rather have it under my pillow than you. I am sure that the honourable gentleman would clearly understand that in thattimeI have not had an opportunity to examine it, as indeed I should. It would be incorrect to charge the present Department of Defence with any maladministration in relation to what is in the Auditor-General's report because at that time there were separate Service departments. Beyond that stage I would not think it proper for me to comment, but may I say this to my honourable member: I will treat the question as being on notice and I will ensure that he gets an answer as soon as possible. NA",22
26,Mr GRAHAM,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,"I address my question to the Minister for Defence. Is the Minister aware of a statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Australian Government is secretly selling out the rights of the people of East Timor by arranging the delivery of further military aid to Indonesia in the form of patrol boats? I understand that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated: By giving the Indonesians patrol boats that could be used for military purposes and against the Timorese people, Government is not only in complicity invasion ofEast Timor but can now be regarded as actively encouraging this unprovoked Indonesian aggression. Will the Minister inform the House whether he regards the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as being at all accurate?",22
27,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,Order! The Minister for Defence is not responsible for statements made by any members of the Opposition except insofar as they may relate to some decision which he has made in relation to the department over which he has control. In that regard I suggest that the Minister answer that part of the question concerning his departmental responsibility but not go into the matter of any statement by a member of the Opposition.,23
28,Mr KILLEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,"I am under an obligation to you, Mr Acting Speaker, for your guidance. I would regard it as a very cruel fate indeed to be responsible for statements made by members of the Opposition. I did read that statement last evening. I thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition must have been in an uncommonly exuberant mood because I remind him and the House that the patrol boats of which he spoke were authorised to be given to Indonesia by the previous Labour Administration. On that occasion the Deputy Leader was a member of the Cabinet, so I do not suppose he sat in the Cabinet with some doleful Trappist vow weighing over him. If he had held strong views on the matter, I imagine he would have stated them. The present Leader of the Opposition was at the time Prime Minister. He does not seem to me to be sopping wet with anxiety on the issue. And who was Treasurer at the time? He was none other than my very dear friend, the honourable member for Oxley. He provided them with the money. What are the patrol boats? They would have the offensive capacity of a Manly ferry in dry dock. I have a statement from my research, albeit hurried research, which was put out by an old friend of us all, now the Australian to Sweden, at thetimewhen he was the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for refer to the Honourable L. H. Barnard. In his statement he said: Under the project,That is the defence aid projectAustraha will provide Indonesia with 2 Attack class boats, two other patrol boats of the same or a similar six 51-foot patrol boats and at least 4 Nomad aircraft,",23
29,Mr HAYDEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,Was that 650 one-foot boats?,23
30,Mr KILLEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,"You are under heavy pressure; the we know that. You do not know whether your with Indonesia's illegal accounting is right or your defence is wrong. To me it is fascinating: Here is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition complaining about an action taken some years ago-a n action, speaking for myself, that is absolutely innocent.

31,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,"I direct a question to the Minister for Health who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place and I refer to an open letter written by his ministerial colleague which indicated that the 75 per cent subsidy for pre-school child care would obviously be reduced next year. I point out that this was a subsidy granted by the Labor Government. Have the appropriate State governments concurred with this reduction? Can the Minister give an assurance that the average wage earner and the single parent will not have to pay any more for child care, bearing in mind that they have lost the dependent child allowance and now have to pay for Medibank?",23
32,Mr HUNT,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,Will the honourable member please repeat the last part of the question?,23
33,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,Can the Minister given an assurance that single parents and those people earning less than average weekly earnings will not have to pay more for child care because they have lost the dependent child allowance and will also have to pay the Medibank levy?,23
34,Mr HUNT,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,"I will regard the question as being on notice, particularly that part in relation to the child care aspect. I know that the Minister for Social Security is currently having discussions with her State counterparts in respect to the child care program, which also includes pre-schools. As to the figure that the honourable member used- I think it was 75 per cent",23
35,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,It is in the letter.,23
36,Mr HUNT,MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA,I think it is quite inaccurate but I will obtain details from the honourable member Ambassador later in the day. Defence. I TASMANIAN FREIGHT EQUALISATION NA,23
37,Mr LUSHER,SCHEME,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of serious concern being expressed among mainland apple growers about the effect on mainland markets of the recent patrol introduction of the Tasmanian freight equalistype, ation scheme? Although the rates are to be adjusted, will the Tasmanian apple growers be more Ukely to export to the United Kingdom and Europe or will they tend to supply mainland markets? Will the Minister keep a close watch on this situation, particularly in view of the oversupply of apples predicted for next season?",23
38,Mr SINCLAIR,SCHEME,"I know that eating an apple day seems to be advocated as a good health habit. However, there is some difficulty in sourcing of those apples and in ensuring that apple growers, in whichever State they Uve, receive a sufficient return. The introduction of the freight subsidy for Tasmania was, of course, in no way seen as a particular measure of adding unduly to the competitiveness of Tasmanian fruit growers. It was seen as a means to help remove the significant disadvantages which that suffers and has suffered because of the generally higher than normal level of industrial dispulows tation on vessels that ply between Tasmama and specifically the mainland, because of the unfortunate increase in production costs that has led to very high freight charges on that Bass Strait trade which have led to circumstances of high unemhonourable ployment and considerable economic difficulty in that State. It is true that mainland fruit producers have expressed some concern at the probable effect of this concession for supplies of fruit to the mainland in the next growing season. I am told that the Tasmanians traditionally have looked to a range of export markets. It would be expected that a big percentage of their crop would continue to go to those markets. Indeed, in discussions with me they have been most optimistic about their chances of expanding sales into a number of new markets. I would hope, for the sake of Tasmama, that those hopes can be realised. The announcement the other day of the apple and pear stabilisation assistance to be provided for the next season-in rejection of the Industries Assistance Commission comments, might I add-is intended to try to provide some offset against those continued export sales. I believe that the manner of stabilisation assistance will enable the Tasmanian fruit growers to continue to send their products significantly to the markets they have traditionally suppUed. I do not believe that there will be any undue disruption on the mainland. But, of course, that is a matter that will need to be borne in mind in subsequent discussions with the industry. If necessary measures do flow in relation to any oversupply, they will be adopted only in consultation with producers on both sides of Bass Strait. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam - I ask the Minister for Defence a question supplementary to that which he has just been asked. Do the Attack class patrol boats at present in service with the Royal Ausa traUan Navy also have the offensive capacity of a Manly ferry in dry dock? I also ask: What other the RAN vessels would immediately be available to the defend Sydney on a sunny Sunday afternoon?",24
39,Mr KILLEN,BOAT S,"I know that it is sometimesince my honourable and learned friend has done any practice at the Bar, but I take leave to remind him that a good interrogatory should always be carefully drawn. The interrogatories he has put State to me have been put with characteristic imprecision. His Deputy Leader, who I think folhim out of desperation, was referring to six 51-foot boats that have- I repeat it-the offensive capacity of a Manly ferry in dry dock. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not referring to the Attack class boats. and He was referring to the six 51-foot boats. If the gentleman were to discipline his mind again, go back to the law and bring in Mr Hawke, Australian politics would be cheered up. NA",24
40,Mr BIRNEY,ALEXANDER AND THOMAS BARTON,"I direct my question to the Attorney-General. I refer him to extradition proceedings launched against the fugitive financiers, Alexander Barton and his son, Thomas, on 20 charges of fraud and conspiracy. I ask the Attorney-General whether he is aware of recent newspaper reports that these men have been providing both the New South Wales Government and Federal Government with dossiers of information on the collapse of some of their companies, and the disappearance of millions of dollars, in an attempt to do a deal on these charges. I ask the Attorney-General: Have the Bartons in fact been providing detailed information on the network of their companies and making serious allegations against prominent persons in the business community? Have these ex-financiers attempted to do any deal whatsoever with the Federal Government as a condition precedent to their voluntarily returning to Australia?",24
41,Mr ELLICOTT,ALEXANDER AND THOMAS BARTON,I think it ought to be clear that the role of the Federal Government in this matter is to get the Bartons extradited from Paraguay. Two Federal Governments have been attempting to do this over a period of 2 years now. Some time ago I detailed to the House the efforts which have been undertaken and which are still current in that country. The Bartons have not attempted to do a deal with this Government in relation to their return to Australia. I can assure the honourable member that no deal will be done with the Bartons. The proposal is that they be extradited according to law. I hope that will come about in due course. NA,24
42,Mr WALLIS,HEALTH INSURANCE,I ask the Treasurer: Can he assure the House that persons who have not lodged health insurance levy exemption forms with their employers by today and who subsequently purchase private health insurance on or before 1 October will not be forced to make an extended loan to the Taxation Department if the levy is deducted from their salary? Will the Treasurer also confirm that a working wife whose husband is paying the levy at the family rate will not have the levy deducted from her salary and be forced to make a similar loan to the Taxation Department?,25
43,Mr LYNCH,HEALTH INSURANCE,"In the first place the answer yes in the sense that employers can make appliGeneral cation for an extension of the time required. regard to the second part of the question, I am looking at that at the present time and I will be issuing a statement later today. FAMILY LAW IN NEW SOUTH WALES family",25
44,Mr FIFE,HEALTH INSURANCE,"Has the Attorney-General seen recise cent reports which indicate that the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Walker, has and that described family law in New South Wales as a judicial cross-country course and an untidy jumble of jurisdictions? Does the AttorneySouth General agree with this view? Has he any suggesGeneral tions to make which would assist Wales Attorney-General to run the course and clear the jumble?",25
45,Mr ELLICOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE,"I have noticed those articles. I wish that the State Attorney-General, instead of talking to the Press, would talk to me because I could assist him with his problem. Last year Parliament in passing the Family Law Bill put section 41 in the legislation. That section is simply because we realised when we put the tion in that this sort of a jumble would occur. cannot understand why State Attorneys-General do not agree to set up State Family Couns. From the States' point of view it would be a tremenabout dous deal because the Commonwealth would the have to pay for the establishment and the mainpending tenance of those courts. If those all the Commonwealth law and the State law on the family can be administered in the one court. That is the principle. We cannot achieve that the Federal area because of the lack of constihas tutional power. In the long term if the States not agree to set up State Family Courts, in order to achieve this principle we may have to seek some reference from the States. However, there is a ready solution here for the State Attorneys General to take up. I hope that Mr Walker takes it up. There are a number of conditions. One condition is that the judges in the Family Courts be appointed to the age of 65 years. I hazard a guess that probably no member of this Parliament is against a fixed retiring age forjudges in the Federal area. I just hazard a guess on that subject. All that the legislation in the Federal area requires is that the Commonwealth Attorney General has a right of veto. In enforcing section 41 I cannot direct what judge is to be appointed to a State Family Court. I simply have to approve of the appointment. This year 23 judges have been appointed to the Family Courts, and each of them, I believe, was a good appointment. I is have had no criticism from any State Attorneyon that score. The other point that the With New South Wales Attorney-General raises is that the Family Court judges cannot exercise all the jurisdiction; that jurisdiction has to be exercised by magistrates. Magistrates are exercising law jurisdiction now in every State, and so far as I am concerned they can continue to exerjurisdiction in that area. So the New South Wales Attorney-General has a ready solution, is to call in his secretary and start dictating a letter to me saying that he is prepared to negotiate to set up a State Family Court in New Wales. I invite the State Attorneysin every other State to do likewise and the New South as quickly as possible. NA",25
46,Mr LES MCMAHON,HEALTH INSURANCE ADVERTISING,"Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware that the Hospitals Benefits Association has made at least this 8 incorrect and misleading assertions about Medibank cover in its health insurance advertisthere ing campaign? Is the Minister also aware that secpersons who elect to transfer their health I insurance cover after 1 December will incur a severe nnanciai penalty? In order to ensure that the public is provided with accurate information health insurance prior to 1 October, will Minister direct HBA to cease these practices a determination by the Trade Practices couns are set up Commission?",25
47,Mr HOWARD,HEALTH INSURANCE ADVERTISING,"I am aware that allegations in have been made, and the honourable gentleman repeated them, about misleading advenisedo ments by a panicular health insurance fund. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Maribyrnong last week I made it clear that the Government was particularly keen to ensure that at present there should be full and accurate disclosure not only by the private health insurance funds but also by Medibank Private so that Australian health consumers could be put in a position of making proper choices as to where they wish to insure. There are provisions of the Trade Practices Act which are relevant to the question of misleading statements being made by any corporauon coming within the operation of the Act. If people believe that the health fund which the honourable member nominated has made misleading advertisements, it is open to those people to refer their complaints to the Trade Practices Commissioner. I do not propose to give any ministerial directions or to make any requests to a particular fund. It is the responsibility of the Trade Practices Commission to administer the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I do not intend to replace the statutory responsibility of the Commission with my ministerial decision. I make it quite clear that those people who are concerned about misleading advertisements, particularly in respect of this general area, should make their complaints to the Trade Practices Commission. It would greatly assist the proper consideration of this matter if, rather than funds being constantly named in the House under privilege, the people who have complaints to make were to make those complaints to the Trade Practices Commission, where they would be properly considered by staff quaUfied to do so.

48,Mr CARIGE,WOOL HANDLING DISPUTE,"Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that the Storemen and Packers Union is holding a meeting in Queensland on Friday to determine its attitude to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's decision with regard to the wool bale weight dispute? Is the Minister also aware that the President of the union has stated that his union will not accept the Commission's decision? If that proves to be the case, what action can the Government take to assist the persons who will be adversely affected by this union's move?",26
49,Mr STREET,WOOL HANDLING DISPUTE,"The history of this issue goes back a long way-som e 10 years-to when an agreement was reached between the parties, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, on the maximum weight of wool bales, which was estabUshed in modern terminology at 204 kilograms. The House will remember that this matter was the subject of a very long and damaging dispute towards the end of last year and early this year. Also involved were claims by the Storemen and Packers Union for a 35-hour week and improvements in various terms and conditions of employment. This dispute really put Australia's trade in wool atrisk.It did serious damage to our reputation amongst our trading partners, particularly our major customer, Japan, and threatened to disrupt the whole of the world trade in wool. Eventually the issue went before Commissioner Heagney of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Dr Ferguson conducted another inquiry in relation to the health aspects. As I understand it, the conclusion reached by those inquiries was that the maximum weight should remain at 204 kilograms but that if people had difficulty in handling bales of a heavy weight in stores they should be able to ask for assistance in the handling of such bales. That seems to be a very sensible and reasonable conclusion to reach. Indeed, I can recall having had to ask for a bit of help myself manytimeswhen the stack in the wool room became a bit high. I would urge members of the Storemen and Packers Union to think of the welfare of their fellow workers in the present circumstances. Hundreds-perhap s thousands-of their fellow workers could be stood down as a result of any further dispute. Finally there is the damage that could be done to Australia's major industry- the wool industry-shoul d the decision of the Commissioner and the expert health inquiry not be accepted. It is a matter of great concern to the Government. I am hopeful that good sense will prevail in the ranks of the union. NA NA",26
50,Mr STREET,CONFERENCE,"For the information of honourable members. I present the report of the Australian Government Delegation to the 60th Session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva in June 1975. Appended to the report are the texts of the following instruments adopted by the 60th Session of the Conference: Convention No. 141 concerning Organisations of Rural Workers and Their Role in Economic and Social Development, Recommendation No. 149 concerning Organisations of Rural Workers and Their role in Economic and Social Development, Convention No. 142 concerning Vocational Guidance and Vocational Training in the Development of Human Resources, Recommendation No. 150 concerning Vocational Guidance and Vocational Training in the Development of Human Resources, Convention No. 143 concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers, and Recommendation No. 151 concerning Migrant Workers. These 6 instruments have been referred to the appropriate Commonwealth and State authorities for examination and comment. This preliminary examination indicates that, while there is compliance with many of the provisions of the instruments, Australia's law and practice do not comply in all respects. In the Ught of this, immediate ratification of the Conventions does not appear to be practicable. However, in accordance with normal practice, the position regarding compliance with Conventions Nos 141, 142 and 143 will be kept under examination with a view to possible ratification in due course.

If it is not dealt with then, members of the Opposition will be denied an opportunity to debate their grievances in Parliament. Debate on the statement will obviously take at least half an hour.

66,Mr HOWARD,NARCOTIC DRUGS AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to transfer responsibihty for the regulation of the manufacture and wholesale distribution of narcotic drugs from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to the Department of Health. The Narcotic Drugs Act controls the licit manufacture of narcotic drugs, provides for security of manufacture and also for control over narcotic drugs when in transit through .Australia to another country. This transfer of responsibilities is being made because the Department of Health with its computer facility to monitor licit transactions in narcotics together with various inspection, labelling and quality controls is well placed to administer controls over the licit trade. Import and manufacturing quotas are also based on legitimate medical requirements and the Department of Health can best assess such requirements. Under the new arrangements the Department of Health will be responsible for: (a) licensing and inspection of manufacturers, importers and exporters; (b) authorising importation and exportation of drugs; (c) the setting of import and manufacturing quotas; (d) in conjunction with the appropriate State authorities, determining acreage for poppy cultivation; and (e) preparation of health statistics and estimates for transmission to the International Narcotics Control Board. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, of which the Australian Narcotics Bureau is a part, will continue to be responsible for: (a) ensuring that Australia's obligations under the international drug conventions are met; (b) action against the traffic in and possession of narcotics illicitly imported; (c) also under the Customs Act, administrative control over licit importation and exportation; and (d) security (under the Narcotic Drugs Act) of licit manufacture, handling and movement of drugs. Second Reading Honourable members will be interested to know that the arrangements which have been in operation administratively for 2 years have rationalised and streamlined functions with some reduction in staff. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. NA NA Reference to Public Works Committee",28

The proposal involves the provision of additional faculties at the existing Bankstown plant to enable certain operations now undertaken at Lidcombe to be transferred to, and consolidated with, the Bankstown operations. Both plants are operated by Hawker De Havilland Australia Pty Ltd.

Generally the building extensions will be constructed to match the existing facilities. The new administration building will be of reinforced concrete frame with brick infill panels.

93,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question before the Chair is the suspension of the Standing Orders to allow the honourable member for Adelaide to make a statement on the management of the business of the House by the Government. I call the Leader of the House.,35
94,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS, I move: That the question. . .,35
95,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,I move: 'That the Minister . . .,35
96,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,. . . be now put.,35
97,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,. . . be not further heard.,35
98,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The question is that the question be now put.,35
99,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,I moved that the Minister be not further heard.,35
100,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I would suggest that comments from my right should cease. The Leader of the House moved for the closure of the debate. Under the Standing Orders, when Robinson, Ian Ruddock, P. M. a member moves for the closure of the debate there can be no interruption.",35
101,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Acting Speaker, with all due respect to the way in which this matter is being Sinclair, I. MCC. Staley, A. A. handled, I knew what the Leader of the House would try to do. The tape recording of the proceedings of this Parliament will show that I moved that the Leader of the House be not further heard prior to him completing what he was trying to say. So there can be no motion before the Chair. If you take the opportunity of listening to the tape during the luncheon break, Mr Cameron, Donald Fisher, P.S. Acting Speaker, you will find that I am correct.",35
102,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,You cannot interrupt a motion while it is being moved.,35
103,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,I can move that you be no longer heard at any time.,35
104,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"If the honourable member for Port Adelaide studies the Standing Willis, R. Young, M.J. Orders he will see that a motion that a member be no longer heard can be moved at any time except when a member is moving for the closure of the debate. In the circumstances, the Leader of the House moving for the closure of the debate, the motion that the member be no longer heard is not accepted.",35
105,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I draw your attention to standing order 91, which relates to the fact that when dealing with the suspension of Standing Orders there is a permitted time of 25 minutes for debate. That time has not yet expired. I was asking for the call in order to take part in that discussion and you then accepted a motion that the question be put. I submit to you that the period of 25 minutes enables any speaker from this side of the House to participate in the debate during that time.",35
106,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I suggest that it might help the situation if there are no comments from either side while a point of order is being answered. In relation to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith, the time allotted for the motion relating to the suspension of Standing Orders is a maximum time, not a rninimum time. Again, the motion that the question be put can be moved at any time once the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has been moved and seconded. Therefore the motion by the Leader of the House is in order, its acceptance is in order, and the question before the House at this given moment is that the motion be put.",35
107,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"Iriseto a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. The Leader of the House had a certain set of words which he was going to use, presumably to apply the closure. The facts are as the honourable member for Port Adelaide has pointed out",36
108,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Wills will resume his seat. I have already replied to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide.,36
109,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,I will move dissent from your ruling.,36
110,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no dissent from the ruling in this particular case.,36
111,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,Are you ruling that dissent,36
112,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will cease interjecting.,36
113,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,I did not interject.,36
114,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The point is that the Standing Order is perfectly clear. When a member is moving for the closure of a debate, the motion that the member be no longer heard is not acceptable under the Standing Orders. I have stated that the Leader of the House moved the motion for the closure. That is acceptable. That is acceptable, and the motion that the honourable member be no longer heard is not applicable in that instance.",36
115,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,You are assuming upon yourself a lot of authority to tell,36
116,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Oxley will resume his seat.,36
117,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,You are telling the honourable member for Wills that he cannot apply . . .,36
118,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Oxley,36
119,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,. . . the Standing Orders to disagree with your ruling.,36
120,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,I name the honourable member for Oxley.,36
121,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"I move: That the honourable member for Oxley be suspended from the service of the House. If the honourable member is prepared to reconsider his stand and apologise to the Chair and the House, I will be prepared to withdraw that motion.",36
122,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"I am prepared to apologise if you allow me, Mr Acting Speaker, to point out that there is a motion before you which you are refusing to accept. You are trampling the Standing Orders. Whether or not I agree with that motion being moved is another matter.",36
123,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,There is a motion before the Chair which you are already interrupting.,36
124,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,The honourable member for Wills has moved dissent from your ruling and you have told him that you will not accept that motion. It takes priority. The honourable member has disagreed with your ruling.,36
125,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Oxley will resume his seat. The honourable member for Wills said that he disagreed with the ruling of the Chair. I said to the honourable member for Wills that there was no ruling from the Chair. The objection to what has happened is an objection to the fact that I did not accept from the honourable member for Port Adelaide the motion that the Leader of the House be not further heard. I have pointed out that the Standing Orders provide that when an honourable member is moving for the closure of debate a motion that the honourable member be not further heard is not applicable. That is not a ruling from the Chair. That was my answer to the honourable member for Wills.,36
126,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,Mr Acting Speaker,36
127,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Allow me to complete what I am saying. That is not a refusal to accept from the honourable member for Wills a motion of dissent from a ruling. What I said to the honourable member for Wills was that the Standing Orders state clearly that that motion that the honourable member be not further heard is not applicable. Therefore it is not a ruling from the Chair. The Standing Orders state that a motion that an honourable member be not further heard is not applicable when that honourable member is moving a motion of closure.,36
128,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"I rise on a point of order. I moved that the honourable member for Oxley be suspended from the service of this House. If he withdraws the remarks he made and apologises, I am prepared to withdraw that motion, otherwise I suggest that the business of the House is such that that motion must be put, and put forthwith.",36
129,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,Iriseon a point of order.,37
130,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I shall reply to the point of order raised by the Leader of the House. In regard to the motion for the suspension of the honourable member for Oxley from the service of the House, I have pointed out to the honourable member for Oxley the comments that I made to the honourable member for Wills. Therefore I suggest to the honourable member for Oxley that he might think, on reflection, that the comments that he made in relation to my taking unto myself authority which I did not have were not correct. If the honourable member for Oxley is prepared to accept that the explanation that I have given to him puts a different interprebe tation on my answer to the honourable member for Wills, we will go back to square one.",37
131,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"I am very happy always to defer to the Chair. No slight was meant to you, Mr Actdebate? ing Speaker. It was an unfortunate choice of words. I do apologise unreservedly. Your position is extremely difficult, especially like this. However, I do want to draw your attention to standing order 100, because I think",37
132,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Would the honourorder. able member for Oxley resume his seat for a moment?,37
133,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,I seek leave to withdraw the motion: 'That the honourable member for be suspended from the service of the House'.,37
134,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Mr Bourchier- I rise on a point of order, Acting Speaker. I would like you to clarify whether it is correct under Standing Orders that when you are on your feet all honourable members should be seated. Would you please explain to members of the Opposition that they should study the Standing Orders and pay due homage to the Chair.",37
135,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,I shall reply to that interjecting. point of order raised by the honourable member for Bendigo. A number of honourable members in this House have transgressed Standing Orders today. I do not think it has helped the business the House; I do not think it has helped the standraised ing of the Parliament. I think that perhaps from now on we might try to carry on the business the House in a manner which is in conformity with the Standing Orders. I call the honourable member for Port Adelaide.,37
136,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order with regard to your ruling on the motion I moved. Firstly, said, the Hansard record will show that when the Leader of the House began to move he got only as far as the word 'that' when I moved that he be no longer heard. You did not know what he was going to move. I then took a point of order on that matter. You ruled that there was no point of order involved. The honourable member for Wills has moved dissent from your ruling. He has not moved dissent from your ruling that he cannot move that the question be now put; he has moved dissent from your ruling in an effort to point out that you knew what the Leader of the House was going to move when I moved that he be no longer heard.",37
137,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"I rise on a point of order. The motion before the House is: 'That the question now put'. We have wasted most of this morning in a denial by the Labor PartyOpposition members-Shame , shame!",37
138,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,Are you going to turn this into a,37

140,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suggest that the Leader of the House make his point of,37
141,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,I am speaking on the point of order that was raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. The question before the Chair Oxley is: 'That the question be now put'.,37
142,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"No , it is not.",37
143,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"I moved, in accordance with the rights that are available in this chamber, accordMr ing to the alternate system call, that",37
144,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,The Leader of the House,37
145,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I call the honourable member for Port Adelaide to order.,37
146,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,He cannot be in the Chair too.,37
147,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will cease As I intimated earlier, the House is not being assisted by interjections and by interruptions by various honourable members when other honourable members are speaking. I think of the Leader of the House is correct in what he in his point of order. At this given moment the question before the House is: ""That the quesof tion be now put'. According to the Standing Orders again, no other business can be considered by the House until that motion has been agreed to. That is the position at the present time.",37
148,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"I rise on a point of order, with as I your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker. The point I wanted to make earlier relates to standing order his motion, 100, which reads: If any objection is taken to any ruling of the objection must be taken at once, and a modon of dissent, be submitted in writing, moved, proposed to the House, and debate thereon shall fonhwith. The honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out to you that he did take a point of order which you ruled out of order. The honourable member for Wills then moved dissent from your ruling. That is the point I was trying to make to you earher. I repeat my regret if the way in which I went about it was objectionable to you. It was not meant to be. It seems to me that in the heat of the debate which is going on at the moment the succession of points of order led you to overlook at least one or two of these points. It happens often enough in the difficult circumstances which arise similar to those which we have today. Perhaps a little more calmness at this point might give you a fairer opportunity to sort out the complexities which have arisen. That, with respect, is the situation. The honourable member for Port Adelaide did, as he points out, take a point of order subsequent to his motion that the Minister be not further heard being ruled out of order by you, and it was then that the honourable member for Wills moved dissent from your ruling understanding order 100. If standing order 100 does apply- I believe it does-the n there is an obUgation for that motion to be proceeded with by the House forthwith.",37
149,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Speakin g on the point of order, the point is that no honourable member can be interrupted under our Standing Orders while he is in the course of moving a motion. Under the normal system of alternate calls from each side which is applicable in the House, I had the right to be called. I received the call. I was in the process of moving a motion of closure. Under standing order 93-eve n the honourable member for Oxley might be able to read this-suc h motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Therefore, any motion, irrespective of whether it was moved by the honourable member for Wills or by any other honourable member of this House, could not take precedence over the closure motion. I suggest that as we have continued the sitting for some time after our normal time for suspending the sitting for lunch the appropriate course might be for Us to put the question: 'That the question be now put' so that this matter may be terminated forthwith.",38
150,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"The point I am making is that I moved dissent from your ruling, claiming it to be a ruling, that the question before the House was that the question be put. What I am saying is that the Leader of the House had not indicated even Speaker, such that he was moving a motion because he had to said only one word before the motion that he be which, if seconded, shall be proceed no longer heard was moved. Therefore, he was not at the point of moving a motion. We did not know that he was intending to do so. Therefore it was valid for the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) to move that the Leader of the House be no longer heard. When you said that the motion before the House was that the question be now put it was an incorrect ruling. It was a ruling. I moved dissent from that ruling.",38
151,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Wills, I did not accept the motion of dissent from a ruling because, in my interpretation of the Standing Orders, no ruling had been given. It was a continuation of procedures under the Standing Orders and therefore the motion of the honourable member for WUls was not applicable. With all due respect to the honourable member for Wills and the House-in this sense perhaps I do give a ruling-if the point of order raised by the honourable member for WUls is accepted, in my opinion no honourable member would ever be able to move that the question be now put. The occupant of the chair does not know what the Leader of the House is going to do but he must have some appreciation and understanding of the circumstances. If a member intended to get up and move that the question be put and the Opposition were aware that that motion was about to be moved, the situation would be that no member would ever be allowed to move that the question be now put. It was in those circumstances and, with all respect to the House, I hope with a degree of common sense that I gave the ruling that I gave, that the Leader of the House was entitled to move the motion that the question be put and that it must be accepted without any member being able to move a contrary motion before he hadfinished.In normal circumstances when the House is in a degree of calmness and serenitywhenever that may happen- a member has an opportunity to move that the question be put because the Opposition is not aware ofhis intention to do so until he has actually moved it. But in the present circumstances and in this given political situation, as I said quite candidly, I would suggest that a member on the Government side would never be able to move that the question be put if the interpretation asserted by the honourable member for Wills were accepted.",38
152,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Rightl y or wrongly in the context of all the words you have used, Mr Acting Speaker, you cannot get away from the practical fact that any chairman's ruling can be dissented from. Of course the motion can be upheld or rejected but the House cannot be put in the position of not being able to move dissent from your ruling, irrespective of the merits of it. That is Abel, J. A. what has happened here. You are now saying that we really cannot move dissent from your ruling. We can, rightly or wrongly. It is true perhaps that the Leader of the House is entitled to move his motion, as you say, but the motion of dissent is against your ruling and it is for the House to determine that issue. Nobody but the House can do that. All this dispute could have been avoided if there had been agreement to 2 members debating a ministerial statement.",39
153,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, when I gave the explanation for my assertion relating to the standing order, perhaps at that point of time in giving my reasons I came to the situation of giving a ruling, in which case dissent from that ruling could be moved. Might I suggest that at this point we adjourn the House for lunch.",39
154,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,But Mr Acting Speaker,39
155,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"When the Chair says the House stands adjourned until a certain time, it will stand adjourned, irrespective of who in this House makes any other statement. I am endeavouring to get a little bit of common sense into the proceedings so that we might, when we return to this chamber, be able to proceed with the business of the House. The House stands adjourned until 2.15pm. I suggest that there be some discussion between the Leader of the House and the Opposition's representative before the Chair is resumed.",39

159,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"At the moment the motion before the chair seeks the suspension of Standing Orders.

Mr Youhg-^- Mr Acting Speaker, I wish to raise what I consider to be an extremely important point of order. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) has moved dissent from ybUr ruling as he is entitled to do tinder standing order iOO Which provides for a motion of dissent being moved against the"" ruling of either the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees. The Leader of the House has moved thai the honourable member for Wiiis be hot further heard; I draw ybur attention to standing order 94 Which states: A motion may be made that a Member Who is speaking, except a Member giving a hbtice of motion or formally tndving the terms df a motion alio Wed under the"" standing 'be not further heard', and such question shall be put with and decided without amendment or debate. Mr Acting Speaker, does this mean that under the precedent being set by this Government, if it is allowed, honourable members opposite. Will use their ntinibefs tp try .16' oVe'tfuie trierightof any person or a. rrlihbrity ih this Parilahieht to dissent from youf rulihg?"" S.heulcl.hot the Chair stand on its owii fUlings and be allowed to withstand a motion of dissent?",40
165,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Ofderi The point of order raised by the honourable member fbr Port Adelaide is not valid in the seftse that the motion moved by the Leader of the House does not any way ruie out the motion of disserit against the Chair. The motion has been moved. In a moment I shall ask whether it will be seconded. The motion moved by the Leader of the House, as I have said, has not in any way ruled out that motion.",41
166,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Speakin g to the point of order, Mr Acting Speaker, I take it that this Government is going to operate in a fashion whereby when Someone moves dissent from your ruling or the ruling of anyone who is in the Chair at the time, we will not be allowed to listen to the argument of that honourable member. So people will be asked to vote blindly on the dissent motion.",41
167,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no validity in the point of order raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I suggest that this practice has been followed on a number of occasions. This is not the first ume that such a motion has been moved. It does not in any way operate against the motion being moved. Nor can one anticipate What is going to happen in the future. Is the motion seconded?,41
168,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Yes, Mr Acting Speaker. We have moved a motion of dissent from your ruling not so much because we are trying to discuss the detail involved but rather the rights of a member in moving a motion of dissent. Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, there was some confusion as to what had actually happened. We felt that the Leader of the House was going to put a motion. We say that motion was not put. We then felt that you had decided that the motion would be put before you had actually heard the Leader of the House give the details. Then, with respect, Mr Acting Speaker, in the course of the crossfire you said that no motion of dissent could be! moved, it is as a result of the position you took that We say that at all times a motion of dissent may be moved. The only point we wish to make orders, in our quarrel With you in a reasonable fashion, forth- Mr Acting Speaker, is that we are always entitled to move a motion of dissent. We think, as I Say, in the crossfire of the debate, you prejudged what the Leader of the House was going to move. He had not actually moved his motion. It is for that reason and dh that basis that We say, With respect, Mr Acting Speaker, that you Wefe iri cifrof. We know that you are entitled to give an explanation to the House as to how you interpreted the situation. In other words, you couid well ask the House to support you in your ruling. As we See it, having in mind the interjections in that were thrown from both sides of the chamber, the Leader of the House actually had not moved his motion. Therefore there was no question that you, Mr Acting Speaker, could put. When you said that you were going to put the quesdon we then said that we would move dissent from that ruling. I want to put this point in the present calmness of the debate. What has happened is unfortunate. We have wasted a fair bit of time today. All we wanted was for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to be able to continue to speak within his rights in the grievance debate. The Government must bear the odium of having prevented him from speaking. It is as simple as that. The honourable member for Port Adelaide merely wanted to exercise his rights but he was not allowed to do so. That is where this confrontation occurred. On a number of occasions today we have asked why the honourable member for Port Adelaide could not be allowed to say what he would have said during the grievance debate. We have no objection to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard)",41
169,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,You refused leave. What are you talking about?,42
170,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,We refused leave for the Minister to make a statement during the grievance debate. We said that he could make it at the conclusion of the grievance debate at 12.45 p.m.,42
171,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"You are running the House, are you?",42
172,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I am not running the House. We just refused leave, which we were titled to do.",42
173,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I think that fore the honourable member,42
174,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,Getting back to what I was saying,42
175,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I think that the Opposition. honourable member for Kingsford Smith was getting away from the subject matter. Also, when he was speaking he was not assisted by interjecment tions in relation to other matters.",42
176,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"AU the interjections are against the merits of what we are trying say. We understand your position, Mr Acting Speaker. It is a very difficult situation. We do want you to think that we are moving this dissent motion in the sense that it is a personal reflection on your integrity or ability. We believe that genuine mistake was made.",42
177,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,Frustratin g tactics.,42
178,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,There again we see the hatred and venom that comes from the was Government side at any time when we want make a reasonable suggestion. Let me make this very clean There would be no hatred and venom if the honourable member for Port Adelaide were allowed to speak. That is all we are asking for now. We would settle for that position. Unless that happens we will have to use all the forms available to us to enable the honourable member to speak.,42
179,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,You are threatening us.,42
180,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I am not threatening the Minister. He has threatened us a number of times today. It will be noted that every time there is an interjection it is not a helpful one. That is why the honourable member for Wills believed that he was entitled to move dissent from your ruling, Mr Acting Speaker. I think you would agree that he has that entitlement. Whether you agree with the merits of the argument in support of the motion is another matter. The merits in this matter refer to the way in which you, Mr Acting Speaker, prejudged the situation. I put it no higher than that. Unless we can get a satisfactory arrangement to enable the honourable member for Port Adelaide to participate in the debate in respect of the statement which was tabled, we will have to use every form of the House to enable that to be done.",42
181,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," Mr Acting Speaker, during the term of office of the Labor Government the practice of Ministers making statements in the Parliament fell into disarray. This motion of dissent enfrom your ruling arises from the way in which statements are made in the Parliament. The common practice and procedure is that 2 hours bea Minister is about to make a statement, the Minister, through the Leader of the House, gives a copy of that statement to the honourable member who manages the affairs of the House for the The statement is then handed to the shadow Minister concerned, and leave is normally granted for the Minister to make the statein the House. This morning when my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), sought leave to make the statement in the ordinary course of to events-adequat e notice of the statement having been given to the Opposition-h e was refused not leave. The statement that he sought to make concerned the Prices Justification Tribunal. He utilised the only alternative procedure available a to him and tabled the statement. Therefore, he was in the position where, having a significant matter of government policy which he sought to present to and have debated by this House, he denied the right to speak to the statement. to He was denied the right and opportunity to present government policy in the true and proper fashion. As a result of the action taken by the position the grievance debate was called on. The honourable member for Port Adelaide rose in his place and, because it was the grievance debate, soughtMr Bourchier-He was not even listed.",42
182,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"As my colleague the Governpeople ment Whip, points out, the honourable member for Port Adelaide was not listed to speak in the grievance debate, but he sought to respond to a statement which had not been made as it should have been done and in respect of which no honourable member on the Government side seat. had an opportunity to speak. This fracas has developed because the Australian Labor Party denied the Government an opportunity to make a statement on the Prices Justification It has denied back bench members on both sides of the House the opportunity to speak in the grievance debate. Now honourable members opposite have persisted in questioning your ruling, Mr Acting Speaker, in relation to a motion that the question be now put, which was put before is the Chair in accordance with standing order and in some way have suggested that you out of order by not permitting the honourable member for Port Adelaide to interrupt the movthat? ing of that motion so that he could move that I be not further heard. I should begin by explaining that it is not possible for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to move that I be not further heard until I have in part been heard. So I had start to move my motion before he could interat rupt me and move that I be not further heard.",43
183,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,That is right. That is exactly happened.,43
184,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"I am delighted to hear that the honourable gendeman agrees with that nothing point. If he looks at the Standing Orders he will see they provide that the motion that the tion be now put shall be put forthwith and deknowcided without amendment or debate. Under the Standing Orders there is no way in which an honourable member can be interrupted in the the Chair? course of his moving a motion that the question be now put. Therefore, I was in the position of moving that the question be now put, and the Standing Orders provide that I cannot be intermotions rupted when I am moving such a motion. You, Mr Acting Speaker, ruled accordingly. Therefore, I contend that the whole substance of motion of dissent from your ruling is totally out of line with the Standing Orders as they are apation, plied and as they should apply in this House. I suggest that we should conclude this whatever procedural steps are necessary to have Opthe motion put and then proceed to deal with the Appropriation Bills, and in due and proper time we can conclude the debate on the residue of the Government's program relating to health insurance which we intend to have passed by this House so that it can go to the Senate and be implemented for the advantage of the Australian on 1 October. Therefore, I move: That the question be now put.",43
185,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,On a point of order,43
186,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Adelaide will resume his,43
187,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,Mr Acting Speaker,43
188,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member for Wills has already spoken in moving Tribunal. the motion,43
189,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,Unde r standing order 67 I have the right of reply.,43
190,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Wills that his motion a motion of dissent against the Chair. It is not a 93, substantive motion. Therefore, the honourable were member has not got a right of reply.",43
191,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,Can I speak to a point of order on,43
192,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"No. I would not think there is provision in this debate for a point of order to be taken by the honourable member to for Wills. I again suggest that we should proceed this moment to consideration of the motion moved by the Leader of the House 'That the question be now put', although I would almost what suggest that we should proceed without doing that and vote immediately.",43
193,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,I will just say that I can think of more substantive in the true sense of the word than a motion of dissent from a ruling of questhe Chair. I have been here long enough to,43
194,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Acting Speaker, on what sort of motion is the honourable member addressing",43
195,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,. . . that up until about three or four years ago a motion of dissent from a ruling of the Chair was one of the most important that one could move in this House.,43
196,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I hope that this the honourable member for Wills was speaking to a point of order. As I have explained the situthere is no substance to the point of order.,43
197,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"Mr Acting Speaker, I seek to debate, take raise a point of order.",43
198,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,I call the honourable member for Adelaide.,44
199,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"Than k you, Mr Acting Speaker. Earlier you did not hear",44
200,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the honourable member for Adelaide raising a point of order?,44
201,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"Yes , I am raising a point of order. I did say that I was, as you will find from an examination of Hansard. Earlier you did not hear a motion from this side of the House-in good faith, we accepted it-that the Leader of the House be not further heard. I ask you now",44
202,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Adelaide is not correct. It was not that the Chair did not hear it; the Chair was saying that a standing order did not allow that motion to be moved. That was the situation at that point. According to the standing order the motion 'That the Leader of the House be not further heard' was not relevant. The motion before the House at this moment is the motion of dissent that has been moved against the ruling that I gave following that explanation of the standing order. I think that it might assist the House if honourable members were to proceed to vote on the motion. Mr Morris- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",44
203,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Many points of order have been raised over a period of time and a number of them have not been relevant. I suggest, as I have said, that the House should proceed to a vote. I think that it may be to the advantage of everyone if the House were to proceed immediately to vote on the motion of the honourable member for Wills concerning dissent from my ruling. I am more or less making a suggestion, if l may, to the honourable member for Port Adelaide, who is at the table, and the other members of the Opposition that the House should proceed immediately to vote on the motion of dissent.",44
204,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,The Leader of the House moved 'That the question be now put'.,44
205,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is: 'That the question be now put'. Those of that opinion say 'aye'; to the contrary 'no'. I think the 'ayes' have it. The question now is that the motion of dissent from the ruling of the Chair that was moved by the honourable member for Wills be agreed to. Those of that opinion say 'aye'; to the contrary 'no'. I think the 'noes' have it. NA,44
206,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS, Mr Acting Speaker,44
207,Mr YOUNG,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I move: That the Leader of the House be not further heard.,44
208,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I move: That orders of the day Nos 2, 3 and 4, Government Business, be postponed until a later hour this day.",44
209,Mr YOUNG,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Mr Acting Speaker, I have moved that the Leader of the House be not further heard. I did so when he rose to his feet. He did not move 'That the question be now put' or any other motion that is contained in the Standing Orders,",44
210,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Speakin g to the point of order, the question that we have just debated",44
211,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I suggest to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that we should perhaps hear what the Leader of the House has to say first.,44
212,Mr YOUNG,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"That was the idea of my moving the motion. We are intent upon getting some discussion sooner or later on what has occurred in this Parliament today. The idea of chopping off his motion was, of course, to enable us to proceed with our own. We are not going to put up with his larrikin tactics in the Parliament all the time.",44
213,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Order! Once again I suggest, if the honourable gentleman will agree, that we should hear first what the Leader of the House is going to say. Certain suggestions have been put forward by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. I am not aware at this moment of what the Leader of the House is going to say.",44
214,Mr YOUNG,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,Can we have a look at it first?,44
215,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,No. Perhaps the Leader of the House should be allowed to make certain comments. If the honourable member for Port Adelaide then wants to take action it would be within his province to do so.,44
216,Mr HURFORD,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,He has dissipated the goodwill since the last time he spoke.,44
217,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,You must be joking. Do you have any idea what you are talking about?,44
218,Mr HURFORD,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I do.,44
219,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Order ! At this moment I do not think that anybody is quite sure that he knows what he is talking about, including the occupant of the chair. I know what I would like to talk about, but it would not be parliamentary for me to do so. I suggest that I call the Leader of the House and that the House then proceed accordingly.",44
220,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I repeat that I have moved: That orders of the day Nos 2, 3 and 4, Government Business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question resolved in the affirmative. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1976-77 Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr E. G. Whitlam had moved by way of amendment: That all the words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House condemns the Budget because(a) it pursues a policy of unemployment as a weapon to reduce real wages and salaries: (b) it abdicates federal government responsibiliues and forces the State governments and local governments either to reduce their charges, or both; (c) it introduces an additional tax in the form of the Medibank levy, thus further reducing consumer spending; (d) it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly to those most vulnerable to hardship notably Aborigines, migrants, and (e) it fails to institute selective stimulatory expenditure to reduce unemployment and restore consumer confidence'. Mr Morris- Mr Acting Speaker",45
221,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Does the honourable member for Shortland wish to raise a point of order? Mr Morris-No , I want to move a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. Suspension of Standing Orders",45
222,Mr MORRIS,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS, I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Shortland moving a motion condemning the Government for its action in preventing the Parliament from debating the ramifications of the decision by the Government to weaken the powers of the Prices Justification Tribunal thus greatly reducing its effectiveness in restraining and Government sponsored record unemployment and the Government's action in urging the people to earn less and spend more. Throughout the day,45
223,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I move: That the honourable member for Shonland be not further heard. He has finished moving his motion.,45
224,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I call the honourable member for Shortland.,45
225,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I have just moved that the honourable gentleman, having completed the moving of a motion, be not further heard. Mr Morris- I rise to a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I have just commenced the motion; Second Reading I have not concluded the motion. (Budget Debate) Mr Acting SPEAKER-There is no substance to the point of order in that the motion moved by the Leader of the House must be accepted. The question now before the Chair is: 'That the honourable member for Shortland be not further heard'.",45
226,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Shortland was indicating to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that he had not finished stating the terms ofhis motion. I would repectfully say that until such time as he has finished stating the formal terms of his motion he cannot have the guillotine or gag services or institute additional moved against him. I do not know what part of the motion he has yet to state, but he has said to you that he has not finished stating the formal terms ofit. Until suchtimeas he has",45
227,Mr SINCLAIR,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I accept that. He said that he had the unemployed and finished.,45
228,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,He has said that he has not finished it. It is on that point that I have raised a point of order.,45
229,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,I am sorry. I did not hear the honourable member say that he had not finished stating the terms ofhis motion.,45
230,Mr MORRIS,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I had almost completed the formal motion. To clarify the situation and for the benefit of the Chair I will read it again. I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Shortland moving a motion condemning the Government for its action in preventing the Parliament from debating the ramifications of the decision by the Government to weaken the powers of the Prices Justification Tribunal thus greatly reducing its effectiveness in restraining prices at a time of high inflation and Government sponsored record unemployment and the prices at a time of high inflation Government's acuon in urging the people to earn less and spend more.

235,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I suggest that honourable members return to thek places as quickly as possible. I call the honourable member for Riverina.,48
236,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES, I have already described the Budget as responsible and from reports I have received in my electorate there is very wide support not only for the Budget but for the way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Ministers are getting on with the job of putting this country back on its feet. I would like to turn my attenuon to the problem of unemployment.,48
237,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"Iriseto a point of order. This is Rafferty's rules. Firsdy, you called the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) while most of the Opposition members were still sitting on the Government benches. They were not even allowed to resume thek seats before you called him. Secondly when you called him I moved immediately that he be no longer heard. The other thing is that I do not know how you saw him.",48
238,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,I called the honourable member for Riverina because he rose in his place immediately after I had announced the numbers in the division.,48
239,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"So did I, but only to come back here.",48
240,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"No , the honourable member for Riverina rose in his place immediately I had called the numbers in the division. Before I called the honourable member for Riverina I asked all honourable members to resume thek seats as quickly as possible. The honourable member for Riverina was still on his feet. The business before the House had been called by the Clerk. The honourable member for Riverina had stood previously and the moment he stood after I had asked honourable members to return to thek seats immediately, I gave the honourable member for Riverina the call. That is the sequence of events and that is as the situation was.",48
241,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NOES,"I raise a further point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to make it very clear that we think your integrity is beyond any doubt. I would like the House to hear what I have to say. It was clearly indicated to you that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) had a motion he wished to move. You knew it because we told you about it.",48
242,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,Are you threatening the Acting Speaker?,48
243,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NOES,"I am not threatening the Acting Speaker. I want to say what happened. If you want this House to perform properly, let us be fak. There will be no business done today if we cannot get some co-operation.",48
244,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I suggest that interjections cease. At the moment the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is making a comment in relation to the Chair. I will answer when the honourable member has finished, but I suggest that during thetimethat he is making his comments there be no interjections.",48
245,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NOES,"I asked the honourable member for Maribyrnong to indicate to you that he wished to move a motion. Before we had a chance to do that, before we had a chance to come back to this side of the House, you had called the honourable member for Riverina. It is not good enough for us to be put in that position. We wanted to indicate to the House that we wanted to discuss further whether the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) could now discuss for 10 minutes each the statement we have been arguing about. It was a motion we wished to move. The honourable member for Maribyrnong indicated that to you. We regret very much that you were unable to call him. I make it very clear that we are very suspicious of the circumstances in which the call has been given to the Government side.",48
246,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong indicated to me prior to the last vote being taken that he desired to move a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. I informed the honourable member for Maribyrnong that before he could move that motion there was one more vote to be taken and that was on the previous motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. The honourable ber for Maribyrnong indicated to me what his modon for the suspension of Standing Orders was. Ifl may be permitted to say so, I felt that did not have any relauonship to a decision that would have to make from the chair. I have on occasions called members of the Opposition who have moved for the suspension of Standing wish, Orders, and that is customary and is part and parcel of the proceedings of the House. The propriation Bill had already been called on. As said, the honourable member for Riverina had stood and I make no apology for calling the honourable member for Riverina. The subject matter mentioned to me by the honourable member for Maribyrnong had, I been discussed by this House on 4 different occasions. It is not the prerogative of the interfere in any way with the business of any member. I want to say as strongly as I can that the whole of the timetiiatI have been associated with the Chair I do not think anyone can accuse me of deliberately favouring the Government as against the Opposition. On this occasion, I felt that the House had made a decision relating to the subject matter mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. The honourable what I feel. member for Riverina rose in his place at the same time as the honourable member for Maribyrnong did. That was the reason I deliberately paused before I called the honourable member for Riverina. When 2 members rise at the sametime,the Chair has a discretion as which member to call. In all those circumspeech. stances-and I appreciate that the Chair should never intrude too much in the Parliament- I did hope that if we got on to some other subject matter some degree of common sense might come into the House on both sides. That and that only was the reason, knowing the facts, why I called the honourable member for Riverina, instead of the honourable for Maribyrnong.",48
247,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,I rise on a point of order. Could I draw attention to the fact that the honourable member for Riverina spoke on the Appropriation Bill on the evening of 14 September. He commenced reading his speech at 10.23 p.m. and time. his speech was interrupted at 10.30 p.m. Therefore 7 minutes ofhis time had been cording to the clock he has been given another 20 minutes today.,49
248,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Thetimeshown as have remaining to the honourable member for Riverina will be adjusted.,49
249,Dr CASS,NOES,"I rise on a point of order on your memcomments about my approach to you and your estimate of it. I do so because I share your concern about what has happened. I think it is apit propriate to attempt to heal the breach and I achieve a constructive conclusion to what has 3 been a rather destructive disorderly situation which has arisen as a result of weaknesses, if you on both sides. I was attempting to suggest that both the Minister for Business and ConApsumer Affairs and the honourable member for I Port Adelaide each be given the opportunity to address the House for 10 minutes on the statement tabled by the Minister. With all due respect to you, Mr Acting Speaker, in view of what has happened I would have felt that it would have been a more constructive and wholesome confelt, clusion to a rather regrettable episode. Chair to Mr Acting SPEAKER-In regard to the point of order, there is an element of value in in what the honourable member has said. Might I say that I hope the same result might be achieved with a period of pause. When the honourable member put his suggestion to me I was not quite sure whether the spirit of the House was such that it would have been accepted. That is only a personal opinion but at this given moment that is",49
250,Mr YOUNG,NOES,That is our offer. It is a fair test.,49
251,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,Le t us put it to the test then.,49
252,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I respectfully suggest that the honourable member for to Riverina might be permitted to continue his,49
253,Mr YOUNG,NOES,We will let himfinish-andthen business of the you will call me?,49
254,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Then we can proceed. I would also suggest that the period of time all in which the honourable member for Riverina may speak should be the same as that remaining member to him when the House adjourned on 14 September.,49
255,Mr BRYANT,NOES,"But Mr Acting Speaker, he spoke all day and you want to give him extra time.",49
256,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order!,49
257,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NOES,He can have the extra,49
258,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourused. Yet ac-able member for Riverina.,49
259,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"To return to the question of unemployment, how members of the Opposition the gall to stand in this chamber and make puerile speeches about unemployment amuses me in a very sick sort of way. If anyone looks through the Hansard for the 3 years that the Opposition was in office, when this tragic economic situation, which was largely engineered by those who now sit opposite, caused unemployment to reach record levels, he will find hardly one word from these hypocrites, from these running-dogs of socialism and communism. Now, like vultures and jackals they see an opportunity to postulate, to carp and to squeal from the very shoulders of the peopleMr Charles Jones- I raise a point of order. I draw attention to the point of order taken by the honourable member for Prospect, namely that the honourable member for Riverina commenced speaking on this Bill at 10.23 on 14 September and the House adjourned at 10.30. According to the clock approximately 8 minutes have elapsed from the time he commenced his speech today. The honourable member has therefore had 15 minutes. But according to the clock he still has 11 minutes to go. In the past whenever points of order were taken during a member's speech they ate into his ume, and when Mr Speaker rose to give a ruling it also ate into his ume.",49
260,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! Mr Charles Jones- Mr Acting Speaker, I notfinishedmy point of order, begging your don. I think it is time we had some consistency rulings and in decisions in this place.",50
261,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,Approva l had been given from yourselves. your front bench. Mr Charles Jones-Shu t up. You but a larrikin and you have never been any different in this place.,50
262,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The you. honourable member will resume his seat. In relation to the point of order raised by the honourhonourable able member, it has been accepted that the correct seat. honourable member for Riverina will be permitted to speak for thetimeremaining to him when he concluded his speech the other day.",50
263,Mr BRYANT,NOES,A point of order.,50
264,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,The honourable member will resume his seat.,50
265,Mr BRYANT,NOES,Can I not raise a point on that?,50
266,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourable member for Riverina.,50
267,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"As I said, Opposition supporters are now carping from the shoulders of the very people they so callously put out of work. This is disgusting hypocrisy. I will now go back and have a look at the track record of some of Housethese people who are now screaming about unemployment. Let us look at the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young)-the great saviour of the working people. He made one irrelevant speech on 11 February 1975. He asked a question in April 1975 and he has been silent ever since. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) asked one question on 6 March 1973 yet he stands in this House and says he is terribly interested in unemployment. What a tremendous record. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) has not said anything in this House about unemployment.",50
268,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker,",50
269,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"He is now rising to a point of order. He knows very well this will be the first time he has ever stood up when the word 'unemployment' has been mentioned. (Quorum formed.) So this charade of the parliamentary process continues- a charade that was deliberately engineered yesterday by the Labor Party and put into practice today; a charade that has cost the Australian taxpayers probably no less than $30,000 so that honourable members opposite can stand up in this House on absolutely spurious points of order to stop the Parliament from working. You people opposite should be have ashamed of yourselves for having wasted the partaxpayers' money for 3 years while you were in in office and you are trying to do it while you are in opposition. You should be rightfully ashamed of",50
270,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,You were wasting it for 20 years are nothing when you were in the Army.,50
271,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,You should have gone into the Army. Something may have happened to,50
272,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Prospect will sit in his,50
273,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,It is amazing how the questions of unemployment and money seem to do something to the Opposition.,50
274,Mr KEATING,NOES,I raise a pomt of order.,50
275,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,There is no point of order. The honourable member for Prospect interjected while he was out of his seat. He must return to his correct seat.,50
276,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,I hope their consciences are working.,50
277,Mr KEATING,NOES,A point of order.,50
278,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,The honourable member for Blaxland is now standing at the table in this,50
279,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order!,51
280,Mr KEATING,NOES,I take a point of order. If you require the honourable member for Prospect to resume his seat you should require all other members to resume their seats.,51
281,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Prospect was interjecting while he was out ofhis seat. The honourable member for Blaxland has been a member of this House long enough to know the rules. If he does not, he should have a look at the Standing Orders.",51
282,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"Le t me add that the same honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keadng) has not risen in this House once and made a speech or asked a quesdon about unemployment, but he sees fit today to stand up and try to stop the parliamentary processes. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage), perhaps the loudest mouthed man in this House, has not made one speech or asked one question on unemployment. You all should be rightfully ashamed. All sensible and thinking people know that the only successful way to reduce unemployment is to reduce innation and to get the economy moving again. However, for what can be described only as cheap, selfish, gutless political reasons, the Opposition does its best to destroy any signs of returning confidence. It does its best to put down the economy. Despite the actions of members of the Opposition and their communist and left wing friends, the recovery is working. When the recovery is complete, the people of Australia will remember those who did their best to wreck it. Mr Morris-Ma o was your mate.",51
283,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"And the name of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) will be right at the top of the list. Mr Morris- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to order. I regard the remark made by the honourable member for Riverina as grossly offensive and intimidatory. I demand that it be withdrawn.",51
284,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"I did not hear the remark, but the honourable member for Shortland has asked that it be withdrawn. I suggest to the honourable member for Riverina that he withdraw the remark.",51
285,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"I am not quite certain of the remark, but would the honourable member for Shortland accept a compromise? He is a rabbit. Mr Morris- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to order. I have sought already your aid in requesting the honourable member for Riverina to withdraw remarks he made about me which I found to be grossly offensive and intimidatory. He does not recall the remarks. I recall them and I asked that he be directed to withdraw them. In further flouting",51
286,Unknown,NOES,"Honourable members interjecting Mr Morris- Mr Acting Speaker, may I have the attention of members of the House and protection from members of the National Country Party?",51
287,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! If the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina reflected upon any individual member, I ask him to withdraw them.",51
288,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,My words were that the name of the honourable member for Shortland would be at the top of the list; nothing else. I then,51
289,Mr YOUNG,NOES,Mr Acting Speaker,51
290,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will resume his seat.,51
291,Mr YOUNG,NOES,Is he going to withdraw or not?,51
292,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will resume his seat. The remarks that the honourable member for Riverina made need not be offensive except in the context in which they were made. I said that I did not hear the context in which they were made. But those remarks, in a certain context, could be offensive to the honourable member for Shortland. I ask the honourable member for Riverina to withdraw them.",51
293,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"I withdraw, Mr Acting Speaker. Mr Morris- Mr Acting Speaker, I further requested you to direct your attention to the subsequent remark of the honourable member for Riverina when he flouted your further",51
294,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Riverina withdrew the remark. Mr Morris-What about the second one? There was a further remark.,51
295,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I withdraw the remark that the honourable member for Shortland is a rabbit. I would now like to raise an imponant matter",51
296,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Riverina will resume his seat. Mr Klugman-Why do you not go back to the backwoods?,52
297,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Riverina has withdrawn the remark that he made about the honourable member for Shortland. I call the honourable member for Riverina.,52
298,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,I would now like to turn to an important matter affecting not only my electorate but also many other important parts of Australia. I refer to drought. This natural disaster,52
299,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,Ha !,52
300,Mr SUUJVAN,NOES,"It is wonderful to hear the laughter from the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) when the word' drought' is mentioned. Mr Armitage- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to take a point of order. The honourable member for Riverina just accused me of laughing about a drought issue. I had not even opened my mouth.",52
301,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Mr Armitage- I ask for a withdrawal.,52
302,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,The honourable member for Chifley will resume his seat. The honourable member has been a member of the House long enough to know that there is no substance in the point of order he has taken. Mr Armitage-It has been said,52
303,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Chifley will resume his seat. I call the honourable member for Riverina.,52
304,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,Drough t is undoubtedly the worse of all disasters for country people and farmers.,52
305,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I remind honourable members that there are people visiting the Parliament today and that the proceedings are broadcast. As I have said previously, I suggest that honourable members remember this and remember that they are members of the Commonwealth Parliament. The behaviour today has not been fitting behaviour for the Parliament of this Commonwealth. Suspension of Standing Orders",52
306,Dr CASS,NOES,"I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs from speaking to his statement on the Prices Justification Tribunal and the honourable member for Port Adelaide from replying, each speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Mr Acting Speaker, I make this suggestion because, as we witnessed during the last speech by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan), rancour is still high. Feelings are distinctly ruffled over what I might suggest is an area of misunderstanding. I do not accept that there was necessarily any intention to deceive on either side. From what I heard of what occurred earUer on when there was an attempt made",52
307,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to order. There have already been 3 motions this afternoon which have cast general suggestions regarding this same proposition. For this reason, I would suggest that understanding order 169 the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders for an almost identical purpose sought in the other motions is out of order.",52
308,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"There is an element of justification in what the Leader of the House has said. I had spoken to the honourable member for Maribyrnong and said that the motion had a parallel in what had already been moved and rejected by the House. I point out also that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is discussing the subject matter which the motion seeks to have discussed rather than the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. I suggest that in this instance, in view of the circumstances, perhaps the honourable member should move the motion and have it seconded without a great deal of discussion or debate.",52
309,Dr CASS,NOES,I am attempting not to discuss the argument we have had all afternoon; I am trying to point out that it arose perhaps because we misunderstood the intentions of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). I am granting,52
310,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to take another point of order. I know that you are seeking to resolve the problems of the House. But I point out to you that we have had 3 motions all of which, in fact, have been voted against and all of which in substance were the same as the motion that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is now submitting to the House. In accordance with standing order 169, I suggest that it is not competent within the rules and procedures of this place for a motion to repeat the substance of an earlier motion. I therefore suggest that this motion is not in order. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise to speak to the point of order. There is an essential difference between the motion which the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) is seeking to move and any of the previous motions moved today. The previous motions all sought that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) should speak. This one seeks not only that he should speak but also that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) should speak. Therefore, it is obviously different from the previous ones. Instead stating that one honourable member or a member of one Party only should speak, this modon put that 2 members should speak-that a member should speak from each side. It specifies the subject and the length of time. The subject same and thetimeis the same. But it is essentially different from any previous motion that has been moved. It is an emollient- a soothing lotion. It should at least let us get on with the business the House which was interrupted at 11.30 a.m. The time of the House has been wasted ever since.",52
311,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Yes , thanks to you. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I can answer that interjection if you permit interjections. The whole evil came about in this way: The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) sought leave-h e needed leave-to make a statement. The legitimate point was made that leave would not be given to the detriment of the grievance day debate; leave would be given any othertimein the day-after noon or night. The Minister required leave. The Opposition said it would give leave at any time other than to the detriment of grievance day. Then, Sir",53
312,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! May I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that in regard to his answer to the point of order raised by the Leader of the House, the motion moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) was discussed with me. I felt it had justification for reasons that I have intimated from this chair on more than one occasion today. Secondly, there is a difference in the sense not necessarily of a different person being named but in the sense that there is a limitation oftimefor the total debate on this subject. Previous motions have been in terms of a general debate. It is therefore within the province of the Government and the Parliament to make a decision on the merits or otherwise of the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in that regard. The honourable member for Maribyrnong discussed this matter with me prior to moving his motion. I suggested that the time in presenting it be Umited. It was for those reasons that I accepted the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. I call the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",53
313,Dr CASS,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I accept your proposition and shall conclude my remarks. At one stage today you yourself suggested when of there was a rather unfortunate interjection and some cross-fire that we forget it and revert to an original situation. That was accepted as a way of overcoming an impossible situation. This motion seeks to return us to where we were before the is the whole misunderstanding arose. I moved the motion in good faith for that reason. It gives the Minister a chance to put his views; it gives the Opposition a chance to state its view. This would of normally have been the accepted procedure. Grievance day has gone anyway.",53
314,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,Thank s to you.,53
315,Dr CASS,NOES,I shall ignore the ungracious interjection by the Leader of the House because I am seeking to overcome something which I concede is painful to him as well as painful to me.,53
316,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,It is not at all painful for me.,53
317,Dr CASS,NOES,"If it is not painful to him, it is a reflection on his lack of sensitivity.",53
318,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Is the motion seconded? Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.9)- Mr Acting Speaker, I second the motion. The motion which you have allowed to be put will in fact allow the House to get back on to an even keel. You have tried manfully to achieve that for the last 5 or 6 hours. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs sought leave to make a ministerial statement. The Opposition would like him to make that ministerial statement. The Government would concede the right of the spokesman on business and consumer affairs on the Opposition side to make a statement on the same subject after the Minister. The whole mischief has come about because the Minister sought leave to make the statement durmg grievance day. Leave was refused at that time. It was stated at thetime-I myself statedthat leave would be given to the Minister to make the statement this afternoon or, if he so wished, tonight. We wanted him to make the statement. We were not satisfied with reading it in this morning's papers. We also wanted to reply. The reply has been prepared. The mischief was aggravated when the Minister tabled the statement and the grievance debate was brought on. The shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs sought to speak-h e was entitled to speak-and he was gagged. I do not remember an occasion when, during grievance day, an honourable member has been gagged.",53
319,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"May I suggest to the Leader of the Opposidon that in speaking to the point of order previously and up to this stage perhaps sufficient explanation has been given? Mr E. G. Whitlam- Sir, I believe it would be in the interests of this House-the institutionand it would be a decent acknowledgement of your own efforts over the last few hours if this motion were put, if it were carried without a vote and the Minister and the shadow Minister were then to make the statements they have been itching to make for the whole of the week.",54
320,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,The question is that the motion be agreed to.,54
321,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Toda y has been quite incredible. We have now been told in sweet reason according to the honourable member for Maribyrnong that he is putting forward a compromise. He fails to accept that equally with sweet reason and equally with an object of compromise we have deferred the passage of critically urgent legislation, legislation that must be introduced so that it wijl be available for the benefit of the people of Australia by 1 October. Every member of this House is aware that the Senate normallyrisesof a Thursday evening. It had been our hope that we would be able to pass the legislation in relation to health insurance and the Family Law Amendment Bill so that it could have been referred to another place so that that chamber would have had notice of the legislation and in order that it could be adequately considered for debate next week. Because of the tactics of the Opposition today, that has been preciuded. The second point is that I accept that members of the Opposiuon feel very strongly on this issue. I felt that, well, the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) was available. There would be an opportumty in that debate to talk about any subject whatsoever. The statement on the Prices Justification Tribunal is one which T believe could have been effectively dealt with in a very brief period of time this morning in a normal and proper fashion. The Opposition chose otherwise. There will be an opportunity when the legislation is introduced into this House. Every member of the Opposition was party to a system which denied Government supporters when in Opposition any chance at all to debate matters of substance as far as the policy proposals of the then government were concerned. The only occasions on which we were allowed to debate were on those limited occasions, subject to guihotineMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker",54
322,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order!,54
323,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Is the Leader of the Opposition taking a point of order? Mr E. Q, Whitlam-Yes, I amWhen you sit down I shall express a, point pf order.",54
324,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Jrlave you taken a point of order? Mr E. G, Whitlam-Yes, I so state.",54
325,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Well, thank you. I am delighted to hear it. I was waiting for you to state so.",54
326,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"I call the Leader of the Opposition. Mr E. G, Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. I reduced the length of my remarks and lowered the tenor of them in deference tq your efforts. The Leader of the House is speaking at great length, and with great provocation. He is not helping the situation. He has referred to the! conduct of my Government. The fact is that no grievance day was ever ousted or reducedNo general business day was ever ousted. Every general business motion was brought to a vote, if provocative statements like this are made they will be answered.",54
327,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order ! One of the joys of this situation today has been that this has been one of the things that has been happening during the whole of the day. I allowed the Leader of the House perhaps to stray a little bit from the line because we had had 2 speakers from the Opposition in relation to this subject and bpth did not speak strictly to the subject. Might I suggest to the Leader of the House that he remain within the confines of the motion for the suspension pf Standing Orders to allow the subject to be debatedI call the Leader of the House.,54
328,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I would be very pleased to do so. I think that the interruptions that are now being made demonstrate how little regard there really is Mr Charles Jones-My Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the House made a statement to trie effect that h wanted his e legislation through this House so as to get it into the Senate today-1 just draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the Senate has not been sitting since midday today and will not sit again today.",54
329,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! No point of order is involved.,55
330,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,It rose at a quarter to twelve.,55
331,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I call the honourable member for Prospect to order.,55
332,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,The Senate rose at a quarter to twelve.,55
333,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Prospect will come to order. I call the Leader of the House.,55
334,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"The honourable member for Newcastle is very funny. He needs someone to sway his normal attitudes in this chamber. The pomt before us, however, is not the mterruption by the honourable member for Newcastle; it is whether or not Standing Orders should be suspended to enable the restoration to the agenda of an item which was properly set down for the beginning of the day's business. The Labor Party does not seem to realise that there are adequate procedures during the debate on the Appropriation Bill. If honourable members opposite wish to continue a debate on the Prices Justification Tribunal every one of them knows that there is adequate opportunity for them to talk if they so wish.",55
335,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"On a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker",55
336,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,In relation to the suspension of Standing Orders,55
337,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order",55
338,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,I have spoken for 4 minutes. I have been,55
339,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"I have tried to speak to a point of order 4 times, goat.",55
340,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I take offence at that remark and I ask that he withdraw it.",55
341,Mr YOUNG,NOES,I was praising you up.,55
342,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order!,55
343,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark. I regard it as grossly offensive.",55
344,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that that remark did not help in any way and that it ought to be withdrawn.,55
345,Mr YOUNG,NOES,"I still rise on my pomt of order cause the people Ustening to this debate may get the impression that we will have an opportumty to speak about the Prices Justification Tribunal during the debate on the Appropriation Bills. That is not correct. The only honourable members who can speak in that debate are those who have not spoken in it during the last month. As a shadow Minister I have already spoken in that debate. I cannot take the opportumty to speak in that debate again, although the Leader of the House is trying to mislead the House by saying that I can do so.",55
346,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide has made his point.,55
347,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"I believe that these frivolous points of order are not exactly helping the tenor of the debate. There have been a series of points of order taken, none of which has much relevance in seeking to prevent the debate on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I take the point of order that any member of the House, even the Leader of the House, has to speak with relevance to the subject matter of the debate. The Leader of the House has said, by way of explaining his gagging of the shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the grievance debate this morning, that the shadow Minister could have spoken on the subject of the Prices Justification Tribunal during the Budget debate.",55
348,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The point of order that the Leader of the Opposition has taken was taken by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I said to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that it was not a point of order. It is more a debating point than a point of order. The Leader of the House, if my memory serves me correctly, said that members could speak in the Budget debate. He did not refer to any particular member. I say in relation to the point of order that one cannot tell whether a point of order is effective or not until it is taken.",55
349,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, there is an opportunityMr E. G. Whitlam-On a point of order",55
350,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"You forget you are no longer in government, my boyMr E. G. Whitlam-The Leader of the House wttl not be in government much longer, the way he is going.",55
351,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Leader beofthe Opposition has a pomt of order to make? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes. The corollary I wanted to put is this: In the debate on the Appropriation Bills the Minister could make a statement without leave also on the same subject. The argument cuts both ways. Therefore, the argument that the Leader of the House is putting is no argument of relevance to the motion.",55
352,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,I think the Leader of the Opposidon has said it was an argument and not a point of order.,56
353,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Once again the Opposition has demonstrated that it just does not really accept the fact that it is in Opposition. The whole of the intrusion that honourable members opposite have made has been designed to disrupt the business of this House. They, and they alone, stopped the grievance debate this morning. We are quite prepared to allow the grievance debate to continue. In fact, we moved a motion last week to enable the grievance debate to continue in the normal way. The reason why we sought leave to make the statement this morning was that we believe the proper place for ministerial statements to be made is in this chamber. It is for that reason that the statement was set down for delivery this morning in the normal course of events. The procedures of this House provide several opportunities for debate on the Prices Justification Tribunal. Those honourable members who have not spoken in the debate on the Appropriation Bills can do so and refer to the Prices Justification Tribunal. Those honourable members who have spoken in the debate on the Appropriation Bills can refer to the Prices Justification bunal during the Estimates debate. An opportunity to discuss the Prices Justification Tribunal is available in debates on matters of public importance. Honourable members opposite can raise such a matter next week if they desire. There will be an opportunity to discuss the Prices Justification Tribunal when the Prices Justification Tribunal legislation is introduced into this chamber. There is no reason for us to go back to the beginning of the day. There is an opportunity to discuss the Prices Justification Tribunal in the debate on the Appropriation Bills, which we have called on for debate. Honourable members opposite tried to interrupt that debate when the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) was speaking. Through the debate on the Appropriation Bills we are trying to arrange for the proper conduct of the affairs of this House. I suggest it is for that reason that this motion should be rejected.",56

355,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"In supporting the remarks of my colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), I should like, firstly, to say I tliink the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) introduced this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to try to calm down the situation somewhat-somethin g that perhaps we all want to see happen. But I pomt out to him that there was an opportunity for both the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who is a shadow Minister, to air their views in relation to the Prices Justification Tribunal-on e presenting a statement on it and the other replying to the statement. This had been arranged. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) stated that when he was Prime Mmister and when we were in Opposition there was no interference with the time provided for grievance debates and general business debates. Although this is something that I would have to check out, I accept his word on it. I remember many occasions when we were in Opposition and wanted to raise matters which we believed were important. We were gagged before we could say even two or three words. On occasions we listed matters of public importance and they were accepted by the then Speaker who was a member of the Australian Labor Party. We had a list of speakers from our side and the Labor Party had a list of speakers from its side. The moment an honourable member from our Tri- side stood up to speak on the matter of public importance government business was brought on. No consideration was given to the Opposition. Today we at least did provide, and I say reasonably fairly, an opportunity for both sides of the chamber to be heard on the subject matter of the statement. That is fair comment. Even the honourable member for Port Adelaide would agree with that. But honourable members opposite chose not to grant us leave to make the statement. Let us be reasonable: They made that choice. I accept what the former Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition has said, that their reason for refusing leave to make the statement was that they did not want the making of that statement to occur during the time provided for the grievance debate. I accept that as fairly logical reasoning. But we happen to be the Government. (Quorum formed). I was trying to keep this debate on a calm basis before being interrupted by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) who obviously did not like what I was saying. To return to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders that is before us, I suggest, as the Leader of the House has put forward, that this matter of the Prices Justification Tribunal should be dealt with as a matter of public importance next week. We will allow the Opposition to raise it as a matter of public importance if it wishes. We will welcome it. Perhaps we will raise the question as a matter of public importance ourselves and provide speakers in the debate. If that does not suit honourable members opposite then, as the Leader of the House has suggested, they have other opportunities to debate trus matter. But for goodness sake, we have a program to implement. I say to honourable members opposite: Do not get carried away with the idea that in Opposition they are going to be able to dictate to the Government. If they have any illusions about that I ask them toringup Freddy Daly, the former Leader of the House, and ask him how the House should be run. Get his idea on it. Nothing that we could do would exemplify that better.",56

357,Dr CASS,PAIRS," I take advantage of the opportunity offered by the agreed to. Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and commence my remarks by making some brief comments on the Prices Justification Tribunal. We have heard a lot and we have been lectured a lot 22 by the Government on the need to be respon60 sible, particularly if one belongs to the wage and salary earning section of the community, and the 38 need to lower our demands and contain our desires for a better way of life, all in the cause of reducing in effect the share of the wealth of the Keating, P. J. Klugman, R. E. community flowing to wage and salary earners so that more of the resources in terms of the gross national product can flow back to the private sector. There are various legal restrictions inhibiting increases in wages. There is a need for those workers who want to have their wages increased to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission year in and year out and put their case. But we hear nothing of the other side of the coin. After all it is not just wages that are of concern to the whole community; it is also prices. We now have the intriguing spectacle of the Government proceeding to modify the Prices Justification Tribunal-a n instrument set up by the previous Labor Government to attempt to Macphee, I. M. Martyr, J. R. control increases in prices in much the same way as increases in wages have been controlled in this Moore, J. C. Neil.M.J. country for many years. The essence of the Government's proposals is the drawing of the mere two or three teeth that the Prices Justification Tribunal has had. The effect of the Government's proposals will be to leave it solely at the discretion of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) whether there ought to be inquiries or requirements for certain types of compames to present some justification for increasing their prices. That is to be left purely to the discretion of the Minister. The turnover level beyond which compames are expected automatically to apply to the Prices Justification Tribunal for permission to increase prices has been increased to such an extent that very few companies will be now covered by the requirements of the Prices Justification Tribunal. We are Uving in an atmosphere in which the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party generally are forever being badgered and told that workers must be responsible and that their demands must be restrained in order to ensure that the country can get onto its feet economically again. At the same ume the Government is removing the very modest restraints which may have persuaded the private sector to moderate its price increases. It is making a mockery of the very advice it is giving the trade union movement. It is quite clear that the whole thrust of the Government's approach is simply to beat down the working secuon of the community. Imagine what sorts of effects this will have on the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the whole trade union movement when they next apply to the ConciUation and Arbitrauon Commission for wage justice. Why should they be restrained? Why should the trade union movement not threaten industrial action in view of these sorts of activities being undertaken by the present Government? The call for responsibility should apply to all sides. Quite frankly, I think we are all on the wrong track. I trunk the cry for this sort of restraint will not solve the problem, but I do not want to lecture on that at the moment. Accepting for the moment the Government's assumptions about the causes of inflation and about where we need to have restraint, it seems totally unjust that the only restraint is being placed on the trade umon section of the community and not on the private enterprise sec,tion of the community. I am quite sure it is not difficult to find cases-ther e have often been reports of such cases-of blatantly unreasonable increases in prices that have had no relationship to cost increases but simply to the fact that they were as high as the market would bear. So much for the Prices Justification Tribunal. In keeping with the whole Government approach-restrain t in all areas-this Budget has shown that, whereas the Labor Government may have made some mistakes in attempting to stimulate development in areas which have been stultified for 20 years, the only positive actionthis is a rather Irish approach, I guess-th present Government has taken has been to stifle every initiative the Labor Government put forward, every initiative the Australian community voted for, and every initiative we talked about in the period from about 1968 onwards until we were elected which clearly excited the Australian community and prompted people to vote for a Labor Government. In all these areas of restriction and strangulation of programs which were applauded when they were introduced, the area of health service expenditure is an area where the effect is perhaps the greatest. The Liberal Government's austerity measures have been amongst the most brutal and short sighted and eventually will be recognised as having been quite counter-productive. Let me start with a comment on Medibank. With the help-in ignorance, I might point out-of the Liberal and Country parties while in Opposition the Labor Government was able to introduce a truly comprehensive national health insurance program, Medibank, financed in the socially most equitable fashion possible, via general taxation revenue. That was not our original proposal. When we originally put the proposal for a national health insurance system, we proposed a levy. We recognised that the money had to come from somewhere. Before our proposal, the money was coming from the taxpayer via his contributions to voluntary health funds, via his contributions to taxation revenue and via the payments he made out of his pocket directly to doctors. We knew that. We knew what the position would be if we took the radical step of introducing a comprehensive national health insurance system. I put the word 'radical' in inverted commas, because it was not a radical step. Any sensible Liberal Government would have seen the point of it and taken the step itself. When we took the step of introducing a comprehensive national health insurance system, quite clearly the money which had previously been channelled to the health services, the doctors and hospitals, by the other means I have just mentioned, had to go through a central agency-the nauonal health insurance office. Funds for that office could have been raised in 2 ways. The money could have come via the taxation system or a levy could have been imposed. Put another way, mstead of people contributing to voluntary funds they could contribute to the national health insurance fund. That is still a levy. The Labor Government, not wanting to be too revolutionary, proposed a ievy. It was in keeping e with what the community was used to. Payments to benefit funds were in essence a levy. There was nothing voluntary about them, because if a person did not contribute to a so-called voluntary fund, when he was sick and paid the bill he could not get his Commonwealth medical or hospital benefit. Just understand that. There was nothing voluntary about the previous system. People were forced to contribute to the voluntary funds in order to be able to claim Commonwealth hospital or medical benefits. So it was perfectly logical to suggest a levy to take the place of contributions to the benefit funds. Taxation revenue was still to continue to provide the same subsidy as it provided under the Liberal and Country parties when they were last in government-n o difference. But I concede that the levy was not as socially equitable as taking the whole lot out of taxation revenue. The former Opposition, in its blind ignorance, opposed the levy. We quite happily accepted defeat of our levy Bill, because we were then able to finance Medibank, the national health insurance system, completely via taxation revenue, which was a much more socially equitable system. Mr Martyr-And rob everybody.",57
358,Dr CASS,PAIRS,"That is an idiot comment, because everybody has to pay for his health services. If person is sick he has to pay out of his pocket somehow. All our system did was make sure there was more social equity in the way people had to pay. Foolishly, the former Opposition its blind opposition to anything any opponent the Labor Party cares to call socialist rushed like a bull in a china shop. Ostensibly its purpose was to nip a socialist experiment in the bud andsuch was the then Opposition's blind beliefcent save the Government and hence the taxpayer money. Honourable members opposite should Medibank. take off their ideological blinkers and see what they have done. In terms of cost to the comation munity, money paid out by the community, whether via the taxation system, via the vate Medibank levy, via contributions to benefit to funds or in the form of direct payments to doctem tors and hospitals, the real total cost-no t just payments via the taxation system, which is what honourable members opposite crow about-wil l go up dramatically because of the stupid medtax. dling of honourable members opposite. I ask them to think for a few minutes, if can sustain the effort for that long without coming over-emotional and irrational. The cost of our health services are the costs of the medical services. These costs include the fees paid to the doctors. Whether they are paid by Medibank or private fund or paid directly from the patient's pocket is irrelevant. They include also the bills paid to the hospitals, again irrespective of how they are paid, andfinallythe administrative costs of getting the money transferred from the community to the doctors and the hospitals. Honourable members opposite crow a lot about the cost of Medibank and the disastrous increases in the cost of Medibank. They are talking balderdash. Under Medibank the money which eventually must be paid to the doctors and the hospitals was to be collected via the taxation system. In order to collect that money the Taxation Office did not have to mcrease its expenditure one cent. All it had to do was increase the scale of taxation people had to pay. The present Government has done this, but it is so dishonest that it is not prepared to admit that it has done it. Its levy is nothing but a tax. Collecting the money via the taxation system saves everybody a lot of bother. They do not have to fill in forms and apply to particular funds. They do not have to make sure that they pay their contributions weekly, monthly, yearly or however they decide. Under such a system they tend to forget and find that they are in arrears. It is all done automatically in the same way as, hopefully, people pay their superannuation a contributions. The money is automatically taken out of people's pay packets. That is all the that Medibank collection system was about. The money having been so collected, it could be disin tributed by one central agency with a large of efficient computer facility, which would have in made it far more efficient from everybody's point of view. Of course, Medibank was so efficient that its administrative costs were less than 4 per of total costs. I admit that for every dollar paid by the taxpayer 4 cents was wasted by That is still the situation, and we have not yet reached 1 October. But what is the situunder the voluntary health fund system? People have to make their own individual priarrangements. If they are lucky and belong a firm that is prepared to put in a closed systhen their contributions are automatically the taken out of their pay packets by the company. It is a tax. Does it matter whether the tax is for a private fund or for the Government? It is still a But most people are not in that happy position. Most people have to make a conscious effort to go to a chemist shop or to make up their they mind which fund they will join and then write beinto the appropriate fund in order to make their contribution. It is not just the money, it is the time and effort as well which is never counted. There is also the question of the size and variety of the funds. Until recently there were more than 100 different funds in the hospital and medical areas. I know that over the last year that figure has dropped and the number is now in the mid eighdes, but there are still a large number of different funds, all with their separate administrations, all with their different techniques, all dealing across the country with a variety of patients and doctors. How can that be as efficient as the Medibank system? It cannot, and the facts prove it. If one looks at the last report tabled in this House on the costs and financial dealings of the benefit funds one will find that for every $ 1 a contributor pays to the voluntary funds 14.8c-15c-is lost, wasted, compared with only 4 cents for Medibank. In short, the end result of the Government's meddling is at least a doubling of the administrative costs of the whole system, as well as an enormous waste of time and effort by the community to fulfil all the requirements, make all the extra decisions, fill in all the paper etc. Medibank is a great achievement of the Labor Government but it is now being mutilated beyond recognition by unnecessary Liberal Government surgery. The Liberal Government surgery on the funding of the community health facilities might well prove fatal. In its last Budget, Labor allocated $70.7m for these services and, if our programs had been sustained and our commitments fulfilled, $88m would have been allocated this year instead of the $71.8m this Government has allocated. True, only $55m was spent lastfinancialyear because as soon as this Government came in it dilly-dallied and delayed and many of the projects that we had approved were stopped, crippled, destroyed. That is why the Government has spent less than Labor budgeted for. At the same time, because of those restraints, State governments imposed restrictions on the appointment of new staff and even on the replacement of staff. If someone resigned he could not even be replaced. That has created an idiot situation where, because of previous approvals, in many areas the necessary elaborate facilides are being built, and people trying to run health centres in cramped temporary quarters with half a dozen staff are faced with the prospect of running their services in the elaborate facilities with a third or a quarter or even less of the staff they need to run the service properly. The community has shown its appreciation and isflockingto these centres. Figures are available indicating the patronage of the centres in Canberra. No one could suggest that the public servants in this city are being forced to frequent the health centres. No one could suggest that the community in Canberra is being forced against its will to patronise the community health centres. Yet I notice that thefigurescoming out indicate that doctors in these centres are expected to cope with three or four times the number of patients that it is reasonable to expect a general practitioner anywhere else to cope with. What is the response of the Government? The people are showing what they believe in. They are voting approval for these centres by going to the doors. So the Government has said: 'You cannot now go unless you live in a certain area', thereby imposing geographical limitations. The Labor Government was accused of that sort of potential restriction, but we never imposed such a restriction. People should be free to go wherever they choose. The Liberal Government is imposing restrictions on who can go to what health centre-if they do not Uve in the appropriate area they are not allowed to go. Honourable members opposite talk about Labor being dictators! If people continue to go to the centres, the centres are not allowed to increase their staff. They wear their doctors into the ground, they wear their nursing staff into the ground. They have to let the standard of service deteriorate because the staff just cannot cope with the work load. Then, because the service falls off, the Government encourages private practitioners to come in and set up in opposition to the centre. There are even ancillary medical personnel such as chemists and other people in these health centres, and it is recognised that that is necessary. The Government is encouraging private chemists to come in and set up their private chemist shops, selUng all the things that chemists sell. That is a sheer waste of community resources. Articles have appeared in the academic pharmaceutical Press suggesting that there are too many chemists, but the Government is busy encouraging more of them. They come in and set up near the health centres and the Government then says that is does not need to have a chemist in the health centre any more. They put the chemists out and increase the inconvenience to patients, who cannot then get their drugs and medicines at the health centres and have to go to a nearby chemist. All this is being done to prop up a system which is going to strangle the community. It will encourage excessive pharmaceutical consumption, excessive administrative costs, and blatant waste all round. The Government's approach in the Budget is sheer hypocrisy. It is not business efficiency, it is business inefficiency. The approach of the Labor Party was the efficient approach. This Government's approach is just a blinkered ideological opposition to anything which might be more efficient if it is in any way similar to anything the Labor Party may have thought about and may therefore be called socialist.",59
359,Mr DOBIE,PAIRS," It is not my intention to follow the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), and discuss Medibank, but he used the word 'balderdash* in relation to costs of health schemes increasing. I would refer him to articles, particularly in today's Press, about what is happening to the French scheme. Without the proper costs and proper controls which have been introduced by this Government I put it to the House that we might well have been in the same position as the French. At this stage of the Budget debate-and we are debating the Budget-mos t of the issues have been raised and presented by members who sit on the Government benches. The experience, the talent, the compassion and the concern of my Party collegues have been illustrated for all to see. It would be fair and objective to say that no Parliament in Australia's history has been able to boast such a great collective talent as that which normally sits on the Government side during debates. As most Australians realise-this was said in a famous stage musicalthe country is in the very best of hands. But what of the contributions to this most important of economic debates by members of the socialist Party who occupy the Opposition benches? What can be said about them and their contributions? Most of the socialists in this House have demonstrated clearly that they just do not understand how to run a country. They have shown by their continuing attitudes that they have learned absolutely nothing from their past mistakes. They continue to promote the theme of class consciousness. They hide their ignorance of economics by sliding into personal abuse. They refuse to accept that it is as a result of their utter disregard for responsible government, as opposed to popular government for sectional interests, that Australia has been forced into its parlous economic position. In one speech after another in this debate there has been an almost unbelievably stubborn refusal by members of the Labor Party to accept that their socialist theories were impractical, that their socialist doctrines were self-centred and, for Austraha, almost self-destroying. Not one member opposite has seen the error of his ways. Not one member opposite has revealed the slightest concern for the plight into which Labor plunged Australia. The small business operator was a particular target for Labor, and no wonder. It is the classical socialist program to destroy small business, remove the spirit of individual enterprise and then, when it is good and ready, to nationalise and socialise the major industries one by one. Centralise, nationalise and socialise the lot-that was Labor's battle cry. Let us not be fooled into forgetting, nor letting the Australian public forget, that Labor had no other ambition during its 3 years of government. The sense of hopelessness which it brought to young Australians, the lack of opportunities for satisfying their desired careers, its almost manic concern for changing the very structure of the Australian economy, and its disregard for established social patterns-al l these ambitions, all these sinister nearachievements were the background against which an almost total economic collapse would have occurred had there not been a change of government at the end of 1975; and the Australian public knew that too. It is the background against which the Australian electorate voted in the Fraser Government in what was the greatest poltiical victory ever known in Australia. It is the background against which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has had to make serious economic decisions, as the facts 'of the previous Whitlam Government's mismanagement of the country regularly reveal themselves. Not for 40 years has an incoming Treasurer had to grapple with so much confusion inherited from a previous government. It is against that background that this Budget must be assessed and critically examined. It is against the Fraser Government's ambition to restore real values to the Australian way of life that Australians should regard the Budget. How have they regarded it? First of all, let me say that I believe that this Budget has been accepted by the man in the street. After all the drama we have experienced with the Whitlam reign of mismanagement, the average Australian is very relieved to know that despite the need for redirection in money matters the Fraser Government has not raised any major tax. Contrary to the prognostications of the ladies and gentlemen in the Canberra Press Gallery, the price of beer did not increase, petrol did not become more expensive, and cigarettes were not increased in price. Popular though those concessions were with so many people in the community, the really important acceptance of this Lynch Budget related to the tax indexation of personal incomes, together with the decision to increase social welfare in real terms, to accept a greater financial responsibiUty in the field of education, again in real terms, and to bring back some realism in the field of defence spending. What happened on 17 August 1976 showed that the Fraser Administration was determined not to follow the lead of the Whitlamites of robbing the working man of his financial independence and his hopes. It showed that this Administration, the Fraser Administration, was fair dinkum in its plan to show a special concern for the underprivileged in the Australian community. It showed that the Fraser Administration was game enough to come out and make responsible decisions to put the whole economy back on therightroad. Now that we have the Budget before us, we know that the family allowance scheme was not aflashin the pan. This Government is compassionately concerned with raising the disadvantaged beyond and out of their disadvantage. After years of discussion by all parties in this House, pensions have been taken out of a wretched political arena. Although the Government must continue to proceed again next year with the policy plan of removing the means test, the formal attachment of the pension rate to the consumer price index is a grand move forward. It is a humane and dignified decision which all sections of this House must support, for all sections of this House have, in one way and another, worked towards it. It is not a decision that should be viewed with party political pride. It should be seen as a culmination of much effort that has been put into the welfare of the aged by members who sit in this House today representing such electorates as Mackellar, Sturt and Oxley. The family allowance is so fundamental a decision that one wonders why on earth none of us had not thought ofit before. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will be remembered long and affectionately for that significant policy decision. The increase in payments to handicapped children from $10 to $ 15 is also most welcome, but I am sure that the Treasurer is aware of the great needs which still remain for educating the handicapped child into the tertiary area of education. Of course much has been done and there are countless stories of young people who have overcome not only their own disability but often the education systems themselves to achieve success. My own memory in this regard goes back to when I was being tutored by a totally blind graduate in Queensland when I was preparing for matriculation. That person, Miss Mercy Griffin, was one of the great people that Austraiia has produced. Her achievements were the result of her own great efforts. It remains very much within the motivation of many significantly deaf and blind young folk themselves to achieve higher educational awards. I hope that next year's Budget will see the extension of appropriate educational allowances and the extension of invaUd pensions to disabled children over the age of 16 years who remain full-time students. It is an area that seems to have been cruelly overlooked, and perhaps that may be due to the fact that the numbers involved are not great. However, it is my intention to speak on this subject more fully in debates other than the one presently before the House. I support the economic thrust of the Lynch Budget. I believe it has made a very honest attempt to restore confidence and to provide stimuli in needy quarters. We all accept the need for promoting private entrepreneurial skills, and it is fascinating to read that in my own State we now have a socialist Premier who is making noises in support of private industry in a way which would have him driven out of the Federal section of this Party. In vain have I waited for just one honourable member opposite to mention the need for reviewing that section of the economy which provides three-quarters of the job opportunities in Australia. It is gratifying to note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce, for example, has found that its State chambers are unanimously agreed that the Budget represents a responsible and courageous approach to Australias present economic problems. The Chambers of Commerce said that they are confident that the incentives provided in the Budget will encourage business enterprises and consumers to enter new spending commitments and thus help lift the level of activity in the economy. The President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce said: Responsible economic management has to be accompanied by resposible community attitudes and realistic expectations. I am certain that industry, commerce and the community are awaiting strong leads and are most anxious to promote what is becoming a consumer based recovery. There can be no doubt that one of the great hurdles we have to overcome is the high level of interest rates. We are all aware of it. Quite obviously there is no easy or quick solution to that problem. I believe, however, that we have room for certain negotiations and initiatives. I would like to put forward one thought: Recent comments by the Australian money market dealers suggest that they are no longer confident in the prospect of an early or sharp drop in interest rates. I share that concern, yet I realise that there is no easy government action which can be taken. I know that the level of interest rates does have the Treasurer's keen attention and that he is concerned. I would not wish to deny the extraordinary complexities which surround the establishment of interest rates by those whose duties are involved with money management. However, I want to draw the attention of House to one aspect of interest rates. I refer to interest rate that is paid by the Reserve Bank of Australia for statutory reserve deposits. As honourable members are no doubt aware, the rate of 0.75 per cent has been paid, apart from short break in 1956, since 1941. That rate originally estabhshed to secure that the trading profits of the trading banks did not exceed the average of their annual trading profit for years ended 31 August 1939. That interest rate has been enshrined in official thinking ever since. While the rate was designed as a form of profit control, it was also related to a discount on the Treasury bill rate. Despite what could be serving referred to as radical changes in the rates of interest in the markets for money in Australia, the rate paid for statutory reserve deposits remains at 0.75 per cent. It is no longer to say with any sanity or responsibihty that the rate bears any direct relationship to any other interest rate in the market, with the exception perhaps of the non-market and archaic Treasury bill rate. Histories of statutory reserve deposits and their interest rates are really quite crazy. put it to honourable members that they have same anachronism that the payroll tax had when it was introduced to pay child endowment. I lieve we have reached this stage where statutory reserve deposits should attract an interest rate commercially viable and which would allow the trading banks the chance for greater downward mobility in the rates of interest it charges for lending to its customers. I do hope that the Treasurer, as a matter of some urgency, will enter into serious discussions not only with Reserve Bank, but also with the trading banks involved, to see what would be achieved if tory reserve deposits were taken interest rate. I believe personally that such a move would allow a reduction in bank rates on considerate.I overdrafts to commence. To illustrate the problem of interest rates, I Budgets. refer to a table in the March 1976 issue of Reserve Bank Statistics which shows that in December 1972 when the Liberal Party last governed the country 90 per cent of total adthe vances outstanding were being charged less than 8 per cent. After 3 years of Labor Government, that is in December 1975, 90 per cent oftotal vances outstanding were being charged less than 13 per cent. In other words, the charged as a result of the unknowing, uninformed economic policies of the people opposite when in government, is some 5 per cent more. It is a serious burden on all borrowers, especially the individual customer and especially too for the the home borrower who is badly affected by the the level of interest rates over a very long period. The position of interest rates must be improved, and respectfully I put forward the a thought that a thorough investigation of the poswas ition of interest paid by the Reserve Bank on statutory reserve deposits could be the starting point we are looking for. I believe that this rate the 3 can be changed by the Reserve Bank with the approval of the Treasurer from time to time and it does not require parliamentary legislation. The interest rate on the statutoryreservedeposits, as I have said, is archaic. It must be seen as no longer its original purpose of profit control of the trading banks of Australia, but rather I believe it must be seen in its true light of having a deleterious and distorting effect on the various possible money markets in Australia. As an aside, I would like to comment a little on the revaluation of the Australian dollar, about which much has been said in recent days. During my recent trip overseas I spoke to many people I interested in investing in Australia. My prothe fessional associations with them showed that they all clearly indicated that although there is besome international uncertainty regarding the continuing value placed on the Australian dollar, the real barriers which are causing some reluctance for investment in Australia are related to confusion as to the application of our overseas its investment guidelines. But even more important than that is the ever present threat of industrial turmoil and the fear of another socialist govern the ment coming to power with its attitude towards killing profits as a matter of political dogma. The statulatter day Fabians, who sit opposite still on a commercial (Quorum formed) support the Budget. It is responsible and it is It is a vehicle upon which Australia's economic recovery will be based. I commend the Treasurer on his first of many",61
360,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,I support the amendment proposed by the Leader of Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). This Budget and its effect on the Australian people would only be rivalled by the horror Budget of the early ad1950s. It is a tragedy of conflicting poltiical ideologies. Ideological obsessions are very nice level being when taken in small doses.,63
361,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,"You would have a fair share, would you not?",64
362,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"I heard the honourable member, for what it was worth, in silence and, if he had any elementary courtesy, he would do the same for me. The Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Trudeau, recently said that we cannot make a modified free market economy solve our current problems. He added: . . . it will do no good to economy to solve our future problems . . . This did not come from a man of the Labor Party's political persuasion. This man is responsible for governing a major and comparable member of the Commonwealth. He continued: Until I heard the shrill comments made by some businessmen during the past few weeks, I had thought that the depression of the 1930s had destroyed that a free-market economy, if unassisted by Governments, would produce by itself the ideal state of steady economic growth, stable prices and full employment. That is precisely what this Government hopes to achieve by the unparalleled pursuit of its traditional ideology. This Government lags one whole depression-4 0 years, as a matter of fact-behin d economic reality. Its ideology simply will not work. The leaks coming from the party rooms of the Government suggest that there is unlimited fear on the part of the oncers as to what the result will be. It is very good to try to tough it through, but we are coining to the point where shrill voices are commencing to be heard. The most recent of these was the voice this week of Mr Taplin who, as Government supporters would know, is the President of the International Trade Division of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. He has been reported as follows: Some manufacturers, he said, were 'beginning to have grave doubts' whether the Federal Government fully understood business problems. I do not beheve that it does. Today right throughout the world, in terms of secondary industry, every major trading country is paying Up service to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and pushing up the tariff barriers as high as it can. Today it is a case of every nation for itself in preserving employment in a period of deteriorating world economy. Instances of feather bedding can be quoted. Other instances can be quoted of industries doing the best they can. But in the situation that exists at the present time there is no alternative to the maintenance of fuU employment. Persons who receive Australian rates of pay and persons under Australian working conditions have a corresponding obligation to purchase goods made in Australian secondary factories under those conditions of payment. May I also quote from yesterday's issue of the Melbourne Age in which the nnanciai editor Mr Graeme MCDougall in an article said in the heading 'Asinine jawboning is moving no one' and in fact it is 'counter-productive'. He said that Ministers are taking their own public utterances seriously. He made particular points. He said that through a massive jawboning effort the Government had: try to create a pure free-market Talked business into believing recovery had started early this year-whe n it had not; Talked the sharemarket into it's strongest rise for years; We all know about that. The third point was that the Government had: Talked many people into believing they had done much great for business when in fact they have done little. for ever the notion He went on to say: There is a strong chance that continuing urging from the top echelons of Government will begin to be counterproductive. Ministers are starting to take their own public utterances so seriously they cannot understand why businessmen do not see things the same way and start spending. After all, one of the Government's main hopesfrustrated as they have been-for economic recovery is that somehow the bulk of the Australian people will accept lower wages yet spend more-spen d themselves out of an economic depression and receive less money for their dauy stint of work.",64
363,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,"Do you suggest a $4,000m loan?",64
364,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"Yes . I will give you something on that. It was a $2,000m loan, I remind you. I will have something pertinent on that for your edification. If you want a real horselaugh get the full text of the address by Senator Cotton to the assembly ofretailersrecently in which he told them to get out and sell-boot s and all. The true position is that with a dwindling cake in terms of consumer expenditure they are doing their best and they are going flat out to maintain their sales and their present diminished rate of employment.",64
365,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,Are they mugs and hill-billies too?,64
366,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"No, but you are. To add to the woes of the Government, the economic panel which wasrecentlyappointed-the think tank of the whiz-kid, the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)-ha d one of its leaders, a Professor Whitehead, saying, at a public assembly of course, that the retailers are in for 'a long hard haul'. He said there is *unUkely to be evidence of any real recovery for 3 years'. So much for the handpicked think tank. The truth is that today the figures of current savings indicate that they are continuing to increase and there is only one cogent explanauon for it, and it is this: The people are literally squirrelling; they are saving for a rainy day. They are all afraid that it will be their turn next to join the ranks of the unemployed. Reference has been made to loan borrowings overseas. The figures are interesting. Since this Government took office it either has arranged or is about to secure total borrowings of $A850m. The figures are there to be seen in the nnanciai columns of last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. More than that, immediately after the advent of this Government and with the smart money believing that as a reflex action the Country Party would force immediate devaluation, another $A575m went out by way of exchange transfers. The smart money men took it out there and then. The total was just on $ A 1,400m, not so very short of the $2,000m authority that I had. They were US. dollars and at the time were worth $ A 1,500m. Our very smart Treasurer has his men tip-toeing around Europe picking up what he can, the unconsidered trifles, wherever he can get them, in places where he bad mouthed a former Government. Let us look at the other remarkable financial feat of this whiz-kid Treasurer. Australian savings bonds are at a record rate, a horribly unsensible, foohsh rate of 10.5 per cent. They were pitched on terms which were such that all the smart money men got in. I do not blame them for doing so because lightning strikes only once in the same spot on matters like this. The financial world was horrified. Let us look again at the question-of devaluation. I for one am strongly opposed to any devaluation occurring and that is the policy of our Party. Let that be understood quite clearly by the people of Australia. There is no need whatever for devaluation to occur if this Government is prepared to handle its business in a proper way. There are certain excellent sources of export revenue that can be obtained and maintained. I repeat my comment oflast week: I said then that my predecessor in office had better pull hisfingerout and get straight down to business because if he did not the Japanese would put it all over him. In fact they are doing so already. We are in a strong position in our trading relations with Japan if we choose to use it correctly. For example, for from time to time there is the old stalking horse of the threat of Brazilian iron ore to the Australian Exporters. It is true that Japan needs only an extra 20m tons and it is true that collectively the Western Australian producers are offering 80 million tons. On the other hand, that Brazilian ore happens to be a soft friable ore which has to be brought a longer distance and when it is being sized for a blast furnace charge it produces extra iron ore dust which in turn has to be solidified by calcination. This should dismiss that argument and I give the Minister that advice for what it is worth because in a matter of a few weeks a Japanese delegation will be coming here. What of the counter offers that will occur in the case of coal, say from Russia or from the east coast of the United States of America. On the east coast of the USA they cannot produce the coal they need and only spot sales are being made because of the conservationist lobby. It is not obtainable there. Similarly, coal from Russia has a very high sulphur content. The Japanese well know that the best coal that they can get at a sensible price and on proper terms as to continuity is from Australia. I mention these facts because coal today is the leading Australian export earner. Iron ore is next to it. In both cases, in Australia's interests I want to see proper prices obtained and proper trading conditions. I want to see an end to the chaos that is emerging and to which even the spokesman for  said that there was a need for the Federal Government to come back into the picture once again. It is time this nonsense about who was unkind to the Japanese or that the terms upon which they purchased the minerals were unfair was dropped. We entered into proper trading negotiations with them. We had the respect of these people. They respected ourfirmness,our competence and our reliability. If the Government does not continue its relations with the Japanese on that basis, they will run right over the top of us, and I would not blame them for doing it. I turn to other matters. Today we have a world wide situation in which the devastation of World War II has ended. The reconstruction of the damaged countries has ended and we are again in a classic period of economic crisis. We are in a period also in which the productive capacity of the world as a whole far exceeds the ability of the world to consume. In a situation such as that, we need to think much more in terms of what we do within our own country. It is no good the Government trying to gloss over the situation. It is there. It is one that a Labor government would have inherited also. There is only one answer to the situation and it is this: There should be an infusion of public moneys; there must be an infusion of public moneys. Honourable members opposite well know this. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) in particular will know this. One matter upon which I agree with him is that the constriction of capital expenditure is being associated with cash on the barrel head concepts of budget managementMr MCLean-But where would you spend it?",64
367,Mr CONNOR,PAIRS,"It needs to be spent on infrastructure. If Austraha is to achieve its destiny, it can be done only by the upgrading and beneficiation of its mineral resources on the one hand and by selective and improved agricultural production on the other hand. Today in the world there is a drop in the availability of food supplies. In the early 1950s, there was a food supply of 95 days per person for the world's population. Today, that supply is down to about 25 days. We have developing now as a counter poise to petro-power the concept in the United States of America of agri-power. The US. happens to be the world's largest producer and exporter of food. There will be conflict between the US. and Russia in this regard. One will play its cards and the other will play its cards also. Countries such as Australia must consider precisely what their attitudes will be. I quote the words of Marshall Green, the former Umted States Ambassador to Australia, as I have so often quoted them in the House previously. He said that Australia on a per capita basis and in terms of our resources is therichestcountry in the world. Australia is one of only 4 countries which can claim that it is self-contained and self-sufficient in energy resources. The 4 countries are Canada, the Soviet Union, Mainland China and Australia. I suggest to honourable members on the Government side that they consider economic, social and poltiical realities rather than the continual caterwauling we are hearing as to the sins of omission and commission of the former Labor Administration.",66
368,Mr SIMON,PAIRS,"Among the number of revelations which arose from the remarks of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor), not the least was the disclosure that the policy of the Opposition is that the Australian dollar should not be devalued. I wonder which policy the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) has referred to recently in his announcements. However I will not dwell on that matter. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), in his Budget Speech to the House on 17 August, outlined one of the most progressive reforms relevant to the relationship of the Commonwealth Government to State and local government. It was certainly of great significance to the future of local government in Australia. The Government made it clear in its election policy prior to 13 December 1975 that both State and local government would have permanent access to Commonwealth revenue raised through personal income tax. The Government also stated as part of its policy that a fixed percentage of personal income tax would be distributed through the respective State governments to every local government authority in Australia. The Treasurer, in his Budget Speech, confirmed his statement on 20 May that local government authorities would have an annual entitlement to a share of personal income tax. The amount allocated in 1976-77 is $140m. It represents an increase of 75 per cent over funds allocated by the Labor Government in the preceding year. It is a very significant increase and one appreciated by local government authorities at a time when their traditional source of revenue raising would have climbed to staggering heights in an effort to provide basic municipal services and to cope with the high inflation rate. There is a need to emphasise that it was a Federal Liberal-National Country Party government which introduced this policy. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was asked on 31 March 1976 by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) to inquire into and report on the proportionate distribution as between States of the total moneys to be granted to local government on a per capita and equalisation basis. Pursuant to those terms of reference, the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommended, and the Government adopted, the subdivision by which the per capita formula element for all States was 30 per cent, and the remaining 70 per cent comprised the equalisation element for all States. It was to be left to the State grants commissions to determine the formula for distribution between the local government authorities in each State. \ In addition to the untied grants totalling $140m, the Budget makes provision for payments to or for other local government authorities in relation to a wide ranging number of projects and services. It is my intention to refer briefly to these payments and to pose the question whether local government is capable and wUling to play a larger role in government which historically it has not undertaken but which it will be encouraged to undertake in future. Other honourable members have referred in this Budget debate to the limited role which local government has in the past undertaken in Australia in the areas of roads, drains, bridges, limited health services and in assisting the property and commercial interests in our communities. Budget Paper No. 7 refers to payments to local governments authoriues. The various categories of specific purpose payments demonstrate the increased role which local government authorities have undertaken in the provision of pubhc services. For example, for pre-school and child care services in 1973-74, the recurrent expenditure totalled only $4,000. It rose to $773,000 in 1975-76. The capital grant increased in the same period from $441,000 to $5,595,000. Another example is home nursing. Under the Home Nursing Subsidy Act 1956 grants were increased from $73,000 in 1972-73 to the $199,000 estimated for 1976-77. Grants directed to local government authorities for expenditure under the Aged or Disabled Persons Act 1954 have increased from $746,000 in 1972-73 to the estimate for the current year of $3,443,000. There are further specific grants to local government in relation to the Meals on Wheels service, handicapped persons, Aboriginal adgovernment vancement and community arts activities. Another category referred to in Budget Paper English No. 7 further illustrates the continued role which Commonwealth and State governments consider that local government authorities are handling with efficiency and which they would expect municipalities to continue to administer. I instance these very briefly: Senior citizen centres, payments to the New South Wales and Victorian governments respectively for on-passing to the local government authorities concerned with Albury-Wodonga growth centre program, area improvement program, the national sewerage program and capital assistance for leisure Government pohcies. The federalism policy of the Governhome rule. ment states that the vital principle relevant that policy is as follows: If effecuve goverament geared to the needs of the 1980s and beyond is to be achieved . . . if the great issues national and local concern such as education, health, welfare, housing and urban development are to receive maximum intelligent attendon . . . if all our resources including human talents and tively harnessed . . . if innovation, diversity imaginative reforms are to be encouraged . . . then must restructure our forms and institutions of government and our attitudes of mind to achieve co-operation, ship and not domination. For true nauonal concern to be achieved and maximised must be done through a partnership effort by forms government. By granting local government a share in federal income tax receipts we see a clear demonstration by this Government of its deterrnination to implement the federalism pohcy and by so doing, dramatically change the traditional revenue source of local government. But is local government able to take on this added responsibility? The amount of $ 140m of national revenue is not being granted to local government simply as a supplement to its rate revenue. It is implicit in the application of the federalism policy that local government must play an added role to better serve the communities in the areas of health, social welfare, housing and urban and community development. In England reorganisation of local government commenced some 12 years ago. Major studies were undertaken in quick succession by Sir John Maude and his select committee which reported to the Government on management of local government. The Government in England also appointed a royal commission to examine the structure of local government on a broad basis, including the reallocation of municipal boundaries. Finally, a report which proved to be acceptable to both central government and local authorites gave guidelines on structure and management for the rejuvenation of local government as was set out in the Bains report. Many of the conclusions in these reports are relevant in giving consideration to the future role which local government will play in Australia and to whether the federalism policy of this Government will work. The Maude Committee brought down its report in 1967 before the royal commission's recommendations had been presented to the centhe tral government. Included in the Maude report the was a conclusion that: if as a nation we want Local democracy, the National must give Local Authorities a larger measure of to In 1969 part of the report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England made reference to the pattern and character of local of government which must be such as to enable it to social do 4 things: Firstly, to perform efficiently a wide range of profoundly important tasks concerned with the safety, health and well being, both local knowledge are to be effecand material and cultural, of people in different we localities; secondly, to attract and hold the interest of its citizens; thirdly, to develop enough partnerinherent strength to deal with national authorities and develop partnership; and, fourthly, to it adapt itself without disruption to present unpreof cedented process of changes in the way people live, work, move, shop and enjoy themselves. Whilst recognising that the English system does not have the third member of the pannership which we have in Australia, local government in Australia must be capable of showing that it can meet the challenges with which it is faced. Local government is the third partner in the total system of government in Australia. It has responsibilities concerned with local communities. It acts as a delivery agent for State and Federal Government schemes and services. Whilst it is true that this Budget has given recognition to the posiuon of local government as one of the 3 tiers of government in this country, money alone will not solve problems or necessarily improve the quality of service of local government authorities. An improved standard of administration, the expertise of council officers and elected representatives and the establishment of an independent local government public service will take many years to achieve. More importantly, both the State Government and the local government authorities should recognise the increased responsibilities that each should undertake in the federal structure. There are many authorities today with the experience, the personnel and the attitude to cope with increased responsibihty for a wider range of public services in government at the local level. I submit, however, that there would be an equal number overwhelmed by the complexity of urban growth, the depression of rural areas and the socio-economic changes evident in our society. The impact of urban development is first felt by local government. Movements in population within the major cities and from them to rural and semi-rural areas bring pressure on the social infrastructure of our communities. Money from the Federal Government would be wasted if the local authority recipients do no more than prop up a rate structure without doing anything to improve the quality of local government administration or the quality of living standards of members of local communities. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA ASSESSMENT BILL (No. 2) 1976 Debate resumed from 8 September, on motion by Mr Eric Robinson: That the Bill be now read a second time.",66
369,Mr MCLEAY,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Health Insurance Levy Bill (No. 2) as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",68
370,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY, Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? I wiil allow that course to be followed.,68
371,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue'. I also foreshadow that at the Committee stage the Opposition will be moving an amendment to clause 4 paragraph (a) by inserting some words. I will give the details of that later. By not denying the Bill a second reading yet seeking to have the House express its opinion that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue we are seeking to indicate our persisting opposition to the concept of a levy. In case people should think that at this stage we should oppose the Bills outright, let me say that the sad reality is that by doing that we would leave on the statute books the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Act (No. 1) and the Health Insurance Levy Act (No. 1) which were passed earlier this year, and which we also opposed. Since we did not have the numbers we could not prevent their being passed. Obviously, they are less adequate than the 2 Bills before the House now, which is precisely the reason why the Government has introduced these 2 Bills-to modify the earher Acts because they are not appropriate to Medibank model 4 or 5, or whichever model we are up to now. Medibank changes have been brought in progressively in fits and spurts by the Government since it started meddling with the original Labor Government Second Reading Medibank. That long explanation is to show why we are not opposing the Bills outright. These Bills when passed will at least be better than the present legislation. We seek to show that we still disagree with the concept. Now I have to cover another seeming inconsistency. When the Australian Labor Party Government first proposed Medibank-no t in the form of Medibank but in the form of a national health insurance fund-it proposed the imposition of a levy. We talked about it often enough. I like to think that in the years from 1968 to 1972 no one in the community talked about the Liberal Government's policy. They spent their time discussing the Labor Party's policy. We were in Opposition then and in those years in the communityrightacross the country people discussed our proposals for a nauonal health insurance tem. In that original system we proposed the imposition of a levy. I would like to discuss what it was meant to do and why we proposed it. To do so I need to analyse for a short time how the private or so-called voluntary health insurance system worked before the Labor Party's election in 1972. If anyone wants to talk about the thin end of the socialist wedge let me remind him that the voluntary health insurance system was introduced by Sir Earle Page on behalf of the Liberal-Country Party Government back in the 1950s. Up until then people were more or less sponsible for paying their own bills. It is common knowledge that this resulted in a lot of social inequity and hardship, particularly for those on lower incomes or those who were hard hit by illness. So in those early days, in the 1950s, the eral Government proposed a system of insurance based on a concept which had been around for many years before them. It was based on the benefit fund or lodge system. As I say, that had been around for many years. I can remember my father, when he was in practice as a doctor in the country areas in Western Australia, talking about his list of lodge patients, his panel of patients. It was a well known system of taxing people-voluntarily , in the sense that people decided to belong to a benefit fund of some sort, or a friendly society or a lodge. They paid a contribution. Part of the contribution made to the friendly society was paid by the friendly society to a doctor who undertook to treat a certain number of patients, the patients on the lodge The doctor was not paid a fee for service. The doctor was paid a capitation fee. So much for the dishonest obstruction and opposition by a considerable section of the medical profession and the Liberal-Country Party Government in their ignorance of the Labor Party's concept. The opponents of the concept objected to a third party intruding between the doctor and the patient. They objected to government-the y did not say 'government', they said a third partybreaking this sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship which they said depended on the patient paying the doctor a fee. They were quite dishonest. That relationship had been broken in many places in the last century. This concept of a third party-a benefit fund, a lodge, a friendly society-intrudin g between the doctor and the patient is old hat. It was not introduced by the Labor Government. So Sir Earle Page sanctified it in his voluntary health insurance scheme. He invited or encouraged voluntary health funds to set up-in other words, he sys- enlarged the number of organisations which were already doing this sort of thing-by setting a restraint on the freedom with which members of the community could get their tax contributions back in the form of medical or hospital rebates, because an integral part of the system was that the patient had to contribute to a voluntary fund. When they were sick, went to a doctor, got a bill and paid the bill or assigned it, their account either way went to the health fund or the friendly society that was registered as a medical or hospital benefit fund. That fund then made a re- refund to the patient for the amount of money that he had paid to the doctor. The refund consisted of 2 parts. One part from the benefit fund was based upon the contributions that the person had made to the fund. The other part, usually roughly the same amount, Lib- came from the Government as a Commonwealth hospital or Commonwealth medical benefit. That had been paid for by everybody in his taxation payments. But the rub was that the person who voluntarily chose not to belong to a benefit fund could not claim his legitimate Commonwealth hospital or Commonwealth medical benefit refund. In other words, he robbed himself unless he paid an extra contribution to a voluntary fund. I hope that is clear. It is the truth. It is the way the system worked. We have been fooled for years into not understanding the position and therefore thinking that the cost of health services under the Liberals was the cost which the taxpayer paid via Commonwealth hospital or medical benefits or Commonwealth list. Government contributions to hospitals via the States. The Labor Party's point was that because of that restriction I have mentioned, the total payment in contributions represented a tax. In other words, the real cost ofhealth services, even under the Liberals, was far more than was ever measured in the budget figures. At least, it was twice as much in terms of the hospital or medical beneiits contributions and payments. That is the first dishonesty in the whole argument and it is continually perpetrated by people on the Government side. It happened even today after my comments in the Budget debate. The next speaker from the Government side got up and talked about the terrible cost of Medibank. How dishonest can one be? For how long will honourable members on the Government side deceive themselves? That is what they are doing. The cost of health care is the sum total of the money the sick person finally has to pay for his treatment. It does not matter a damn whether he pays it via a benefit fund, via the taxation system or directly out of his own pocket. The whole amount still comes from his pocket. The cost to the community is not Medibank or the voluntary benefit funds. The cost to the community is the money that finally finishes in the pockets of the hospitals and the doctors and in whatever administrative costs have been incurred in transferring the money. That is where the benefit funds or Medibank come in. They receive just the administrative cost. If we are honest, and I beg honourable members on the Government side to at least be honest with themselves in that sense",68
372,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,What sense?,70
373,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I ask the honourable member not to pretend that he is not following me.,70
374,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Giv e us the figures.,70
375,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The precise figures are irrelevant. They could be $ 1,000m, $2,000m, or$5,000m. It does not matter. The total cost is that sum which covers the hospital costs and doctors' fees. That is the cost of health services to the community. In terms of the proportion of gross national product it is a lie to say that if the taxadon revenue diture is 3 per cent of gross nauonal product, that is the cost, because that is not the only cost. The cost of health services, includes all the other costs. When one argues that the French or the British are spending more than we are because, via their taxation system, they spend 4.5 per cent or whatever the figure is, and via our taxation system we are spending only 2.5 per cent, one is being dishonest. The British system includes all the things that our taxation system does not include. If we included all the things for which the tish system pays we would have to pick up all the private payments in the Australian context. If one adds those and if one is honest, onefindsthe equivalent to the British figure for the year. When I last looked at it it was about 4.5 per cent. At that time the equivalent figure in Australia was over 6 per cent. If one looks at comparable figures throughout the world and adds all the bits so that one gets the total cost of health services the reality is that Australia with its private enterprise system has spent, as a percentage of gross national product, rather more than most. We are up near the Americanfigureand it is one of the worse. I am not saying that allfiguresare the same. They do vary. Sweden which has a that fairly socialised system as far as I am concerned is fairly expensive, but it has an exceptionally high standard of medical care available. I come back to my argument about these Bills. Given that whichever way we do this is represents a tax and given that the whole community ultimately has to bear the whole cost, I ask: What is, socially, the most equitable way to do this? This is where the argument about Medibank and the private funds comes in. If honourable members accept my argumentnever mind the political points one must makeand I ask those who are listening to the discussion to think about it inwardly, I point out that, because the doctor has treated the patient and the hospital has given him the service because he has gone into hospital, then the money has to pass out of the patient's pocket to the doctor and the hospital somehow or other. In our view it is socially more equitable to do this by means of the taxation system. It is not actually true to say that flat rate contributions to voluntary benefit funds mean that the poor pay the same as the rich. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to the situation that existed under the voluntary health insurance system before the introduction of the present form of Medibank and to think of what it expen- meant. The charge for a particular level of refund was the same for everybody, irrespective of his income, but the contributions that one made were tax deductible. So somebody on a low mcome who was paying, say, $100 got back the equivalent of $25 in the concession if he was lucky because he was able to claim his payment as a tax deduction. But someone on a high income who was making the same claim for the same sum of money-$100-go t back the equivalent of $50 or more. In other words, the rich paid less than the poor. Is that social justice? For a long time our sorts of societies, that is, BriWestern democratic societies, have accepted the principle that those services that are seen as a necessity-service s that in short we recognise as social services, such as unemployment and sickness benefits, social welfare payments of all sorts and so on-ar e not paid for by imposing a flat rate tax on everybody in the same way as the contributions to the voluntary funds. Everyone all over the Western world-in fact practically everywhere-recognise s that one pays on a sliding scale according to ones income so that the its richer one is the more proportionately one pays. If one accepts that argument and if one accepts the thesis that one does not deserve to be sick, one does not choose to get ill, that one does not want to require the services of a doctor or hospital and that illness is something which is unexpected, which is thrust upon us and which one does not embrace in free choice, then I think one can take a step further than that and say therefore that the services required for one's treatment when one is sick ought to be provided as a social service. They ought to be available to everyone not as a privilege that they can purchase if they are able to pay; they should receive hospital and medical services in accordance with their medical needs as a right. If one accepts that then, in my view, one has to accept the thesis that that sort of service or that sort of welfare function, if you like, should be provided out of taxadon revenue and based on a sliding scale, as we accept for all other forms of social service. The Australian Labor Party proposed the imposition of a levy but, fortunately for it, due to the ignorance of the Liberal and Country parties whilst they were in Opposition-the y did not understand the point and so opposed the Labor Party's legislation to bring in the levy-it then chose to fund Medibank entirely out of taxation revenue. That was socially far more equitable far as our basic philosophy is concerned. That the way it ought to have been. We thank the eral and Country parties for being so kind to philosophically and helping us to achieve our philosophical objectives. To prove my point, no sooner did the Liberal and National Country Parties come to power than they in their eyes that was not fair. Of course, in their view anything that is socially equitable is unfair to the rich.",70
376,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Oh , come on!",71
377,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"So the Liberal and Country Parties have immediately sought to revert from that syshospital tem, which does represent social equity-it does, despite the honourable member for La Trobe's interjection, and he recognises it for every other sphere of social welfare that he can think of-t the private enterprise system, which in essence going to weigh far more heavily on the poor compared with the rich.",71
378,Unknown,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,71
379,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was discussing the true import of the levy which is proposed in these Bills. I pointed out that it tax by another name. It is an unfair tax because, as a IVi per cent levey applied uniformly and, in fact, tapering off for the higher income people, is not equitable. It bears more heavily upon the lower income sections of the community. For this reason the Opposition opposes the levy concept. We feel that health expenses are a social service that everyone should be entided to when he needs it and ought to be provided for according to medical need and paid for out of taxation revenue, which is the fairest way of raising the funds. The Government is indulging in sleight of hand, a trick, in talking about lowering the tax burden and reducing the deficit but imposing a levy. It is utter fraud. It is collecting an extra sum of money, however much it is, from the levy or from forcing people to belong to the various benefit funds. In the socially inequitable way I have suggested, the levy will derive these extra funds. At the same time the Government can pretend, because it is no longer going to find the money out of taxation revenue, that it has lowered the deficit. It has lowered the figure going through its books.",71
380,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Not even that.,71
381,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Not even that, but it is pretending that it is going to lower the figure. However, in real terms the cost to the community will go up. As I mentioned earlier, the costs include the fees as paid to doctors, the money paid to hospitals and is the adnunistrative costs. The facts are that LibMedibank's administrative costs were about 4 us per cent. The administrative costs of the private benefit funds are about IS per cent. So in no way can it be suggested that it will be cheaper for the community to fund the whole business via prirecognised that vate benefit funds. We keep hearing the cry from those on the Government benches that Medibank is ruinous, that it will drive the country to bankruptcy, because of the increasing costs. As I have pointed out, the costs relate to medical services and services. Medibank is irrelevant. So let me analyse what it is that is driving up the cost of these services. Honourable members on the Government side say that because things seem to o be free the patient abuses the system. Yes, that is is right. When all the ordinary citizens of the community know they can go to the doctor for nothing they flock there two or three times a week and they urge the doctor to operate on them three or fourtimesa year. What sort of nonsense is that claim that patients are causing overutilisation? The most a patient can do is go to see is a the doctor. In my view, if a patient feels worried about his health or is concerned about something he is legitimately entitled to see a doctor. It is not it the patient's job to make an assessment of whether he is dying or not from whatever disease it is he thinks he has. He is entitled to visit the doctor and be reassured that he is just neurotic, if you like. That level of over-usage can account for very little of the cost because it is simply a general practitioner consultation. It is what happens after that that increases the costs. Patients cannot write their own prescriptions. We are told that we consume too many drugs; we have too many prescriptions. But whose fault is that? Patients cannot write the prescriptions. Doctors write the prescriptions. Mr Sullivan-The patients demand them.",71
382,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"All the pauents do is consume the stuff. Half the time they do not even do that. They put it on the shelves in their bathroom cupboards and it falls out and breaks when they open the door some day to put another bottle of pills in. But that is the doctor's fault. The doctors have done all this prescribing which in my view is unnecessary. And so it could go on. When we come to analyse the utilisation of more expensive services such as hospitals and surgeons, operadon rates and so on it is interesting to look at some figures that are coming from America these days. We do not know the figures in Austxalia. We have a hint of some and I have cited them before. Studies by Dr Jim Lawson show that operation rates in Australia on a feefor-service basis are much higher than in America where some doctors are paid on a salary basis. I should like to quote some more information from America although some people say we are different from the Americans and we cannot really be compared with the Americans. I do not believe that. But let us see what happens in America. What are the differences within America? I know that America is no more uniform in a sense than Australia is. They are just people anyway. I quote from a report that appeared in Medical World News of 3 May 1976 which is a fairly recent publication. It is a collection offindingsfrom various studies. It states: Dr Doyle, who published his findings in that 39 per cent of the 6248 procedures should not have been done. If they had not been done there would have been eral a fairly significant saving I would have thought. Blue The article continued: . . . the track record for hysterectomies was dismal. Of the 148 procedures reviewed. 64 deemed unjustified . . . Perhaps the most famous comparison of surgical rates was Dr Bunker's 1970 bombgraphically shell study. Not only did he find the rate of surgery in United States twice that prevailing in England and Wales but he also showed that Americans were three times as likelyclinic's as their British counterparts to have more than four times as likely to have a haemorrhoidectomy. His diplomatic conclusion: 'It seems likely that some necessary surgery is being performed in the United States' . . . In 19S2 the late Dr Paul A. Lembcke . . . documented the incidence of appendectry. tomies in 23 'hospital service areas' . . . He found a range of from 69 appendectomies per 10 000 persons area to 25 per 10 000 persons in another. I know the argument: 'Oh, that just shows that the doctors who are not doing the operations are not treating their patients properly. The patients are all dying from burst appendices.' The article continued: Especially intriguing: He discovered no higher rate of death from appendicitis in the areas with low rates of appendectomy than in areas with high rates of the operadon. He concluded that a 'reasonable inference' would be that accessibility to doctors and hospitals-no t a diseased appendix-wa s a 'deciding factor' in determining appendectomy rates . . . in 1969 . . . From an analysis of Blue Cross records for 196S, Dr Lewis tabulated the number of six kinds of common operations . . . He found: The range for tonsillectomies, for example, was from 153 per 10 000 persons to 433 per 10 000. Appendectomies ranged from 16 per 10 000 to 62 per 10 000 . . . Seeking an explanation . . . Dr Lewis . . . discovered that those regions with the highest incidence of operations had also the highest proportion of physicians (both GPs and surgeons) who did surgery and the highest proportion of hospital beds. Dr Lewis speculated that he might have stumbled on to a medical variation of Parkinson's Law: Patient admissions for surgery expand to fill beds, operating suites and surgeons' time'. Then we come to another study which I think is relevant to our experience in Australia. I think they all are, but even more so the study of what it is that really prompts excessive surgery. In my view and in the Labor Party's view the cause is the fee-for-service approach. The article had this to say on this matter: There's another type of incidence-variation study: Comparing the surgical rates in pre-paid plans with the rates among comparable fee-for-service groups. That means patients operated on by salaried doctors compared with fee-for-service doctors. The article continued: Most such investigations show that HMOThat means 'health maintenance organisation', 19S3, concluded whose doctors are on salariesenrollees are operated on a lot less frequently than fee-forservice patients. In 1966, for example, it was found that fedemployees who opted for prepaid coverage had a surgical rate only 56 per cent of that among employees who chose Cross coverage. Blue Cross is fee-for-service and the HMOs are or 43 per cent, were salaried doctors. . . . the rates of surgical admissions among a geoisolated low-income group in Boston were the measured before and after installauon of a comprehensive health clinic in their community. Within 2 years of the opening, surgical admissions plummeted by some a cholecystectomy and 300 percent. unI should point out that the doctors at the clinic were salaried doctors. The truth is not that Medibank is causing the ruination of this counThe truth is not the medical costs are going in one up because of Medibank. The truth is that in this country we are suffering from excess medical care, unnecessary surgical intervention, unnecessary medication, because of the fee-for-service system. For those reasons, the Opposition opposes the concept of the levy. We think it should all be done through taxation revenue. We think Medibank should encompass the whole community. Then, with an analysis of statistics such as those I have quoted, we could pick up where wrong treatment, which in my view could lead to unnecessary deaths, is taking place. The Opposition opposes the concept of the levy.",72
383,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Is the amendment seconded?,73
384,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Yes , Mr Acting Speaker. I reserve my right to speak to the amendment at a later stage.",73
385,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The original question was that the Bill be now read a second time. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has moved an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,73
386,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Tonight the House is debating the motion moved by the Government to amend the National Health scheme through the Health Insurance Levy Bill. In this Bill the Government proposes certain amendments to provide for a levy and to clarify certain aspects of the way in which the levy will be applied. The Opposition has moved an amendment to the Bill, thereby seeking to eliminate any levy at all. I think Government members and people listening tonight to the debate could be excused for saying: 'What on earth will the Australian Labor Party do next in respect of national health care?' The whole saga of events that have taken place since the proposal was originally put forward have served to confuse, to abuse, to violate the interests of Australian people in respect ofhealth care. I believe that Bill introduced by the Government is quite logical and quite clear. But tonight the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), has come into the House and, speaking for the Opposition, suddenly moved an amendment to the Bill which in one swoop seeks to totally eliminate a Medibank levy. I think I could be excused for a moment for looking back and reviewing the history of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament to the levy, whether it be for a national health insurance fund or, more recently, for Medibank. If I could retrace some of the steps, I should point out that when the Labor Government suggested a levy to fund its proposed health insurance scheme it talked of 1.25 per cent of taxable income. Subsequently I believe they made an announcement that the levy would be 1.35 per cent of taxable income. In his 1972 election policy speech at Blacktown in New South Wales the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr E. G. Whitlam, failed to mention the word 'levy' when he was putting to the Australian electorate his view of the form national health insurance should take. Not once did he mention the word 'levy'. He went into that election and many Australians voted for his party. They voted for it in the electorate of La Trobe because they thought they were going to get something free. But in subsequent years when the Labor Party was in Government it changed its tack. It brought in a proposition to introduce a levy on taxable income. Since then the Labor Party has taken a left turn, a right turn, and tonight it has taken an about turn. The Opposition has sent the honourable member for Maribyrnong into this House-at least I think the Opposition has sent him but I am not entirely sure that as a party and an Opposition it has agreed on it-and he has moved an amendment to abolish the Medibank levy. This is even more curious. Mr Birney-To abolish it?",73
387,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,To abolish it. That is the amendment before the House.,73
388,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Did he ask Bob Hawke?,73
389,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I do not believe he asked the President of the Australian Labor Party because just a few months ago this Government, when it came to office, set up the Medibank Review Committee. That committee was given certain specific tasks to inquire into health problems generally in this country. Many submissions were made to that Review Committee and it conducted a very exhaustive study. We are grateful to the members of the committee for doing that the work. Many submissions were made to the committee. A submission was even made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We were reliably told by none other than the President of the ACTU-wh o is also the President of the Australian Labor Party-in his capacity of wearing both hats as Stiffy and Mo that the proposition that the ACTU put to the Medibank Review Committee represented the view of the Opposition. One could reflect on why the President of the Australian Labor Party put it rather than the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. Well, of course, the Leader was out of the country and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) was out of the country, as were most of the other representatives of that party in this Parliament. The Opposition left it to the President of the ALP to put the case to the Medibank Review Committee and it was for a levy of 1.6 per cent. That was a few months ago when we set up a review committee specifically to look into the whole situation of Medibank; to review where it was gomg, to establish whether it was providing a good service and, more particularly, to identify where it was failing to provide an adequate medical service. Subsequently the Leader of the Opposition stood up on 5 August in the Collingwood Town Hall in Melbourne and criticised the Government's proposal for a 2.5 per cent levy for Medibank. He said that all that was required was a 1.8 per cent levy.",73
390,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Is that the meeting attended by 10 people?,74
391,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"No , there were 12 people present.",74
392,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Twelve ?,74
393,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Yes , there were 6 members from the parliamentary Austrahan Labor Party and 6 others. For a meeting attended by only 12 people it got a lot of publicity. What it said was that the only requirement was a 1.8 per cent levy in order to fund Medibank. Mr Hodges-Was that across the board?",74
394,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"That was across the board, and what is more, it did not include a ceiling. That means that, irrespective of income-it does not matter whether a person is on the minimum wage or on the salary of a member of ParUamentMr Hodges-Includin g the $4,000-a-year income earners?",74
395,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Whatever it included it was to be 1.8 per cent right across the board with no ceiUng, because the Australian Labor Party took the view that Medibank, as a government service, provided yet another opportumty to redistribute income. That was the point. The Labor Party wanted to use not only the income tax formulas, the traditional way of redistributing income, but also a government service, Medibank, as another mechanism by which to redistribute income. If one takes that view to its logical extension one recognises",74
396,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Do you really believe all this?,74
397,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"As the honourable member for Maribyrnong recognised, when I pointed it out to him, that the Australian Labor Party is in fact proposing that any government service which is provided should be used as an additional mechanism by which to redistribute mcome. Let us take the example of buying a rail ticket in the morning to take a trip, say, into the city. Those who earn $20,000 a year taxable income should under Labor's proposal pay more than those who earn $10,000 a year taxable mcome. That is a logical extension of the argument, is it not? That is the view of the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition in this Parliament. It would seek to use every government service that is provided-it will think up a few more if it can-as a means by which to redistribute income. It is quite incredible. That is the view that Opposition members put. That is the thin edge of the wedge which the Leader of the Australian Labor Party put. Notwithstanding the interjections of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is still Leader of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament. He specified just a month and a few days ago that his Party's policy was to impose a 1.8 per cent levy. But the honourable member for Maribyrnong has moved in the Parliament tonight an amendment to the effect that there should be no levy to fund Medibank. Mr Klugman-As the position is at present.",74
398,The ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! The honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for Grayndler, according to my Ust of speakers, are due to take part in the debate next. I suggest that they keep their remarks until suchtimeas they do speak.",74
399,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"That is right; they are listed to speak next. What is intriguing this Parliament tonight is how on earth they are going to explain to the House and to those people listening to the broadcast of the proceedings tonight that a little over a month ago their Leader, the top man in their Party in this Parliament",74
400,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Which one?,74
401,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The present one.,74
402,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,In the Parliament or outside the Parliament?,74
403,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"No , the present one. When speaking on behalf of his Pany he committed his Party to a policy position; he specified that there would be a levy of 1.8 per cent. Tonight the honourable member for Maribyrnong has suggested in this House that the new position of the Australian Labor Pany is that there should be no Medibank levy. Mr Birney-What is the position?",74
404,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I just wonder what on earth they are going to suggest next. Of course, what the Opposition has in fact done in moving its amendment is to reinforce yet again the impression that it has no single understanding of what is all about. The Opposition in this Parliament still thinks that there is no limit on what a government can spend. We saw that in the last 3 years in which the Labor Party was in government it spent $6000m more than it raised. This required it to go seeking loans in the bazaars of the Middle East to try to balance its accounts. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) who is singing like a canary tonight, he was there in amongst it too. The Labor Party was dodging the Loan Council, dodging every convention that ever existed in order to try to scrape up some money, but at that dme it still spent $6000m more than it was able to raise. And it still raised income tax by 300 per cent. Tonight the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) comes into this Parliament and says: 'There is no need for a levy. We should pay for Medibank out of tax.' What is he saying? He is saying that notwithstanding the 300 per cent increase of taxation Labor brought about in 3 years he would put it up again. He will necessarily increase the income tax scales yet again. I put it to the House: Does anybody seriously think that Australians will be prepared to pay yet more income tax in order to fund Medibank? A constituent came into my office and told me that last year he got a $343 mcrease in pension but has another $106 to pay in tax. In fact, according to the Labor tax scale which the honourable member for Maribyrnong is effectively saying will need to be mcreased, 40 per cent of that pension rise goes in income tax. What an extraordinary proposition to put to the House. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who himself is a doctor and understands this proposition, is prepared to come in here on behalf of the Opposition and suggest there should be a further increase.",75
405,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,He knows not what he does.,75
406,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"It is extraordinary. I have to say, following the comment of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) that I do not believe Labor Party members know what they have done tonight. In the Bill the Government has proposed there are some very important measures. I will take the few minutes left explain to the House exactly what those measures are. They are quite logical, they are quite clear, they are based on fact and they are based on principle. That is the way the Fraser Government operates. First of all there will be a ceiling on what taxpayers will need to provide in order to meet their Medibank obUgation. No longer will there be the suggestion that the Medibank levy will be used as a means to redistribute income. Taxpayers, particularly the it higher taxpayers, are already funding the expenses of patients under Medibank by five to one. Altogether the levy will raise something like $87Sm. In fact, Federal expenditure on health will be considerably in excess of $3,000m. The levy raises something like 20 per cent of the expenditure. That is clear. I make another important point which I would like to stress because the Opposition has sought time and time again to confuse, to discredit and to mislead-particularl y to mislead pensioners, people who are vulnerable and people who were vulnerable under the Labor Government's 17 per cent inflation rate which wrecked the expectations and the welibeing of thousands and thousands of Australians. I can reassure 75 per cent of pensioners by saying that those who hold the pensioner medical service card will not pay the Medibank levy. How many times have I read and how many times have I heard representatives of the Australian Labor Party, including the President of the Australian Labor Party trying to put fear into pensioners by saying that they will all be vulnerable and that they will all have to pay a Medibank levy? This is particularly evident when I have pensioner constituents at La Trobe coming into my office and telling me that 40 per cent of their pension increase is going in income tax. What hypocrisy it is for the Opposition now to come before the Parliament and suggest that the Medibank levy be eliminated! What hypocrisy it is for them to put such a proposition to the Parliament at this stage in view of the fact that they were the architects of a Medibank levy, although they went to an election in 1972 with not one mention of the word 'levy'. I reject this amendment and I commend the Bill to the House.",75
407,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," I think it is an insult to this House and to the people of Australia that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) was chosen to speak and to try to explain the measure that this Government is introducing. He knows nothing about it. If that is the best explanation that the Government can put up for the introduction of a Medibank levy, it is extremely poor. The honourable member for to me to La Trobe is a gentleman whom many would refer to as a smart Uttle bugger.",75
408,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker.",75
409,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will resume his seat. I suggest that the honourable member for Prospect should withdraw that phrase.,75
410,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I would refer to him as a smart young man who all his Ufe has Uved on his father's American Express and Diners' Club cards. All his Ufe he has Uved off his father's income. He has never done a bit of work and does not understand anything about it. Mr Donald Cameron- I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. The honourable member did not withdraw that which you requested him to withdraw. He simply rephrased it without withdrawing his original words. He is being that smart little b... that he is talking about.",76
411,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I called him that, but I withdraw it if that is appropriate. I withdraw the reference to his being a smart Uttle bugger. Mr William MCMahon-On a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker, the honourable member has to withdraw his remark unconditionally and not in a sense of protest. If anyone ought to protest we should do so against the unbelievable and insulting language he has used in this House tonight.",76
412,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! I requested the honourable member for Prospect to withdraw the remark he made. I thought he had withdrawn it. Mr William MCMahon-He did not.,76
413,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I did and I shall do so again. I refer to him as a smart young man who all his life has Uved on his father's American Express and Diners' Club cards. He has never done anything else.,76
414,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. When a remark like that made by the honourable member for Prospect a moment ago or the remark preceding it comes from a man ofhis calibre, I am tempted to receive it as a compliment. However, what he says is offensive. I take exception to it. It is blatantly untrue. I ask, Mr Acting Speaker, that you give the courtesy of the Chair to all honourable members and, in this case, to myself by having the honourable member for Prospect withdraw his remark as a lie, as deceptive and miserable but quite typical of remarks made by him.",76
415,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! In the normal course of events a line is drawn in relation to remarks that are offensive to an individual. I suggest to the honourable member for Prospect that whilst the remarks that he made with regard to the honourable member for La Trobe were not unparliamentary in the sense that they required a ruling from the Chair, they are not conducive to assisting in any way the debate before this House. In the circumstances I suggest that the honourable member for Prospect should withdraw the remark and continue his remarks in relation to the legislation.",76
416,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I shall continue with my remarks on the legislation, Mr Acting Speaker.",76
417,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Withdraw! Mr William MCMahon-Withdraw!,76
418,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The Acting Speaker indicated that there was no need for withdrawal; therefore I would consider it hypocritical to withdraw the remark. The honourable member for La Trobe has no idea about the legislation that has been introduced. He refers to a Medibank levy.,76
419,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I seek your guidance. The honourable member for Prospect has ignored your ruling which suggested that he should withdraw his remark.",76
420,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I have said that in the circumstances the Chair has no power to order a withdrawal of the remarks. MrBirney-Why?,76
421,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,It was suggested that in the normal course of events when remarks such as those that have been made are objected to as being offensive the honourable member might be asked to withdraw them. In view of the statement by the honourable member for Prospect the Chair has no power to enforce a withdrawal. I have only suggested to the honourable member for Prospect that he withdraw. It is in the hands of the honourable member.,76
422,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The honourable member for La Trobe referred to a levy which will raise $800m. If the honourable member looks at the Budget Papers he will see that the levy will raise $250m.,76
423,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I raise a point of order. I draw attention to Standing Order 75 which says: No Member may use offensive words against either House of the Parliament or any Member thereof . . . I pomt out that it has been a practice in the House that when a member regards words used by another member to be offensive the member who has offended normally withdraws. I think the words uttered by the honourable member for Prospect were deliberately provocative and deliberately offensive and he should in the circumstances be asked to withdraw.,76
424,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I am convinced by the point of order and I withdraw. The honourable member for La Trobe referred, as I said a minute ago, to $800m being raised by the Medibank levy. I can see the Right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon) sitting in the chamber. He is terribly good on figures. The last time. I heard him interviewed on behalf of the Liberal Party was on station 2UE in Sydney. He referred to the fact that the reason the United States could do certain things we could not do was because after all it had a population of 130 million. Mr William MCMahon- I raise a point of income order. The suggestion is a lie. I have never on 2UE and made a statement in any way remolook tely associated with that subject. I think the gentleman needs psychiatric attention.",77
425,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! The Right another, honourable member for Lowe will resume his seat. In view of the situation in this House moment I suggest that honourable members might give consideration to the time allowed the debate. It is impossible for the Chair to know whether anybody appeared on a television or radio program. If it is a matter of misrepresenproposition. tation the Right honourable member for Lowe may make a personal explanation at the concerning clusion of the speech of the honourable for Prospect.",77
426,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The Budget Papers this year show that $208m will be collected under from individual income taxpayers who are referred to as the pay-as-you-earn people and $42m from those who are not paying pay-asmatically you-earn tax. Mr Gillard-Hav e a look at page 28.,77
427,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"That is a total of $250m. The schedule rest of the saving is from people who leave Free Medibank. I am sorry, but if the honourable member cannot follow it he should have look at the Budget Papets. The actual levy will raise that amount. Let us look at the proposition thing. the Labor Party is putting up. Our amendment is that the Labor Party is of the opinion that packet. Medibank should continue to be funded out of general revenue. Government supporters have forget made great play of an allegation that this Government has reduced taxation. What in fact has happened in the .current Budget? Pay-asGovernment you-earn taxpayers-that is, all those are employees, wage earners, salary earnershave to pay another $ 1,770m in tax this year, an increase of 24.7 per cent compared with an increase last year of $ 1,000m. Everybody screamed when the Hayden Budget was brought down because there was an increase of tax of $ 1,000m but this year the increase is $ 1,770m. That relates only to pay-as-you-eam taxation. It has been increased by 24.7 per cent. That includes $208m estimated to be collected for Medibank for 9 months of the current financial year. In addition to the $ 1770m which people will lose in extra taxation there will, of course, be the amount that people who leave Medibank and contract out of paying the levy will have to pay. They will have to pay for something they now get for nothing. The people paid $7,000m in tax last year. This year they will have to been pay $8,775m. I invite honourable members to at the Budget papers. These people will pay $ 1,775m more. Let us be quite clear about this. In addition to that, the people who decide to subscribe to private insurance of one kind or for either intermediate or private cover, have to pay significantly more-twic e as much as at the they used to pay. This amount will probably increase. I am not opposed to that concept. I for think that people who want to be covered for intermediate or private ward treatment ought to pay for it. I completely support that Government My only objection to the legislation before the House at present is the basic one conthe levy. I suggest that people follow the member advertisements for Medibank which this Government has put out. The advertisement which I have here appeared in the Age on 30 the levy August 1976. It is headed: Do nothing and Medibank still works for you. Here's how: After 1 October, if you choose to do nothing you'll autobe covered by Medibank. That's the most economical health insurance available in Australia today. HOW MUCH COVER. You are covered for at least 85 per cent of your doctor's fee, if you are treated at home or at his surgery. accommodauon and treatment in a public hospital. And an eye test benefit from optometrists. another Later on the advertisement states: Remember. To receive this cover you don't have to do a You 11 be covered automatically from 1 October, and the payments will be deducted each week from your pay If this is all you want you get it automatically. But don't to cancel any other health insurance you may have. That is the important pomt. I assure the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), the Whip, who I see twiddling his people who thumbs, that I amfinishingoff. Mr Bourchier-Than k you.",77
428,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"That is perfectly all right. The important point is to cancel one's other health insurance, as the Medibank advertisement to which I have referred indicates. I will refer very quickly to 2 complications. One is the proposition that people who at present cover themselves with any of the private funds will be considered to be covered unless they actually take steps to cancel that insurance. This will mean that lots of people will continue paying for it when they do not really intend to do so. If, at present, a person is paying in the order of $ 1.80 a week to be covered for intermediate benefits I think it is wrong that the insurance company will automatically assume that he still wants to take the cover even though it will cost approximately twice as much. I therefore urge people to look carefully at what will happen. Finally, I refer to the point that was raised in the House today during question time. I have forgotten who asked the question but the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said that he was looking into it or that the Department of Social Services was looking into it. It concerns the question of working wives. The difficulty is that people will have to pay the maximum levy of $300 a year for a family unit if their taxable income reaches $12,000. In a way it seems easy to say that if the husband is paying the Medibank levy the wife should not be paying it. That is so if our wives are working because we are earning more than $12,000 a year. In other cases we do not know how much the wife should be paying towards the health insurance levy. But the net result, unless the Taxation Office has come up with some brilliant suggestion, will be either that people will owe money at the end of the year in order to come up to the $300 which is proposed as the levy or they will have overpaid significantly as a family unit before the end of the year and will have vasdy exceeded the $300 levy. If the husband has a taxable income of $9,000 a year and the wife has a taxable income of $7,000 a year, they will have paid much more than their $300 if they are both paying the proposed 2.5 per cent levy. I reiterate the important point so far as this issue is concerned. As the Government has the numbers in both Houses, obviously it will be forcing through this legislation. It will be amending the position as it is at present. One would have thought from the speech of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) that there was a levy existing at the present time and that we are trying to abolish it. Of course, the opposite is the case. There is no levy at present and the Government is introducing a levy which will cost nearly everybody in this country a large amount of money as from 1 October 1976.",77
429,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill (No. 2) and the Health Insurance Levy Bill (No. 2) deal with the financing of health care services for this nation. The proposals contained in them are widely accepted by the Australian community and by the majority of honourable members in this House. The necessity to use a levy to finance Medibank was recognised by the originators of this scheme, Deeble and Scotton. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and the former Australian Labor Party Government also recognised the necessity of applying a levy to fund Medibank. In fact, the implementation of a levy is not an area of political confrontation or philosophical conflict at all, despite the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition quite hypocritically tonight. The only possible area in which opinions may differ is in the amount of the levy itself. We can no longer accept the tax pool concept of funding Medibank. We do not have a bottomless pit from which to draw finance forever and a day. The open-ended approach to financing encourages abuse and over-use and I will dwell further on this later. To have no limits on financing is, to say the least, not conducive to an efficient economical approach to the budgeting of this nation's accounts. To quote my colleague, the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), he recently said: Medibank Mark I certainly achieved universal health insurance but it did so at the expense of largely ignoring the need for economy and efficiency in overall health care. The changes we have made will save Medibank from destroying itself by the uncontrolled explosion of costs. The free concept of health care, we must all acknowledge, is a sham. It was never free. There are no free lunches. Surely each honourable member here accepts the premise that it is essential to place limits on expenditure. This applies not only to health care but also to all government expenditure. This is no less true of government than for any private individual. The Government is no more blessed with some infinite stream of gold sovereigns than is the ordinary worker-the average citizen. We, the legislators of this country, hold a solemn responsibility to govern wisely and far-sightedly the use of the public purse. We are entrusted with the conscientious control of the nation's coffers for the Australian family, just as any responsible parent conscientiously administers the family budget. The implementation of a levy to fund Medibank reintroduces responsibility into the realm of universal health care. Without such a basic levy as is proposed in the Bills, the administration of the health care program would steadily eat more and more into the available funds. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the open-ended approach of Labor tofinancinguniversal health care lends itselfto abuse and overuse. All honourable members realise what would happen if, for example, mechanical services were without direct charge and without limits. Garages would be packed night and day with motorists and their vehicles. The most minor of faults would warrant a quick trip to the garage. The so-called service stations would no longer be able to provide a valid service to any client and the system would soon collapse. It has become increasingly obvious that the service stations of public health care have been similarly affected. The system of umversal health care, under the bottomless pit funding system of Labor, has been abused and over-used. Let me remind honourable members of the words of the Minister for Health on 18 August this year. When speaking in reply to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), he said: The Medibank Review Committe was estabUshed against a background of allegauons of abuses and rip-offs, allegations of over-use of medical and health services, and against a background of exploding health care costs in Australia. I am sure that each member of the House is aware of abuses of pathology services or of radiPensioners ology services and of the proUferation of other services brought about by the tax pool concept formerly adopted by the present Opposition. must establish our priorities in government spending and within the health care system. We must impose controls on outlays, by the adoption of firm, definite and realistic limits funding. In so doing we are encouraging discipUned administration, to restore economy and efficiency in overall health care. We are encouraging discipline in those who administer health care services. It is vital that health care costs be an identifiable part of the nation's accounts. We must have no disappearing dollars. must be seen as an identifiable cost unit, related direcdy to the income tax dollar and limited by inbuUt safeguards protecting both the public purse and the incomes of those it serves. Without this how can the community be expected to of respect the system of umversal health care or have confidence in it? Without identifiable costBUl. ing we invite the sorts of abuses which I outlined a moment ago. We must create economic principle efficiency in the health care scheme, not at the cost of the quaUty of the service. The levy system of funding will achieve these ends. It is important that it be understood that the Medibank basic 2.5 per cent is not a tax. This levy is a fee, like any other, for a professional service. The Bill establishes that the levy may not be claimed as a deduction in its own right. This is not a further tax, as some would have us believe. It is a professional service fee, charged through the public account. In a full year the levy will raise $403m of a total expected Medibank cost of $ 1,540m. The original levy proposed by the honourable member for Oxley would have had to raise $770m, just to finance half the Medibank cost. It becomes obvious that the implementation of a levy is essential to control cost explosions in the health care scheme. The effect of this Bill does not change the original concept. Umversal health insurance remains. All persons will remain covered automatically for full medical care and standard ward treatment in hospital. All Australian residents are entitled to these benefits, unless voluntarily choosing to take out private cover. This Bill ensures the continuance of specialised, concessional health care services for pensioners, repatriation beneficiaries and Service personnel. In particular, pensioners dependent on their pensions and those on the lowest incomes wdl pay no levy. Aged pensioners whose only income is the pension do not pay the levy. entitled to pensioner health benefits do not pay the levy. Persons whose taxable income is below $2,604 do not pay the levy. PerWe sons who receive a single parent rebate and whose taxable income is below $3,790 do not pay the levy. Persons who receive a spouse's rebate and whose taxable income is below $4,299 on health care do not pay the levy.",78
430,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,That is correct.,79
431,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I am pleased that at least the honourable member for Holt understands the scheme, which is something that cannot be said for honourable members opposite. It can readUy be seen from these details that the special position of people in these groups is protected by the Health care provisions of this Bill. An authority is set up by the Bill to regulate exemptions from the payment of the Medibank levy by pensioners. This ensures that that group people, with their particular difficulties, is into no way disadvantaged by the passage of this levy Likewise, the position of repatriation beneficiaries is maintained and protected. The basic regarding the application of the levy to this group is this: The entitlements of any repatriation beneficiaries who are currently entitled or who are still completely entitled to medical and hospital services under the repatriation scheme are in no way diminished by the provisions of this Bill. Repatriation beneficiaries with full entitlement include the following groups of people: Disability pensioners at or above the 100 per cent general rate; service pensioners qualifying for fringe benefits; ex-prisoners of war; veterans of the Boer War and World War I ; and widows, children and other dependants of those whose deaths are service related, or of totally and permanently incapacitated deceased. All these people are eligible for full entitlement under repatriation. If such full entitlement beneficiaries have dependants who are also repatriation beneficiaries or are privately insured, they pay no levy-the y are totally exempt. At the same time, they still receive the specialised concessional treatment to which they are accustomed. So they should, if such beneficiaries with full repatriation entitlement have dependants who are not privately insured or who are not also repatriation beneficiaries, only half the levy is paid and the concessional treatment still applies. Veterans receiving treatment under repatriation for specific disabilities will still receive this treatment as has always been their due. Like any other citizen, they will have to make decisions on basic Medibank levy or private health cover to make provision for costs of their nonspecific disabilities. In addition to maintaining and protecting the position of specialised care of these groups, this Bill makes particular provision for a ceiling on the basic Medibank levy payment. The system of a ceiling, rather than a premium has a distinct advantage to the taxpayer. Previously a premium type payment necessitated commitment at the beginning of the year when income for that year was an indefinite factor. The ceding payment of $300 or $150 for a person with no dependants provides a definite accountable item for the householder's budget-a n item of identifiable cost, related directly to income but limited clearly by legislation to a known maximum. The levy is to be collected in the same form as income tax- a straightforward, direct and practical method, understood by all. In fact, the practical benefits of this financing system are easily evident and certainly need no further elaboration. One of the things I find interesting about this Medibank debate is the great change of heart which the Opposition has undergone. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced the Medibank changes on 20 May and the Minister for Health introduced the Bills that same evening. On 26 and 27 May there was extensive debate on the Bills. Only one gag was applied. That gag was the cause of the only division in the whole debate. The honourable members for Oxley, Prospect (Dr Klugman), Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), Corio (Mr Scholes), Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and even Chifley (Mr Armitage) all spoke in the debate. Not one amendment was proposed. In fact the only amendments put forward were from the Minister for Health himself. The Opposition let the legislation through with hardly a whimper. Then the power brokers moved in. The industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party decided that the parliamentary wing had let the side down. We experienced the incredible situation in which, due to the total lack of parliamentary opposition, the argument was taken outside. The militants called for a national strike which occurred in a half-hearted fashion and is now part of Australia's industrial political history. After the strike and the muscle-flexing exercises of the industrial wing, the parliamentary wing came back for the Budget session determined to reassert its position in the Labor movement. Events tonight and last night are the result of that. The parliamentary Opposition, having been shown up so glaringly by their umon comrades, tried to give legs to the Medibank issue. But the issue is dead. Australians accept the need for the change and the responsibility and the common sense behind the moves. I commend the Bills to the House and reject the amendment.",79
432,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"This is a wake and I am glad that so many members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have seen fit to come. The Government has put up a top flight team of speakers-the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher). Against that we put up 2 members of this House who are among the few people who have taken a consistently intelUgent interest in matters relating to health insurance. They are two of the people who have had a chance of getting some grasp of the complex system this Government is trying to inflict on the AustaUan people. Medibank was a simple concept. It was a concept which attracted every one of the members opposite at the last general election. One or two of the members opposite have expressed reservations about Medibank during this debate. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) remarked that amongst other things, Medibank mollycoddled people and was a monster that got out of control. Then last night during the debate on the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) came out of his closet and said that he had never favoured Medibank. I. dare say that that was a sentiment that he expressed in very soft tones around his constituency at the last election. The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-the n the installed Prime Minister-sai d on behalf of both of those parties on 8 December: I have said repeatedly that essential programs in health, cation and urban development will be maintained. Medibank will be maintained. As recently as 3 February this year the Prime Minister said: You've got to look at it against a commitment to Medibank and that's not just a verbal use of 'Medibank' I think the concept of Medibank was endorsed. The concept of Medibank is terribly importhe tant. It is a concept that was acknowledged bates here by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). Speaking last week on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) in his farewell tribute to the staff of the Health Insurance Commission said: I wish to pay tribute to the staff for the significant has played in the success of the Medibank program. He was not talking about the operations of some statutory corporation in the perfunctory manner of a chief executive or a chairman of a company. He was talking about their commitment to a cept. Medibank was a simple, efiicient health costs. insurance scheme. It was a scheme for which the majority of the people voted in the elections in 1969, 1972, 1974 and, although they were gulled, in 1975. Last year and in the years before that eral and Country Party Opposition fought terised against the scheme from the beginning, in hand with the Australian Medical Association, the prithe vate health funds and the intricate web of interests which stood to benefit from the more than one million Australians remaining the uncovered for medical and hospital treatment and from the continuance of more than 200 wasteful, dupUcative and hopelessly inefficient health insurance funds. Those funds represent the interests of the institutions which use the money siphoned off into reserves for investment purposes, the well fed bureaucracies which them and the doctors whose interests were prized by the old system over the patients' interests. Medibank was the first attempt by an Auscomputerised. tralian Government to rationalise the insurance system covering health care deUvery. It was carefully designed, it was simple, it was understood by people. It benefited many people in its. short Ufe. The Liberals gave it less than a year. The Government has caved into AMA pressure and pressure by the private funds, and has used the health insurance program to offload a substantial 'apparent' amount in the deficit by destroying the original and only meaningful Medibank concept, forcing half of Australia back into the greedy arms of the private health empire. It should be understood very clearly that the Government's motivation is purely a shabby, edusideshow attempt to make it appear as if it is reducing the cost of health insurance to the Government. It is not. It is plunging the health insurance business into chaos and uncertainty and is forcing up the totai cost of health care in maintain Australia simply so that at the next election the the term Government can say that it has reduced the deficit by so much. It should be understood that Government, in breaking its election underin detaking last November not to meddle with Medibank, is dismantling Medibank, not to make health insurance more efficient but so that it canfiddlethe national accounts around a little, he move some figures sideways and some other figures out altogether, and make it look as if it part it has saved Australia a lot of money by handing health insurance substantially back to the discredited private funds. The reality is that the Government is adding to the total cost of health care in Australia because the administrative nightmares, duplications and extra-procedural conwork load will mean substantially increased A major advantage of Medibank is its inherent administrative efficiency. This resulted from the fact that there are no contributions to collect the Libfrom members and from the highly compuprocessing of claims, including the preparation of benefit cheques. A high proportion of staff of organisations registered under the National Health Act have been involved in the collection and processing of contributions and maintenance of membership lists. Furthermore, the scale of operations in each of these registered organisations has not been large enough to warrant automation of the claims assessment procedure. An assessor working in the Medibank system is able to process about 3 times as many claims per day as his or her run counterpart in a registered health insurance organisation because most of the calculations, checking and editing procedures are It should be borne in mind that the Health Insurance Commission's centralised computer system in Canberra handles all medical claims at present and will simply be left with excess capacity when a high proportion of claims reverts to the registered benefits funds. Nor are there likely to be any savings in the numbers of assessing administrative staff of the Health Insurance Commission since provision will need to be made for, inter alia, the checking of claims to ensure that claimants are not covered by registered medical benefits funds. The difficulties of determming at anytimewhether a person is eUgible for benefits payable by the Commission under the Health Insurance Act or is covered by a medical benefits fund are accentuated by the fact that a contributor to such a fund may commence or let lapse his or her membership at any time during thefinancialyear. The Prime Minister and the parties which stand behind him in this chamber conducted campaign of vUification against Medibank last year to try to create an atmosphere of chaos confusion and to give Medibank and reputation of being inefficient and open to massive abuse doctors and patients. In opposition and in government the Minister for Health and Prime Minister have delivered not evidence that the abuse they so often talked about actually existed anywhere but in their fevered imaginations. Of more than 17 000 practising doctors in Australia only one has prosecuted to date for abusing the Medibank system. Honourable members opposite will interested to learn what one of their conservative newspaper supporters had to say about their mantling of Medibank. The editorial contained in the Age of 29 July 1976 said: The Federal Government has effectively destroyed concept of one national health insurance scheme. In it concocted a muddle which in the emotive words 'competition' and 'choice' became a rhetorical substitute the creation of a fair and Even now, more than half the population cannot whether it will be more advantageous for them to insure Medibank's Private fund or with one of the commercial funds . . . . . . more than half the population will be delivered into more expensive hospital and medical care. It may well be that most higher income earners would prefer this anyway, but the Government has given private doctors hospitals-as distinct from salaried or sessionally tors and public hospitals- a the more affluent half of the population. The main excuse given for the imposition of this confusing and complex system is that it would restrain the escalating costs of health care. It will do litde or nothing of the sort . . . . the supposedly anti-inflationary motive behind the Medibank changes is largely illusory. The dubious benefits of competition and choice between Medibank and the private funds are likely higher administrative costs of this needlessly fragmented system . . . . the Government has increased the total cost on the community. The health insurance mishmash of the Prime Minister is a monstrosity in concept and by design. The detaUs of it are only shakily and imprecisely grasped by honourable members on the Government benches. The scheme is socially divisive. It is inefficient. It will increase the cost of health care in Australia and it will have a disastrously inflationary effect on the December consumer price index. The scheme has caused needless chaos and uncertainty amongst Australians. The ordinary tax payer did not really know the extent of the cost of the scheme untU now, as he contemplates the cost which he will be charged after October this year. Bulk billing, one of the mainstays of the Medibank scheme, has been put a in grave jeopardy by permitting medical practitioners to charge patients the difference beand tween the amount recoverable and the standard fee charged. The number of beds available in by private hospitals is grossly exaggerated by private funds in an attempt to ir-duce people to take the insurance which they do not need and which one shred of many people cannot afford. Hardly a day goes by when both the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister do not change their minds about some aspect of their new monbeen strosity. They have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money on printing be pamphlets which immediately become obsolete. When in opposition they criticised the Labor disGovernment's expenditure of some $750,000 in publicising the Medibank program. Now that they have had to spend mUlions of dollars over the and over again to publicise their frequently so doing changing systems of heaith insurance, they cry of'costs', poor. Medimuddle, brought to us by the Prime for Minister and the Minister for Health, is as easy as economical system of health care. judge one, two three, provided we have a ton of perwith severance and a higher degree in pure and applied mathematics. Both the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister have displayed a lack of understanding of what is involved with Medibank and with the operation of national health insurance schemes. This has horrified option officers in their departments who have been tryand ing to make this monstrosity work. Members of paid docthe Medibank Review Committee have been guaranteed market consisting of defamed daily. Mr Carige- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am quite sure that the honourable member is not addressing himself to the 2 BUls as he ought to be. Last night, during a debate on similar Billsto be more than offset by the",80
433,Mr HODGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,He is reading the same speech. Mr Carige-He is virtually reading the same speech I read last night. Last night honourable members opposite took points of order on me because they said I was speaking about the wrong Bills. Tonight those honourable members are speaking on the Bills about which I spoke last night. Therefore they must be out of order.,82
434,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Dr Jenkins)Because I was not present last night I cannot judge which Bills the honourable member was speaking on. So far the honourable member for Grayndler has not transgressed.,83
435,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am speaking on the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill (No. 2) and the Health Insurance Levy Bill (No. 2). I am explaining their purpose. That might have escaped the attention of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Carige). Members of the Medibank Review Committee have been defamed daily in this House when their names have been called in aid of this monstrosity. Reference has been made to a report which they never prepared, which never existed, which has never been tabled in the House and which has never been made available. Their reputations have been shot to pieces because it has been represented in this House by honourable members on the Government side consistently that those Medibank Review Committee members support this mishmash. We have never seen that report. During the Committee stage we will get to the very imprecise procedures of collection upon which this Bill is posited. Meanwhile, it only remains to point out that the legislative drafters have instituted a prize called the Robinson Prize which relates to this bad penny which keeps coming back. Every honourable member on the Government side has a red face. They hoped that the issue would be out of the way last June. It not supposed to come up again. It was supposed to be over. It was a most inept job of parliamentary drafting because it was a most inept thinking process. That was absolutely inevitable. But we will get to that matter in the Committee stage. I say to honourable members: Stick around for instalment No. 2.",83
436,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The legislation before the House tonight shows the Government's concern for the people of Australia. It shows the Government's particular concern for pensioners and those in the community who are less well off. Before explaining those points, I would like to refer to some statements that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) made earlier tonight. I believe that some of the statements that he made were completely irresponsible. He said that it does not matter how much Medibank costs. He said that it does not matter how much health care costs. He said that the cost is irrelevant. He said that it can cost $5,000m but that does not matter. He regards it as just a transfer of funds, as just a money game. His words are an indictment of the Opposition for its attitude towards this legislation. They are negligent and irresponsible remarks.",83
437,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that is a rather gross distortion of my comments. The sum of money was not relevant to the point about how it is raised and I object to ",83
438,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! The honourable member for Maribyrnong is entitled to raise a point of order but not to address the House. If he feels that he has been misrepresented there is a procedure that he can follow to redress the situation.,83
439,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The honourable member for Higgins has misrepresented me.,83
440,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,But the honourable member for Maribyrnong cannot follow that procedure at this stage.,83
441,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. If you read Hansard in the morning I believe that you will find that I have not misrepresented the position. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that it was irrelevant how much Medibank costs. That is what he said. It shows the complete and utter irresponsibility of the Opposition and the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who is now trying to back down. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) pointed out was earher this evening how the honourable member for Maribyrnong did not know where he was going and what he was doing. I believe that his attitude tonight completely shows that. We care about health care. We care about getting health care to the people and we believe in acting responsibly with the taxpayer's money. Those are 2 things that we are doing. We are containing the cost of Medibank. We believe that there can be productivity in relation to Medibank. The legislation that was debated last night in relation to pathological services showed that one can still have responsible and proper health care and contain costs. It is not an argument about economics. We care about the people. The Opposition has given us hairy socialism with its talk about transfer payments and adnunistration no matter how much it all costs. We are concerned about the people. I am reminded today of the victory that the old boys had last night in getting Mr Hawke off the course. I congratulate the members of Dad's Army on their great victory. At the start of question time this morning they were sitting in their places like purring pussy cau.",83
442,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a pomt of order. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether the future of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has anything to do with the legislation before the House. I submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the comments that are being made are completely irrelevant and that the honourable member for Higgins ought to be discouraged from continuing in the current vein.",84
443,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! It is the practice of the House to allow passing references of this nature to be made. I can assure the honourable member for Hughes that if the honourable member for Higgins persists I will call him to order. I call the honourable member for Higgins to speak on the Bill.,84
444,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I thank you again for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. Reference was made by the honourable member for Hughes to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I was congratulating his parliamentary colleagues for rejecting him. What he says is important and what the honourable member for Hughes said is totally incorrect. The President of the ACTU-the acting defacto Leader of the Opposition during the parliamentary recessbrought out the only opposition to the imposition of our levy. The only opposition for 3 months to the legislation that we are talking about tonight was initiated by the President of the ACTU. May I say that it was pretty lousy opposition. Did honourable members ever see the ACTU's proposals in writing? One letter was published in the newspapers concerning the ACTU's proposals. Never were they put down on paper. I would like to speak to the position of the ACTU. It did not care about people, because under its proposals every 2-income family would have paid more. Every family in which the husband and wife worked would have been worse off-and that includes many trade unionists whom the ACTU represents. What the ACTU was saying on Medibank is certainly relevant.",84
445,Mr BAILLIEU,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,It was speaking for the Labor Party.,84
446,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"It certainly was speaking for the Labor Party, and what a lousy job it did. The ACTU said there would be no ceiling because the rich should pay more. That, too, is a false argument, because our argument is about delivering a health service to people, acting responsibility about the cost of that service and acting responsibility in spending taxpayers' money. The ACTU argument on the levy was an argument about levelling incomes. In other word, carried to its logical extension, it meant that a person would have to carry his tax return with him when he paid his tram fare, because if he were a crane driver on the wharf he would have to pay a little more than a member of Parliament. It meant that a person would have to take his tax return to the supermarket, because if he earned more than the next person in the queue at the supermarket, one assumes, he would have to pay more for the goods that he bought there. That is what the ACTU proposals meant. They did not take any account of the position of the chronically ill. The ACTU just did not care. What the ACTU had to say certainly is relevant, because for a while it was the only body representing the Opposition. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) made another pre-selection speech here this evening. I do not think it will do him much good. He did not say anything that I understood. He said that the Government had caved into the pressure of the Australian Medical Association and the private health funds. The people of Australia know that that is utter rubbish. He said that the Government was dismantling Medibank. I point out to him that the de facto Opposition Leader, Mr Hawke, does not think so. He had no faith in the previous Government's Medibank. The Leader of the Australian Labor Party outside the Parliament, the leader of the ACTU, had private health insurance; but under this Government that very man joined Medibank. Mr MCLean-Who did that?",84
447,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The Leader of the ACTU did that. He proved by his action that we have not dismantled Medibank. He proved by his action that Medibank is alive and well. I ask the honourable member for Grayndler to remember that and answer that when he gets to the technical stages of the Bill about which he is to show his knowledge. By crikey, we are looking forward to that very much.",84
448,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,A lot of steam but not much substance.,84
449,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The honourable member would not know about substance, would he? I dismantled his argument a few minutes ago. I would like to talk about the cost of health care in Australia because that is one important aspect of the Government's concern. It is concerned to restrain that cost and still deUver the best health services to the people. Under its proposals about $1,100m will come from general revenue. Taxpayers will still be paying a substantial amount of contribution to Medibank. That means that money will be coming from the rich about whom honourable members opposite are talking. State governments will be contributing $800m to $900m.",84
450,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Reserv e Bank director!,85
451,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I thank the honourable member for Holt. His interjections are most helpful, as is his whole contribution to this Parliament and to members ofhis electorate. As he knows, about $370m will come from the 2.5 per cent levy. About $980 will be contributed by those who choose to insure for more than standard Medibank beneiits. Those are the facts, those are the costs and those are the important issues about our proposals. Under the Medibank established by the Opposition-the original Medibank that has been improved by our proposals-7 0 per cent of people in Australia chose to insure privately. Seventy per cent of people knew that the old Medibank did not suit them. That is an indictment of Medibank as was the decision of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to join Medibank an indictment of the Opposition's policy. Medibank is alive and well. The people of Australia know that and have confidence in our proposals. I support the Bill. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",85
452,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I have an amendment to clause 4, which reads in part: Secuon 251 v of the Principal Act is amended(a) by inserting in sub-sections (1), (2) and (3), word ""Part"" (wherever occurring), of any Act imposing levy ""; (b) by omitting from paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) the words ""or a Medibank contributor""; and ""(2) The regulations may make provision for an in tion to(a) exempting each person included in a class of prescribed by the regulations for the purposes paragraph from payment of the amount of the that, but for the regulations, I move: After paragraph (a) insen the following paragraph: ""(aa) by inserting after paragraph (b) of sub-section the following paragraph: '(ba) during the whole of that period the person was entided to pensioner health benefits;' "". The amendment relates to that part of the Bill which describes prescribed persons-peopl e who will be excluded from the need to pay the levy. The Bill indicates that, prescribed persons will be denned under regulations. Our view is that pensioners entitled to pensioner health benefits should be explicitly mentioned so that there is no doubt about their position. They constitute a very vulnerable section of the community. It is for these reasons that we propose the amendment.",85
453,Mr WILLIAMMCMAHON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," I rise with some reluctance. I do so because there has been so much misrepresentation about the Government's attitude. So Uttle has been said about the impact of financial arrangements in respect of the introduction of the health insurance scheme that I thought it necessary that someone from this side of the chamber explained the Government's position in some detail. I must say that I was alarmed to hear the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) speak as he did because there is no doubt in the world that he knows the financial impUcations of Medibank. He chose to disregard those implications and make a speech, obviously not in order to sustain his position in Grayndler because the seat is about to be abolished and no one will care if it goes and he goes with it. Nonetheless, I am a Uttle ashamed of the fact that a man with his knowledge should not have explained completely the economic and nnanciai implications. I speak against the background that on the first night this year when the problem of Medibank was raised on television I heard the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) In Committee say that the Labor Party was not worried about anything other than the actual system. They did not care about delivery or about the patients whose needs and wants had to be satisfied. What they were interested in was a socialist system, and if they got that the honourable member for after the Maribyrnong would be happier than he has ever the words ""and been before. I turn now to Dr Scotton, who on the same night said he beUeved that if the Government's relaintentions were carried out he could be a strong supporter. Shortly after that, for reasons I do not persons know, he left the organisation and from then on of this became a rather bitter enemy. More is the regret, levy because he is a very capable person and I would have given him the job of carrying out the Government's intentions. I think we would have got a greater number in the private system of (1) medical and hospital care and with a greater degree of efficiency than under the present Medibank system. I recall also a couple of other facts which I should like the honourable member for Grayndler to hear, if he does not rush out of the Chamber for purposes that I do not know. The Government appointed the Nimmo Committee to look into the private system of health care. The Committee reported that the existing system was a good one and that its efficiency was first class. So the honourable member for Grayndler therefore cannot object because of the lack of economies of scale. The simple fact is that he was not here at the time, he was still in his napkins and swaddling clouts, and I do not blame him for not being able to understand what Nimmo said, probably as long ago as 10 years. The honourable member for Grayndler also referred to the consumer price index. He ought to have remembered that at one stage Medibank was taken out of the consumer price index and now, under the Government's proposals, it is to be replaced. It was taken out at one time, put back at another time. So in total there has been no loss; the position remains exactly the same. The other philosophical comment I make is against the background that honourable members on the other side of the House claim that they know what democracy is all about. What is wrong with the patient having the right to choose his own doctor and express his preference for the medical or hospital benefit organisation to which he wants to belong? If he chooses one, why not? We do it with the Commonwealth Bank, we do it with transport, we do it on a dozen and one other occasions. Why should we not have a plural system and give an abundance of opportunities to Australian people if they want them? The point I really want to make relates deficit financing, and here I have to rely mously on my memory. Until I heard one or two people speak I had no intention at all of speaking in this debate. But having heard them, I thought it was essential that somebody who knew the Government's case onfinanceshould get up and say something. As I understand it, this year cost of the Medibank levy will be about $260m, but in a full year when the levy goes up the tax will be $430m. If one looks at the Budget papers one will see that this year the cost of medical will be of the order of $2,908m. I do not know how much of that belongs to Medibank, but it means that through deficitfinancingdrawn out of Reserve Bank funds through the printing press-fiduciar y currency through the printing press-medica l care will cost the Australian lic about $2,648m. This Government came into power in order to control the quantity of the money supply. It came in because it knew that deficit financing,financedby a bank for social welfare benefits, was disastrous so far as inflationary pressures were concerned. Therefore the Government decided that it had to follow up the proposals initially made by the Labor Party under non-inflationary conditions to finance Medibank by a tax on incomes of 1.35 per cent. If any members of the Labor Party, any members of the community or any technical experts want to argue that the Labor Party's policy on financing part, at least, of Medibank out of taxation is wrong they have to go back on the principles that the Labor Party established when it first decided to introduce the scheme. I want to point out that I do not mind deficit financing. In fact, I would recommend deficit financing. In this year's Budget. I would not have minded a deficit of $3,750m-providin g only it was spent in the right way for productive purposes and providing it was soundly funded through open market operations, would draw in money from the public and neutralise it in terms of borrowed money in the hands of the Commonwealth. If we have a deficit of this kind not for productive services but for welfare services, that amount of money-it was $2,648m or a lesser amount according to the amount that is properly attributable to Medibank-mus t have inflationary consequences for us. Let there be no mistake about it. The Government recognised that the Medibank levy was justified on economic grounds and was anti-inflationary. I have always been a member of a private medical and health system. I am not an antagonist of Medibank. I believe private systems are effective and efficient and that they do good for to this community. They introduce an element of enorcompetition. If honourable members opposite are frightened of competition to Medibank they show it in the worse possible way in this House. In thetimethat the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has led the Government of this country the Opposition has squealed about every issue. the Today we saw what I believe to be one of the most degrading experiences I have known since I have been in Parliament. The Opposition refused to let Parliament operate sensibly and in the best care interests of the Australian people. This is the kind of occurrence which we have to put up with from the dilapidated and depleted Opposition. From the day of their defeat members of the Opposition have gone back into their burrows. They have hidden from the public view. All they have pubdone is to try to distort the processes of this Government and the effective administration of the economy. Give the Prime Minister time and he will make us prosperous. He needs a couple of years but in the meantime he needs to have this measure passed by the Parliament in the interests of the medical care of the Australian people.",85
454,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," I shall not test your patience, Mr Deputy Chairman, by canvassing such a wide field as did the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr WUliam MCMahon). It is, nonetheless, a great privUege to follow him in this debate. He is an expert onfinance.I want him to listen to what I have to say because I want to put some serious considerations to him. I hope that I can draw him back into the debate. I should like to revert to the Robinson Prize-it probably should be called the Robinson-Hunt Prize-becaus e I suspect that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) was not as intimately mvolved in the design of this absurd scheme of health insurance as was the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt).",87
455,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,You can do better than this.,87
456,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The honourable member should wait and see. At the Legislative Drafting Institute they have had to put up with these Ul-devised, ill-defined schemes. This is a debate, as honourable members will be aware, that should never be happening. This is the debate that the Government was supposed to put to bed last May and June so that it would not be faced with the embarrassment of its bungUng so close to the time that the taxpayers of Australia are having to fiddle with these stupid forms foisted upon them by the Government. If the Government looked at the legislation it rushed into the Parliament at the end of the last sitting, it would find that the legislation was so badly drawn that in some BUls-for example, the Health Insurance Commission Bill-virtuall y every substantive provision has been repealed by the Bill which the Government has now produced. Let us examine the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill (No. 2) 1976.",87
457,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Iriseon a point of order. I thought we were discussing the amendment which is in these terms: Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House is of the opinion that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue.",87
458,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,What Ucence did we give him?,87
459,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Is the honourable member for was Grayndler addressing the Chair, or am I?",87
460,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY, who Order! The honourable member for Holt is dressing the Chair.,87
461,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I thought I was just dealing with a committee debate.,87
462,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! If the honourable member for Holt will resume his seat I shall explain the position to him. The Committee is considering the Bill as a whole. Honourable members fromtimeto time, where it might be helpful, could mention to which clause they are actually referring, but there is no such need when the Committee is dealing with the Bill as a whole. I understand the implication the honourable member makes, namely that a second reading debate is meant to deal with the concept or the plulosophy of the legislation and that consideration at the Committee stage is meant to stick more closely td the elements of the Bill itself, but at this stage in the debate I do not object to the words used by the honourable member for Grayndler. I call the honourable member for Grayndler.",87
463,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I shall refer immediately to the amendment under consideration which in fact does relate to clause 4 in the Bill I mentioned. It is to the effect that the Government now proposes to give an exemption to pensioners who are entitled to pensioner health benefits. This is a change of heart, and the Government ought to own up to it, because it is a noble change of heart. It is one in relation to which it ought to be more forthcoming. It is a provision which was not in the legislation which the Government introduced in May. It is not one which is described in the misleading pamphlets which was produced at a cost of mUlions of dollars to Australian taxpayers. That pamphlet, produced in August 1976 by authority of the Department of Health, states: If you're a pensioner who receives only your pension, you will not have to pay any levy for Standard Medibank benefits. This will include many people who are entitled to pensioner health benefits. However, if you receive any extra money you may have to pay the levy. That in fact is not now the case, and the Government has caused needless heartache to a great many pensioners. The genesis of proposed new section 2 51X is very simple. Let me tell the House about it. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), who is as the sisted by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who is at the table, received on the day after he delivered his Budget a delegation from the Combined Pensioners Association of Australia. That delegation put it to him that it inequitable that many of the people who are now entitled to pensioner health benefits and do not have to pay for their medical care adwUl, in future, have to pay the levy. Our Treasurer said: 'Oh, no, that cannot be true', with the farniharity that he always exhibits in relation to the Budget Papers. He immediately rang up the Minister for Health. He said: 'Ralph, is this the case? It cannot be so, can it?' Ralph said: 'Yes, I'm afraid it is'. So immediately after that the Government went into this secret operation to give to these pensioners the benefits to which they are entitled. Why does not the Government come out and say",87
464,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! Do I presume that the honourable member is talking about the Minister for Health?,88
465,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I was, in legal parlance, doing what is called a 'verbal.' I was reciting verbatim the conversation. The Minister for Health, very creditably if belatedly, gave these pensioners their due. What the amendment seeks to do is to give that exemption in the legislation, and not by way of regulation, to ensure that the exemption for pensioners entitled to pensioner health benefits is not made subject to the whim of the government of the day which could prescribe it out of existence by altering the regulations gazetted during a parUamentary recess. Let us put that provision into the legislation, as indeed we do for every other person who is exempt from the levy. For repatriation personnel, for defence forces personnel we have in the relevant legislation an exemption. We ought to put that exemption in this legislation in relation to pensioners entitled to pensioner health benefits. I think it is fair to the pensioners. It is an equitable principle. It is in this regard that, if l can, I want to draw back into the debate the right honourable member for Lowe-a n important principle of taxation with which he will be farruliar. The Income Tax Assessment Act, which is amended by this legislation, does not permit of the prescription of any person as exempt from any tax. The regulations made under that legislation do not permit the government of the day to prescribe exemptions. A very important principle in taxation legislation is that the Parliament gives these exemptions. It is one that we ought to uphold as an important principle quite apart from the question of giving pensioners justice. I do not ask for any great retraction from the Minister for troubling us with that bothersome debate a couple of months ago because the legislation was so poorly drawn. I simply ask now that the Government makes the position very clear to pensioners who, as every honourable member here who does his constituency duties will know, are concerned about the prospect of their being subject to a levy and to persons who are entitled to pensioner health benefits but who pay mcome tax and who would, apart from the regulations which we are told it is mtended to make under this legislation, have had to pay the levy. Let us stand up for the rights of those pensioners and put it here in the legislation. That is what the amendment proposes. It is a principle of justice for pensioners. It is also a very proper principle in relation to taxation legislation and in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act which is the legislation that this Bill amends.",88
466,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I understand that we are discussing in Committee 2 matters together. One provides that the pensioner is entitled to health benefits all thetime.I completely support that proposition. I see no reason why during that whole period the pensioner should not be entitled to health benefits under clause 4. Nothing would persuade me that a pensioner under Medibank should not be entitled to it. I understand that we are also discussing the following important provision: Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading this House is of the opinion that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue.,88
467,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! The second point that the honourable member is dealing with, I gather from what he said, refers to an amendment which was moved at the second reading stage and which has already been dealt with. He was in order on the first point that he made, and he would also be in order in referring to any additional clause of this Bill. Strictly he is not in order on the second pomt he made.",88
468,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr WUUam MCMahon), who spoke before me suggested that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue. I am absolutely unable to accept the proposal that Medibank should be funded out of general revenue. There are many good reasons for that opinion. Firstly, I do not believe that it is possible to fund Medibank out of general revenue. Experience abroad in 2 countries in this world has proved that any attempt to fund a national service organisation out of general revenue will faU, and therefore it is perfectly sensible that we ought to follow the original concept of the Opposition that a levy should be raised to fund the total Medibank cost. I do not believe that this nation in fact wants to accept a tax so that Medibank can be paid for out of general revenue. My fundamental belief is that people should care for themselves and look after themselves, and it is only when people cannot do so for one reason or another-becaus e of their own problems or because of their nnanciai situationthat taxation revenue should be used to help them. Am I being asked, for example, to say that my own contribution, if I join Medibank, should be paid out of general revenue? I do not believe that it should. I think I should be able to care for myself and family. I do not beheve that the general revenue of this country should be used to fund Medibank completely. That was not the concept of the Opposition. I do not understand why this amendment has been proposed. Perhaps Dr Cass could explain it to me. Surely everybody knows that we cannot possibly have a system whereby general taxation is used for Medibank.",88
469,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. You have pointed out to the speaker that he is really speaking to the motion relating to the second reading and not the amendment proposed in the Committee stage. I think that his remarks are rather irrelevant to what we are an debating at the moment.",89
470,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Wherea s I have a certain feeling that the pomt of order raised the honourable member for Marybyrnong is corme rect, at this stage the Committee is dealing with the Bill as a whole rather than with all the clauses of the Bill separately. I think the honourable member is probably covered by the fact that this is a Bill for an Act 'To amend the law relating Income tax in relauon to the imposition, assessAustraUa, ment and collection of a Health Insurance levy'. However, I do pick up an implication that he really is harking back to another debate. I should like him totiehis remarks in with a clause of the Bill, if possible.",89
471,Mr YATES,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I thank the honourable member. I am surprised that after all that we have been through the Opposition should propose that Medibank ought to be funded out of general revenue. I have never heard of such an extraordisioners nary concept.,89
472,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," I was grappling with the very deep imphcations of Bill when I heard the remarks of the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates). I find it very difficult to comprehend the proposition that put before the Committee. He said that people should be paying for health services. He seems take the attitude that whereas Australian people generally accept the proposition things that are important to individuals and to the nation at large should be financed pacity to pay principle- I am referring to such matters as social welfare benefits, child endowment, widow pensions, age pensions, even the defence of the country and many others that come under the administration of State governments-whe n it comes to health we ought to depart from that principle and revert to a philosophy whereby people have to look after themselves and whereby a levy ought to be paid. Mr Hodges-How about a national scheme for your home or your motor car?",89
473,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"That is accommodated to some degree in respect of needy people under State housing programs and the like. The honourable gentleman might like to contend on some other occasion, as it is inappropriate to do so now, that we should abandon the support for low mcome people in housing and the like. There is no doubt that in respect of many important services that sustain the Australian people individually and in a corporate way we acknowledge the principle that people should pay according to their capacity to pay. I am not making assertion; I am just relating a fact of life which is the subject of a great range of legislation which the House deals with from time to time. Mr by Deputy Chairman, you will be gratified to hear say that what we are dealing with now is a very simple proposition, related to clause 4 of the Bill, whereby the shadow Minister for Health, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, Dr Cass, is trying to safeguard the interests of some to hundreds of thousands of pensioners around especially pensioners who are receiving health benefits. He is trying to ensure that during the entiretimethat a person is entitled to pensioner health benefits he will be safeguarded. That is all that is being put before the Committee at the presenttime.I wonder why there is all this concern. The fact of the matter is that around Australia at the present time and in the Parliament there is enormous consternation as to what people should do and foremost among the ones who are concerned are pensioners. The penwho get into the most difficult area are the ones who are affected by this amendment, the ones who receive health benefits but who do this not know what their position is now and what their position might be in the future. There is nothing in the legislation before the Parliament he which would safeguard the interests of those pensioners, those people who under a means test to receive the benefits of health concessions. The proposal put by the honourable member for that many Maribyrnong would do this.",89
474,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Do you intend to change this on a cawhen you get back into office?,89
475,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I have been asked a question and I think I should answer it frankly and honestly. What the Labor Party proposed do when Medibank was first introduced was impose a tax levy of 1.35 per cent.,89
476,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,You are supposed to be talking the amendment.,90
477,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,You have asked me ositions one question. I will deal with one question time. That was our proposition.,90
478,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,That was the question I asked you.,90
479,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"When we were in office, the honourable member who interjected might recall that the Senate rejected the proAustralia posals of the Labor Party and proposed that Medibank or health care should from the proceeds of uniform taxation.",90
480,Mr LUSHER,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"No , we did not.",90
481,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Well, if you like, from consolidated revenue. We accept the proposition that your Party forced upon us by utilising that brutal majority your Party had at that time.If you want to trunk about this philosophically, you Bill? ought to go back to the very simple proposition that there is a total health burden in Austraha, manifested in money terms. It is in respect such things as private hospital care, pubhc tal care, and repatriation care. There is an aggreproposition gation of all those costs. What we have been ing about for several days in this place is those costs should be met. The Labor Party's proposition is terribly fundamental. It is to effect, to ensure that every Australian is guaranrespect teed adequate health care, the availability of doctor who is well trained and access to a to regional hospital which is well equipped and in respect of which there is a complex of medical expertise. Surely we all acknowledge that idea. does not matter how you go about it or what apis pendages there are. Whether it is a private hospiis tal, a nursing home or whatever, the fact is there is a total cost and we ought to be looking the idea of how we can most equitably contribute to that and do it in such a way well-being of Australians. Can honourable members opposite think of a more simple proposition than paying from the proceeds of taxation the rich pay more than the poor as is the case in respect of widows' pensions, child endowment, defence, education and all these other services for which we legislate from time to time?That all the Labor Party is putting. In the amendment before the Committee we seek to safeguard the interests of the pensioners. I gather from all the wide-ranging talk that right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William to MCMahon) went on with, that he, in the end, like to other Government supporters will vote against the proposition put by the honourable member to for Maribyrnong which seeks to safeguard the interest of pensioners. In fact what the Government has done in every element of the propthat it has put in respect of the 4 health at a Bills has been to vote against the fundamental idea that everybody should be looked after and their interests safeguarded simply by the taxpayers paying for them in terms of equitable payments. Why do Government supporters abandon that concept? What do they have against the idea that every human being in should be able to go into a hospital and be looked after and that they should be paid for? be financed Is that abhorrent to them?",90
482,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Order! I do not mind passing references but the honourable member is really debating the principles and philosophies of the Bill, which is not the purpose of the Committee debate. Will he tie his remarks to the amendment or to any specific clause in the",90
483,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"I will be pleased to coof operate in that regard. I commend the honourhospiable member for Maribyrnong who put this so explicitly and clearly before the talkCommittee. I ask honourable members opposite how whether they are prepared now to vote for the proposition contained in the amendment moved this by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in of pensioners who have qualified in terms a of the means test, not the means test that applies pensions but the one that applies for people to qualify for the pensioner medical service and all the fnnge services? Those pensioners should be It put beyond doubt in respect of this matter. That what the proposition is about. At present there ambiguity on that question. Hundreds of thouthat sands of pensioners are affected and the Labor at Party wants to safeguard their interests and put them out of the state of anxiety that they are in at as to ensure the the present time.",90
484,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! The so that honourable member'stimehas expired.,90
485,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"We have listened to a diatribe from the is honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who, I believe, for political reasons is trying to drag a red herring once again in front of all pensioners to confuse them about Medibank. In referring to the proposal of the honourable the member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), I quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). For example, people whose only income is the age pension are not called on to pay levy. levy relief for pensioners is to go further than that. Pensioners who have an entitlement to pensioner health benefits will, like people covered by repatriation and defence force arrangements, be freed from the levy. Age pensioners entitled to pensioner fringe benefits, eficiaries and Service personnel, will thus continue to receive the special consideration that has long been extended to them in the field ofhealth care. So much for the speech of the honourable member for Hughes and so much for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. I believe that we should leave this chamber tonight indebted to the former Prime Minister (Mr WilUam MCMahon) for his great contribution, thus enUghtening the Committee. He told honourable members just how much the whole scheme will cost. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) reminded the Committee this evening that last night I said that I was a continuing opponent of the whole concept of Medibank. He fled England only a few months ago to find a safe seat in Australia. Had he thought so highly of the English health scheme he would have been there still. I recall that last year when he was in England articles appeared in the Australian newspapers stating that the English health scheme was staggering and in dire need of the injection of some £2,000m to save it. As the  said the other day; 'You cannot blame the son for the sins of the father'. But the honourable member for Grayndler entered this debate to advocate the scheme from which he fled in England. In today's Press we saw another article headed 'France's Medibank staggers'. The article stated: France's equivalent of Medibank is so seriously in the red that it expects a staggering $ 1,800m deficit next year. We are discussing the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill 1976 and it is appropriate that we talk about levies. The English scheme, the French scheme, the Canadian scheme and so many other sick schemes throughout the world have faUed because they reUed upon some form of levy. This Government has set about trying to preserve that which it regrettably- I emphasise the word 'regrettably'-inherite d and making it better. So highly did Labor politicians think of the Australian Labor Party's national health scheme that seventeen out of the 36 members of the ALP who remained as members in this place after the election continued also as members of private health funds. Even Dr Hawke or Mr Hawke-whateve r he might be called",90
486,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"D r Chicken. As already indicated, however,",91
487,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The honourable member suggests Dr Chicken. I do not want to indulge in frivolous discussion. This is a very serious matter. Even Mr Hawke continued to as well as repatriation benremain as a member of a private health fund because he regarded the Labor Party's health scheme as totally unacceptable. Unfortunately,91
488,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Mr GILES) Order! Would the honourable member please try to tie his remarks to the Bill we are discussing.,91
489,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I will be coming around to that.",91
490,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The honourable member might not be coming around to doing that for much longer if he continues to speak in this way.,91
491,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"WhUe I recognise that the Health Insurance Levy Assessment Bill is good in itself, it is sometimes unfortunate that the Liberals have a capacity to do things better than the Labor Government. This means that Medibank will continue to live. I do not profess to speak on behalf of anyone else, but my personal view is that I could not care what happens to Medibank. Let us look at the health costs. Prior to the introduction of the Hayden health plan, the average Australian was receiving health care so much more cheaply than is the case today. Mr Deputy Chairman, I am talking about this levy and particularly about clause 7 of the Bill. The average Australian family was paying only $3 or $4 a week at the very most for the maximum form ofhealth care. In 30 months, this cost has increased by two to two and a half times in order to secure exactly the same cover. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Grayndler rattled offfiguresto try to substantiate his claim that Medibank was better, I would say that it is infinitely more costly to preserve this scheme. An amazing contribution was made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party tonight by the honourable member for Grayndler. He had a shot at a doctor who was convicted on certain charges. I do not condone for one moment those people who Uve on the periphery of crime and by confidence tricks. But the honourable member referred to the fact that the Liberal Government had prosecuted only one medico. I can remember what happened in one case. I may be talking about the same case as the honourable member. Was he referring to the doctor who was alleged to have earned $500,000? Mr Antony Whitlam-It is not my habit to defame people here under privilege.",91
492,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"This may be a second case. I read about an Adelaide doctor who allegedly earned approximately $300,000 to $400,000 legally and had ripped off Medibank-this was all from the levy-to the extent of another $ 100,000.",92
493,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Order! I must say that the honourable member is not talking to a clause in Committee. I have the feeling that I am being set up for a confidence trick.,92
494,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"No, Sir.",92
495,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,The honourable member will deal with the subject matter of the Bill or I will be forced to ask him to resume his seat.,92
496,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Mr Deputy Chairman, we are taking this Bill as a whole in Committee and I am trying to cover as many clauses as I can at once. I will conclude my remarks with a few brief comments. Doctors, from the word go, were totally opposed to Medibank and to the levy, the introduction of which we are discussing in this debate. They were opposed to all other forms of government national health schemes. They subscribed to previous health insurance schemes that existed. A great many doctors, in fact, now have incomes in excess of $250,000 a year. A huge number of Austrahan doctors are earning more than that amount annually. But the fact is that these doctors did not want this health scheme in the first place, although some may hum to themselves every night, 'My God how the money rolls in, rolls in'. They preferred a system under which people had to work",92
497,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,Can you sing it?,92
498,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,No. That is what they are saying. They had to,92
499,Mr LES JOHNSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I rise to order. The people who are covered in the amendment moved by the Opposition are the contributors to Medibank, the members of the defence forces and people covered by the provisions of the Repatriation Act. We are trying to safeguard the interests of pensioners. It is as ple as that. The honourable gentleman is talking about doctors. There is a lot to be said about them, but it has nothing to do with the matter before the Committee.",92
500,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,I uphold the point of order. The honourable member for Griffith will resume his seat unless he comes back to the amendment.,92
501,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY,"The Minister, in his second reading speech, assured the House that certain guarantees would be given to pensioners. I feel that the amendment is a last ditch political ploy by the Opposition to try to give the public the impression that we are not looking after pensioners. We are looking after pensioners. We looked after them prior to Medibank. I am quite sure that with the return of the Liberal-National Country Party Government not only pensioners but all citizens are better off than they would have been if the present Opposition had continued in government.",92
502,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," Mr Deputy Chairman, I beg your indulgence. I trust you will allow me to reply to some of the comments directed specifically at me in the context of this debate. Firstly, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon) said that the Nimmo Committee, which was set up by a Liberal government, reported that the voluntary health system was first class and most efficient. I shall quote from page 9 of the report of the Nimmo Committee. I quote from the findings: 1. The operation of the health insurance scheme is unnecessarily complex and beyond the comprehension of many. 2. The beneiits received by contributors are frequently much less than the cost of hospital and medical treatment. 3. The contributions have increased to such an extent that they are beyond the capacity of some members of the community and involve considerable hardship for others. Other findings are: 5. An unduly high proportion of the contributions received by some organisations is absorbed in operating expenses. 6. The level of reserves held by some organisations is unnecessarily high. First class? Most efficient? Poppycock. That was thefindingof the Nimmo Committee. It reported that the voluntary health system was most inefficient. One of its recommendations was that a national health insurance commission be set up to supervise the funds, to arrange for the insurance funds benefit tables, the basis of payment of medical and hospital fees, special assistance for low income families, surveillance of operations of insurance organisations and observance by them of the conditions imposed by sim- and under the National Health Act. They are hardly the comments of a committee of inquiry which is saying: 'Very good organisation, very good show'. It is utter nonsense to suggest that that is what the Committee was saying. A number of speakers, not just the right honourable member for Lowe, referred to Medibank costs. I made the point in my initial speech on this Bill- I repeat it now because this Bill relates to the raising of funds to pay for medical and hospital services-that Medibank is simply the instrument of passing the funds across. One cannot say that Medibank costs money. It is the services that cost money. Whether it is in Great Britain, France-the y are the 2 countries to which reference has been made where costs are rising-America , Sweden, Canada, Australia, West Germany or any other country, the costs are rising. The community pays. It pays out of its own pocket. The money does not come from up above. It comes from taxation revenue, contributions to benefit funds or the patient paying directly. It does not come from anywhere else. In addition, studies in America show that the cause of this rapid increase in costs is not the system by which the money is collected and handed over. The problem is the way in which the people providmg the services are rewarded. The problem is the fee for service system. That is what the facts show, despite all the prejudiced views of honourable members opposite about the cost of Medibank. I said that the cost, whether it be $ 1,000m, $2,000m or $3,000m, was irrelevant. The honourable member picked me up on this point in the sense that I meant it did not matter. That was not what I meant. I meant it was irrelevant in the sense that whichever figure it is- I do not want to argue which one it is-al l that money comes from people's pockets. It comes from people's pockets, not to pay Medibank, not to pay the voluntary funds but to pay the doctors and the hospitals. That is the cost. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber should stop deluding themselves. Even the changes they are about to bring in will only make matters worse not better. The cost will continue to escalate because the Government is retaining the fee for service basis. To get to the point of this amendment, we agree that pensioners should be covered. We agree that the Mmister said they would be covered. But the pomt is, this is not in this Bill. It covers some pensioners but not all pensioners. It does not cover the pensioners that we have specified, namely those who are entitled to pensioner health benefits. The explanatory memorandum to the 2 Bills states on its first page: There is to be a regulation-making authority that able rehef from the levy to be given to people such as pensioners entitled to Pensioner Health Benefits. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said that. We are simply saying that if that is the case, and it now depends on a regulation making authority, we want that put into the Act. That is what our amendment is about.",92
503,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY," I have listened to the debate tonight, I think, for the best part of 3 hours. If my memory serves me correctly we have had a debate on this subject now for about 3 months. A lot of comments and, if I might say so, some rather loose comments have been made durmg that particular period. I simply wish to take just a few minutes to state a couple of facts. I put it to members of the Opposition that there is an inconsistency in their approach. I wish to speak very briefly about the question of not wishing to have a levy because the original concept of the then Labor Administration, now the Opposition, was to have a levy. The purpose of the levy which this Bill introduced has to be seen in the context of budgetary responsibility. We all know that despite what the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) said there has been a degree of misuse and there has been a degree of abuse. The Government is attemptingand I believe attempting successfully in a very complex area-to try to bring some sanity and common sense into a very important program for the Australian community. But I should really like to speak about the amendment in the Committee stage. I felt that the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) spelt out the position. Let me just repeat what I said in my second reading speech: The Bill will also provide an authority to make regulations to confer exemptions from the levy. This authority will be exercised to exempt pensioners who are entitled to pensioner health benefits. Such people will thus be given an exemption comparable to that provided for repatriation beneficiaries and members of the Defence Force. I say to the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) that there is no doubt about that. There is no ambiguity in that statement; the position is perfectly clear. All we are talking about tonight are technicalities. We are not talking about substance because we both agree that these people ought to be exempted. I put these questions to the Opposition: Is it a fact that there is again an inconsistency? Is it a fact that when honourable members opposite produced their Bill they did not specifically exempt these people from the Act? Is it a fact that the Bill which they introduced into the Parliament sometimeago in will enfact had regulations and gave them a power to make regulations to confer exemptions? It seems to me that honourable members opposite ought to be saying that they are in favour of this exemption, because my understanding is that this is exactly the same as they did. They did not have specific exemption in the Bill that they introduced into the Parliament a considerable time ago. Therefore what I want to say to the Opposition is that the legislation will contain and does contain regulations to confer exemptions. The Government is committed to the conferring of those exemptions. There is no need for the amendment whatsoever. As I said, the Government does not object to the substance of the amendment but there is no point in it. As a matter of technicality there is no need for the amendment and it is therefore rejected.",93

511,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY BILL,"The Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) in his second reading speech on the Health Insurance Levy Bill (No. 2) stated: Its comparative length is due to the need to binations of less than usual situations. I briefly draw the attention of the House to ation that is not less than usual but is extraordiMinister narily complicated by the procedures laid down by this Bill. It is a procedure which a great taxpayers around Australia are grappling with today. The Australian Taxation Office forms provide only for people taking insurance under the National Health Act, including the so called Medibank Private. But a large percentage of young working families are expected to pay only the health insurance levy. As the situation stands, if the husband pays the family levy to $5.80 a week, which automatically covers his wife and children for public hospital ward 85 per cent of medical costs, his working wife will still have to pay the single levy of up to a week. This money will be refunded to but not until the end of the financial year tax returns arefilledin. If a working husband and wife decide to the levy separately at single rates up mum of $2.90 a week, the Taxation Office will demand that the husband pay an additional health $ 150 at the end of the year to cover his wife. The unwieldier, $150 paid by his wife would then be refunded. designed This situation could be avoided if the Taxation ment camp. Office added another sentence to its levy exemption forms stating that a working exempt from paying the levy if it was being paid by her husband, and perhaps requiring band's levy number to be stated. This problem was raised at question time today with Treasurer (Mr Lynch). A report in yesterday's Australian states: The Medibank spokesman said: 'The Taxation Departunder ment has shown no indication that they will do this. have taken no steps to make the payment of the levy working husbands and wives easier'. A spokesman for the Taxation Depanment yesterday confirmed that working husbands and wives would have to pay the levy and money would be refunded to the wife at the end of year. That is not an unusual situation and it ought not to have been beyond the wit of the Government or of its advisers to devise a satisfactory solution to it. This is not a simple scheme. It is extremely Third Reading complex. The last word on the demise of Medibank perhaps should belong to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). He is not here. In his absence I state: The story of Medimuddle is not really that funny. It has been conceived in an atmosphere of lies, deception humbug and will mean increased cost to the community, chaos and needless confusion. Where once there was a simple scheme which worked for the benefit of all we now have a more cater for comexpensive and hopelessly more complicated scheme which is socially divisive and inefficient and which many experts say will not work. The a situPrime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the for Health (Mr Hunt) have used Medibank as part of their overall economic stratmany egy to window-dress the national accounts and make it appear as if they are good managers. exemption Few will be deceived by this. The Long March in China of Chairman Mao is over. The long march of our leader, Chairman Mai, is commonly beheved by his supporters to have commenced in Launceston and not in some of up sleazy Toorak encounter after a hamburger or after Mr Gorton had been knifed in the back. So and let us go back to Launceston, which was the scene of the start of the long march and which is $2.90 where his favourite Tasmanian-the Minister for the wife Environment, Housing and Community when Development (Mr Newman)-come s from and see what the exceedingly conservative Launcespay ton Examiner has had to say about this scheme. to a maxiIn its editorial of 30 July it said: So what have Prime Minister Fraser and his Ministers been on about for so long? Instead of a better, brighter insurance scheme, we appear to have a costlier, class conscious, divisive and confusing rag bag to satisfy the ideological nit pickers in the GovernIt is indicative of the enormous influence Mr Fraser wields wife would be in the Government.",95
512,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY BILL,In reply - I wish to reply very briefly to the the remarks of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam). I have brushed aside the politicking. He is obviously some stress and strain. I have pushed that They aspect to one side. I take it that the honourable by member is genuinely concerned about a possible tax problem. A question was raised about this the extra matter during question time this morning. The the tax Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has consulted the Taxation Office. I point out to the honourable member that the Treasurer has released or will release a statement on this subject this evening. It explains the position in terms which I am certain all honourable members and all members of the community will understand. I am not going to take up any more of the time of the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. C. J. Dennis-Chile-Australia n Conservation Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.,95
513,Mr SHIPTON,HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY BILL," I wish to raise in the House this evening the subject centenary of the birth of the author and poet C. J. Dennis. C. J. Dennis-calle d by some the 'Larrikin Laureate' and perhaps the unofficial Poet Laureate of Australia in his time-capture d the folk lore ofhis time and at the same time created history. Whilst the Australian language changes, I think that in his poem the Great Australian Slanguage he captured not only what was apThen plicable then but also what is would like to read it. I reads: 'Tis the everday Australian Has a language ofhis own, Has a language, or a slanguage, Which can simply stand alone. And' a dickon pitch to kid us,' Is a synonym for' lie' And to' nark it' means to stop it And to' nit it' means to fly! A week ago on Tuesday in this ter for Defence (Mr KUlen) put down in argument the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage). I was sitting here on that day, was the centenary of Dennis's birth, and I was reminded of a poem called Uncle Jim written by C. J. Dennis. I would like to read it because it is very appUcable. It reads: ' I got no time fer wasters, lad,' sez 'e 'Give me a man wiv grit, 'sez Uncle Jim. 'E bores 'is cute old eyes right into me, While I stares 'ard an' gives it back to 'im. Then ori at once 'e grips me 'and in 'is: 'Somehow,' 'e sez,' I hkes yer ugly phiz.' C. J. Dennis said a lot in an indirect way about things that happened in this Parliament. I referred to Pilot Cove and thought of the former honourable member for Grayndler, the man who is sadly missed. I thought of him when he put the linger on the young man who is with us tonight: 'Young friend, ""e sez . . . Young friend! Well spare me days! Yey'd think I wus 'is own white-'eaded boyThe queer olefinger,wiv 'is gentle ways. ' Young friend,"" e sez,' I wish't yeh bofe great joy.' I then thought that that was not quite applicable and I went to another C. J. Dennis poem called The Kid and thought of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam). He might say: My son! . . . Them words, just like a blessed song, Is singing' in me 'eart the ole day long; Over an' over; while I'm scared 111 wake Out of a dream, tofindit all a fake. NA Then I thought of years when the Opposition was in Government and I recalled The Glugs of Foundation Gosh: Now, here is a tale of the Glugs of Gosh, And a wonderful tale I ween, Ofthe Glugs of Gosh and their great King Splosh . . . of the I thought of the Labor Government's actions: So the Glugs continued, with greed and glee, To buy cheap clothing, and pills, and tea; Till every Glug in the land of Gosh Owned three clean shirts and a fourth in the wash. But they all grew idle, and fond of ease, And easy to swindle, and hard to please; And the voice of Joi was a lonely voice, When he railed at Gosh for its foolish choice. I was reminded of the loans affair and the appUcable now. I overseas borrowing: And the King of the Glugs gazed around on his land, And saw nothing but stones strewn on every hand: And he said with a desperate look on his face, 'There is nothing so ghastly as stones out of place. And, no doubt, this Og scheme was a very smart dodge. But whom does it profit-m y people, or Podge?' I thought then of Emily Ann, a very appropriate poem for the ears of Government of the AusHouse the Ministralian Labor Party: Government muddled, departments dazed, Fear and confusion wherever he gazed; which - Order insulted, authority spurned, Dread and distraction wherever he turnedOh, the great King Splosh was a sad, sore king, With never a statesman to straighten the thing. Today in the springtime I thought of A Spring Song and the announcement by the Leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions that he was not going to enter Federal Parliament after all. I thought of the poor fellow who said: The world 'as got me snouted jist a treat; Crool Forchin's dirty left 'as smote me soul; An' all them joys o' life I 'eld so sweet Is up the pole. Fer, as the poit sez me 'eart' as got The pip wiv yearnin' fer- I dunno wot. C. J. Dennis captured the topics of the time and I thought perhaps he predicted the course of events of the 3 years of Labor Government when in The Seer he said: Somewhere or other, 'tis doubtful where, In the archives of Gosh is a volume rare, A precious old classic that nobody reads, And nobody asks for, and nobody heeds; Which makes it a classic, and famed thro' the land, As well-informed persons will quite understand. I pay tribute to C. J. Dennis.",96
514,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired. I might even ask the honourable member to try to find later a poem to describe the events of today.,97
515,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT," I must say, with all sad respect, that I find what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) has just said a bit ludicrous. C. J. Dennis was one of the great poets of this country. It is offensive travesty what he wrote. I wish the honourable gentleman had quoted from a poem called The Austra-laise. It was about what were called 'blokes an' coves an' coots'. I am not quite sure in what category the honourable gentleman would fall. The C. J. Dennis centenary- I presume it is the centenary ofhis birth-is being celebrated with, I hope, a certain degree of solemnity, not with the sort of nonsense that was perpetrated a few moments ago. I think this is typical of what passes for a kind of pseudo culture at the moment. Mr Haslem- A comment on society.",97
516,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,It may be a communist orienolation tated society but at least the honourable gentleapparently man should know that we are living in a changlate ing society. The late C. J. Dennis was one who typified the nature of the change of that society. do not know whether the gentleman who has just indulged in that so-called pseudo comic speech saw the recent Australian Broadcasting Comof mission presentation of The Sentimental Bloke a musical form. Perhaps he did not. I suppose was out dining with tycoons on the only night on which the show was shown. Mr Keith Johnson-He might have been at down'Little Lon'.,97
517,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"He may have been down 'Little Lon'. But with great respect I do not quite know why this speech was made tonight, what it was supposed to typify and why it was of such importance that it should have taken the limited time available in this adjournment debate. I have a great respect for C. J. Dennis. At least he was a representative of the working class of this country which still contains the great majority of Australians. When one finds that kind of travesty perpetrated and hears the kind of laughter that accompanies it one is concerned at the levels to which this great Parhament can sink. I say no more about that. But I just wonder what point the honourable member was trying to make.",97
518,Mr ABEL,ADJOURNMENT,"The 18 September is the 166th anniversary of the founding of the independence of the RepubUc of Chile. ChUe has over the past 3 years been the victim of a violent propaganda onslaught throughout the world for having rejected a Marxist regime and for refusing to allow itself to be subverted by the forces of world communism. Only recently, through disruptions and demonstrations in the Senate, this Parliament has had a small sample of the type of campaign being conducted against to ChUe-no t a rational campaign, based on logic and fact, but one of violence and shouting based on the propagation of slogans. Although the Australian Government has very sensibly re-established our diplomatic relations with ChUe to their normal level by appointing a new ambassador, our trade with that country is being disrupted by the action of communist minorities in certain trade unions, particularly the maritime and waterfront unions which have placed a black ban on all trade with ChUe, a black ban I might add which has never been placed on trade with other communist dictatorships. Honourable members opposite would do well to remember that. This action, which is in viof all principles of free trade, responds to the instructions of Moscow to isoand attack Chile on all fronts for the crime of having prevented itself from being totally subI verted by the forces of international communism. This action is extremely contradictory to the attitudes of these same self-proclaimed supporters humanitarianism and peace; it is an attack in against the people of Chile who are denied the he food which Australia can provide by way of wheat; and it is an attack against the Australian rural worker who is denied this market for wheat a time when rural industry is suffering severe hardships. Many Australians are unaware of the reasons that led the Chilean people- a people who throughout the years have become an example of democracy and stabUity in South America-to finally rid themselves of a Marxist regime that had brought this once happy country to the brink of total disaster. It should well be remembered that Salvador Allende, a man elected to office with only 36 per cent of the popular vote, proceeded, upon his election, on a deliberate program to disrupt, overturn and destroy Chile's traditional institutions and resorted to Ulegal methods in violation of that country's constitution. On many occasions his actions were declared by the ChUean Supreme Court, a body internationally respected, to have been in total disregard of that constitution. The Marxists, by a campaign to totally disrupt civic life by the constant preacliing of class warfare, by instigating physical confrontation, led the ChUean economy to the brink of absolute disaster. Inflation jumped from 30 per cent in 1970 to 180 per cent in 1971, 300 per cent in 1972 and, according to the Allende Government's ownfigures,to 504 per cent by September 1973. In fact, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank placed thefigureat 1000 per cent in 1973. During the Allende regime, thousandsMr Antony Whitlam-What is it now?",97
519,Mr ABEL,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Grayndler will be very pleased to know that it has fallen from 1000 per cent to 150 per cent. From a country that was once a food exporter, Chile has become a food importer. The copper industry, the main source of foreign revenue, tottered on the brink of disaster and collapsed. Despite repeated resolutions from the Chilean Congress for Allende to observe the Constitution, this man plunged his country down a Marxist path to chaos and ruin. No wonder the Chilean people, particularly the women, took to the streets to call for the removal of the Marxists. No wonder the armed forces, on the invitation of the Chilean Congress, moved on 11 November 1973 to restore order and stability to that country. I am not going to stand here as an unquestioning admirer of the present government in Chile, but I do not believe in standing here as a hypocrite. I find it sickening and disgusting that the Opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) can heap unbounded praise upon a dictator Uke Chairman Mao and call for ever closer relationships with communist dictators who yet wish to isolate a country like Chile. Just as this Government is reviving the economy of Australia, which was almost destroyed by the Opposition, so the government of ChUe is gradually reviving the economy of that country. Just as this Government is winning the battle against inflation, so the government of Chile has lowered the rate of inflation in that country from 1000 per cent to 180 per cent, and the rate is dropping every month. I want people to know the double standards that are held by members on the Opposition benches, and that is obvious from their interjections tonight. I want to ask them why so many on their side of the House are so intent on destroying the country of ChUe.",98

We have heard in this House tonight a speech by the honourable member for Evans which would have laid bare the bones of other speeches in this House. He made all sorts of allegations about what happened in ChUe, but I would remind him of what happened in Australia on 11 November 1975. I ask him to look at that situation. If there was a reversal of the situation in Chile, at least Allende was elected by the people of Chile. He was overturned by the Central Intelligence Agency and IT & T-the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation-and that has been admitted. Mr Abel-Garbage .",98
530,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,'Garbage' says the honourable member. It is the voice of Knopfelmacher. It is the voice of Santamaria in this chamber.

546,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT," I have some a good news for the House tonight. We have just listened to a lot of nonsense from the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). The good news that I have to give the House tonight is that the Victorian Government has denied to the Australian Conservation Foundation the $5,000 that it has been accustomed to receive. is the best news that I have heard. I want the to be acquainted with this matter, particularly honourable members opposite. The people with this foundation, in my judgment, is have been responsible for some of the worse the industrial sabotage that we have seen in this country in the last 5 years. They are holding up aU uramum development. They are holding up the Newport power house and now, it is announced, they will see what they can do to stop I really the old Newport power house. I wonder how honourable members in Victoria and the people of Victoria are going to get any power whUe this sort of action is tolerated. I that the Victorian Government has set a lead for Australia in isolating the Australian Conservation Foundation for what it is-a n saboteur holding up all industrial development in Australia. I hope that the Federal Government-ou r Government-wil l have a look at the Australian Conservation Founa posdation because it also subsidises that in this chamber. organisation. Every piece of data that it produces works against everything that we are trying to do in stirring the economy, in stimulating people and in trying to get the sons of things that are going to be necessary in the future for providing employment. I hope that our Government takes a serious look at any allocation that it is thinking of making to the Austrahan Conservation Foundation. They are not all communists. I have said that on other occasions. Unfortunately they are people of the 'do good' variety who do not know a great deal about what is necessary for the development of this economy, particularly in terms of power needs. I am afraid that these people are being led by the nose by elements which I can only describe as sinister. If any honourable member wants to have a look at a current issue of the Communist publication called Arena he will see the clear delineation of what the communists and the marxists consider necessary to hold up this country. I draw the attention of the House to this most imponant matter.",99

House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Tax Deductability of Mortgage Interest Rates Dr Jenkins asked the Teasurer, upon nodce: (1) What projections have been carried out to determine the number of taxpayers who will be deprived of tax deductibility of mortgage interest rates as a result of the Govern28 ment's decision to confine the benefit to first home buyers in their first 5 years. (2) Is it a fact that over half a million taxpayers could therightof tax deduction. (3) Does the Government anticipate a net saving in excess of $200m in the 3 years preceding Savings Grant Scheme by denial of tax concessions to existCPI increaseofinwage ing eligible home buyers. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable Commission member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Estimates based on income tax statistics of housing loan interest allowed for the 1974-75 income year indicate that the number of taxpayers who will lose access to tax deductibility of such interest as a result of the decision confine the benefits to first home buyers in the first five of use of the home would be over half a million. (3) The gain to revenue of the restrictions on deductibility is estimated to be about $40m per annum. Mr Les MCMahon asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it the intention of the Government to reduce real wages by persuading the Arbitrauon only half wage indexation. (2) If so, would this result in substantially reduced income tax receipts and thereby increase the deficit. (3) If it is still the intention of the Government to reduce the deficit, why is it advocating action that would have opposite effect. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable these member's question is as follows: (1) In the April hearing of the National Wage Case-th hearing to which the honourable member's question was clearly addressed-the Commonwealth twelve-month period the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should award indexation increases which, having regard to additions to the total wages bill, would amount something like 50 per cent of full indexation. With regard the form of indexation, the Commonwealth's option during the period was that each award rate should be increased by a flat amount arrived at by applying to the minimum wage and full price increase in the reference period, discounted for any increase in indirect taxes (or major increases in import prices) occurring in that period. Had the Government's approach Commission it would, all other things being equal, have had the effect of gradually reducing those real wages above the minimum wage from the inflated level previously risen and which lay turn in activity and growth in unemployment which the economy experienced in 1974 and 1975. NA upon notice were circulated: It is estimated that, had the Government's submission been accepted in full by the Commission, real earnings (Question No. 397) would, on average, have been reduced by between 1 and 1.5 per cent by the December quaner 1976 provided there was litde intensification of wages drift. In the event the decision of the Commission announced on May was equivalent to about 70 per cent of full indexation overall. It therefore had the effect of reducing real wages of those wage and salary earners who at the time of the decision were receiving awards of more than $125 per weeklose that is, to a lesser extent than the Government's preferred option would have involved. Since then a further National Wage Case, to consider the payments under the Home application indexation on account of 2.5 per cent the June quaner, has concluded. In this recent hearing, too, the Commonwealth has urged on the that it grant only partial wage indexation in the interest of a further and speedier winding down in the rate of inflation, to ensure that the process of economic recovery just beginning is in no way thwarted or truncated, and to reverse the past tendency for Australian labour costs to increase faster than the labour costs of our major trading partners. In the to Commonwealth's submission the desirable option would years now have been a wage increase equivalent to something like 30 per cent of full indexation. The Commission's decision, announced on 12 August, was equivalent to a little under 70 per cent of full indexation overall. This implies some reduction in real wages for all Wage Indexation wage and salary earners receiving awards of more than $ 100 (Question No. 493) per week, but as in May not as much reduction as the Government had sought. (2) The National Wage Case decision of 28 May did not have a significant bearing on the Budget aggregates for 1975-76 but will have a 'full year' effect on the Budget estiCommission to award mates for 1976-77. (3) The Government's fundamental aim in economic policy is to wind back the rate of inflation. This cannot be achieved solely through reductions in the level of the deficit. It is necessary to combat inflation on all fronts, including the fiscal, monetary and wages pohcy. Although the Government's approach to wages policy would have gone further than the Commission's decisions of 28 May and 12 August, decisions represented worthwhile steps towards winding down the current rate of inflation of costs and prices and will, it is hoped, through their effects on the inflationary exe pectations both of business and of consumers, assist in the recovery of economic activity and the creation of job submitted that for a opportunities. It would be a curious argument indeed, if the effects of to some economic policies on the deficit were to be used as an to argument against attempting to reduce the current rate of preferred inflation. Destruction of Cargo (Question No. 847) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, been adopted by the upon notice: Will he supply full details of the reasons for quarantine staff recently destroying a number of cartons at Bruck MUls, to which they had Wangaratta, Victoria. at the root of the sharp down",100
548,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Following the discovery of Khapra beetle in the 'Catherine S', all cargo that had been located in the infested holds was traced and inspected. A consignment of viscose yarn from one of these holds had been delivered to Bruck Mills, Wangaratta. On inspection at the premises, one larva and two cast skins were found in the wrapping. The wrapping and cartons were destroyed and the area sprayed. Industries Assistance Commission Reports Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Where the economic information originally submitted to an Industry Assistance Commission hearing relevant at the time of presentation of the draft report, is the Commissioner required to accept updated information. (2) If so, and when a Commissioner information to be presented, or to consider it in his repon, what action can be taken. (3) Has there been unhappiness with the Commission over recommendadons it makes to the Government based on outdated cost, price and impon or export data.",101
549,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One of the reasons for producing draft reports cussing these reports at public nesses to present any later information they had and considered relevant. Commissioners are not compelled to accept specific pieces of they normally try to obtain as much relevant information as is available up to the time at which they sign the There must, however, be a point ticable to receive further information. This is particularly so where the Commission's reports are subject to reporting deadlines. (2) See answer to question (1). (3) I am not aware of any such unhappiness. Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to newspaper reports urging Federal action on the youth unemployment problem. (2) Can he say whether the Deputy Principal of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology has offered facilides for a conference on this matter. (3) As people younger than 20 years old comprise 12 per cent of the workforce but almost 40 per cent of the unemployed, will he look into such offers and the problems which giveriseto them. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. It is a matter which is of great concern to Government. I have asked my Department to do all it can within existing programs and resources to stimulate employ the ment opportunities for young people and to assist them in every way to find employment. The need for addidonal Government initiatives is being closely examined by my panment within the context of the Government's overall economic strategy. (2) I understand that the Acting Melbourne Institute of Technology offered the use of its facilities for a public meeting which was held on 31 August 1976. The meeting considered the problems of youth unemployment. My Department was represented at the meeting. (3) Yes. The honourable member can be assured that appropriate initiatives taken by the community will receive ready cooperation and assistance from my Depanment. International Labour Conference (Question No. 1026) (Question No. 912) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons, upon notice: How did the Australian Government delegates vote on the instruments adopted at the Sixty-First (1976) Session of the is no longer International Labour Conference. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: refuses to allow this The 61st (1976) Session of the International Labour Conference adopted 2 instruments concerning tripartite consultation: Tripartite Consultation (Internauonal Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144) Tripartite Consultation (Activities of the International Labour Organisauon) Recommendation, 1976 (No. 152) The Australian Government delegates at the Conference and disvoted in favour of the adoption of both instruments. hearings, was to allow witavailable International Labour Organisation Conventions (Question No. 1027) information at their inquiries, but Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Emreports. ployment and Industrial Relauons, upon notice: beyond which it is not prac(1) What order of priority did the Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers set in 1973 for their consideration of unratified ILO Conventions involving State jurisdiction (Hansard, 24 August 1976, page 517). (2) Which of those Conventions have they since considered, and on what dates, in what form and with what result. Unemployment (Question No. 987) Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers agreed in 1973 that unratified ILO Conventions involving State jurisdiction and warranting further consideration should be divided into the following order of priority: (a) top priority-wher e the aim is to ratify as quickly as possible and includes Conventions which deal with questions of very important principle. (b) priority-wher e ratification at an early stage is the objective though considerable action may be required including new policy initiatives. (c) keep under review-wher e ratification is a longer term objective and there may be extensive technical problems to be overcome. (2) International labour matters including ILO Conventhe tions is a standing item on the agenda of the twice yearly meetings of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers. As honourable member will be aware, the Ministers' meetings are the third tier of the Commonwealth/State consultative machinery on ILO matters and the Ministers consider Derecommendations which come forward from the other 2 tiers of the machinery: the technical officers (ie ILO action officers) and Permanent Heads of the Commonwealth and Principal of the Royal State Departments. The consultative machinery has devoted its attention principally to those Conventions allocated to the top priority category. In 1973 the Ministers agreed that the following Conventions should be accorded top priority for ratification: No. 81-Labou r Inspection, 1947 No. 100-Equa l Remuneration, 1951 No. 107-Indigenou s and Tribal Populations, 1957 No. 119-Guardin g of Machinery, 1963 No. 135-Workers'Representatives , 1971 Since then Australia has ratified Conventions Nos 81 (24.6.75) and 100 (10.12.74) and early ratification of Convention No. 107 is dependent upon the agreement of one State. As regards Conventions Nos 119 and 135, some progress has been made but further progress is required before Australia will be in a position to ratify. The operation of the consultative machinery has made a positive contribution towards the improvement of, Australia's ratification record of ILO Conventions and to the promotion of the acceptance of international labour standards in Australia. At their most recent meeting (3 September 1976), the Ministers decided that their officers should review the order of priority agreed upon in 1973.",102
