1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J - S. Eosevear) took the cbair nt 10.30/ a.m., and read prayers Mr ER&XCIS;^-Oyer a . pexiod of - : years; by speeches andquestions, without) notice in this House, and', by - correspon: dence with Ministers-, I have - endeavouredto persuade ' the. Government-- to take, a; practical interest in the prevent tion of thespread' of* the. buffalo-., fly down the southern coast of Queenin lend - Honourable gentlemen opposite may laugh, hutthis ie not a matter for: hilarity. It is causing the graziers of-' southern Queensland and northern-New. South ""Wales a great deal, of'concern. 1now ask the Minister in. charge of the Council for Scientific and - Industrial Research whether ae will take steps to ensure that adequate supplies of DDT shallhe - made available to; producers through a government department or. otherwise, and also whether, through the council, he will ensure provision b:\ a. sni.ta.ble dip to deal, simultaneously with the' buffalo fly and ctttlo tick! Will ho alsotake steps to provide that the. whole or a part of the coat, of the DDT. will be. boi-ne by the Government; in' view, of the fact that the fly entered Queensland from the Northern Territory ?",11
2,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"It is troe that this subject has been raised from time to time hy the honourable member. I believe that on one occasion ho moved the adjourn T njent of, the House is order to discuss it. The .buffaio Â£y has been in Australia for a very long timo. During the periodthat Governments supported by the"" honourable gentlemanwere in office, no steps were taken to deal with it. The Queensland Government, on which responsibility rests in 'thismat Mr is doing everything it can do to retard the spread of the fly. Theresponsibility of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is to undertake: research intothe problem, and this has been done on nn extensive scale. The council has elaborated a method' to. deal with the buffalofly on dairy and tb'at'method is now beextended, to cattle, stations: I hare visited the affected areas in Queensland, on two occasions, and havemade inspections of the station being conducted by the Council lor 'Scientific ' andIndustrial- ' Research. I found that ail the farmers were loud in their praises of the efforts of the council to deal with the pest. The honourable gentleman seems to consider that the council is a trading organization which should acquire supplies of DDT and make them available to farmers. That is not one of its functions - In fact, the Commonwealth Government has no power to produce or acquire DDT for sale to farmers. The honourable member may rest assured that this Government is taking all the necessary steps to make good the deficiencies of previous governments in the matter. ARMED FOEOES. ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE. . i i r . JAMES - I ast the Acting Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that thousands' of members of the forces were absent without leave at the termination of the war, and that following his announcement that no further' attempt would be made to apprehend them, although . many of them did not see active service, they have heen - discharged tn absentia? Does not the Minister consider, that those who saw active service overseas and are still serving sentences in detention, camps for a similar offence should be immediately discharged, or accorded similar treatment?",11
3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The decision to discharge those men who' were absent without leave before the 31st .December, 1945, was made some time ago by the AdjutantGeneral. As the result of that policy, about 8,000 men were discharged in absentia and their discharge certificates, if the'men apply for them, will be so endorsed. A decision was also made that all. those who were undergoing detention, should be discharged after they had served one-third of the period of their sentence. As a result, the number in detention camps- I am not able to give lihe exact figure offhand - and the personnel required to guard them have heen considerably reduced. X assure the honourable gentleman that the Government has carefully considered this leniency, having due regard to the fact that the war has ended and the necessity for maintaining discipline among those still serving in the forces in Australia and the islands. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. VOCATIONAL TRAINING .",12
4,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"^-A correspondent has written to me that his son enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force at the age of 20 years and 6 months, hut was not called up until he was 21 years and 1 month. His application - for reconstruction training in carpentry has been rejected. He was five years in the Air Force, and served overseas. I ask the Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction whether provision could be made for men in that position to' be given training in a trade ?",12
5,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The conditions of eligibility for reconstruction training are laid down in order to limit the trainees to the numbers that can be handled with the available facilities in Australia. I have dealt with this matter on previous occasions. Honourable members will realise that as nearly 1,000,000 persons served in our fighting forces, it would be impossible to provide reconstruction training for all of them.",12
6,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"All of them, do not require training.",12
7,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"That is true; but because of the necessity to restrict the number in accordance with the facilities available, certain conditions of eligibility have been prescribed, relating to the age of individuals and the capacity of various industries to absorb them. If an individual has sustained any injury during the war, and as a result of the disability is unable to follow his pre-war occupation, - if any, he is entitled to reconstruction training, regardless of his age. If the honourable member will supply complete details of the case, I shall have it investigated. BROADCASTING. SERIAL "" THE LAWSOKTS "" .",12
8,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"Has the Prime : Minister ever listened j*> the serial "" The Lawsons"", which is broadcast over station 2BL? It purports to be an Australian play depicting the Australian wa; of life, and the performance is a com- bination of the worse features of Oxford and adenoids.' Did the right honourable gentleman hear the broadcast over station 2BL at supper time last night. recounting the attempt of the Lawson family to huy a business from a man named Sorenson, who gave as his reason for selling, high taxation and industrial unrest? Is this the political news which the Liberals complain is broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission ? Will the right honourable gentleman ascertain, if possible, how much is paid to ""stooges"" to'write such attacks on the Government into the scripts of the Australian Broadcasting Commission ? 1",12
9,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I assure the honourable member that I did not hear the broadcast at supper time last night. Nor have I heard the serial at any time since it has been on the air. I do not acknowledge, that it is appropriate that radio scripts should be used as a propaganda medium over 2BL, or national stations, generally.",13
10,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Propagand a is broadcast from this House.,13
11,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On e does not expect any better from this House. But one does expect that the national broadcasting stations will refrain from making comments which might be regarded as providing fuel for attacks on the Government by the Opposition, no matter what government is in power. Perhaps all this is a part of the political game. I shall have inquiries made, and request national broadcasting stations to refrain from doing things of this character, or being a party to their being done. Later:",13
12,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Las t week attacks were made under privilege in this House upon individuals employed by the AusArmy tralian Broadcasting Commission. The news .editor of the commission was the subject of one such attack. Early this morning an attack was made on the that writer of a serial "" The Lawsons "", which, as the Prime Minister is probably aware, has been on the air for more than two years.",13
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,I heard of it only this morning.,13
14,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"If the Prime Minfarmers ister resided in the country and not in Canberra, he would be aware that "" The Lawsons"" is one of the most popular requirements ? broadcasting ' items of the day in country districts. The serial is the work of a charming lady, Miss Gwen Meredith. I ask the Prime Minister whether he condones such attacks on employees of a government instrumentality who have no opportunity to protect their reputations. Does the right honourable gentleman approve of employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission being described as "" stooges"" if they comment in a way not favourable to the propaganda of the Australian Labour party?",13
15,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I heard the debate this morning on the Australian Broadcasting Bill. I did not notice any particularly hurtful criticism. People who broadcast matter on subjects of public controversy must. expect to be criticized. I am assuming that what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) said this morning in regard to "" The Lawsons "" was true. If that be so, it did not seem to me to be appropriate matter for broadcasting over the national stations. The issues raised are the subject of constant controversy in this House.. I can understand that if a person is slandered in any way he would feel aggrieved. I would not stand for that kind of thing for a moment. As to other criticism, it seems to me that we are becoming far too sensitive. NA",13
16,Mr ABBOTT,WIRE AND WIRE NETTIN G,"Las t April, there were extensive floods on the lower north-coast ' of New South Wales, and the fencing of many farmers was washed away. I understand that supplies of wire and wire netting, were made available from stocks to the floodrelief committees set up by the Government of New South Wales, and were distributed among the farmers. I have been informed, however, the Army has repossessed a considerable quantity of the wire and wire netting that was released recently from its stocks, and has diverted it to the use of the occupation force in Japan. If that has been done, will the Minister fbr the Army ensure that further supplies will be provided as soon as possible to those who. for more than four months, have suffered damage because of"" floods, and have not been able to obtain their ' Mr Forde - The honourable member's statements will be fully and sympathetically considered, with a view to his wishes being met, if possible. DAIRYING INDUSTRY. SWEET CREAM..",13
17,Mr FRASER,WIRE AND WIRE NETTIN G,"I address a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, relating to the payment of subsidy on sweet cream. I appreciate.the information which the honourable gentleman has already supplied to me, governingrthe position in.the butter-producing districts. This question concerns the position in the districts which supply whole milk to the metropolitan area. By way of explanation, I point out that when the original arrangement was made for the payment of a subsidy to the suppliers of whole milk, nothing was done in regard to sweet cream. Evidently, because of the prohibition - of the use of cream, so little was being used that it was not thought tq .be worth troubling about. Since then, however, the use of cream has increased as people have, and quite rightly, become aware of the conditions under which cream can be obtained by medical prescription. Thus, an item which was previously unimportant, has now assumed importance for those who supply whole milk. Can the Minister say why a subsidy should not be paid on sweet cream, seeing that it costs as niuoh to produce the milk from which, it comes as to produce milk sold in the form of whole milk, and seeing that the farmer does not know from week to week how much of his milk he will have to separate ? Finally, seeing that sweet cream is used for the benefit of those requiring medical treatment, - is there any reason why farmers should be penalized in respect to that part of product which is used to help the Should not the burden be borne fairly the whole of the community through the electoral rolls. payment of a subsidy?",14
18,Mr SCULLY,WIRE AND WIRE NETTIN G,"I regret that the answer supplied to the honourable memof ber did not cover the point now raised by him. .The milk stabilization scheme is operated by the Prices Commissioner, and I shall take the matter up with [ realise the justice bf the honourable member's claim, and appreciate that, at' all times, he is anxious to protect the interests of the primary producers in his electorate-. NA WAR. DE-PENDANTS' ALLOTMENTS.",14
19,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister for the Army, in his capacity as' Acting Minister for Defence, because it concerns members of the.Air' Force as well as soldiers. I previously asked two questions on this subject, and the reply of the Minister was that the questions would receive prompt consideration and replies to them would be made before the rising of Parliament. This final session will end within a few hours. The questions which I asked wereWill the Minister for the Army reply at an early date to two requests that I have made to him from time to time, by letter and in questions in this House, namely, first, that allotments paid between the dates on which a prisoner of war was posted as missing and when he was presumed to be dead, be no longer deducted from the estates of the deceased men; and secondly, when will the subject of pay in lieu of furlough be adjusted, so that'the depen dants of those who died before the date in : 1945 fixed by War Cabinet will no longer be deprived of this pay? I know of many cases in which extreme hardship has been, inflicted upon thf dependants of such prisoners of war",14
20,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Althoug h only a few hours remain before the Parliament adjourns, I assure the honourable member that I shall take steps to obtain the necessary information so that the promisp made to him may be honoured. GENERAL ELECTIONS. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",14
21,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"by leave-Earlier their in the week the honourable member for sick?. Cook (Mr Sheehan) asked a question by relating to the issue of Commonwealth Under the standing ministerial' authority a member of the House of Representatives is authorizedto receive without charge fifteen copies each new print of the electoral roll for his division, while a senator is authorized to receive fifteen copies for each division of his State. Under the same authority him.. a non-member candidate contesting an election for the House of Representatives is authorized' to receive six copies of the : roll for the division concerned, and senator candidate contesting a Senate election six copies of the roll for each division of the State. In the case of senators and candidates at a Senate election the existing issue appears to be adequate, hut in the case of members of the House of Representatives and nonmember candidates at House of Representatives elections, an increase of the number of rolls supplied is, I believe, warranted. I have accordingly approved of increases of from fifteen to 21 copies the case of a member of the House of Representatives, and from six to nine copies in the case of a non-member candidate at a House of Representative's election. Arrangements will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer for the distribution of the additional copies upon request. THE PARLIAMENT. ALLOCATION OF ACCOMMODATION.",14
22,Mr SHEEHY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Do you, Mr Speaker, propose to make any arrangements to increase the size of the Government party room in the House ? At present the .room is occupied by .25 members and is greatly overcrowded. In view of the fact that the number of Labour party members be increased greatly at the elections, you take steps to provide additional for their accommodation?",15
23,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I think the honorwhether able member should give notice of that question. TRADESMEN'S RIGHTS REGULATION BILL . PERIOD or ELIGIBILITY FOB BENEFITS.,15
24,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"In the absence of the Minister for Labour and National Service I address a question to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. absence - of the former Minister makes it necessary for me to make a short explanation of the question, ft is, however, one in which the Railways Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, as the Minister responsible for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, is vitally interested. During the debate on the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill, I moved an amendment which, if carried, would have had the effect of extending, the period during which a .member of the a non- forces who desired to receive training as a probationary tradesman or a trainee tradesman could make application for .such training from six months after the 22nd March, 1946, or six months after his discharge, to the 30ih June, 1947, or twelve months after disr charge, whichever was the later. I then stated that I believed it to be a fact that the period of eligibility under the reconstruction training scheme had been similarly extended. TheMinister for in .Labour and .National Service stated that the Government would examine the proposal fully with a view to the introduction of a suitable amendment when the bill was before the Senate. Was such an amendment made when the bill was before the Senate? If not, did the Minister examine the proposal fully, as he undertook to do? Is it not a fact that the period of eligibility of applicants for benefits underthe, reconstruction training scheme has been extended to cover the dates I have mentioned, and will the same principle be applied under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill""? Mr -.DEDMAN - It is true that the date of eligibility for Commonwealth reconstruction training has been extended will by my department. I sympathize with will the honourable member's proposal, but I space am not aware whether it was examined before the bill went to the Senate or an amendment that would give effect to it was made in that qhamber. I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Labour and National Service, and if it is possible to meet his request it shall be met.",15
25,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Will the Minister tell me the result?,15
26,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Yes . The WHEAT INDUSTRY. . STOCK FEED...,15
27,Mr BREEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have received from the Secretary of the New South Wales a letter replying to questions about railway transport from the central west, in which he told me that he was having great difficulty in supplying immediate demands. A statement appeared on his behalf in the press that the New South Wales railways would .have great difficulty in lifting wheat - from the Australian Wheat Board and the difficulty would be aggravated by the need to supply transport for starving stock. In view of that position, will the Prime Minister consider the purchase from the Australian ""Wheat Board by the Government of that wheat in order that it might be retained in the district for use as stock feed? The railways may'not be ""able to lift the wheat until half way through next year, by which time the rice crop will be coming forward in Eastern countries, whose present demand for wheat will accordingly diminish. As it is impossible otherwise to feed the stock the possibility exists of stock losses equal to those incurred during the drought two years ago when 10,000,000 sheep were lost. The value of the wool lost then was equal to Â£10,000,000.",15
28,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,What is the question?,16
29,Mr BREEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the right honourable gentleman consider allocating sufficient money from the Consolidated Eevenue or some other source to purchase the wheat for use as stock feed rather tban risk losing the sheep, and the wool representing Â£10,000,000 worth of foreign exchange?",16
30,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I shall discuss the suggestion with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and arrange for its careful consideration. WAR GEATUITY. FOBMS FOB HOME-BTJILDINQ.,16
31,Dame ENID LYONS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Is the Prime Minister aware that although machinery, for the use of the war gratuity for building came into force on the.lst ex-servicemen in Tasmania are deprived of benefit because the application forms have not arrived? Can the right honour and able gentleman say whether,- in view the heading of an article in the Hobart Mercury, ""There Will Always be a Form"", the Government will set up department of form procurement?",16
32,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Some time ago the procedure to be followed by applicants for war gratuity for use in financing matter? the building of homes was announced. I have not heard of any complaints that the machinery is not working smoothly Arrangements were made to send the application forms to the principal post offices. Applicants must apply through approved bodies, the list of which was' published, in order that they may have their applications approved expeditiously. I shall. have an examination made of the whole position and if delayare occurring they will be rectified. GALVANIZED IRON.",16
33,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am informed that, because of transport restrictions, about 1,000 tons of galvanized iron which has accumulated at Lysaghts works in Newcastle cannot be transported to places in New South Wales or in other States where it is needed. I ask the Minister for Works and Housing whether, as galvanized iron is urgently needed for housing projects at Newcastle, some of the accumulated stocks at Lysaghts may bfmade'available for housing projects there, as transport for this purpose can be provided \",16
34,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am aware thai there has been an accumulation of stock? at Newcastle. I shall advise the honor-' able gentleman whether allocations can be made as he has suggested. There is a shortage of galvanized iron all over Australia, and we are endeavouring, to arrange transport of supplies to places where the iron is most needed. .(REPATRIATION. j TOOLS OF TRADE.",16
35,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"If has been brought to my notice that although provision has been made for a grant, and homealso for loans to discharged serviceAugust, men for the purchase of tools of trade to rehabilitate themselves, the men cannot obtain the tools they need consequently, are not able satisfacof torily to rehabilitate themselves. I am ""also aware that many tools-necessary for use on farms cannot be purchased. Will a the Minister for Repatriation state, whether greater supplies of tools can be made available, and will he say generally what is. being done in regard to this",16
36,Mr FROST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Ex-serviceme n receive a free gift of Â£10 for the purchase of - tools, and may apply for an advance of up to Â£40, free of interest, for the same purpose. The Government has purchased large stocks of tools that have become available. Some of tbese would bave been used in the armed forces bad the war continued. .The tools bave been distributed to the best advantage. Certain tools, however, are extremely difficult to obtain. The Government is endeavouring to secure supplies from other parts of the world. In fact, more tools are being made available to ex-servicemen than to the general public. I assure 'the honourable member that every endeavour is being made to meet all requirements. SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1946-47. SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed from the 6th August (vide page 3729), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",16
37,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Wentworth) .[11.7]. - The purpose of this measure is to supply for another two months, which will cover the election period and the time necessary to enable the new Government to take over the affairs of the country. It is. usual, on the occasion of the introtime duction of a Supply Bill for honourable members to criticize Government adminthat istration and various departmental actions. I do not propose to follow that course today, for it is recognized that supply must be granted to cover the election period;' but there is ample justification for criticism of the extravagance unsound financial practices of the vernment, and other honourable members may wish to speak on those subjects. I desire to refer to a matter arising from the tabling of the Conde report on the Salvage Commission for which I asked earlier this week.. Prom what I can learn from my examination of the document, the terms of reference were, given to Mr Conde last February. The inquiry was ordered following possession, charges which the Leader of the Austions, tralian Country party (Mr Fadden) and I had made regarding the operations of the Salvage Commission and with' regard to the disposal of refrigerators, motor cycles, motor vehicles, army foodstuffs, tools and equipment. _ The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) considered that the charges were sufficiently serious to warrant an investigation. The terms of reference, as I read them, gave to Mr. Conde the opportunity to make the most exhaustive inquiry into the charges, but I am amazed to discover that he did not so regard them. He treated this inquiry in a most cavalier fashion. He evidently placed on the terms of reference an interpretation that all he had to do was to whitewash the Government and obliterate with a liberal coating of whitewash the charges which we had made. Strange as it may seem, Mr Conde did not interview the members of the Advisory Board on the Salvage Commission, who had specifically asked for an opportunity to give evidence on oath. My statements in the House, and the correspondence which I read in relation to this matter, he brushed lightly aside. The Minister stated that he would give to the members of the Advisory board an opportunity to state before the investigator grant the complaints that they had made in writing to me, but Mr Conde ignored the undertaking. He did not even attempt to ascertain from me what information I had to support my charges. At no during the inquiry did he establish contact with me and I do not believe he interviewed the Leader of the Australian Country party.",17
38,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,He did not.,17
39,Mr HABBISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Therefore, Mr. and Conde could not have been aware of what Goevidence the Leader of the Australian Country party and I had to support our charges, and what evidence could be obtained from members of the Advisory' Board. Yet he reported to the Government that, after baving examined the files of the department, he could not see any reason why he should proceed with the inquiry. I propose further to support my charges .and place before the House documents which I have in my including statutory declaraletters from responsible firms in Sydney, and charges made by officers of the commission itself. Thia is evidence which Mr Conde should have obtained from me. All the papers were available to him, but he was not desirous of having an inquiry into the matter. His aim was to confirm what he believed was the direction of the Government in thia rpgard, and be effectively carried out the duty that he assigned to himself. page 2 of the report, he statesDepartmental records and documentary evidence tendered enabled me to examine closely the allegations which are the subject of the foregoing terms of reference. On the other hand, however, the statements made by the right honourable A. W. Fadden, M.P., and honourable E. J. Harrison, M.P., were not specific in detail, and because of their generalizacerned. tion the task of verification or otherwise tremely difficult, Mr Conde was appointed to inquire into charges which were made in general terms in this House. Obviously, when honourable members make certain allegations here, they do not desire to reveal the source of their information. However, we were prepared to give the necessary evidence on oath before Mr. Conde, so that the persons whom we held responsible should have an opportunity also to testify on oath in an attempt to refute those charges. Mr Conde complained that we did not give specinc details, and that because of our generalizations-, the task of verification was extremely difficult. He could have verified every one of the charges which we had made in the House-if he had complied with his terms of reference and taken evidence on oath from the Leader of the Australian Country' party and myself. As a matter of fact, Kfr. Conde did not call any witnesses. It is. true that he visited certain firms which I had mentioned, and I had to give instructions to. the omployers to insist that, if Mr Conde decided to ask questions of them they should claim the right to be sworn.",17
40,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"How could the honorHe able member "" instruct"" the members firms?",18
41,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Perhaps I should have said that I advised the employers reportedthat, , in my opinion, they should not answer any questions by Mr Conde unless Company, he was prepared to take evidence from thpm on oath. Surely a witness has the Sydney, right to be sworn, and to insist that other witnesses shall also be sworn. Mr Conde withstanding had authority to verify every statement or record of an which we made in this House, but he be found. failed miserably to exercise his powers under the terms of reference. He reported(a.) Hot water system - I can find no conclusive evidence' that an offer of Â£150 made for the hot water system, notwithstandThe On ing that the person who alleges he made the verbal offer has since confirmed in writing that he did make such an offer. The Ministry of Munitions has no record of the offer, and, in a written statement, the particular oflicer concerned states that he cannot recall any such offer being made to him. the I have the names of the persons conI have mentioned some of the is ex-' names in this House. Mr Conde could have called before him responsible officers of the department and other persons, and taken evidence from them on oath. He would then have been able to determine whether or not the statements were accurate. But he was too eager to side-step a legitimate inquiry, and to give the Government what it wanted. He succeeded in closing the inquiry as quickly as possible - That is what he has said in his reportThis resolves itself into a matter of one man's word against another. Whilst there is a possibility that an offer of Â£150 could have been made, the question as to whether it was, or was not made, is not in my opinion a matter of importance. Surely he was in duty bound to satisfy himself as to which man's word was correct!",18
42,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Did he hear both men?,18
43,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"He did not call any witnesses. He merely moved round, had a look at the various files, and satisfied himself that they were correct. He made no attempt to learn, whether the Leader of the Australian Country party and I could place before him sufficient evidence to warrant, his full attention. did not approach either the Leader of of the Australian Country party or - myself at any stage of his inquiry. On the subject of work benches, he has A representative of the Consolidated Metals' Auburn, claims that he wrote out an offer at the Ministry of Munitions Office, which it is-alleged the Chief Disposals Officer rejected on the grounds that the company was not engaged on defence work. Notexhaustive search, no - trace the original written offer can. I have before me certain information which it may be well that I should read to the House-; it relates to the letters .was referred to by Mr Conde in hisreport. first letter refers to the sum of Â£150; which, it will be remembered, was mentioned in connection with a hot water system. It was sent to me by Mr Kerry, who was the disposals officer in the Department of Munitions, in a letter dated the 28th September, 1945, - in these termsWith reference to your charges in connection with the Disposals Commission, reported in Daily Telegraph of 20th September, 1945. I wish to advise that. 1 was the disposals officer concerned,, and I did receive an offer of Â£150 for the hot water heater and Â£10 each for the work benches. The same day as your charges were reported in the press, a departmental inquiry was commenced to ascertain if they were true. I was "" put on the mat"", practically accused of being the "" traitor in the camp "" who had informed you This I denied, as I have never met you and. had disclosed no information to anyone outside the department, though at the time it icas common talk in our section. Although Mr Conde has reported, "" This resolves itself into a matter of one man's word against another"", and the officer concerned said that he did not make an offer, this letter from Mr Kerry states that he received an offer of Â£1501 That he did so is proved by this letter, signed by Mr J . TreacyWith reference to various articles inspected by me on the 15th March last at Villawood, amongst which was a 900-galloncopper hot water system, together with stand, hot and cold water taps. I wish to confirm the fact that 1 made an offer of Â£150 for the heater to Mr.' Kerry, who introduced me to Mr Cohen at the time of the offer - of the Mr Kerry mentioned the fact that he would have to tell Mr Cohen, and as' Mr Cohen was there he introduced me and submitted the offer. Mr Cohen inferred that the price was too low, as they could get more at an auction sale, thereby rejecting the offer. In view of the offer being turned down verbally I did not proceed further to confirm the matter in writing. That places beyond all reasonable doubt, first, that Mr Treacy made the offer; and secondly, that Mr Kerr y received it . Yet Mr Conde has said in his reportI can find no conclusive evidence that an offer of Â£150 was made for the hot-water system, notwithstanding that the person who alleges he made the verbal offer has since confirmed in writing that he did make such an offer. The Ministry of Munitions has no record of the offer, and, in a written statement, the particular officer concerned states that he cannot recall any such offer being made to him. The offer was made verbally. Even the disposals officer was not called before Mr . Conde to give evidence, although in a letter, to me he has said that he was ihe responsible officer who received the offer. A similarposition exists in connection ' with work benches. It is made perfectly clear, in a letter from Consolidated Metals Proprietary Limited, that it made an offer. The letter readsWith reference to my offer of l l t h April last concerning six work benches at Â£5. each located at No. 2 Store, Villawood, and which, offer was rejected as being too low. I wish to confirm that approximately one week later 1 submitted in writing to Mr Kerry a fresh offer of ten pounds (Â£10) each. Subsequently, I was informed two days later by phone by Mr Kerry that this offer was rejected by Mr Cohen, on the grounds that we were not engaged on defence work and that the .benches were to be sold at auction at Villawood. Thereupon I dropped the matter, as 1 couid - not afford the time to compete against dealers. Yet Mr..Conde has reported that, notwit'hstanding an exhaustive search, no. trace of the original written offer could be found. Of course, no trace could be found, hecause the offer was made verbally. But it was subsequently, confirmed by -' letter. Mr Conde could have satisfied himself as to whether this firm or Mr . Kerr y was telling the truth, by the simple expedient of calling them before him and taking evidence from them on oath. He did neither. Another matter is referred to in No. 5 terms of reference. In regard to the alleged victimization of Mr Geoffrey Eudra M a r n i Kerry, Mr Conde saidAfter a very careful perusal of the files, which includes a signed statement, made by Geoffrey Eudra Marni Kerry, I am of the definite opinion that there is no foundation whatsoever in the allegation that there was improper dismissal or victimization of Mr. Kerry. I have here a copy of a statutory declaration made by Mr Kerry, and I understand that, certain penalties are incurred by any one who makes a false declaration of that kind. I ask leave to have the declaration incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.",18
44,Mr HABBISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The declaration is as follows:I , Marine Kerry, of North Sydney, salesman, do solemnly and sincerely declare: 1. On the'20th September, 1945, a .report of Mr Harrison's speech in Parliament dealing with munitions disposals was drawn to my notice and 1 noticed that several of the articles mentioned were ones I had handled, particuleaving larly work benches and hot water heater. 2. Later that morning, a Mr 8. 6. Cohen, Chief Disposals Officer, called me into his office and showed me the cutting. He then referred to the disclosure of information from within the department and drew my attention to the penalties, producing at the same time a copy Mr Byrne then said, "" Have you got your terof the National Security Regulations. He then said, "" Did you disclose this inPlease formation to Mr Harrison 1 "" I replied, "" most certainly did not,"" He then said, "" It very queer - that Mr Harrison has all the figures correct and he could only have obtained them from someone very closely associated with the deal"". I again replied, "" I did inform Mr Harrison."". 3. Later that morning, the Liquidation Officer, a Mr Hannelly, called me Present were Mr Cohen, Mr Curran (in charge of Auction Sales), and myself. Mr. Hannelly cross-examined me about the report and finally asked me if I had been to Mr. Harrison. Again I replied, ""Emphatically ' No ' . "" I then'drew Mr Hannelly's attention to the fact that I had brought the Sydney Morning Herald advertisement offering the heater at Â£250 to him, purely on academic terest. Mr Hannelly said, "" That was so"". Mr Hannelly then requested me to make a port on the heater nnd benches and submit him, which I did on the 21st September last. 4. Mr Cohen, did' say to certain people the top of his voice, "" I have a traitor in section and I know who he is, ""-. As a result, Cohen. X was given the cold shoulder in certain quarters. 5. On Tuesday night the 25th September, Or about 5 p.m., the administrative officer formed me that Mr Sharpe, the Staff I spector, wished to see me at once. Mr. Sharpe then informed me that my services would be terminated from 12th October, 1945. I then asked him whether this action was because T was accused of bejng an informer traitor and he replied, "" No "" , but that private treaty has now been completed, a number of others would be getting their disenough miss!) 1 notices. (1. On ' Friday, the 28th September, I instrneted to report to Mr Hannelly's office at about 10.45 a.m., and Mr Hannelly handed me my .dismissal notice expiring on the 12th Ot'tolier. While I was discussing it Mr Tiyrne came into the office and I got up and left. About fifteen minutes later. I was again instructed to go to Mr Han'-elly's office and Byrne was still present. Mr Byrne asked me to"" sit down and then said Mr Hannelly been tel'ins bim of the trouble and asked to tell the whole story. I detailed the facts leadii'or up to.the offers and the rcieetions Mr Cohen. I then informed Mr Byrne that a comTnnnication had been sent to Mr HarriI son ""askins for a letter clearing my name. Byrne renlied. "" I wish yon had not done that as the department .may become involved."" replied tbnt sucb action h&d been forced on me by the hiffh-haoded action of his senior officers and I felt I was-being"" made a political Mr Harrison. }at. I then told him I had intended to resign in any case during October and I objected to the department under a cloud. Mr Byrne then said, "" I am going to ask you a question which I want you to reply to on your word of honour. Did you inform Mr Harrison of the matter referred to in the press ?"" 1 replied, '- I did not and have never met the man, either directly or indirectly in my life."" mination notice with you? I believe you. let me have it . "" I handed it to him, h* I read it through and then said, "" I would bf s glad if you would disregard this notice and 1 promise you 1 will look into the whole matter very thoroughly. Now you have told mc, you had intended to resign, in any case, can you not give me any idea when you are likely to be leaving us."" 1 replied, "" the 19th October and he said, "" Will you please let me have Â« to his office. memorandum to that effect."" 7. About 3.45 p.m. .the same day, I wa, again summoned to Mr Byrne's office', present Byrne, Pattison, Sharpe, Hannelly and myself. Mr Byrne said he had. been looking over the papers in connection with my case and. had come to the conclusion that, although I had confirmed my previous statements, he wa*' satisfied that offers had been made as I had insaid, but the fact remained that offers could not have been accepted because the firms were reoutside the munitions block. He also said it to he felt sure no good would come from anv further inquiry as he knew ill-feeling existed at between Cohen and myself and did no.t think my any direct accusation could be proved against 8. On or about 4.45 p.m. the same day, I was again summoned to Mr Byrne's office, when on Mr Hannelly was also present. Mr B y r w inthen said, after my five vears service, he hoped n - I would notleave with any hard feelings towards, the department. I .then said that, while he and Mr Hannelly knew of Mr Harri son's letter, the floor did not know of it , and still had doubts and looked askance at me. 1 and think I said that Mr Cohen should apologize as publicly and clear-my name. Mr Byrne then said, "" I agree with you and if he is not man to do it , I will do it for him."" He also instructed Mr Hannelly to be present. I left was about 5.10 p.m. and Mr Cohen went in . 9. On Tuesday, the 2nd October, I showed Mr Hannelly the letter from Mr Harrison, and said I was going down to show it to Mr. Byrne. 10. On Wednesday night, the 3Td October at Mr 4.50 p.m., Mr Cohen and Mr Hannelly came into the section, called the staff together, when had Mr Cohen apologized for his part in the me matter and Mr Hannelly supported him on behalf of the department. Earlier, Mr Cohen by wanted to apologize privately in his office, and accepted in renly their apology, and said that hoped certain officers would be more careful Mr in future before they decided an innocent man was guilty of an offence, without giving hima I chance to prove his innocence. 11. The next day, the 4th October,' Mr . Harrison's further statement in the HouBjt scapeappeared in the evening newspapers. 12. The next morning, Mr Byrne sent for me and produced a teleprinter of the speech. He said he had .to 'draft a reply immediately and - could I assist him which of Mr . Harrison's statements were correct.Â» I replied that, except for certain minor details, in the main it was all correct. It was rushed on me, and I had not time ,to consider whether or not I had informed Mr Harrison of all the details as stated, but on reading a printed copy of the speech later, except as stated for a few minute details, such as reference to the staff superintendent, instead of senior officer, the main facts were correct. 13. Later, when speaking to Mr Byrne, I . referred to the apology on the Wednesday. Mr. Byrne then denied that any apology had been made and called Mr Hannelly down. Mr. Hannelly said, "" What have I got to apologize to you for."" Both then adopted an aggressive attitude. . t 14. At the time of the said offers, private treaty was definitely in force which was on or about March of this year. 15. The disposal section was formed with the object of obtaining buyers, whether under defence or not, and lots of assets have been sold on the same basis as I obtained these offers for the benches and hot-water heater. The whole staff of the section is employed on a similar basis. 16. No other officer received a similar notice or has been queried or suspected to my knowledge of giving the information to MrHarrison, and it was only because of my knowledge as to making of the offers that I was suspected. I know nothing of the grinding machine and only what I heard lately about the bogie wheels. Mr - Kerry Lad been , given notice, but the notice was torn up when he told Mr. Byrne that he had never seen me before. However, he was so severely victimized subsequently that he had to leave the section. In connection with reference No, 2, Mr. Conde says- ' During the course of my investigations I have examined the Auditor-General's special report, dated 3rd December, 1045, addressed to the Minister of Home Security and Works, the Honourable H . P. Lazzarini, on the accounts aud transactions of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission. In view of the Auditor-General's comments in this special report, I feel that the terms of reference do not call for .any furthercomment on my part. No w let me read the report of the A u d it o r General for the year 1944-45 in w h i c h he b it t e r l y criticized the a d m in is t the Salvage Commission. He r e are his words Contract with F i r m of Salvage Distributors. - "" There are other features in this contract which, in normal circumstances, would be considered far from satisfactory:No tenders were apparently 'called. Dealing was made with a Melbourne syndicate, not yet registered as a firm, in respect of materials lying in Sydney and Brisbane. The syndicate apparently had no stores under its own control in Brisbane or Sydney. This had caused a number of difficulties with deliveries to apparently "" agent"" firms. Terms which appeared unusually easy were made as regards use of commission's stores and delivery of materials at the commission's expense. .The mixing of "" clothing "" with "" rag "" in hulk sale. Mr Conde, when looking up the report of the committee appointed by the Minister, did not take into account the report of the Auditor-General, who so scathingly criticized the administration of the department. I propose to read extracts of letters sent to me' by the Minister's own advisory committee. . I think that this is justified, in view of the fact that these men, who. had indicated their willingness to give evidence on oath, were not called.' The first letter, from Mr E. J. Millar, statesIn reference to the inquiry being held into the activities of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission, it is respectfully requested that the writer be given the opportunity of giving evidence. M . KERBT. When I read t h at letter to the Minister he said that Mr M ill a r would be afforde d an o p p o r t u n it y to give evidence, b ut he. was not called, and Mr Conde does not kno w of the charges l i k e l y to be made by this m a n . The letter goes o n Some time in 1945, Mr Walker, then secretary of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission, entered our store, accompanied by two refugees and made"" a request that they be shown the material referred to. According to the conversation between these people, it became obvious that Walker was negotiating a sale. Immediately Walker and his companions left our store, I rang the Sydney office of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission, and offered Â£112 per ton for a quantity of the material. The following day, Mr Farthing, who was then Assistant State Controller ol Salvage, rang and informed me that .Walker had sold the material to the refugees. At a later date, it was discovered that, despite the fact that my firm offered Â£112 per ton for certain of this material, Walker sold to the r at i o n of people referred to at Â£20 per ton. That is a grave charge w h i c h sbould have called for an i m m e d i at e in q u i r y . When the Government ""ordered an inquiry this person should have i m m e d i at e l y it . been called, to give evidence. neither t h is m a n n o r any other member ..of the advisory committee was called. F it z p at r i c k ' A not h e r letter,.dated the 1 7 t h of A p r i l , is as f o l l o w s : A few months ago I interviewed Mr Walker, secretary of the Commonwealth Salvage Com.mission in Melbourne, and complained about the unfairness of the commission in hti'jre quantities of inn ferial to refugees, without uiving the legitimate traders an opportunity of quoting for the said, materials. Mr Walker replied, "" 1 called in Baron in an advisory capacity to the commission, with a request he proceed to Sydney aud Brisbane and in-: spect all' materials available"". I then asked Walker why this man wa3 called in and pointed out that Mr K . MCLeod Bolton, of Sydney, had been gazetted honorary adviser to the commission, and also that advisory panel, of which I , myself, was a ber, was in existence. , Walker - answering this question, but did admit that, after Baron had inspected the material, he, Baron, submitted the following proposition:'Biii-nii to form a company to be known - Associated Salvage Distributors and that company purchase all Army textile salvage materials available throughout the Commonthan ever. wea'th. Walker further stated that the commission accepted this proposition and signed a tnict accordingly. That contract was c r it i c i z e d by the ' director of Sydney W as t e A u d it o r - G e n e r al because it was made L i m it e d , w ho was also >a. member of the w i r h a f i r m that h a d no t the n been regisM in is t e r ' s advisory panel. tered;Upon my return to Sydney a few days later, I ' immediately arranged for a meeting of local waste traders and explained the position to the-members present. It was decided that three .members of the, trade interview Mr. Lazzarini in reference to these transactions and, despite the fact that Mr.'Lazzarini agreedto meet these gentlemen, they were informed, upon arrival at his rooms, that he would only' interview one member. Mr Bolton was the gentleman who saw Mr Lazzarini. and, as reward for his - efforts in attempting to straighten out matters, was called a liar.",19
45,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Did called Mr B o l to n a liar.?,22
46,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"He s a i d Mr Bolton was the gentleman who saw Mr Lazzarini and, as a reward for his efforts attempting to straighten out matters, was called a liar.",22

49,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is another l i e !,22
50,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"^ L et us get o n with selling the facts. The letter continues'Ihe writer is a partner in a Melbourne firm registered under the name of Preston Waste Proprietary Limited. This firm, owing to the control by the Commonwealth Salvage Comthat mission, was compelled to close down during the period of control, due only to the fact that it was unable to obtain supplies. Despite repeated requests by a director of the firm to the Commonwealth Salvage Com. mission, no supplies were made available, yet an Walker had the audacity to admit having memsigned a contract with a 'firm which was not refrained from even registered. In my letter to you dated 28th March, 1 omitted to state that the material referred to . had been sorted by Millar Ezzy & Company as and the commission had paid us Â£10 per ton this to do the sorting. This, of course, makes the sale rcfered to in that letter more ridiculous In conclusion may I-suggest that, when the inquiry is held, evidence be taken on oath. conI turn now to a letter dated the 29th A p r i l , 1946, from Mr Evans, m a n a g in g In d u s t r i es The letter readsMy company, as one of the largest textile 1 the waste merchants in Australia, had a considerable amount of dealings - with thecommission and I consider that the ' treatment doled .out to this company and other waste firms by the commission was most unreasonable. My reason for making this statement is that in July, 1945, my company purchased from the commission a quantity of old hosiery at Â£102 13s.. 4d. per ton and again in September, a 1945, purchased a quantity of wiper material at Â£102 13s. 4d. per ton. At about'this period the commission sold by contract at least 1,500 he say that I tons of rags to the Melbourne Syndicate at a flat rate of Â£17 per ton. It is not possible to reconcile the action of the officers of the commission in these sales. Whilst I was in Brishane in October last ] . found that the syndicates were using the comin mission's store, Army personnel and vehicles to handle the waste. To communicate with the Syndieate (now known as Associated Salvage is a damned Distributors) it was first necessary to telephone the State Controller of Salvage, Brisbane, whose office would then connect you That is a clear in d i c at i o n as to h o w far this firm had progressed in its relations r with a government in s t r u m e n t a l it y . . If . Minister was no t satisfied with , a - statement of that kindhe should have advised the commissioner to call evidence - on oath. He was empowered to do so and Mr Evans was desired to give sworn evidence. It seems, however, that the commissioner was not intent on unravelling the facts; he feared what might be brought to the surface. That is the reason why no evidence was called, why the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) and myself were not approached to disclose what evidence we could offer, and why this man went anooping round the firms concerned in an - endeavour to get information without calling for evidence on oath. The letter from Mr Evans continuesWe are led to believe that when the was made the Syndicate was neither registered as a company nor were they licenced as distributors by the Salvage Commission.. It. would also be interesting to know if it is true that the principal of the syndicate has left this country and is now in Palestine. Honourable members will recall that. I asked in .this House, whether this gentleman had been given a visa to go overseas and that I was informed that he was then on his way back to Australia. To say the least it seems strange that the principal figure in the case should be allowed to leave the Commonwealth at a time when the inquiry was proceeding; The terms of reference were quite clear. I do not know whether Mr Baron was called; I venture to say he was not. If he was. called, was his evidence taken on oath? Again, I venture to say it was not. A commissioner was appointed by the Government to investigate serious charges made by responsible members of this Parliament who are associated with the leadership of the two parties in opposition. likely that we would have made loose - charges or idle statements? .By the.documentary evidence I have produced this morning I have already proved that the charges were based on facts supplied to me by members of the Minister's own advisory panel. I could do no other than bring those' facts before the House and the country; I could do no other than bring before the House the evidence ativen by Mr Kerry, disposals officer of the commission. If the Government thought those charges of sufficient importanceand it did, so, because it apnointed' Mr. - Conde to investigate the matter-it had a responsibility to call all evidence that that would establishthe truth or otherwise of the allegations. After sifting the evidence Mr Conde should have made recommendations upon which the Government could have acted. But Mr. Conde did not do that; he interpreted his terms of reference as giving him authority to whitewash the charges and he immediately proceeded to do so. I turn briefly to another matter. I again direct attention to the serious position in which country people are placed as the result of the imposition of sales tax on freight charged on goods transported from the. metropolitan area to country centres. This praccontract, tice imposes an unfair, burden on country people and on wholesale firms which have branches in country centres. In order to illustrate my argument I propose to give one or two examples of how this surcharge places country consumers at a disadvantage by comparison with city dwellers. As honourable members are aware, under the sales tax procedure,, goods purchased by merchants in a country town from the' branch of a wholesale, warehouse attract sales tax not only on the goods' themselves, but also on the freight, whereas, if they are bought direct from the main warehouse in the city, sales tax is paid only on the cost of the goods, and not on the freight. The situation is well illustrated by the following examples: The freight on a ton of goods carried by rail at the second-class rate of freight to a point 300 miles distant from Sydney is Â£8 16s. Sales tax on the freight on those good's is Â£2 4s., if they are taxable at 25 per cent, or Â£1 2s., if taxable at 12Â£ per cent. The tax on the Is it freight on 1 tonof fine salt sold at. Inverell, the wholesale price of which is Â£6 14s. 6d. a ton, on rails, Sydney, is 8s. l i d . In this case the salt is taxable at. 12$ - per cent., and the freight on it to Inverell is Â£3 l is . 3d. per ton. Here are two other examples. The first, is iri respect of a ton of fine salt purchased direct from a city wholesaler and shipped to Glen Innes. The initial cost of the salt is Â£6 14s. 6d., the freight costs Â£3 8s.. 6d., and sales tax at T2i per cent, oh Â£6 ]""*s. 6d'., ad'd's 16s. 10d., makina; the total Â£10 19s. l?0d. Wow consider the same ton of salt, purchased from the country wholesaler, who is forced to pay tax on the cost, plus freight, by rulings of. the Taxation Commissioner. The cost, as before, is Â£6 14s'. 6d., the freight Â£3 Ss. 6d., and the sales tax, on cost plus the freight, at 12^ per cent., Â£1 5s. 5d., making the total, Â£11 8s. 5d. This represents"" an increase on the first example of 8s. 7d. a ton, or 6.4 per cent., directly attributable to what must be conceded to be an unjust impost. I ask the Minister for ""Works and Housing, in his capacity as deputy to the Treasurer, whether consideration will be given to the correction of the anomaly, which bears unduly on the country trader. It debars him from purchasing from the branch warehouse in his own town because the sales tax on the freight from the city as well as on the actual cost of the goods makes the cost so much higher.",22
51,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing) [11.54] - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison), has provided another example of his irresponsibility in the tirade of ' abusethat he has hurled at the-Salvage Commission. I"" do not intend to take up much time replying to the honourable member, because every allegation made today by him has been made and refuted on four or five occasions. It is amazing to hear the honourable member one day asking questions about reflections made by Ministerial supporters on people outside who cannot defend themselves, when he makes more use of this chamber than any other honourable member as a coward's castle from which to attack people who cannot reply. The irony of it is that Opposition members, tongue in cheek, endeavour to make it appear to the people that we on this side of the House take advantage of the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament to attack people, whereas the truth is that this offence is committed mainly by honourable gentle: men opposite. Both the honourable member for Wentworth, and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), have made the most irresponsible accusations against the. Commonwealth instrumentalities-the honourable member for Wentworth against the Salvage Commission and the Leader of the Australian Country party against the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The-accusations against the Salvage Commission have already been effectively answered by me. The full story appears in Hansard, and the newspapers have published a condensation; and, through both, members of the public have been able to ascertain the facts. The honourable member for Wentworth ""was able"" to substantiate only one detail of his otherwise wild and mischievous accusation* and the practice that he complained of was stopped' immediately it came to my notice. He knows that as well as I do, but that does not stop him from coming here and uttering more baseless slander? of people who are powerless to defend themselves in this chamber. With reference to the allegation of the Leader of the Australian Country party in regard to the sale by the Commonwealth. Disposals Commission of household refrigerators, Mr H . Gk Conde. who conducted an inquiry into that and other matters, furnished a report, which was tabled yesterday by the Prime-Minister (Mr Chifley).' It contained the following paragraph:In my opinion, the transaction referred lo relates to refrigerator cabinets and not to refrigerators. Tn August, 1945, there were a number of refrigerator cabinets disposed of which were condemned as irreparable anti were - non-accountable. These were sold at prices ranging from Â£2 10s. to Â£20. That disposes of the alleged refrigerators. They were refrigerator cabinets. The truth about the sale of the material referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth is that Millar Ezzy and Company and one or two other unsuccessfully tried to compete with the purchasers, who are successfully tendering for nearly all the lines the-, commission sells. Ezzy and Bolton had submitted tenders. I have them before me to prove that. Because they were beaten in a business deal they scuttled off to the honourable member for Wentworth to get him to make charges in this House. My privatesecretary, a public servant of many years standing and with a very high reputation, is sitting in the gallery behind me. He was present when Bolton came to see me and remained the whole time that Bolton was there. If Bolton says-and I do not believe that he does, for the honourable member only read a letter that was not signed by Bolton, I understand-that there was any acrimony in my talk with him, he is not telling the truth. ' Mr HARRISON - I assure the Minister that he has said so.",24
52,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Then he is telling an untruth. I had a witness present; there was no acrimony. In fact, Bolton shook hands with me after the interview and said he hoped that as a result of our conversation things would be straightened out. He made no charges. He admitted that he had been an adviser of the Salvage Commission, and that his main complaint was that, although he had worked in an honorary capacity, his advice had not been sought on one occasion when he thought it should have been. Neither Bolton nor I had notes taken. What I have said is the plain truth.. I will match my reputation against his at any time. My standing in the community - is at least as high as his. Moreover, I have the benefit of a witness, who is known in his private and official life as an honourable man. I do not want an argument with Bolton. All I can say is that he is using his position as president of the New South' Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen^s Imperial League of Australia to play at politics. I believe that he is to .be a candidate at the forthcoming general elections. I warn him that, if high officers of the league use their official positions for political purposes, the league will be smashed, because the rank and file will not stand for it. That is all I have to say. I categorically deny, the honourable gentleman's statements. Mr Bolton met me in my office and told me that he was in trouble mainly because, as honorary adviser of the Salvage Commission, he' claimed that his advice was not sought on some occasions when it should have been sought. I told him that I would take the matter up with the Salvage Commission to see whether the matter of which he complained could be rectified. At the end of the interview he shook hands with, me as he left my office. The Auditor-General is correct when he says that the contract was signed with an unregistered company. I was one day out in my dates. The contract was signed by Mr Brilliant, a prominent business man of Melbourne, on behalf of Associated Salvage Distributors Limited, on the Tuesday. The company was [9 AUGUST, 1946.J (No. 2) 1946-47. 4179 registered on the Wednesday. I admit that the Auditor-General was correct when he said that the company was noi registered at the time Mr Brilliant signed the contract. Mr Brilliant signed on behalf of the company, not for the company. The Auditor-General came into my office andasked me about that. 1 intended to make a statement in the. House on the matter on the motion for adjournment or at some other time. The point is that the Auditor-General did not find that there was anything wrong. He said that there was never anything ethically wrong'. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), knows something about company law, and I am sure that he would agree that there was nothing wrong in what was done. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred constantly to refugees, and, in my opinion, has .attempted to distort the' meaning of the word. He desires to leave the impression that these people "" came to this country very shortly before these transactions occurred, and that there was something unsavoury about them. ' ",25
53,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The term was used in the letter.,25
54,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Yes , but the honourable gentleman has repeatedly used it in the House. The fact is that Mr. Brilliant is a naturalized British subject who took out his naturalization papers in 1920, when a government of the political complexion favoured by the honourable member for Wentworth was in office. The honourable gentleman also said that Baron was given a . passport and went away to Jerusalem. The fact is that he went away on only a short visit. He took out his naturalization papers in the 193,0;'s, also when an anti-Labour government was in office. The citizenship of these men is' recognized in thi* country, but the honourable member for Wentworth is using this House, as a coward's castle and is continually suggesting that. there is something wrong with what these naturalized citizens have done in certain business transactions with which they have been connected. In one breath honourable gentlemen opposite say , that we should be doing everything: possible to bring immigrants to Australia and thereby increase ourpopulation, and in the next breath, for the purpose of trying to gain a paltry political advantage, they - charge person's who become naturalized citizens with improper practice. I have dealt with this subject on threeor four - occasions, as may be ascertained from - reference to. Hansard and the evidence in regard to it has been, published in our - official records.. . The honourable gentleman said that an effort was being, made to make available to these interests all the salvage in Australia. That is another half-truth. A - contract was signed for 1,000 tons of - salvage, and the quantity was afterwards increased to 1,500 tons.' An attempt has beenmade also to lead people to believe that certain materials were improperly included, as rag. I ordered: an inquiry be made into this matter as soon as the 'allegations came to my notice, and it was --also subsequently investigated by the Auditor-General.",25
55,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"""What was the price of the salvage?",26
56,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Fro m Â£20 to Â£25 a ton.,26
57,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Was it not Â£14?,26
58,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is not true. The evidence obtained by the Auditor General proves that it was not true.,26
59,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,What about Miller's letter?,26
60,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"There is no evidence' that Miller ever made an offer to anybody. These allegations can be put in the same class as^ those made by the honourable gentleman in regard to a hotwater system. Mr Condehas reported that no evidence was to be found as the result of his exhaustive search that any contract was made. What has happened is that the honourable gentleman's ""stooges"" come to him and tell him that they have made verbal offers for goods. I could say that I had made a verbal offer - of Â£10,000 in certain circumstances, and later write a letter to the honourable gentleman on the subject, well knowing that he would use it in the House. The honourable gentleman is making use of political ""stooges"",, who write"" truths rr untruths to himi knowing that he wil' probably use the matter to "" cook up "" charges of connivance",26
61,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I rise to oitder. I ask that the Minister be called upon to witfodraw the allegation that I would ""cook up "" certain evidence, particularly as Mr. ; Conde had power to call me to. give evidence on oath, and did not do it.",26
62,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF," As the honourable member for Wentworth regards the term "" cook up "" as offensive, I ask the Minis1 ter to withdraw it.",26
63,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I withdraw it willingly. I used the word "" probably "", but I withdraw the term "" cook up "" as the honourable gentleman considers that it is offensive. He has indulged in many suggestions', and innueridos regarding these matters and has quoted, from a' letter which implied that something dishonest and dishonourable has been done, when, in fact, there is no evidence of anyto thing of the kind. The Auditor-General made exhaustive inquiries, extending over three or four months in three States, into activities of the Salvage Commission, and in spite of all the harping of the honourable member for Wentworth on this subject, all that the Auditor-General could find was that a contract was entered into with a firm that was not registered until the day after the contract was signed. The Auditor-General frequently criticizes the accountancyand bookkeeping methods of departments. AuditorGenerals of both the Commonwealth and the States are in the habit of criticizing the accountancy methods of government departments. The Salvage Commission was one of the last bodies of the kind to be established and it had to "" pick up ""- its officers from wherever it could get them, because all the most capable accountants had already been engaged. I have never tried' to deny that the Auditor-General has been critical, but he has also stated in plain terms that there was no evidence, to justify the allegations made i i i this Parliament by the honourable member' for Wentworth. This relates particularly tO' the statement, that a certain amount of material that wasin'cludedi in a contract asrag was .not rag. Because of that allegahalf- tion I requested that an immediate investigation be made. Subsequently the Auditor-General, in company with an officer of the Treasury, also made an investigation. I do not think it; will be suggested that the Auditor-General would so out of h-is way to whitewash me or anybody else;",26
64,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,But tenders were not called in this case.,27
65,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That was admitted long ago; but since then tenders have been called in every instance. There has been no attempt to deny that tenders were not called in this particular transaction. The Auditor-General has reported that there is not the slightest evidence of any dishonesty in. this matter, though he also said that he considered that the chairman of the Salvage Commission had participated in what had been disclosed as a bad business deal. I cannot remember his exact words at the moment. I have..the report before me, but I do not intend to ""weary honourable members by reading long extracts from it. When the Auditor-General and the officer from the Treasury went to Queensland to examine and sort the goods that had been . sold, they had to wear gas masks at the work because thesmell was so bad. That fact indicates the quality of the goods. Since this particular transaction occurred, all sales by the Salvage Commission have been conducted by public tender.

68,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I rise to order. Is the Minister in order in referring to the House of Representatives as a "" coward's castle "" ?",28
69,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF, - That is not a point of order.,28
70,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [12.17] - I support and confirm the views expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) regarding this alleged inquiry by Mr. Cond6 into our statements about the maladministration of the Salvage Commission. When I raised this matter, I referred particularly to the sale of refrigerators, and emphasized that the inquiry should be conducted by a judge of the Supreme Court who would be able adequately to sift and assess the evidence. The report submitted by Mr Conde reflects the greatest attempt to white-wash a government department that I have ever known. The Government appointed Mr Conde to inquire into the statements which I made. I use specifically the word "" statements "" because I do not desire any honourable member opposite to accuse me of having used' the word "" allegations "". I made no allegations. I stated that I could not verify the statements and. claims which had been made to me, and I considered that I executed my trust as a representative of the people when I raised the matter in this House and pressed for a most searching inquiry. What has been the result ? Mr Conde never interviewed me. or asked me whether I had any evidence to support by statements, who my informants were, or whether I could produce any material which might assist a proper investigation. I have in my possession the duplicates of receipts and warrants issued by the Salvage Commission regarding refrigerators. - The Department of Supply and Shipping supplied to me the ledger-sheet as Well as copies of warrants or receipts which were certified. What do they reveal? Mr Conde could have got this information. What the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley), stated td me in reply to a question which I asked in the House was an untruth. He said, when I raised the matter, that ten refrigerators only were sold to Fostars Foundry at Â£10 ,each. Receipt No 62324 states that ""the price includes"" two cases of parts. The Minister did not mention this fact. There is a big difference between selling a refrigerator at Â£10, and selling a refrigerator with two cases of parts at the same price. The stock ledger lists one refrigerator sold by auction at Â£4 as being a "" six hole play type "". It is fairly good buying at Â£4! But evidently Mr Conde was satisfied without making any inquiry or investigation. Certain receipts are endorsed by the purchaser, "" for my own personal use and not for re-sale"". If those were junk items selling at Â£9 10s. each, why is the admission made that they could be used and were.consequently serviceable, and why was the restriction placed on their re-sale? A. Simmick is described in pencil on the stock' ledger as a carrier, and consequently, the real name of the purchaser does not appear. The prices of these items to Simmick are Â£9 10s., Â£7, Â£7, Â£2, Â£7, Â£7, Â£7, and Â£7, respectively. Nine refrigerators were sold to Army officers, and one was sold to a woman in Adelaide for Â£7; Surely she . would not have paid the cost of transport from Brisbane to Adelaide if the refrigerator wasjunk. Mr Conde .used the white-wash brush 'too thickly and too crudely. He could have been even a little subtle in his investigations, called for the evidence and arrived at something approaching a reasonable decision based upon a proper investigation by a man of Mr Conde's reputation. It is a scandalous state of affairs when the white-wash is used in an attempt to discredit the honourable member for Wentworth and myself. We are not irresponsible. We have a duty to perform, and when people make complaints to us about wilful waste and extravagant maladministration, we must raise the matters in this House. We did so in this instance. We asked for a searching inquiry, and the result is this nebulous white-washing document which purports t.o be findings based on searching investigation to elicit the truth. This Parliament and. the country should not tolerate that. This bill provides for the granting of supply until the 30th November next. The amount which the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley), seeks is Â£45,030,000. That amount approximates the estimates that, the right honourable gentleman gave in his Financial Statement on the 12th July last. I direct particular attention to the method of finance which the Government proposes to adopt during the next twelve months. The Treasurer stated that the provision of Â£30,000,000 for war services represents the amount which, it is estidis- mated, will be available from revenue receipts for the period of .three months, after allowance is made for other obligations. Therefore, of the total amount of Â£302,000,000 which will be required for war services this financial year, the Government plans to' expend Â£120,000,000from .revenue, and the balance of Â£180,000,000'will be.raised by loan. . I direct particular attention to that fact. The Government's plana for this financial year contemplate the borrowing of at least Â£180,000,000. Let use examine some of the items for which we are asked to make provision. It ' is interesting to note the trend' of the Government's financial policy. The amount which the Parliament is asked to provide includes the sum of Â£3,500,000 for air. craft equipment and stores. The inference to be drawn is that in this financial year, the Government will expend about Â£14,000,000 in that direction. An amount equal to Â£1,800,000 a year is provided for standard ship construction. I shall connect that matter with some remarks which I propose .to make on the Auditor General's report on that particular venture. My point is that provision is made in the Government's financial proposals Eor giving effect to its socialization ideals. I also direct' attention to an amount of Â£8,760 provided for the next three months for the . Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department. That is equivalent to an expenditure of Â£34,000 a year on that activity. ""We must consider the . Government's financial requirements in the light of the Auditor-General's report. What has the Auditor-General said of the public accounts since this Government took office.? His report was laid on the table of this House last March, but copies were not.available for some time. The report is a scathing .document containing on almost every page examples of Government squandering, maladministration of every kind, bungling and inepitude. The comments regarding government departments call for a most searching examination, and, in many cases, stringent action, against those - responsible fpr the inefficiency and wasteful expenditure disclosed in the report. I emphasize that these criticisms are not made by the Opposition. They are not the observations of a political party on the eve of the elections. They are made by a public official who is appointed to safeguard the interests of taxpayers. The Audit Bill was one' of the first measures 'passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth when it was constituted 45 years ago .The importance of his office is beyond question. He can be described a.Â« "" the watchdog of the public purse "". When a Minister iÂ» ^worn in a3 the head of a Mr Fadden. Commonwealth department, he is required to assume complete responsibility for its administration. His duty is toensure that full value shall be received, for the money which the department expends. Yet, within the last four years,. with the Labour party in office, one report after another by the Auditor-General has criticized the administration in the most scathing terms. This officerhas reported that his strictures have been ignored, and that there has been little or no improvement of the position to which be has directed attention. In fact, repeatedly he has had to revert to criticism in his previous reports. When other Opposition members and I have sought an explanation of the waste, extravagance and maladministration disclosed by the Auditor-General, the invariable' practice of the Minister concerned has been to present a report prepared by a public servant; in other words, a "" white-washing "" report. In the main, such reports are prepared by an officer of the department, the administration of which has been criticized by the Auditor-General. WKen the report has been given to the House, the whole matter has been shelved, and frequently the Auditor-General has found himself obliged to reiterate his criticism in his next report. His report' for 1943-44 was tabled on the 13th June, 1945. Even the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Chifley), had to admit that he had not had an opportunity to peruse it. Subsequently, I suggested that immediate action should be taken to investigate the highly unsatisfactory state of affairs that had been revealed by the report. The Auditor-General had strongly criticized inefficiency in accounting and stock-taking methods, as well as wasteful expenditure, particularly in the Departments of Munitions, the Army, and Aircraft Production. I suggested the appointment of an independent com- ' mittee of practising accountants, to investigate and report upon methods for improving the position, especially as some of the transactions at which criticism had been directed bad extended over three or four years. The Prime Minister replied that the matters relating to costing which had been brought under notice in the report would be considered. He said I know from my own experience that it is hard to obtain the services of extra men, but II assure the honourable member that the Government will do whatever is possible to have - an examination made. I was impelled to suggest an investigation because the Auditor-General's statements in that report were similar to those that he had made in his report for the year - ended the 30th June, 1943. standing the serious nature of these repeated criticisms, the Minister for Munitions (Mr M a k in ) , dealing - similar comments in the 1943 report, - saidThe comment of the Auditor-General can described as exaggerated and giving a torted picture of the situation. Most of appears to be directed at the Victorian section. The Auditor-General referred to these observations in his subsequent report, addedThe inference is quite correct; the graph in question was headed "" Munitions - Stores and Transport Branch, Victoria "". I have been greatly concerned at the .ter's-statement, as it is my invariable practice where comment or criticism is necessary, to state the position as moderately - as possible and to avoid overstatement in any Tespect. As regards the branch in question, my cost of comparable officers had been endeavouring for a conwooden siderable period to secure improvement in its overtime"". accounting and control. The Treasury had to dispose ofRecently also taken action. In the circumstances, it is most regrettable that the Minister for Munitions, referring to the 1944 report,.should have sepn f it to observe that the AuditorThe General was not a production had only a rather theoretical knowledge, for which reasons he, the Minister, would project. prefer to be guided by production men. That a Minister should regard such an important document as the report of the Auditor-General, is a serious fixed-price matter. I have abstracted from the latest report of the Auditor-General a few classic examples of the squandering of public money which should be devoted to other purposes in a much higher priority group; for example, the re-establishment and rehabilitation: of ex-servicemen. Unfortunately, the report is twelve months old, hecause it refers to the year ended government-owned the 3ftth June, 1945. The extravagance to which it refers has doubtless been aggravated in the year that has recently closed. Here are examples of disastrous maladministrationMunitions Department - Discrepancie s between accounts were considerably increased during the year, and a complete reconciliation was impossible. Audit representations regarding unsatisfactory accounting features are still Notwith- unsatisfied. Authentic departmental records of assets purchased from Commonwealth Fund! 1 cannot be established. with The Auditor-General reported in similar .terms in 1943, and again .in 1944; yet the maladministration was considerably.be accentuated. I have drawn attention in disthis House to the estimates of private it individuals in connection - with the construction of wooden vessels by the Shipbuilding Board, the amounts being Â£700,000 for a period of three months and and Â£1,800,000 for a period of twelve months. One would have thought that some regard would ,be paid to the criticism that had parabeen offered, when plans were being made for the future and an expenditure of .Minisnearly Â£2,000.000 was involved. This is what the Auditor-General has said in reconsidered gard to that ventureStandard wooden vessels completed cost Â£71 per deadweight ton-many , times the overseas vessels. Two hundred ton vessels cost up to Â£7(1,000 a piece, caused in part ""by heavy expenditure on an endeavour was.made some of these vessels,- with little success. The eventual loss will' be of staggering proportions. Yet no attempt was made to exercise more stringent control over expenditure. Auditor-General said in regard to man and locomotive constructionA substantial loss will result from this These are his remarks in connection with so lightly the cost-plus systemDespite a recommendation regarding the contract, the department still continued to let some cost-plus and maximum price contracts. His recommendation in that regard was completely ignored, and the position was aggravated,, with the result that greater calls had to be made on the public purse. Tn regard to the A irc ra ft Production Department, he saidControl recordsi are incomplete, stocktaking has nut been recmir Mrd with them. The material issued direct to contractors has. not beenbrought completely under departmental control.. With regard to one contractor alone, the amount involved is Â£1,790,000 while in another case evidence has not heen forthcoming to indicate whether ty.S90,000 worth of materials supplied to one major contractor by the department was properly controlled as to receipt, usage or return. Numerous sub-contracts were placed on a basis which did not provide for the right to investigate costs. ' Four million pounds 'was paid to sub-contractors, and of those , which could be investigated, substantial refunds resulted. Other extracts from the report areStores and Equipment:-Store s records con-' tinue to be unreliable. Stock-taking immediately - revealed numerous discrepancies-in many cases without seeking authority and without submitting details to the Audit Office.' Allied Works Council:-Plan t and stores records could not be reconciled with control accounts. Purchases could not be traced, numerous adjustments were made to stock ledgers without authority. attempts have been made to correct records. Canteen Accounts: - During the deficiencies and irregularities were disclosed, stated to be largely due to pillage and loss in transit. Stores and Plant Eecords:-Certain phases of accounting were seriously in arrear audit examination disclosed numerous inacand courage. curacies. Stores were over purchased and became unserviceable. Salvage Commission:-Item s not properly accounted for reduced the accumulated profit claimed, by Â£20,700. The accounts were so unreliable that the Chief Auditor, New South Wales, reported that "" the position regarding by stock records, stocktaking and related crepancies is quite unacceptable to a u d it "" . Another auditor had strong suspicions some treaters were in a position to better, class fabrics to their own stocks, replace themwith lower class materials! Food Control: - Losses amounting Â£105,000 arising from the processing and sale of vegetables resulted during the year. was expended on a project in northern land which produced Â£15,800 worth of Australia. vegetables during the year, before closed down. The same department spent Â£42,820 of public moneys on a publicity campaign for increased food production. Prime Minister's Department:-Stocktakin of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is seriously in arrears with regard to both stores and equipment. Department of the Interior:-As in previous the years, working expenses of the Grafton-South Brisbane railway were incorrectly charged Â£53,000 of capital expenditure. Prices Commission:-Salaries in this branch jumped from Â£285,000 to Â£420,000 in the twelve months. This is an increase and calls for some explanation. cost of administration alone of the commissions-prices and rationing, cost over Â£1,000,000 for the year. Mr Fadden. Department of the Army:-Discrepancies ; arrears,"" withholding of audit approval, failure to check deliveries, of Army goods such as tyres, and otlier unsound features mark the administration of this department. Minerals Production: - Expenditure on. various projects to 30th June, 1945, was Â£2,584,000, and receipts totalled only Â£344,000. One could give many more examples of the appalling state of affairs which, according to the report, exists in Commonwealth departments. The most unsatisfactory feature is the complete apathy of the Government, and its total disregard of responsibility. competent I wish to record my appreciation of . the work of the retiring Auditor-General, Mr R. Abercrombiej who has given outstanding service during theeight years and of his occupancy of that office. He has Unsuccessful not had that departmental or ministerial the co-operation which he should have had during the last three or four years.

71,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2 p.m.,32
72,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I now draw attention to an item of Â£8,756 to cover expenditure the Commonwealth Investigation disBranch for a period of three months; that proportionately the expenditure for the transfer full year would he about Â£34,000. and It is opportune to call attention to the fact that, during the war, the to Commonwealth Security Service was Â£101,000. set up to carry out important funcQueenstions associated with the security of When the war ended, the it was Government appointed a committee, which included the then Director General 'of Security, now Mr Justice Simpson, to g make recommendations concerning the future of the department. I understand that that committee recommended to Government - that the security service should be terminated. When-the with matter was raised in Parliament earlier this year, the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) gave an assurance that it was not extraordinary intended to have a permanent security The service, such as was necessary in war-time. two Nevertheless, he added, there would have to be in the Investigation Branch of 'the Attorney-General's Department officers whose duty would be to watch security matters in Australia's interest. It appears, however, that there is in Australia today^-at a time when we are not at war-a n organization which is described as "" Evatt's gestapo"". , This organization is under the control - of a Colonel Jackson, who, I understand, was formerly Deputy Director of Security Service in Sydney. Two well-known.and experienced New South ""Wales detectives, Detectives Wilks and MCDermott, who were seconded to the Commonwealth for security work during the war, are, I understand, today associated with this gestapo. Side by side with this organization, we have the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, which cost Â£33,182 in 1943-44, and Â£35,804 in 1944-45, and provision was made for an expenditure of Â£38,800 in the financial year 1945-46. The security service cost Â£121,579 in 1943-44 and Â£134,184 in 1944-45, but the provision was cut down to Â£40,000 for 1945-46. I am unable to say what the security service actually cost in the last financial year, but I do say that Parliament and the people are entitled to know how an estimated expenditure of Â£40,000 was justified on a security service, while the Commonwealth Investigation Branch was functioning. , Furthermore, I understand that the permanent' head of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch is Colonel Longfield Lloyd, who is at present in Japan, and Major Rowland Brown is the temporary head of the department. What I want to know is, under whose control are Colonel Jackson and the officers of his department? Are they under the control of Colonel Longfield Lloyd, or under the direct control of the Attorney-General? Further, I want to know what is the nature of the work of this new organization-whic h is functioning in peace-time - that requires the services of detectives trained in police work? In connection with this subject, I have recently received details of the moneys expended out of two secret funds by the Labour Government during the past few years. The first secret fund, known as the Security Service Special Fund, was operated upon by the Government for some nearly three years until it was closed in December, 1945. The sum ' of Â£8,662 l is . 4d. was spent but of this fund on security matters, including subversive activities. It is. the successor, except in name, to the fund known as the Australian Democratic Front Fund, established for similar purposes under the control of Sir George Knowles, the Solicitor-General at the time. Besides this' fund , there is another government secret fund known as the Investigation Branch Special Fund, from which the Government has spent Â£9,185 during its - term of office. A portion of fhese money -' was used in investigating subversive activities in all States. It took a good deal of questioning on my part to obtain information about expenditure from these funds. I persisted in my endeavour to get the Government to admit that it had a secret f u n d similar to the one which uninformed members opposite have called a "" s l u s h "" fund . I asked on the 19th July a series of questions, No. 4 of which was as follows:Have moneys from any of the above mentionecl accounts and/or funds been used either directly or through any Commonwealth instrumentality or otherwise to control, police and/or investigate communism or com munistic activities, and/or any persons, matter* or things associated in any way whatsoever with the Communist party of Australia. Strangely enough, I received replies to all the questions I asked except No. 4, and that one was evaded. It would appear that honourable members opposite were ignorant that the present Government had carried on the same practice as the previous government by operating on secret funds. The only difference is that this Government of which the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr W a r d) is a member, has spent more on secret funds than did the previous one. The reply which I received to my question was a> follows:This Government takes no responsibility for the manner in which the moneys made available through the Australian Democratic Front Fund were expended, but the disbursement* from the Security Service Special Fund were, and the disbursements from the Investigation Branch Special Fund are, at all times subject to audit by the Chief Audit Inspectors. As Prime Minister, I instituted an inquiry into certain disbursements from special funds, and the Minister for Transport, at regular intervals, has quoted in this House .carefully selected extracts from this report to ""show that the practice of operating upon a secret f u n d is highly irregular. The shock of realizing that his own ministerial colleagues had been following the practice-whic h he so roundly condemns-to the amount of Â£17,847 all told, might well prove too much for him. Hisblood pressure has risen to danger-point often enough over a mere Â£300 expended from a similar f u n d , ' hy a government of which I was a member. That particular fund was closed by the"" present Government and I was informed that it took no responsibility for the disbursements therefrom. To put the record straight. I shall quote what the royal commission found with respect to every item paid out from this fund . Mr . Justice Halse Rogers saidAt the inquiry files were produced ing supporting documents in the shape of vouchers, invoices and receipts for every item. On 19th September, 1941, the Commonwealth Audit Office investigated all these payments and there is no evidence that any question 'wa.s raised as to the correctness of any account appearing in the cash book or the authenticity of any reecipt or any supporting documents. With regard to Â£300, the judge found, as a fact, first, that Mr Nelson received, the Â£300 from the fund, which was paid by the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Sydney in the first instance to a Mr Winkler. Secondly, he said I do not find anything in the evidence at all which could be regarded.as a ground for rejecting the evidence of Mr Hughes and Mr. Fadden as to their reasons for making the money available. Fie further saidIf Mr Nelson did suggest such a campaign to Mr Hughes-and that is what I have found- I can see nothing ridiculous, and certainly nothing sinister, in the acceptance of the suggestion by Mr Hughes and the subsequent adoption of it by Mr Fadden. Consequently I can see no ground foT rejecting their evidence as to their motive and certainly no ground for finding or even a suggestion that they entered into a conspiracy with Mr. Nelson to do something with him for some r purpose unspecified. And finally; Mr Justice Halse Rogers statedFor the reasons given, I am driven to the conclusion that I should find that the moneys in question were paid out of the account established in the name of the Australian Mr Fadden. Democratic Front by . Mr Watson under theinstructions of the Attorney-General, Mr. Hughes, with the approbation of the Actingdesigned Prime Minister, Mr Fadden; that the moneys were paid out through Mr Winkler to Mr. Nelson in accordance with the instructions of the Acting Prime Minister; that the pui posefor which the moneys were paid was that indicated in the receipts and in the letter from Mr Watson to Sir George Knowles already referred to, that is to say that it had relation to the promise of the executive officers in the,coal industry that there would be free-lorn from further strikes in the coal industry during the war and that it was meant for a campaign in support of the declaration of Mr. Nelson and Mr Kelloek. That declaration enunciated the policy of"" continuity of production of coal during the war, and it was published in the press of Australia on the 28th February, 1941,. just a fortnight after I , with the concurrence of the Advisory War Council, had issued a warning of the grave menaceof Japan, and the possibility that it contain- - might declare war against Australia. Secret funds have been in existence in. this country for over 30 years, and it will no doubt be found necessary to employ them again, whatever party may be in power In conclusion, I wish to emphasize to - the Minister for Transport, to the mem few other lionorable members of the Go1 vernment, that when they .criticize my expenditure of hundreds from secret funds, I can with equal facilit y - point to the spending of thousands from the same public source, and on precisely the same objects by the Government of which they are supporters. At least it can never be said of <me that I ran away from a royal commission, or that I took cowardly shelter behind parliamentary privilege. The payment of the Â£300 which has caused me so much humiliation was paid in the honest belief that it would lielp to check the subversive activities of Communists at a time when Australia was menaced by a Japanese invasion. It was a mere drop in the ocean by comparison with the vast sums the Communists were spending in pernicious propaganda. Has this Government expended .any money to combat their activities? If so, was the amount in excess of Â£300? If it was not, what excuse has the Government to >offer for its failure to protect our democratic institutions against the subversive doctrines - of those, who would destroy them?",32
73,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The right honourable member's time has expired.,35
74,Mr MARTENS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Herbert) [2.16] This is the last opportunity I shall have to speak in this chamber. After eighteen .years' service as the representative, of people in the electorate of Herbert, I retire with a record, of which I am not .ashamed. ""When I was first elected to theNational Parliament, in February, 1928, I made a promise at the declaration of the poll that I would do my very best to represent the interests of. the electors of Herbert fairly and fearlessly as long as T continued to hold their confidence. I believe I still hold their confidence, but' - certain things have happened, over which I have no control, as the result' of which - another Labour candidate will contest the Herbert seat at the forthcoming - elections. I bave no doubt that the Labour Government will be returned to - office because of its splendid record in one of the most difficult and trying periods in the history of this nation. On more than one occasion I have been - called' a unificationi'st. I believe in the National Parliament being clothed'with full powers. I do not desire that the State parliaments should be .abolished, however, .until either cantons or local verning province's with clearly defined powers are created to take their place. This Parliament should be clothed with supreme authority, the cantons or local governing provinces beingvested, with delegated powers to give effect to decisions on matters of. national policy made by this Parliament. A written constitution is"" not sufficiently flexible to the changing conditions of our times. Our Constitution was based on the American model, and the greatest difficulty has been experienced in altering it to meet - changing circumstances, because the - people have been swayed too much by - opposing factions in the National and State parliaments. Irrespective of what government has been in office, I have supported every referendum of the people which has had for its object the clothing of this Parliament with additional powers. In ' every State the capital city is the centre on which everything converges. It is true that some attempt has beenmade in Queensland to decentralizegovernmental activities, but not much has yet been. achieved in that direction. Withthe exception of abreak of three years, Labour governments have been in office in that State siince 1915. For economic and otherreasonstheState the governments will not easily yield' to the Commonwealth the powers they now possess. I regret that, because I believe the time has arrived when there should bea complete redesigning of our legislative machinery. As long as the State Parliaments retain their legislative powers Labour will continue to govern in Queensland because of the hopeless muddle which surrounds theparties now in opposition.in that State. That is also true of New South Wales and will continue to be so long as Mr E r n i e "" White"" Winalot "" .White-remain s associated with the Liberal party in that State. Some time ago, an Australian traveller mentioned, on his return from a visit overseas, the excellence of the amenities provided for members of the legislature^ of the countries which he bad visited, and the comparatively generous allowances paidto members. Few ' people realise the enormous expense which members of Parliament incur in looking after the needs of their congo- stituents.. Some people believe, that members are served with meals at the refreshment rooms free of charge, and that thp parliamentary allowance of Â£1,000 a year represents the net return to the member. Nothing could be further from the truth. After eigbteen years membership of the national Parliament, I leave, it no better meet off than when I - joined it.. I know men who have been members of Parliament for a much longer period, who during the period of their service have held Ministerial office, and who have retired from active politics, absolutely penniless. The common belief that this Parliament is a sort of rich man's club is very wide of thetruth. The amenities provided in this building are a disgrace to-the nation. There is not one room set aside in this building where members can conduct private interviews with their constituents or friends. They have to conduct their private business in the King's-Hall or the lobbies, or perhaps obtain the use of a room fromone of the more fortunate senators. . I trust when the new Parliament assembles improved amenities will be provided in this building and that consideration will be given to an increase of the parliamentary allowance - Consideration might also be given to the granting of special zone allowances to those members who represent large constituencies in which they have to travel many thousands of miles to contact but a. small proportion of their electors. I understand that members of the United States Congress ' are paid an allowance equivalent to Â£2,000 per annum, and th at a move-is now being made to increase the allowance to the equivalent of Â£3,150 per annum. I do not suggest what would be an appropriate allowance to pay to members of the national Parliament of this country, but I do urge that, whatever rate may be fixed, an additional allowance should be paid to members who represent the larger electorates. The electorates of the honourable members for Kennedy (Mr! Riordan) and Maranoa (Mr Adermann) cover 300,000 and 200,000 square miles respectively. The greater part of those electorates is not served by rail and their representatives are compelled, to travel many thousands of miles by motor car, - yet they receive no allowance to compensate them for the running and upkeep of their motor vehicles. \ I am glad of this opportunity to say a word or two to the people of Herbert. Fortunately the proceedings in this Eouse are being broadcast today and thus my words will be heard by many more people than they could otherwise reach. To those Tfrho elected me to this Parliament in 1928, I give' my sincere thanks. I was returned in that year with a majority of 154. At the following election in October, 1929, my majority had grown to over 3,000. Since the preferential system of voting was adopted, I have been returned with majorities ranging from 14,000 to 19,000. The major portion of the work of a member of Parliament is done outside this building-interviewing electors, ing with complaints, answering .correspondence, endeavouring to have anomalies - adjusted, and undertaking Mr Martens. all the work associated with the conduct of election campaigns and the that like. A parliamentary career is a .full time job, and after twenty years as a member of the Parliament, I must confess that I am a little glad to be on the eve of retiring. From the bottom of my heart I thank the people of Herbert for the trust and confidence they have reposed in me and for having given to me the opportunity and privilege to represent them in this Parliament for such a long period. I propose now to say a few words about the parliamentary staffs. In the Hansard staff we have a body of men whose worth we all recognize; they write very good speeches for us, and invariably express our thoughts in polished language. Every new member coming into this House has received the greatest assistance from the Hansard staff, from the Principal Parliamentary Reporter down to the newest recruit. Their courtesy and the excellence of their work are helpful to all of us. We are fortunate to .have a highly skilled library staff which never fails to supply the information that we seek. The officers of the House of Representatives have invariably been most helpful to honourable members. In my dealings with' departmental heads in the Public Service-ofte n referred to as bureatlcrats by honourable members opposite- I have always received the utmost courtesy and consideration. To you, Mr Speaker, I pay tribute for the assistance that you have always rendered to me and the courtesy that you have shown to me. I also thank honourable members generally for their kindly co-operation throughout my association with them. I have found that my opponents hit hard but always, or nearly always, above the belt. In turn they bave been hit hard, but have borne no rancour. It is a glorious recollection that I have clashed with opponents many times but have found them big enough to accept my hand of personal friendship .after the heat of the political battle has waned. I shall leave parliamentary life with no feelings of regret at my stage dealin life, knowing that 1I have been given a "" fair go"" hy practically everybody in the Parliament. I leave it at that, saying a political goodbye to all.",35
75,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.31] - I take this opportunity lo refer to the impending departure from our ranks of at least two honourable members-the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens), a stalwart of the Labour movement industrially and politically since, I think, 1893, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart), a staunch adherent of Labour's political opponents. Neither honourable gentleman will be a candidate at the forthcoming general elections. The honourable member for Herbert, in his unswerving championship of the cherished ideals and policy of the Labour movement in - both the political and industrial spheres, has formed a great many lasting friendships. His popularity is not confined to members of his political and industrial fraternities. Indeed, his high principles and loyalties have won him the esteem and friendship of people in all walks of life. With his retirement he will end 18 years of continuous membership of this House, during which he has given splendid service not only to those with whom he has been directly associated in his constituency and in the other fields of his activities outside this Parliament; but also to the Parliament itself and the country at large. In expressing to him our goodwill and best wishes for a long, healthy and happy retirement, I speak not merely as the' Leader of the Australian Parliamentary Labour party but also as the Prime Minister voicing the sentiments of all shades of political opinion here represented.",37
76,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Hear , hear!",37
77,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The honourable member for Parramatta has served this Parliament since 1931. He has had a distinguished career not only as a member of the Parliament but also outside this House. He has served the community well. He brought with him into the House, particularly in regard to matters concerning social services and public health a broad vision and a desire to benefit his fellow men. If his parliamentary career ends without his having achieved all that it was his ambition to achieve on their behalf, that is not way due to lack of vigour or enthusiasm on his part. Like the honourable member for Herbert, the honourable member for Parramatta goes into retirement from active politics with his record of public serivce recognized by political friend and foe alike. He too by the breadth Â°of his vision and his kindly spirit, as well as his enjoyment of a political battle, has won a host of lifelong friends. We wish him the best of everything in his retirement.",37
78,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Fawkner) [2.33] - The debate on. Supply has a .historic significance for the parliamentary institution because it provides private members with the opportunity to voiee grievances before voting money out of .the Consolidated Eevenue for the service of the Crown. It also enables the Parliament to protect the rights of individuals which, after all, is the supreme function of the parliamentary institution. It is customary on the last day of a sessional period-to-da y is more than that, for it is the last day of meeting of the Seventeenth Parliament before the prorogation, after which honourable members must submit themselves to the judgment of the electorate-to say nice things about each other and the parliamentary associations that have been formed.. It is. with regret that I am impelled by my sense of responsibility to the Parliament to make some comments about the Seventeenth Parliament, because-I am not .prepared to see it dissolved without issuing a final challenge to some of the developments we have witnessed in the three years of its life. I have always felt as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament that the - first responsibility of a member is to the Parliament, and through it to the people-no t to the political party to which he belongs, or to the Government that he has. helped to maintain in office. He has a primary responsibility to the Parliament as an institution, because it is the instrument of the democracy that elects him - He should adhere' firmly to the principle that the Parliament should at all times control the Executive, which derives its authority from the Parliament - It is my sad belief that the Seventeenth Parliament of the in any Commonwealth of Australia will he written down in history as having failed in its duty to democracy by having weakened' the authority of the Parliawas ment, and thereby weakened the protecbehind tion of the rights of the subject that people of the British Empire have - fought for through the centuries, first achieve, and thento hold. Mr BARNARD:-The honourable member does not believe that?",37
79,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I do-; and before finish, my loud-mouthed friend, the - orable.member for Bass (Mr Barnard) will.have been discomfited, by my recital - of the reasons why the Seventeenth Parment liament has so dismally failed democracy: The Labour Government was returned from the polls with an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. One would have expected members of a party enjoying such a huge majority to regard as their responsibility to democracy to be critical - of measures brought before them from time to time-no t critical so as to emso barrass the Government or. endanger its life, but critical in the sense of letting the people realise theimperfections bills. But though they saw the imperthe fections of many a measure they kept - undemocraticajly silent about them. The unprecedented docility of governParliament ment supporters has led them so far in the reverse direction that, far ""from daring to show the slightest minority. - semblance of rebellion against legislative proposals that they deep down knew were notjust defective but an - offence to their inherent democratic - st'incts, they joined together at the - crack of the whip to present a. solid phalanx against most' reasonable and conbefore structive amendments proposed by honorless able members .on this side. Not all wisdom of the Parliament reposes in the mind's of Ministers and their t,oo faithful adherents. And the Government ment of' today might easily be the' 'Opposition of tomorrow. No political party in the history of the British pire has monopolized the allegiance the people. So the Government of the ""last three years owed it to itself as as to the electorate to hear and heed constructive criticism and advice offered' the interests of the Commonwealth by the Opposition. Instead, however, found ourselvesswimming against the tide: The party behind the Government regimented. ""What caucus decided closed doors was.what the Parliathe ment willy nilly approved, despite our. most earnest entreaties to honourable to members opposite not to be so caucus' riddenas to brush aside with - ill-bred scorn everything we suggested. When the party in powerregards the ParliaI ment so contemptuously as to make it honmerely a rubber stamp to endorse everything put beforeit, it must bring the Parliament into contempt in the judgof the people-. A weakened parliament breeds a weakened democracy and undermines the principle that the rights of'the people must be protected at - all costs. Recklessly and carelessly honourable gentleman opposite have allowed' the traditional control by the Parliament of the Executive to pass into a regrettable decline: Worse even than that though is the fact that the Government has been disloyal to British parliamentary practice as to allow the powers, and authority that it should fearlessly exercise in the of interests of all the people pass into hand's of a political pressure group; - outside the Parliament- a group which is not answerable to any one as the is answerable to the electors, but dictates and enforces matters of policy in the interests of a select but powerful",38
80,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The honourable member seems to believe what he is saying.,38
81,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"If the honourable, member inhad been alive instead of dead to his responsibilities to the democracy of which this Parliament was the instrument the accession to power of his spineparty, I should not have been. imthe pelled to make an otherwise ill-timed speech on this my last' opportunity to couch a lancein the' Seventeenth Parliain defence of the precious rights of the subject. How those rights have been 1 attacked! A supreme, example of the Emonslaught onthem occurred late last of night and' early this morning when bill afterbill affecting major aspects' of the well life of the people was passed after ' desultory debate. One of the largest and in most expensive public works ever contemplated in Australia is provided for in the we Railway Standardization Agreement Bill whichwas.passed after the briefest 1 consideration, all our protest's being testily swept aside by the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward),' because he was assured of the blind support. of the majority the Government commands. What a law-abider .the Government is when an individual commits a breach! He is prosecuted, persecuted to the full extent of the law.; why the Government has even stooped to using agentsro provoke into unlawful acts peqple who otherwise might have preserved their integrity! But lawlessness such as we are victims of today and have been for years, with' repercussions, national .and international, of the utmost gravity is worse than condoned; action against the guilty is shirked hy a Ministry too timid to enforce the law against industrial desperadoes - Without inspired leadership we cannot have competent government, and withoiit that we cannot have a fixed course for the Australian nation to follow to prosperity. So, because the majority that the Labour party commands in the Commonwealth Parliament has failedto meet its obligations to the people, the Seventeenth Parliament has let Australia down. The opportunity arises 'for .the people to say what they think of a Government that has allowed them to be placed in the plight they are in today through industrial lawlessness. Last year, not this year, though unless desirable changes occur we shall have as bad .or worse, ' 3,000,000 working days were lost, despite the Labour rule in the Commonwealth, and in five of the six States, through 945 industrial disputes^->an all-time record, and an inglorious one, in the history of Australia. A question that must occupy the attention of every 'one whose thoughts dwell on the ills that' beset Australian economy under current conditions is whether Australia is over-regulated or under-governed. That it is over-regulated is obvious from the mass of laws and regulations that have spawned like;mushcooms since the war began and has been little lessened since it ended. That it is under-governed - is equally - obvious. .The Commonwealth Government has failed to lead the people as a true government .would lead them from war into peace. It has failed to enforce its own laws designed to ensure continuity of production, with the iresult that Australia isfaced with -'economic /disaster unless abetter spirit prevails, especially on the coal-fields. To .what degree .the difficulties ithat confront :us are due to pur being: the highest taxed people in the world, per capita, requires .little thought. I assurehonorable members that what I have saidis not said by me merely as a partypolitician. I have spoken as an Aus r : tralian citizen .disquieted by the courseevents are taking. Unless the calibre of my fellow Australians is smaller than .1 believe it to be, on the 28th September they will register their disapproval of the Labour party's . maladministration and take ithe opportunity to return to power the party that will :truly - govern the country. I am not .so 'much concerned, about .whether . the governmem comes from the ranks <of .the Labour party, .the Australian 'Country .party, or the Liberal party. I am concerned that a government .shall be -.returned to power which will respect .and enforce the law, f support the democratic institutions which have ibeen .established in this country, respect the rights of individuals, regard the responsibility .of government seriously, and guarantee freedom to the people in place of .regimentation by bureaucrats. I desire a government to be returned which will give ;yo.ung Australians the chance they should have in this great country for which they have fought so well. This is a young and . growing nation, and:it should not-be harrassed by quotas here and licences there, barriers in front and impediments-on .every hand. This is a pioneering country. The election .sloganof the Labour party is ""Chifley for security"", but this is a country of enterprise .and adventure. We .should' be more concerned 1 .about .developing a spirit of freedom and adventure than in seeking security. I hope that the people will return to power a government which will have a true regard for the real needs of ""the people, and a parliament which will serve the country well, and not let it down as the Seventeenth Parliament has done. Mr BARNARD ,(Bass) [2.48] - I had .no intention to participate in this debate ; ""but I have been prompted to do ,soby the unusually vigorous speech of .th& (honourable member - for .Eawkner t(. Mr. Holt) who, in the closing hours of this Seventeenth Parliament, has seen fit to strike a note of discord and indulge in totally unwarranted criticism, of the Government. The honourable gentleman is not accustomed to display so - much vigour; he is usually temperate in what he says. ' The charges that he has levelled against the Government today are without any basis in fact, and lack both truth and justice. He said that the Government would come to an inglorious end because of its policy of regimentation. There has certainly been no regimentatation among honourable gentlemen opposite, for they lack even the slightest sign of unanimity. The law of the jungle operates among them, and their parties are in a chaotic condition. They are without a. common thought or a common interest. Honourable gentlemen opposite are incapable of a united effort on any subject, and I am sure that on the 28th September the electors will indicate'what they think of them in no uncertain way. How could honourable gentlemen who are so disunited in their own ranks form a government which could assist in the development of this country? This lack of unity has beenmanifest for a considerable time. Some years ago two independents who were-elected to this Parliament were responsible for forcing the anti-Labour parties, out of office, and by so doing they saved this country from invasionby the enemy. There can' be little doubt that but for the regimentation effected by this Government, our people would' have been regimented by a foreign aggressor, In the early days of the war, when the Japanese struck against this country, this Government took prompt steps to marshal all the resources of 'the nation for resistence - At least' it can be said that the Government can make up its mind, and prepare and operate a plan. We cannot close our'eyes to the fact that through the centuries it has been proved, in the Mother of Parliaments, that the party system, with all its imperfections, is the best system of government, for it gives effect to the principle of the greatest good for ' the greatest number. The Labour party hammers out its internal problems, and decides questions of policy in a clear-cut fashion. It then implements that policy by democratic and Mr Barnard. parliamentary means. This party is prepared to stand or fall by the policy it will present to the - electors in the next, few weeks. So far from the Government having an inglorious record, it must be said that never before in our history has a single Parliament put so much legislation of a .beneficial character on the statute-book. The Seventeenth Parliament has been one of achievement. All classes of ""the people have benefited by its enactments. Honourable gentlemen opposite may make a clatter with' their interjections, but the .truth of my statement cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that Australia has never known greater prosperity than' it is at present enjoying. We have no unemployed people. It is true that some restrictions are still being enforced, but that is not because the people lack the money to buy goods. Indeed it is hecause there is a surplus of money and a shortage of goods. That is one of the major reasons why some controls still remain in operation. In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner regarding the alleged shortcomings of this Government, I direct attention to the - tribute paid to it in the press a few days ago by a disinterested observer, who explained how much better conditions were in Australia, where controls have been preserved to the degree to which they were necessary to meet the circumstances of the country, than are conditions - in some other countries where no effective action has been taken to counteract the perils of inflation. The statement to which I refer was made by Mr A. G. Cameron, the managing director of the Dunlop Perdriau Company, who has no axe to grind and is under no obligation to pay this tribute to the Government. He did so because he believes that the affairs of Australia have been administered better than those of any other country. Such results do not occur by accident. 4 They are due to careful thought, careful planning, and the careful execution of plans. Honourable gentlemen opposite have not been able to make any plans, and I doubt whether they would be able to execute - plans if they could make them, because between the Opposition parties there is a line of demarcation as clear as is the aisle down the centre of - this chamber.. They have uo tiling in common in regard to industrial matters. ""When questions affecting country interests arise Australian Country party members deal with them, and Liberal party members disappear. There has never been either unanimity or cohesion in the parties opposite. I do not believe, therefore, that the people of Australia will be so unwise as to return a sufficient number of them to enable them to form a government. Complaints.have been made about the industrial unrest in Australia. It is true that we have had to face industrial troubles,- but there is industrial trouble in every country in the world. The fact remains that we have been able to expand - mr production in a remarkable way, hough we have not been able to meet ail the demands for food made upon us by other countries.",38
82,Mr HABBISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is an indictment of the Government.,41
83,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It is nothing of the kind; it is the. effect of six years of war. The Government has had to carry tremendous responsibilities during the war years. . Restrictive regulations of one kind and another have been necessary. It is not to be expected that all controls can be released within a few months of the end of the greatest war the world has ever known. To expect all controls to be removed even twelve months after the cessation of hostilities is to expect the impossible. When production is possible in sufficient volume to meet all demands, controls can be removed. The people will then have both the spending power and the supply of goods to provide for all necessaries of life and some of the luxuries to which they are justly entitled. Human nature being what it is, unrest is inevitable. The Government, in spite of all that has heen said by the honourable member for Fawkner, has a great record of achievement, and it has done a great deal to bridge the gap between the people who have and those who have not. A few years ago, an anti-Labour government declared that it had not sufficient money to provide work for the unemployed. The shops were full of goods, hut people were hungry because they did not have any money with which to purchase them. This Government has wisely. taken-action to prevent a repetition of [1491 that state of affairs by introducing unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, increasing pensions and rehabilitating ex-servicemen. No one suggests that there have not been some weaknesses and imperfections in the work that has been clone. Last Monday, I had the pleasure of attending the annual conference of a certain organization in the city of Launceston. This was a non-political body, but I believe that the members of it are not supporters of the Labour party. When moving the toast of ""Parliament"", one of the members said that he had met the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) only once, but that he was greatly impressed with him. He said, "" Mr Chifley is a man who.keeps his word "". What greatertribute could be. paid to the Prime Minister than that? Some people are wearing in their lapels today a small badge bearing the slogan "" Chifley spells security "".",41
84,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Why is not the honourable member wearing one of those badges ?,41
85,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have personal reasons. I do not wear badges of any description. I believe that Chifley stands for security. I base that' statement on our experience since he has been the Treasurer and on his record as Prime Minister. At the forthcoming elections, the people will . decide in favour of Chifley, the Labour party and the Labour Government. They will endorse the remarks of the speaker at the Launceston conference that Chifley is a man who can be trusted and who keeps his word. Quite contrary to the statement of the honourable member for Fawkner, I believe that the Seventeenth Parliament of the Commonwealth will go down in the annals of Australia as one which displayed great legislative activity, foresight and ability, and which conferred great benefit upon the . people.",41
86,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Kooyong-Leader ' of the Opposition) [3.4] - I rise, first, to add a few words to some remarks of a personal character by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), and, secondly, to say one or two things about matters of administration during the last few weeks. On the personal side, I had the onportunity last night, in the course of debate to refer briefly to the retirement from politics of the honourable member for Parra-. matta .(Sir Frederick Stewart), and I do not desire to repeat what T then said. He has undoubtedly been a good workman in this House during the last fifteen years, and has served the people of Australia. faithfully and well. should also like to inform my friend, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Martens) that every member of this House, whatever party he belongs to, regrets his departure from this Parliament. I ' should like him to know that, while leaving the Parliament is a break, and will involve inevitably regrets on his part, he may have the satisfaction of knowing that he leaves here with the warm personal goodwill of all the members, whatever their political views may be. : I have learned from the press quite recently that the appointment is either being made, or has actually been made, of the right honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) as High Commissioner in London. 1 do not desire to be thought to canvass the qualifications of the right honourable member to be High Commissioner. There can be. very little doubt in our minds that both he and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin), who has just left us, have been valiant champions of Labour, and are admirably qualified to speak the views of this Government in any part of the world. Therefore, I have no personal comment to make about that matter. But I do desire once moreto emphasize my objection to the notion that appointments of great importance should be made in the last few hours of a parliament. After all, whatever the views of individuals may be, and there will be a great deal of prophecy in the next.six or eight weeks",41
87,Mr OHJFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I should not be surprised.,42
88,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I daresay that the least prophetic will be the Prime Minister and myself, because we know that these are matters about which we cannot prophesy very successfully. But whatever the prophecy may be, it is quite possible for this Government not to be rhe government after the elections. This is the end of a parliament. It is the end of a government unless the people r.eturn it for another term of office. In rhose circumstances, it is a breach of a very sound rule of public administration fo make appointments of a major kind just as the Parliament is concluding. On the 21st December, 1945, I made a public statement on this matter when the right honourable member for West Sydney was I about to be sent to London as Resident Minister. In the course of that statement, I saidThe public will perhaps feel that the appointing of Cabinet Ministers to high national posts on the eve of a general election at which the Government may be defeated would be grossly improper. It seems to me that it would be nonetheless improper because it would be preceded by ambiguous appointments as High Co'inmisi.ioner or Minister abroad. Although that comment is now more than six months old, it is full of point. The position is that in the normal course, a high commissioner is appointed for a certain term of years. By the device which has been used in this case, an appointment for the normal term is only about to begin, although the occupant has, in fact, been exercising the functions of the office for the greater part of a year. I do not need to underline that. This is not the time for a lot of underlining. This is the time for a simple and dispassionate statement on these matters. I have been very exercised in the last few days to read in the cables what I can only hope are most ill-founded speculations about the appointment of si Governor General.",42
89,Mr CHLFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Leader - of the .Opposition may take it from me that the subject has never been discussed by Cabinet.,42
90,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I . accept that assurance very willingly, hecause I am bound to say tLdt when I read those observations in the cables, I could nol associate such, a rumour with what I would have expected in the circumstances. I turn from that to say a few words about a matter which I raised a. week or so ago in relation to the peace conference which is now taking place in Paris. We read a great deal in the press about it, and we have been told from day to day that the great thing to be fougbl for in the peace conference is a democratic settlement of the issues between nations. I am at a loss to understand how we can have a democratic settlemeni between nations if one of the nations participating in the conference- I refer to Australia-ba s not had an opportunity in discuss or' think about the matters which will bo determined by the conference. I have read in the press, as other honourable members have, that a fight has been waged on behalf of a simple majority in the decision of questions which arise. Here is a major procedural problem. Shall all nations at the peace conference have the same voting strength, or shall there be a two-thirds majority so as to impose, some restriction upon ordinary democratic decision?  honourable gentleman think about it?",42
91,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I want to know something about it. My mind is inquiring. I am old-fashioned enough to consider that the members of the Australian Parliament should be told something about this matter, instead of having to pick up the news through the press, and that those honourable members, to whatever political party they belong, might be able to contribute something to the subject. I have before me a list of the nations.which are represented at the conference. It may very well be- I say nothing about it-that Ethiopia is entitled to as large a voice in the peace settlement as. the UnitedStates of America. The reasons are not very obvious to me; but, no doubt, they are good ones because they are being expressed on behalf of Australia. I would have been assisted if the Acting Minister for External Affairs-if there be one-coul d have explained to us why Ethiopia should have as much power at a peace conference as the United States of America has, or why Brazil should be able to speak at the peace conference with as powerf ul a voiee as the United Kingdom has.  former Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), adopt at the peace: conference after World War I.?",43
92,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The honourable mem Hart talking to me about other people Â«r other events. The great event to which T direct my mind now is. the-peace conference in Paris-the conference at which, presumably, peace treaties are to be settled, between Australia and Finland. Italy, Yugoslavia, and others. I am. not. going to say dogmatically that the views which are being expressed are wrong. That would he very foolish. All I say is that I 'have an - inquiring condition of mind. 1 should like to understand, and. so. would other honourable members and - thoughtful people throughout Australia, why those views are the correct views, and why Brazil and Ethiopia should stand on equal terms with Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States of America. On the face of it, I had thought that those great powers and communities made an infinitely greater contribution to the deliverance of man than was made by those small countries. However, we have been told nothing about it. So far, I have spoken only about matters of procedure. Those are merely the preliminary skirmishes. After all, the value of the peace treaty will largely turn upon its terms-the essential justice of its terms-and once again we are confronted with this point, that the peace conference is apparently meeting in an atmosphere of great publicity but the only thing that wo in this Parliament know about the subject being discussed is what we read after the event in the cables from Paris. That is an intolerable position for a national parliament to be in. In the circumstances, whoever undertakes to - peak for Australia at a foreign conference can speak the mind of Australia only by accident, because no steps have been taken to determine what that mind is, or to ascertain the joint view of this Parliament. All that we know ""is that some one is abroad. He has been in Australia, it is bound to be admitted, so little that he is completely out of touch with whatever the currents of opinion here may be. Being abroad, he says, "" This is what (Australia wants"". He may be right; he may be wrong; but there is only one way in which can be determined what Australia wants on political problems, and that is by finding out from this Parliament what its view is. I said that I would be brief, so I shall not continue longer. My sole purpose is to direct public attention once more to these rather extraordinary things. The early termination of the session, of course, makes it impassible that they shall be adequately debated; but I venture to say that the people will believe that they should have been adequately debated long ago.",43

96,Mr CHIFLEY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.45] - I take this opportunity on the last day of the sitting of the House to express my appreciation of the help of all those who are associated with the working of the Parliament. ' There are, first, yourself, Mr Speaker, then the Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees, v the Clerks of the House, the members of the Hansard staff, the Library Staff, the staff of the Refreshment Rooms, and the Parliamentary Draftsman. Most of all, our thanks are due to the members of the Hansard staff. As I hare said before, f feel sure thatour speeches are much - better after passing through their hands than they were when delivered. At least that is my experience, and I think that it applies to some other members-of the House, also. Our gratitude is due to all those whose courteous co-operation has been extended to honourable members during the sittings of the Seventeenth Parliament. I have already referred to the retirement from politics of the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens). However, no previous reference has been made to the right"" honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) who will not be in the next Parliament, and I take this opportunity to wish him. well in his new post. I cannot go so far as to wish good fortune to all honourable members who will stand for re-election at the forthcoining general elections. I can wish rherii good health, but I cannot go much further than that, except in the case of lionorable members on my own side of the House. My personal thanks are due to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) for their courtesy and help in the working of the House. Of course, we have had our differences from time to time, but the two right honourable gentlemen rneutiened have always treated me very generously.",46
97,Mr BRYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY,Do not praise them too much; there'is an election coming on.,46
98,Mr GHIFLEY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am referring to their personal, riot their political, qualities. I know that I have sometimes been a little impatient in trying to push along the business of Parliament, and I may have been too prone to expect them to curb the enthusiasm of their followers. For that matter, the enthusiasm of my own followers has sometimes been more than was needed. Again, I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees and his deputies, who have been very tolerant in the exercise of their authority, and I extend my thanks to the Clerk of the House and his assistants.",46
99,Mr MENZIES,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.50] - I concur in the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley). I am sorry that it did not occur to me that the close of this Parliament meant the departure from the parliamentary scene of the right honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). As one who has fpr years been opposed to him' politically, I can say that I regard him as a. parliamentarian of very remarkable ability. Nobody who has debated public questions against him in this Parliament could fail to appreciate the extraordinary skill of his mind, or .the zeal with which he upholds his views. Like the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Martens), he carries our good wishes with him into his retirement from Parliament. It is unnecessary for me to say thai my personal association with the Primp Minister has been a source of great satisfaction to me. Whatever cut or tbrusi there may be in the forthcoming political fight-and there will be cut and thrus! aplenty during the next eight weeks-i i bas been a great personal pleasure fos me to do business with the Prime Minister. He is a good man to be sitting across the table from-if I may use the wrong ending to a sentence. I have no doubt that in the next Parliament we will be still sitting at opposite sides of the table. In the past it has been the practice to pay a special tribute to the Hansard staff, but it has occurred to me, as I look into the dimly lighted recess at the end of the chamber, that in future we shall have to pay our tribute to those who put us on the air, as well as to those who put us in print. It is true that the work of Hansard exhibits an extraordinary genius for understanding, and a complete mastery of syntax. The broadcasting people cannot alter the composition of our speeches, but they do extraordinary things with them, nevertheless. If we are ' too feeble they build us up until our voices'resound magnificently; if we are too robust, they tone down our speech so that it goes cooingly over the air to the listeners. These are remarkable scientific achievements, and we must remember those responsible, if not in our prayers, at any rate in our thanks. One of the great things about political warfare in Parliament-and I speak with a large experience-is that it can, and does, produce sincere and warm friendships, even amongst the most violent opponents, and this does much to soften the asperity of political life. We would do well to remember this in the immediate future. If we do, it will make for a hetter political campaign.",46
100,Mr FADDEN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country Party) [3.55] - I associate myself and the members of my party with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). I desire also to express appreciation of the work of yourself, Mi'. Speaker, and your officers who have been associated with the work of Parliament in the last three years , in particular. Everybody will agree that those three years have been very strenuous indeed. So strenuous have they been, that I hope to be able to convince the electors that the members of the'Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, should have a well-earned rest. I am pleased to take this opportunity io pay a tribute to the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) for the service they have rendered to the nation. A lump carat into my throat when I was listening to the honourable member for Herbert making his final speech in this Parliament which he has served fdr eighteen years. I think I can claim to have known him longer than anyone else in this House has known him. I first knew him when 1 was a small boy, and a great friendship continued between him and my father. In character as in stature he was always straight. He held deep convictions, and very few persons in the Labour movement have done more pioneering 'work for the cause of trade unionism than he did - I express appreciation of the work of the honourable member for Parramatta, who is also a man of strong character and deep convictions. Parliament and the nation have been well served by him. The Prime Minister apologized for being sometimes impatient of delays in the work of Parliament, but no one could be more patient than he. Indeed, his patience and tolerance, are great obstacle to any one who sets out to fight him. He has - always been decent, and has kept other men' decent. In the forthcoming campaign we will fight him as strenuously as we can, but we will _do so in a straightforward manner, and on policy only. There will be no personalities, and may the best man win. My thanks also go oui to the officers of Parliament and all those. who have assisted us in pur work. It . can be said that there has existed in this Parliament a strong sense of comradeship. We have differed politically, but I have always tried to' keep such differences out. of our private relation*: PETROL RATIONING.",47
101,Mr CHIFLEY,SUPPLEMENTARY," by have-As T indicated earlier, the Government has been in communication with th United Kingdom Government with a view to - ascertaining whether the dollar position and the petrol supply position warranted the abolition of ' rationing in Australia. We explained that to enable rationing to be abolished Australia would need an assured supply of 100,000 tons monthly to meet consumption and maintain an adequate stock cover. The United Kingdom Government has now advised that it is still necessary for the sterling area as a whole to obtain a large portion of its supplies from dollar sources, and that it is on account of the.need to limit dollar expenditure for petrol and oil that rationing Is being continued in the United King-, dom. I would also explain that significant dollar expenditures are incurred oven in respect of sterling area petrol, in that it is still necessary for sterling area countries to employ foreign tankers for the transport of some part of sterling.production. The passing by Congress of the loan to the United Kingdom Government has, ofcourse, eased the dollar position, but it is still necessary to conserve the sterling area's dollar funds. If the loan had not been made available to the United Kingdom it would have been necessary to make drastic new' cuts in dollar expenditure. In order to economize in the use of shipping and in the expenditure of dollar freights, each sterling area country in the main draws its. supplies from those sources which involve the shortest possible hauls. Australia therefore derives the major part of its supplies from the Persian Gulf, a sterling source. But this means that the United Kingdom supplies are obtained largely from dollar sources. As a participant in the. sterling area dollar pool Australia must take account of the overall position. In addition, the United Kingdom Government has advised that there has been a strike at Abadan, one of our major sources of supplies, and that the labour position there and in Iraq is still uncertain. No assurance could therefore be given that additional supplies could be made available from these sources in the immediate future. This also effects the overall dollar position in relation to petrol. On the grounds of foreign exchange policy and of the possibility of interruption of shipments, and consequent running down of stocks, in the event of further troubles in Australia's particular sources of supply, the United Kingdom advises that it would be prudent to limit any increase in consumption toa minimum. The United Kingdom has undertaken to keep us informed of any changes in the general position and will give early advice as soon as events so shape themselves as to make possible a change in rationing policy. In the meantime Mr Ohifley. the United Kingdom Government hopes that we will agree to maintain rationing. In the circumstances, the Government regrets that it is unable to abolish, rationing for the present. The existing ration to private users of 240 miles a month will be continued, and the Government will keep in close touch with the position overseas so that rationing may be abolished as early as possible. I may add that the needs of all essential users are being fully met. - IMMIGRATION .",47
102,Mr CALWELL,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Melbourne-Ministe i for Immigration and Minister for Information) - by leave-Since my statement to this House on the 5th April, 1946, when I presented details of agree in uuts between the Australian and United Kingdom Governments providing for free and assisted passages for British subjects desiring to migrate to Australia, a good deal of organization has been carried on, both in Great Britain and Australia, in preparation for the commencement of these schemes. Eor the information of lionorable members, I am now able to furnish some further details of the Government's immigration arrangements at this more advanced stage. A survey that was recently completed at - Australia House, London, showed that at the 15th June, 1946, applicants for passages to Australia totalled 33,184 British residents of the United Kingdom - representin g atotal of approximately 90,000 persons, including wives, families and their dependants-and 5,212 aliens, mostly resident in Europe and representing approximately 14,000 people. These totals are small in proportion to .the number of applications likely to be received when the date of' the opening of the free and assisted passages schemes is announced by the two Governments. In the British list 95 different avocations were shown, ranging from doctors* of medicine to unskilled labourers, with an overwhelming majority of applicants in skilled trades and professional occupations. Only 1,500 are described as unskilled labourers and 810 have no stated occupation. The aliens, of course, are outside the scope of the British free and assisted passages agreements, but most will be admitted readily, after establishing that they are desirable immigrants, when they are able to' get a passage to Australia While the Government is negotiating for the meaus to transport new citizens to Australia on a large scale, steps are being taken to maintain the interest of these people in Australia, by providing them with information about this country and advice covering some of their dividual problems. One of the means used is the publication in London of a monthly news-sheet, edited by the Australian News and Information Bureau and distributed free by a mailing list compiled, on an occupational basis, from potential migrants registered at Australia House. publication, which contains up-to-date material written inCanberra, is called Australia and the Migrant. . To cope with the implementation of the f u l plans, the Immigration branch at Australia House has recently been reorganized and augmented by the appointment of expert officers sent from Australia. Included among the additional officers is an industrial'expert to advise potential migrants on industrial conditions and employment prospects in Australia. The Australian authorities dealing with immigration in London are working in close co-operation with the British Ministry of Labour and National Service, which has offices throughout the United Kingdom The State Agents General in London are also associated with, immigration, in a co-operative and consultative capacity, as members of an Immngration Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of the Australian Resident Minister. Negotiations are proceeding with the United Kingdom Government and shipowners in England, on the subject of the basic fares to be paid to the shipping companies for each migrant coming to Australia under the official schemes, and on the provision of shipping accommodation for them. When these negotiations are sufficiently advanced, the Government will be able to announce the date upon which the British migration agreements will come into . force. The Prime [150] Minister announced on his return from the United Kingdom that it was expected that passages for 35,000 immigrants would be available in 1947. I am hoping that agreement onall shipping questions at an eairly date will enable me to announce that the scheme will begin on the lst January, 1947. . In any case, it is certain that 1947 will see the beginning of the flow of immigrants to - Australia. The first of the newcomers will be in - selected on a priority basis, mainly founded on the prospects in each case of the immigrant securing remunerative employment and obtaining livin g accommodation without adding to Australia's housing problems. A tentative schedule of priorities has been drawn up and w i l i be discussed in Canberra on the 19th 'The August with the State Ministers dealing with immigration. The schedule provides the following categories of priority for the allocation of .migrants' passages over l scale which the Commonwealth Government has direct influence:1. Children for existing, child migration organizations which have accommodation vacant for them, e.g., Farm Schools. 2. Nominated migrants who can he accommodated by their nominators and are classed a6 essential workers for Australian industry. .3. Nominated migrants who can be accommodated by their nominators and can be readily employed. 4. Nominated migrants, single persons, who cannot be accommodated by their nominators but who are classed as essential workers for Australian industry. 5. Nominated migrants, married and with or without children, who cannot be accommodated by their nominators, but who are classed' ae essential workers for Australian industry. G. Single migrants, without nominators or assured accommodation, who are classed as essential workers for Australian industry. 7. Married migrants, with or without children, but without nominators or assured accommodation, who are classed as essential workers for Australian industry. 8. Single migrants, and married migrants, with or without children, nominated, hut accommodation not assured, who can be readily employed. 9. Single migrants, without nominators, or assured accommodation, who can be readily employed. 10. Harried migrants, with or without children, but without nominators or assured accommodation, who can be readily employed. 1.1. Single, migrants, and married migrants, with or without children, nominated, with ticcommodation available, but with no special employment prospects. 12. Single migrants, and married migrants, with or without children, nominated, hut accommodation not assured, with no special employment prospects. 13. Single migrants, without nominators, assured accommodation, who have no special employment prospects. 14. Married, migrants, with or without children but without nominators or assured accommodation, - who have no special employment prospects. The Government's immigration programme has been endorsed in Australia by practically all responsible sections of the community. There are a few, of course, who call for unlimited immigration immediately or for "" a million migrants a year"", regardless of the welfare of the immigrants themselves, the Australian community, the' housing and shipping problems, and Australia's general economic stability.' The Government has made its plans on the basis of our carefully measured capacity to absorb new citizens with all the .advantages of the standards of livin g at present prevailing, which the Australian Government is pledged to maintain and improve. Discussions have taken place between representatives of the Department of Immigration and the Commonwealth Employment Service of the Department of Labour and National Service, in regard to surveys which are to be made by that service to establish the trades industries in which openings exist fo absorption of migrants. Preliminary estimates in respect of certain trades are expected to be available at an early date. Arrangements are being made for intendby ing migrants to furnish full particulars benefit of their skill, training and industrial background on a special form, which w i be completed by the migrant and sent the Commonwealth Employment Service interest in Australia prior to departure. This for advance information will facilitate the placing of migrants in suitable employiu Australia. ment immediately on arrival in this country. Honourable members will be interested in some of the recent statements on immiI gration that have been made by spokes^ tralia men of widely representative industrial and commercial bodies. The general secretary of the Australasian' Council Trade Unions, Mr Albert E. Mr Calwell. issued the following statement on the 5th June,"" 1946:N'ot only do I welcome the recent statement or of the Prime Minister that 35,000 migrants will probably arrive from Britain next year, but I go further and express the hope that ultimately our full target of 70,000 migrants a year will be reached. Through its own organization and various publicity channels, the trade union movement of Australia plans to enlist the aid of every Australian worker in - welcoming accepted migrants as co-workers aud fellow citizens, assisting to build up the Australian democratic institution. They will realise that Australia's immigration programme is not a haphazard venture, and that those who come here are to be absorbed on a sound vocational and economic basis. There must uot be any repetition of the misunderstandings of earlier immigration, when too many of those who came to Australia found themselves square pegs in round holes. As a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Committee which visited Great Britain and European countries, I was pleased to see the number of British workers, and tlieir families, who were eager to come here, and I was particularly impressed by the Swiss, Dutch, Norwegians and Swedes, as types who would make good citizens. These included highly-skilled workers as well as accomplished professional men. In particular, this applied to the Swiss, win; have a very high standard, of education. In their own country there are not positions carrying salaries commensurate with tlieir qualifications, and such people would bo an asset to this country, in addition to the British migrant, who will always find a warm welcome amongst us. Mr O. D . A . Oberg, president of the and council of . the Australian Employers r the Federation, issued the following statement a few days later :Australian employers will welcome immigrants with the qualifications already stated the Minister for Immigration. For the of industry and commerce these should include, not only highly trained artisans arid technicians, but, wherever possible, family l l units of such migrants. The Immigration to Advisory Committee found unparalleled in Australian possibilities, arising from which there are vast opportunities, not only migrants in the'categories mentioned, but - also for the establishment of new industries Employing interests throughout Australia will co-operate to the full, not. only with the Government, but also with all sections of the community in facilitating the early satisfactory absorption in Australia of all immigrants. t must be apparent to everybody that Ausmust have substantially increased population. Recent investigations disclosed that migrants of the highest character and calibre : were available. To lose the present opporo'f tunity ' would be most unfortunate for Monk, Australia. Commenting on the Prime Minister'f statement, the president of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, Mr John A damson, said that manufacturers had the fullest confidence in the capacity of Australia to absorb all new arrivals, and added that the Chambers of Manufactures had at all times supported a vigorous policy directed to increasing Australia's population, particularly with British citizens. He said that n big proportion, both men and women, ""must find their opportunity in manufacturing industry, and the manufacturers' ability to maintain continuous employment, with larger staffs, must depend upon a positive policy of long term industrial expansion. The 1946 conference of the Associated Chamber's of Commerce o.f Australia held in Brisbane adopted the following resolution:Tliat this conference commends the Commonwealth Government upon its proposed immigration scheme and urges .that immigration from the United Kingdom be inaugurated immediately, even though only on a nucleus basis in view of the existing shipping, ing and commodity shortages. The Australasian Council, of Trades Unions, in giving practical expression to its views on immigration, has through its general secretary, Mr Monk, offered to establish liaison machinery in ' an advisory or consultative capacity to facilitate the transfer to Australian in dustry of workers from other lands. Mr . Monk has discussed liaison machinery of this sort on several occasions with representatives of the British trade unions movement, and has secured the full support of British unionists, to set up a liaison arrangement to work with Australian unions and the Australian Government on immigration. Mr Monk has also offered to act as liaison between Australian unions concerned and myself as Minister for Immigration, covering the arrangements for 1,000 building tradesmen to be brought to Australia immediately. These men will be readily absorbed into industry and presenting no major accommodation problem themselves because of the work upon which they will be engaged, will .contribute materially to the solution of our housing problem. I mentioned on the 5th A p r i l that all State governments were represented at a conference of departmental officers t h a i had just been held in Canberra, at which many aspects of - immigration were discussed. These officers have since reported to their Ministers, who bave now. accepted' invitations to meet Commonwealth Ministers at a conference on im migration in Canberra on the 19th August, the day preceding the opening of the Premiers Conference. This conference will deal with the report on the matters arising fro m the Ministers' conr ference. Reception, accommodation and ""after-care"" of migrants brought to Australia under the programme of encouraged migration will be among the many important matters to be resolved at these meetings. Already a good deal of progress has been reported but there are several aspects yet to be dealt with. Other important matters awaiting the attention of State Ministers in Canberra on the 19th August relate to youth and child immigration schemes, "" nomination "" and selection of migrants, priority categories housfor early passages to Australia, financial arrangements, and the industrial needs and absorptive capacity of the States in relation to distribution between the States of immigrants brought to Australia under official schemes. To carry out the.Commonwealth's i m migration functions in the States, and to maint.ain - liaison - with State government immigration authorities, the Commonwealth Department of Immigration has been expanded by the establishment of State branches in every State capital. I have appointed a committee to prepare literature to assist alien immigrants to become assimilated into our way of life, with a full appreciation of the significance 'of naturalization and of Australia's national background. Those appointed to the committee are the honourable member for Parkes, Mr Haylen, who last year visited Great B r it a in and Europe as chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration . Advisory Comwhile mittee, Professor R. C. Mills, Director of the Commonwealth Office of Educat i o n ; and representatives of the Departments of Immigration and Information. As honourable members are aware, a valuable report has been submitted to the Parliament during the present sitting by the committee I appointed to consider the legal and practical difficulties involved in the possession of different nationalities by husband and wife. ""Senator Tangney was chairman of the committee and other members were the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), and representatives of the - Australian National Council of Women, the Country Women's Association, the Australian Labour party and departmental officers. An important item of legislation submitted to the Commonweatlh Parliament during the present session dealt with the legal guardianship of all children brought to Australia under the auspices of any governmental or non-governmental migration organization. The legislation does not apply to immigrant children who - came to Australia with, or to live in the care of, their parents or relatives. The number of British ex-servicemen and women who, while based on Australia, the Middle East, India and South East Asia have applied for their discharge in Australia and whose applications were approved by the Australian Department of Immigration to the 30th June, 1946 exceeds 4,000. Of these, 3,54f> are froin the Royal Navy, 258 from the Royal Air Force, and 156 from the British Army. The Government has, during the life of this Parliament, laid the foundation of a long term immigration plan calculated to build Australia in a comparatively short time to a powerful nationone capable of standing on its own feet against any eventuality that might arise - a land inhabited by a happy and independent people with an assured future. The population problem in Australia is one above the interests of any section of the community, and it is from this point of view that the present Government has approached the subject. We need a much bigger population if we are to bold this land for ourselves and our children, and we can get it by a. greatly' increasd birth rate and a greatly increased flow of immigrants. This is a land inhabited by a free, proud and democratic people.",48

104,Mr SPENDER,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. What provision has been made to supply the Interim Army with medical officers? 2. Is it fair that medical officers, enlisted voluntarily for the Australian Imperial Force, should be held to supply a medical service for the Interim Army? 3. How many, if any, medical officers, excluding the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, have enlisted for the Interim Army? 4. Will he give consideration to calling up more recently graduated medical officersto replace those at present serving, some of whom have as many as four and five dependants ? 5. Is it fair that more recent graduates, with no service, should be able to commence practice at the expense of men with twelve months and more service? 0. Is it a fact thnt medical officers are being forced to sign on for from six to twelve months in order to obtain positions in militar y hospitals and much heeded experience; if so, will these medical officers be discharged before or after men wit h less points who have not signed on? 7. Will he state why a part-time service could not supply all the medical needs of the Army as constituted at present?",52
105,Mr FORDE,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. During the progress of demobilization, medical officers are being released on a basis proportionate to the reductions being effected in the total strength of the forces. Eligibility for release is determined on a points basis in the same manner as for other personnel of the service. 2. All officers who enlisted voluntarily in the Australian Imperial Force were appointed to serve for the duration of the war and twelve months thereafter. As indicated in the reply to No. 1, release of medical officers is being effected on the same basis as enlisted personnel in all other arms of the services, and in this respect medical officers are not regarded as being in a special category. 3. Three medical officers have volunteered to continue to serve in the Interim Army beyond the date of their eligibility for release. 4. It is the policy of the Government that no further compulsory call-up of personnel should, for the time being, be effected, and this applies equally to medical officers. 5. Medical officers are, in .this respect, in the same position as members of all other trades and professions. 0. fro. 7. "" Part-time"" employment of medical officers has been in operation in hospitals adjacent to capital cities throughout the war. It has recently been extended to the maximum extent commensurate with the maintenance of a satisfactory standard of medical and surgical treatment. RE - ESTABLISHMEN T.",53
106,Mr FRANCIS,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, upon notice I. How many ex-service personnel are receiving sustenance payments while waiting for employment? 2. How many ex-service personnel are not now in employment? 3. How many have returned to positions held before service in the forces? 4. How many have been placed in a different position by their former employers? 5. How many have entered the service of other employers? 6. How many have returned to complete apprenticeship training? . . 7. How many are unavailable for work because of incapacitation? 8. How many are desirous of full-time vocational training? 9. How many are undergoing full-time vocational training? 10. How many intend to establish new businesses ? 11. How many ex-service personnel, if any, are unwilling to accept employment?",53
107,Mr DEDMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. 4,560. 2. The number shown under No. 1 (4.560), plus a proportion of the total number of persons (civilian and ex-service personnel) in receipt of unemployment benefits (6,804). It is not practicable to ascertain the number of ex-service personnel included in total recipients of unemployment benefits. 3. 305,689. (a) 4. 423.(6) Cases have been notified. 5. 150,699.(5) 6. 8.451.(a) 7. 313 cases accepted as totally and permanently incapacitated, due to war service, and unable to engage in any occupation. 8. 56,458.

It is certain that at least a very large proportion of the 3,581 males, unwilling to accept work immediately after discharge, have since taken up employment. (it) Related to the period from November, 1943, to 30th June, 1946. No Commonwealth records available earlier than November, 1943. (1>) Related to the period lst October, 1945, to 30th .Tune, 1946.

ROYAL ' AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE : ADMINISTRATION. - Mr RANK IN asked the Minister for Air, upon notice.1. Has he seen A i r Vice-Marshal Bostoek's statement that documents exist containing grave charges by senior operational officers of unwarranted delays by the Air Board? 2. Will ho table in Parliament two official minutes signed by senior war-time officers in which grave charges of unwarranted delays are made? 3. Will he also table Royal .Australian A i r Force Head-quarters signal No. PP486, dated 17th November, 1943, in which reasons are given for the withdrawal of one A i r Board member from a war-time post? 4. Is it a fact that the latter advised the removal of A i r Commodore Hewitt from Operational Command "" in the interests of morale and discipline""? 5. If so, why' was A i r Commodore Hewitt appointed A i r Member for Personnel, virtually controlling all morale and discipline in the service?",53
108,Mr DRAKEFORD,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follows:- 1. Yes. i , 3 and 4. The minutes (which were dated early 1942) and the signal referred to-lik e all reports relating to officers of all forcesare highly confidential documents and must be treated as such. The tabling or the making public otherwise of any departmental or service documents of such a highly confidential character would be a serious breach of wellrecognized governmental policy and practice of long standing. 5. When making selections of .officers for appointments to the higher administrative and command posts, full consideration is invariably given to the complete service records of all officers regarded as most suitably qualified for such appointments. That procedure was followed in the selection of the present occupant of the post of A i r Member for Personnel, who, by the very efficient manner in which he has discharged his duties and responsibilities in that capacity, has full y justified his selection for that responsible position in which he has the confidence of the Government. BREN GUN CARRIER PARTS. '",54
109,Mr DEDMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"Recently , the honourable member for Corangamite MCDonald) asked a question concerning the disposal of spare parts for Bren gun carriers. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has now furnished the following reply:Any purchaser of Bren gun carriers not in a position to obtain spare parts should contact the regional manager of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in the State in which, lie is located. The Commonwealth Disposals Commission does not sell retail, but is in a position to advise inquirers of any firm which tarries stocks, or when the next auction sale of ' Bren gun carrier spare parts will take place. Stocks of Bren gun carrier parts, mainly surpluses from uncompleted contracts, aro vastly in excess of any needs by purchasers of Bren gun carriers, and the commission's normal method is to quit such stocks by public auction. If the honourable member for Corangamite will advise me of the name of the primary producer concerned. T will arrange for the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to fully inform him of sources of supply for such parts as ho might require in the future. PETROLEU M PRODUCTS: MOTOR CYLINDER OIL.",54
110,Mr FORDE,BILLS RETURNED FROM T HE,"On the 26th July , the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Smith ) asked whether I was aware that the price of motor cylinder o i l . had increased 50 per cent, above pre-war levels, and whether I would cause investias gations to be made to ascertain why motor cylinder oil had not been reduced in price correspondingly with other petroleum products. I have now been informed by the Minister for Trade and Customs that it is a fact that the prices of motor cylinder oils rose approximately 50 per cent, above pre-war levels, but no increase has taken place since the 12th A p r i l , 1943, and since that date a price reduction has been made. Further, additional price reductions wil l be made as soon as reductions of the cost of motor cylinder oil indicate that such are justified, as has already been done with other petroleum products.

As considerable numbers of ground staff personnel were employed in establishments- .such as stores and equipment, maintenance and repair depots, and certain other units performing dual functions connected with the Empire air training schools and other Royal Australia.li A i r Force commitments, it is not practicable to give the precise number of enlistments effected exclusively for the limpire air training scheme. 5.

AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR: DEFENDANTS' ALLOTMENTS ; SUBSISTENCE AXLOWANCES .",54
112,Mr FORDE,EQUIPME NT A ND SERVICES OF ARME D,"On the-31st J u l y , the h o n orable member for Balaclava (Mr . W h it e ) asked the following question: Will the Minister for the Army reply at an early date to two requests that I have made ' "" to him from time to. time, by letter and in questions in' this House, namely, first, that allotments paid between the date on which a prisoner of war was posted as missing and the date when he was presumed to be dead, be no longer deducted from the estates of ine deceased men; and secondly, when will the' subject of pay in lieu of furlough be adjusted, so that the dependants of those who died before the date in 1945 fixed by War Cabinet will no longer be deprived of this pay? J in for m e d him at the time that both of these questions w o u ld receive considerat i o n and replies w o u l d be g i v e n to him before the House rose. The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follows: The question of the - deduction of overpaid allotments from the estates of deceased men has been under consideration from time to time, and on 10th April last I furnished a detailed reply in the House to questions raised .by the honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Balaclava. It was then stated that no recoveries were effected in any instances from dependants, or from allottees who, though shown by the soldier concerned at the time of making the allotment to be non-dependent, were able to produce proof that they were in fact dependent or partly dependent on the soldier. I have given further careful consideration to the position of other nondependants, but regret that I cannot see my way to depart from the decision already given. ' On the subject of pay in lieu of recreation leave due at the time of the death of a member of the forces, this question is at' present' under consideration, 'but the fact that records of recreation leave of members of the forces which were maintained in the earlier years of the war are not satisfactory state, .it would be difficult determine the amount of pay in lieu of leave that would be due .to the estates of such members, if approval were, given"" to making this decision retrospective. The honourable member will be informed immediately a decienemy. sion is given.",55
113,Mr FORDE,EQUIPME NT A ND SERVICES OF ARME D,"On the 26th July, honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) referred to questions which had been asked by him on several occasions as to the need for payment of subsistence allowance of 3s. a day men who were captured by the Japanese and held as prisoners of war for three . and a half years. I advised the honorbers able member that I would further invesor tigate this matter, and now desire to that, as a result of the further investigations that have been made, i not proposed to authorize the payment suggested by him of a subsistence allowance to prisoners of war while in home stations. enemy hands. The representations that were made ' the honourable member in the House of Representatives on the 12th July, 1946, and the further representations .made him on the 26th July, 1946, were specially considered before arriving this decision. * The honourable member in his recommunique presentations on this subject has referred to the payment of field allowance officers, and has suggested that, because campaign:of such payment, a subsistence allowance of 38. a day is justified for other ranks. ourDuring There are a number of factors which must be taken into consideration in deal5 ing with this case, but the most important one is the necessity for ensuring that over no special privileges are extended to one section of the forces that would cre.ate an injustice or inequality of treatment/ 7,000 When the position of members of the Australian fighting forces held in cap-. !)0 tivity by. the Japanese was considered the Government, it was decided that the tingniahed pay and allowances of these' members should be continued at the daily rate applicable to their rank, and that no debits should be raised against their during the period of their captivity. Under this decision, as field allowance was an allowance in the nature of pay due to which was credited to an officer's pay account throughout the whole of his in a service, it was automatically continued to during the period of the officer's capsuch tivity, in the same way as it was continued to officers while taking part in active service operations against the The honourable member has suggested the that, because of the payment of field allowance, other ranks should receive a subsistence, allowance of an equivalentamount. Careful consideration has been given to his representations, but such an to allowance cannot be approved, because it would automatically involve' the payment of subsistence allowance to all memof the forces, whether in captivity otherwise, who because of military state operations, or for any other service reason, could not be provided with meals t is and rations under conditions which were as normally applicable when those forces were at rest in base areas or at their Honourable members will be aware that, by under active service conditions, it was not always possible to provide the troops with service rations, and that this situaby tion existed throughout the whole of the period of the war in North Africa. at Greece, Crete, Syria and in the South-West Pacific area, and I quote from a received while the fighting was in progress in the Owen Stanleys to in the early stages of the New Guinea this campaign'in the Owen Stanleys troops were supplied by aircraft by free dropping. Their supplies were calculated at lb. per man per day-2 % lb. of ammunition and 2 i lb. of dry rations-and they had to live and fight upon it. They had to climb precipitous mountains; mostly ankle deep or knee deep in mud. It rained continuously and they were seldom dry. At times they were feet up in the mountains where the nights were bitterly cold, with half a blanket tn protect them. They carried weights up tn lb. nn their backs, but they never grumbled. by On the contrary, they carried on with that spirit of self-sacrifice which has always dis our Australian soldier. It would be illogical and unjust to pay a subsistence allowance to prisoners of pay war and not pay a similar allowance to. members who fought under conditions such as these. As already indicated, ""it is the view of the Government that the- treatment that has been accorded to prisoners of war in relation to their pay accounts is not illiberal, and it is not proposed to depart from the payments now authorized under the Regulations and existing conditions.

During the dispute over the question of double dumping of wool, members of the Brisbane branch of the Waterside Workers Federation decided they would discharge the perishable cargo ex Murada and Macedon.' The labour was not allocated by the Stevedoring Industry Commission, but the men proceeded to the ships of their free w i ll and commenced work under supervision of union officials. The agents for the ships contend that, as .they did not engage the men and do not know what numbers were employed, they cannot pay them. Claims for the wages involved have been submitted by the union and these are at present being examined and consideration is being given the question of payment for the-wort which was done, which resulted in the prevention of deterioration in the perishable cargo which was on these vessels.

121,Mr CHIFLEY,EQUIPME NT A ND SERVICES OF ARME D,"On the 6th August the honourable member for Flinders (Mr ; Ryan) ashed me whether it is intended to make special concessions to candidates in the forthcoming elections in respect of petrol and tyres. In reply, I inform the honourable member that it has been approved that any necessary tyres and tubes should be made available for fitment to a motor vehicle owned and operated by any candidate for the federal elections or a member of a State legislature, as well as for fitment to a motor vehicle on loan or on hire to such a member or candidate for use in connection with the election and referendum campaigns. Individual applications for such tyres and tubes should be made through, the local transport advisory committees to the tyre distribution branch in i-aeh capital city. In regard to petrol, special rations will be provided for each candidate for the House of Representatives and the Senate. The rations issued will, of fonr=e, be greater for candidates for the Senate and country constituencies, in view of their greater travel obligations. Those special rations will be made available on the submission of applications by present members, or. in the case of candidates who are not sitting members, upon - heir receiving the nomination or endorsement of a recognized party. An independent candidate will receive the ration as soon as definite proof of his candidature, i.e., a lodging of a nomination, is received. These special rations are - being granted for joint election and referendum campaign purposes and, as in the case of the 1944 referendum, certain rations will also be issued to members of State parliaPort ments. The Minister for Supply and Shipping is arranging for full details of these arrangements to be conveyed to all members of State and Eederal legislatures, and to prospective candidates as quickly as possible so that use can be made of the special rations at. the earliest opportunity. JAPANESE AMMUNITION : DISPOSAL:",59
122,Mr HARRISON,EQUIPME NT A ND SERVICES OF ARME D,"the Minister for the A r m y , upon not i c e 1. Is it intended that members of the Australian Imperial Force will be required to carry out the hazardous task of disposing of the 2,000 tons of Japanese bombs recently discovered near Rabaul, and that these bomb's are already ""weeping"" and therefore highly dangerous to handle? 2. If the answer is in the affirmative, will he give consideration to employing Japanese prisoners of war to remove the bombs which were placed there by their own forces?",59
123,Mr FORDE,EQUIPME NT A ND SERVICES OF ARME D,"Sufficien t information is not immediately available to supply a detailed answer to the honourable member's question. Japanese bombs and ammunition ' located in this area must of necessity be disposed of, and Australian Army personnel will be employed on these, duties. The number of Japanese prisoners of war in this locality has been reduced considerably, but those remaining are. required to perform labouring duties and also work of the above nature. REAL ESTATES TRANSACTION : ACQUISITION AT REGENT'S PARK. MJ-. JOHNSON - Recently the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) asked a question concerning land at Regent'. 1 Park which has been acquired by the Commonwealth. I am now in a position to furnish the following information to the honourable member:On the 6th June, 1946, an area of about 117 acres of land at Regents Park was acquired by the Commonwealth for defence purposes. The acquired area, which has been held under National Security (General) Regulations since 1941, is used as a storage depot by the Army and Royal Australian A i r Force. As large Commonwealth expenditure has been incurred, and the depot is required for defence purposes indefinitely, the acquisition was necessary in the Commonwealth's interest. Part of the land was formerly owned by Hume Steel Limited, and Babcock and Wilcox, two large industrial concerns. Although the acquired portions of their properties were vacant scrubcovered land before being occupied by the Commonwealth, representations, have been made to the effect that each company wishes to embark on an expansion of its works on to the land acquired by the Commonwealth. There have been several preliminary conferences between some of the owners affected aud departmental officers who were examining the owuers' representations with a viewto reaching some suitable compromise, which, while meeting Commonwealth requirements, would cause a. minimum of disturbance to the development of the companies concerned. Although no finality was reached before the acquisition was effected, it did not appear possible that certain parts of the land taken by the Commonwealth but not actually occupied by Commonwealth buildings of importance could, perhaps, be released. I recently took this up with the Minister for the Army, to ascertain - whether in fact and without detriment to Commonwealth requirements, any of the acquired land could be released. A decision on this aspect of the matter has not yet been reached, and it must be appreciated that a fairly exhaustive examination of post-war defence requirements, particularly in respect of storage accommodation, will be required before such a decision is given. I have, however, assured each of the companies mentioned above that, as soon as finality is reached on the question of whether or not any of the acquired land can be released, I will arrange for a senior officer of the departmentto confer wit h them to examine the' proposals they have submitted, with a view to arriving at a satisfactory arrangement. In view of the Government's policy of assisting industrial development it may he assumed that the department w i ll give most careful consideration to the companies' proposals and endeavour - to cause as little disturbance as possible to the plans for the expansion .of their factories. The honourable member for Eeid is assured therefore, that his consistent representation's will receive careful and sympathetic consideration. ARMED .FORCES: MEDICAL NA RABAUL GARRISON.",59
