6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMALGAMATION OF TAXATION,"I am not aware, at the moment, but I should like to say that the only Government that has taken advantage of the arrangement so far is that of Western Australia, and, in a communication which I received from the Premier of that State this morning, he expresses satisfaction that the arrangement has been made, and the hope that it may be the forerunner of other arrangements to the mutual advantage of the Commonwealth and the States.

10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMALGAMATION OF TAXATION,"Our note issue is less now than it was at the time of the Armistice, and Australia is almost the onlycountry in which the note issue has not increased in that period. In almost every other country it has increased. In Great Britain the increase amounted to 22 per cent., and even in America there has been an increase. Here there has been a decrease in the issue.

19,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"On the 20th April, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cameron) asked the following questions:1. Whether the graves of all members of the Australian Imperial Force buried in the Desert of Sinai, Palestine, and Syria have been located? 2. Has the work of identification and establishment of central cemeteries been completed * 3. Where are the central cemeteries situated?

21,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"On 5th May the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) asked if I would obtain a report of the cost of the horsebreeding establishment at Maribyrnong and the revenue derived from it up to date. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation :The breeding establishment at Maribyrnong was formed in October, 1917, and was discontinued in February, 1920. The were selected from those on hand, none being purchased for the purpose. These have now boon returned to their usual work. The stallions were purchased for 800 guineas, which was sold, on disbandment of the stud, for 2,100 guineas, the other being retained for the use of public mares at a fee of 3 guineas. The other two stallions used were presented to the Department, and are now located in New South Wales and South Australia for use of public mares at 3 guineas. The cost of maintaining the stallions whilst the stud in operation was £338. The cost of maintain a ing the mares over the same period was £3,570. The cost of maintenance of the geny to date is £676. The only revenue received from the stud has been 2,100 guineas for the stallion Piastre, and £272 from the vice of privately-owned mares last season; it may be added that the stallions are at £1,000, and the young stock at £2,000, and it is estimated that the stallions will earn in invalids' foods. fees next season 400 guineas, and their tenance for the year will not exceed £100. No not additional men were employed in connection with the stud, all work being done by the mount Section. The stud was worked from the Remount DepGt, Maribyrnong, and mares on being stinted were placed on agistment. SALE OF THE. SHANDON. Sir JOSEPH COOK: - Yesterday , the honourable member for Oxley (Mr . Bayley) asked me what the Shandon cost to buy, what was paid for refitting her after purchase, and what she was for. The facts, so far as I remember them, are these: The vessel was bought for £7,000 at a time when we were laying hold of anything we could get about the to meet the exigencies of the moment, and cost about £26,000 to refit. vessel was eventually sold as a coal at hulk for about £4,000,, but in the meantime she had earned £39,000 profit. We got out of the whole transaction with £3,000 or £4,000 to the good, and considering that she was purchased in a time of stress when we had to secure whatever was available, I think it will be admitted that the vessel has seired her purpose.

In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 18th May mares used (vide page 8530) : It e m 55Infajits' and invalids' foods as prescribed by one of departmental by-laws. Free.",21
22,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Hunter ) [2.42] Under this item infants' and - invalids' foods are to be admitted free, and I think that is very wise, because every one will the admit that it should be our endeavour was to allow these commodities to be sold at reasonable price in the interests of the invalids and infants in our community. proBut I desire to place before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) the serposition in regard to groats and barley but which, I presume, would be classified valued . under this heading as infants' and I have been in mainformed that groats and barley are so classified under State Acts, which provide that these commodities Reshall Dot be used for infants' food u n t i l a child is at least six months bf age. It seems hardly fair that groats and barley should be admitted into the Comorable monwealth free, in view of the fact they are manufactured in Australia, and cannot be used as food for infants all ages. If the Minister makes quiries he will find that groats and barley are manufactured here in a form that makes them suitable for breakfast foods, and therefore importations should be dutiable.",21
23,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But they are of benefit to invalids.,22
24,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That may be so. But barley and groats cannot be used infants until they reach a certain Barley may be used in the preparation barley water or something of that nature for the use of weaklings; but the Pure Foods Acts passed by State Legislatures practically debarred the use of barley groats for infants.,22
25,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But it is used.,22
26,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It may be to a small degree; but as we manufacture these commodities in Australia. I would know whether the Minister thinks it wise to allow them to remain on the free,22
27,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Dampier) [2.45] - I adopted. discussed the question of infants' and invalids' foods in the course of the general debate, and on this itembut perhaps not so much as on item 174- I would like the Committee to determine whether the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) it shall have power to allow goods to admitted free or not. I want to know whether the Committee will limit the power of the Minister, or whether he to be the determining factor in deciding whether goods shall be admitted free not? I think we should also determine if the Minister is to have the power impose a duty if Parliament has said that such articles as infants' foods shall be admitted free. When previously cussing this matter I referred to Horlick's malted milk. I do not know anymember propose? thing concerning the firm handling this product, but I received a circular and after reading it I came to the conclusion that as Horlick's malted milk had been used in and around Melbourne and elsewhere as a beverage, the Minmilk ister had decided that it should moved from the list of infants' foods. On page 56 of the Customs by-laws honinfants' members will find a list of articles that which have been allowed to come into tnis country as infants' or invalids' foods, of and I think I am voicing the opinion of in every honourable member in this House when I say that as far as infant life is concerned special foods required for invalids and infants and recommended by the medical profession should be admitted free. This item is connected with the milk industry, but I want to go further than support the imposition of a duty simply because it might be the for means of benefiting an industry. We age. have to consider the community as a of whole, and not the profit that would be derived by one section of the community. For its area* New Zealand may be considered quite as great a milk producing and country as Australia, and I find that in the New Zealand Tariff there is set out a list of the various foods admitted duty free. I am a little doubtful of the wisdom of adopting that course, because new like to foods may be imported. Mr WATKINS' - We should know list? where we were if that course were",22
28,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It might be better if the list set out in the departmental by-law were inserted in the Tariff. The Minister may question the accuracy of the statements made in the circular to which I have referred, but I suggest that may be assumed that they are correct be when I inform honourable members that the circular was sent from the office of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir is Robert Best). He was the solicitor for these people in trying to keep the article or placed on the free list. I do not know how the honourable member will argue on to the question in this Chamber, but I 8UT>nose he will be quite justified personally in giving effect to the fiscal prindisciples he has always expressed.",22
29,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,What does the honourable,22
30,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That there .should letter, be no duty on the article.",22
31,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It is free now.,22
32,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That is' not so. I have explained that. Horlick's malted was placed, with forty or fifty other be refoods examined by the Government Analyst, and pronounced to be invalid or foods on a list coming under item 55 of the Tariff, and being, therefore, duty free; but owing to certain representations made to the Department Horlick's malted milk bas been taken off the list of invalids' and infants' foods, and a duty is now charged upon it. The reason given for this, according to the circular to which I have referred, is that the article is being sold in shops as a beverage. The statement is made in the circular that of the imports of this article only 8.31 per cent, goes into consumption as a beverage, leaving 91.69 per cent, to be consumed by invalids and infants.",22
33,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There is more of the article used in the American bars"" in Sydney than by infants in Australia. . It has become a popular summer and winter drink.",23
34,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It ought to be a good thing for the manufacturers of the article if it is readily purchased as a beverage in the way suggested. I point out that it is very much dearer than locally manufactured foods. We are all agreed that infants' and invalids' foods should be .allowed to come into the country duty free. I want, to raise the question whether, when the Trade and Customs Department has admitted that certain foods are infants' or invalids' foods, the Minister should have the right to remove them from the free list, because, in his opinion, they interfere with a certain industry in this country.",23
35,Mr BEENNAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,If he has that right he may alter the definition of any imported article.,23
36,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"When we come to consider item 175 I intend to, show the extensive use that is made of the power of the Minister to alter the Tariff in the way I have mentioned. I believe that he has acted outside the law, and in ways that are most unjustifiable. If the Committee decides that the Minister should . have this power he will be justified in exercising it, but I do not think that it is wise to place him in the position of being able to say that certain goods shall be admitted duty free, and certain other goods shall not, without the matter being considered by this Parliament.",23
37,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Melbourne Ports) [2.55] - Wheneve r an attempt is made to introduce a reform there is always some scribed by departmental by-laws."" objection urged against it. When the effort was made to secure better hours for shopkeepers, the case of the poor old widow who lived by keeping a shop was put forward as an objection. Now, when an attempt is made to levy a duty on an article which can, and should, be manufactured in Australia, the poor infants are used as a plea against it. Horlick's malted milk is used today by twenty adults for every one infant using it. In Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane it is drunk' wholesale in the milk and soda shops. In Pitt-street, Sydney, there must be seven or eight shops selling Horlick's malted milk, though customers do not always get that brand when they ask for it. It is not a question of the poor infants at all. They are merely dragged out foT a special purpose. This article is used extensively by adults, and manufacturers of similar foods in Australia should be given some Protection.",23
38,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Nepean) [2.57] Horlick's malted milk is one, of the best infants' foods we have.",23
39,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Grandfathe r is speaking.,23
40,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I am not yet a grandfather,, but I am a father, and I know that Horlick's malted milk saved the life of one of my children. According to the circular quoted by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) less than 9 per cent, of the imports of this article is used as a beverage by adults. It is one of the most expensive infants' foods, that can be bought, and it does not come into competition with Australian foods, because they are very much cheaper. It is often ordered in special cases by medical men, and I hope that it will be retained on the free list.",23
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.58] - The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton.) made an inquiry with respect to certain oat and barley preparations. They will fall under item 5S, "" Grain and pulse, prepared' or manufactured,"" and it is my intention to submit an amendment to paragraph E of that item which will further strengthen the existing position. With regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), Parliament defined this item as "" Infants' and invalids' foods as preIa doing so, Parliament gave power to the Minister for Trade and Customs to prescribe certain things aa infants' and invalids' foods,, and it gave him power also not to do so. The position is that if the Minister does not prescribe any particular food as an infants' or invalids' food, it automatically becomes dutiable under one or other of the existing items of the Tariff. .Speaking generally, Parliament agreed that all these articles should be dutiable, and then gave to the Minister for Trade and Customs power to prescribe certain articles in such a way as to bring them within the free list. That is the principle upon which the Tariff is drawn.",23
42,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Did not Parliament say that these articles should be free?,24
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"No , what Parliament has done up to the the present has been to make all these .articles subject to duty, but to leave with the Minister for Trade and Customs a discretionary power to include any of them in the free list. I admit that that is wide power to give the Minister, but it has been given designedly by Parliament. In regard to malted milk, the position was that we found that this food was being used very extensively as a drink, and not merely as an invalids' or infants' food. Further, we found also that the Bacchus Marsh Company were turning out a malted milk which, on analysis, was found to be identical with Horlick's malted milk. In the circumstances it appeared to the Minister then in control of the Trade and Customs Department that it was right that the power which Parliament designedly gave him should be exercised. As a result of the action taken by the Department in this regard we have Mellin's and other manufacturers of these foods coming here. I cannot say anything as to their prices, but they are using the raw material of our own country, employing our own people, and turning out what I believe is an excellent .article. As to Horlick'3 malted milk being an infant's food, the latest information I have is that the Victorian Health Department is taking action against the proprietors for so describing it. Mr .GREGORY - If the Minister found that any of these foods could not be described as an infant's or invalid's food, would he not remove it from the list?",24
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I have explained the position in which we found ourselves. We have carried out the law as it has been given us to administer. It is for the Committee to say whether or not we shall have the power in question, but that is the way the Tariff is designed. In regard to many things that are not made here, we take no action except that we use the power that has been given us to prescribe certain conditions.",24
45,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I contend that this power was not given to the Minister to be used for protective purposes.,24
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The position in regard to all these tilings is that they fall under one or other of the items of the Tariff as dutiable articles unless we by Ministerial act take them out. Parliament gave us this power for the express purpose of enabling us as far as possible to protect our own people. We have simply exercised the power which Parliament has given us. I admit that the question is surrounded with many difficulties. It presents difficulties of administration, but the power was designedly given us by Parliament, and we have exercised it in what I believe to be the interests of this country.",24
47,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Werriwa) [3.2] I support the principle of allowing infant's and invalid foods to come in free of duty, and join with others who have advocated the free admission of Horlick's malted milk. I do not know whether the State Government of Victoria or the Government of New South Wales has 1 taken action against the proprietors of Horlick's malted milk for describing it as an invalid's food, but I do know that it is used very extensively as such. Those who have reared a family know very well that there are some infant's foods which do not agree with children as well as do others. My eldest girl, for instance, when an infant, refused to take Lactogen, but she thrived on Horlick's malted milk, which was the only artificial food that she would take. We all know that Hor- lick's malted milk is used extensively and recommended by doctors an an .invalid's food, and it is within my own experience that infants have been successfully reared on it. Eor these reasons, I agree with those' who urge that Horlick's malted milk should be admitted free of duty. There is no danger that it will undersell the local product or swamp the market, because at the present time its price is higher than any Australian-made infant's or invalid's food. That being so, the locally-made article must have the market preference. It seems to me that in this matter the Government are simply proposing to take a little more revenue out of the pockets of invalids and the parents of infants. A duty is being levied in this case solely for revenue purposes. I therefore hope that the Minister will agree that Horlick's malted milk shall come in free.",24
48,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Wakefield) [3.6] - I am in sympathy with the view advanced by' the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden). The Minister (Mr Greene) knows very well that Horlick's malted milk is almost twice as expensive as any locally manufactured invalid's or infant's food which he is so anxious to protect, and that it is one of the most valuable foods, not only for infants, but for invalids. If the Government are going to drive Protection to these outrageous lengths they will meet with a good deal of opposition which they would not otherwise encounter. I shall certainly divide the Committee on this question.",25
49,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Batman) [3.7] - The only thing that is more pathetic than the imposition of this duty is, perhaps, the puerile and feeble reason advanced, by the Minister for imposing it. I gather from what has been said that Horlick's malted milk, which is a recognised infant's food, has so far won popularity in this country that persons who can no longer lay claim to the happy state of infancy have been persuaded to use it in large quantities. It appears that one other duty has been added to the numerous and exacting duties of the Minister in that he is, constituted a public analyst to declare from time to time what may or may not be properly described as an infant's food. The truth is that this is a tax on the babies of Australia, and, at the same time, a tax upon public health. The absurdity of the position is well illustrated by the Minister's public declaration that he understands that legal proceedings are actually pending in this State against the proprietors of Horlick's malted milk for describing it as an infant's food. The Minister, having in his august person, the right to - declare that it is not an infant's food, certain other people institute proceedings against the people who manufacture it for saying that it is an infant's food. I do not say that this is the most absurd of the absurd positions in which the Minister is placed, but it certainly should be added to his album of eccentricities.",25
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The only trouble is that my actions have nothing whatever to do with it.,25
51,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It is quite immaterial who for the time being exercised the power or enjoyed the honour. It is evident to all. who have heard the Minister that ho would delight in exercising the power, and that the honour would sit very gracefully upon him. The Minister's statement that an industry has been established in this State in respect of which it was found that this new milk product possessed all the attributes that could be claimed for Horlick's milk was very interesting and important, but it lacked weight when the Minister had to tell the Committee that he was not in a position to give honourable members any information as to the price. I suggested, of course, facetiously, by interjection, that, after all, the price did not matter, the cost of living was nothing, and the needs of the babies were apparently nothing. We must take Horlick's milk immediately out of the list of babies' foods, if some one claims, rightly or not, that we can establish a great Australian industry, even at the expense of the babies, and by way of keeping up the cost of living. I u this case, the price of Horlick's is higher than that of the local article, so we compete on exceptionally favourable terms.",25
52,Mr HAY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"New England) [3.12] - I am not so much concerned as to whether malted milk is an infants' food or a food for others. What I am concerned about is the fact that the Minister is seeking to protect what is clearly an Australian industry. We have all the raw material in this country-w e have the milk, the barley, the wheat, and the labour ; we make the bottles; we produce the labels; and we employ our own people in building up an Australian industry. During the war, the supply of all infants' foods which we imported was cut off. We cannot see what the future has in store for us, but surely a country like this not permit itself to be cut off from its essential requirements. There .is now in this State a company making malted milk.",25
53,Mr GEEENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,There are two.,26
54,Mr HAT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I was not aware of that; but the milk which - the company I refer to is making has been shown by analysis to be equal to Horlick's imported milk. . Mr WATKINS - Who is the authority?,26
55,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The Eederal Analyst.,26
56,Mr HAT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I have seen the analysis, which shows that the local product is quite equal to the imported article. The imported article is selling at a very much higher rate, because its manufacturers are a very ricb and influential company, who have advertised largely throughout Australia, with the result that people who want malted milk naturally ask for Horlick's. Every one has seen those black and white cows painted up all over the fields-throughout Australia. We are importing milk from other countries in the shape of manufactured articles which we could easily produce ourselves. I have no doubt that before the Minister took the step he has taken he consulted the Government Analyst regarding the product in question. The local company have already had plans prepared for a very largely increased output. If we can establish our industries, using our own raw material, I hope honourable members will see the great advantage of doing so, as against importing manufactured milk products from other countries.",26
57,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maribyrnong) [3.15].. - I hope the Minister will adhere to his determination. If ever there was an item on which the Committee should be united, from the point of view both of primary production and of manufacture, it is this. The honourable. member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) spoke of the virtues of Horlick's milk. From my own family experience, I swear by Mellin'3 Food. The Minister informs me that Mellin's Food is practically on the same list as Horlick's now, so much so that, stead of being imported, it is actually ing manufactured in Australia. have an opportunity here of standing by our own people, who are not on this occasion fleecing the public. The analysis shows that the local article is exactly, or almost exactly, the same as Horlick's can- malted milk, and that it is selling much below the price of the imported article. The ""poor, unfortunate babies and widows"" that we heard about from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) are being fleeced, not by the local manufacturer, but by the producer of the imported article. They are paying very much more for Horlick's milk than for the local product. Then we are told that the fact that the local manufacturers are selling at a lower price is a reason why no protection should be accorded to them. I am surprised at those who advocate that kind of thing. Let us stand by the Australian article, which, made out of Australian material, the best in the world, is the best for Australian babies, and we can raise the best Australians on it. We have now a splendid opportunity to help the primary producer. I am surprised to find the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), the Deputy Leader of the Country party, refusing to listen to the practical men who sit alongside him. Let him take the advice of the honourable member for New England (Mr. Hay). I hope the primary producers will take note of those people who are trying to oppose the advancement of their inown terests in connection with the Tariff. I trust the Committee will be solid on this point, and will give the Minister the discretionary power that is required. If the time arrives when the Minister finds that a fair deal is not being given to the people by the local manufacturers, and that an article is being placed on the market which is not as good as it should be, he will have in his own hands the discretionary power to place the local manufacturers at a disadvantage. He will not be constituting himself an analyst who will issue an edict that this, or that, shall be done, as the honourable member for Batman suggests. The officer who has made the analysis in this case is one of the finest analysts in Australia-in fact, I in- question whether he has any peer in the be- world as an analyst--and I am prepared We to take his word in regard to it. If he says that the component parts of the article which is being made by the Bacchus Marsh Company are practically the same as those of Horlick's milk, I am prepared to accept his assurance. He is a responsible officer, and has to discharge his duties f a it h full y , both from a professional and departmental stand-point. He is not influenced by politics. He is there, with his reputation at stake, to say whether the articles submitted to him are suitable or not. I intend to stand by the Australian article for all I am worth.",26
58,Mr EOBERT COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Indi ) [3.20] I am prepared, as I said previously, give the fullest assistance to our local i dustries where proof can be given that h warranted. This industry is already established in Australia, and, although has not had any great aid, it has expanded very rapidly. Comparative analysis Bacchus Marsh and Horlick's malted milk child's bottle should be made give the following figures- Bacchus Marsh. Moisture 2S Fat 9-3 Proteids 11-8 Carbohydrates .. 73-7 Ash 2-7 Thus we see that we have in Australia industry which produces an article equal in every way to that supplied by the Horattitude today. lick's Proprietary. This local industry is not only of advantage to the dairymen, but to primary producers generally. If our banana friends are entitled to the duty that has been fixed on that f r u i and if other sections of the House are entitled to the duties they desire in other directions, then this food industry surely entitled to substantial Protection. If I felt that it was necessary in all cases to admit infants' foods free, I should cerother tainly vote for any proposal with that object, but seeing that the local product is equal in every way to the imported, we ought to encourage local manufacturers.",27
59,Mr WATKI NS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Newcastle) [3.24] Whenever this subject has come up in House, considerable debate has taken place on what constitutes infants' and valids' foods. No one will deny, I think, that I have always given genuine support to Australian industries; but in the case admitted, is fairly high Protection. of infants' and invalids' foods, no matter what the analysis may be, we cannot find two stomachs for which the analyzed food is_egually suitable.",27
60,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The authority must be the departmental analyst.,27
61,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I do not deny that ; but that official does not analyze stomachs. I have known infants reared successfully on foods that were an absolute surprise to medical authorities. Indeed, I had a to case in one of my own children, who is n - now, perhaps the healthiest of the family. it There was a deficiency of mother's milk, and our medical adviser .tried various it foods, including milk from our own cow. Nothing seemed to be suitable, and, of finally, the doctor suggested that the up of unsweetened condensed milk. On this the child thrived, and, as - I say, is a healthy g i r l today. What analysis could cover a case like Horlick's. that? As to invalids' foods, when I was near death a while ago, I had the greatest difficulty in getting any food to 37 suit me; - and it was not any elaborate 90 medical arrangement that brought me 138 round, but a simple plan of feeding de70-8 vised by the matron of the hospital. In 2-7 endeavouring to develop our industries 100-0 100 0 by Protection, we must be very careful, at any rate so far as infan t life and the care of invalids are concerned, to provide an the widest possible choice of foods. That is the principle that is guiding me in my The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) used an argument from a Protectionist stand-point that is altogether t , new to me. I was always under the impression that our industries required Protection because of dumping, or because they is could not compete with commodities sent from overseas. In the present case, however, there is not only Horlick's milk, but children's imported foods, being sold at a higher rate than that at which the local article can be supplied. The difference in price, plus the duties, are shown in the following figures:-A comparison of wholesale prices in Melbourne, of Horlick's malted milk, imported, with local the foods, on 1st January this year, shows that the present average commercial proi n - tection to Glaxo is 97.76 per cent., to Lactogen 89.96 per cent., and to Bacchus Marsh 95:81 per cent. This, it will be I have here the price list of Messrs. Rooke, Tompsitt and Company, from which it appears that Horlick's, No. 3 size, dutiable at 20 per cent., is sold at 218s. per dozen of 43 lbs. each; Mellin's, free, is sold, No. 2 size, at 258. per dozen of 9^ ozs. each; Benger's, free, is sold, No. 2 size, at 47s. per dozen of 16 oz. each; Carnrick's, free, is sold, No. 3 size, at 46s. 6d. per dozen of 16 oz. each; Glaxo, Australian, is sold at 15s. per dozen of 7 oz. each, and 62s. per dozen of 2 | lbs. each; Nestle's milk food, dutiable at 20 per cent., is sold at 25s. per dozen of 12 oz. each; and Lactogen, Australian, is sold, No. 3 size, at 62s. per dozen of 3 lbs. each. Nestle's milk food is an imported article, which has been brought under the duties, though I remember the time when it was regarded as the one invalid food for this country. Why should this food be penalized with a heavy duty at this stage ?",27
62,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Nestle' s milk food is manufactured here now.,28
63,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That , 110 doubt, is the reason for the difference in the duty. This is really not a Protective duty, but a revenue tax on invalids and children. Never, as a Protectionist, have I favoured revenue duties through the Customs, because they do not fall on the rich, but on the parents of the largest families in Australia. I stand for Protection with the object of creating industries, and I cannot support a duty which is merely imposed for revenue purposes, and has not the industrial object in view. Even if Horlick's milk is more largely used as a beverage, that does not make it the less an infant's food. My information is that not more than 8 per cent, of it is sold for consumption as a beverage. But I am not very much concerned about this aspect of the case at all. My desire is to give the invalid and the child the best foods obtainable, no matter whence they come. In the case of medicines, duties are prescribed according to departmental by-laws, and only the other day I brought under the notice of the Minister the case of a man, a sufferer from asthma, who had read of an American cure and had obtained the preparation only to be held - up at the Customs because of the duty,",28
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I think, we remitted the duty in that case.",28
65,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That man had to write to me, and I approached the Minister, who told me that no duty would be charged, but that if would take some days to fix the matter up. I have been waiting ever since for a reply. I think that it is asking too much to expect honourable members to agree to a charge of 80 per cent, upon certain infants' foods. It is about time we endeavoured to establish such industries in some otlier way. I am prepared to go almost to any length to protect an industry that will employ thousands of people, and I am ready to give assistance to these particular industries, but I protest against this discrimination by means of regulations, because, in my judgment, it is impossible to rear children by any Act of Parliament or regulations made under any Act.",28
66,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Nepean) [3.35] - I move That after the word "" by-laws "" the following words be inserted :- "" including malted raillc.""",28
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"This question will como up for determination on item 75. If the duty under that heading is not agreed to, the items will automatically come under the item now under discussion. MrJ BOWDEN - The Minister'has already told us that all these commodities are dutiable unless they are prescribed by departmental by-laws as being free, and although the proposed duty in item 75 may be struck out, this article will still have to be prescribed by the departmental by-laws. It occurs to me that this is .an opportune time to come to a decision.",28
68,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Melbourne) [3.37] I trust the Minister (Mr Greene) will adhere to his suggestion. At present he has discretionary power. Let us look at this matter quite fairly. During the whole of' my thirty years' experience, when I was in active practice, I never prescribed patent food for. any child. If a mother was unable to nurse her child, and unable also to obtain the best substitute-an other mother-to give the child the breast, I recommended her to get a goat and suckle the child in that way directly. Failing that, I advised the use of pure cow's milk. I feel disposed to urge that the formula be printed upon the label of every imported patent food and every 'bottle of medicine, as well as every packet of patent food manufactured and sold in the Commonwealth for child consumpEuropean tion.",28
69,Mr GBEGOKT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The manufacturers would not sell to the public then.,29
70,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That argument has been used on many occasions. Any done. analyst of standing can determine the component parts of the average dried-milk , product. I have the highest opinion of impost. the departmental analytical chemist. He is a man of great experience and high tainments. I would vote for this item simply because any advance in duty will have my support. No honourable member will say that the milk produced in Australia is not as good-in - fies malted milk. deed, it is better-tha n milk produced, in the United Kingdom. And no one will say that the Australian workers engaged in such industries are not as intelligent as those in England. A gentleman with experience of workers in Germany, France, Great Britain, and Australia, states definitely that he has never ployed more intelligent workers than has in his factory here. I cannot imagine, any one representing a farming constidirection, tuency voting against the Minister's sugbe gestion. No one who claims to be a tectionist can be a moderate Protecportation tionist. Would we approve of a moderate drunkard., or of a woman who is modewishes rately virtuous? The honourable member whose purpose is to secure revenue from the imposition of Customs duties should proclaim himself, not as a Protectionist, but as a revenue TarifHst. There is halting-place. A Protectionist must an absolute Protectionist. My vote shall be given to permit the Minister have the discretionary power set out in the schedule. No doubt, he will always be guided by the advice of his departto mental officers. If they can give him assurance that the formula of what scribed as an infant's food is consistent with the ingredients of such a commodity, it should remove from the minds of any suspicion that the article is otherthat wise.",29

But if these people are anxious to' be placed on the same footing as the manufacturers of Lactogen or Nestle's Food,, let them come and establish their factory here, as others have The duty is only 6d. per lb., which works out at about 12 per cent., and is therefore not a very serious",29
72,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Dampier) [3.43] atI do not care for the honourable member's proposal to confine his amendment to protective Horlick's malted milk.,29

74,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"In New Zealand, the preparations permitted to be imported free as infants' foods are set out in the Tariff schedule. There is an. enormous number of foods imported into Australia. Our Trade and Customs Department has published a list of 180 approved infants' emand invalids' foods.

At any rate, if their are to be carried into effect; and protection is to be afforded to local manufacturers of invalids' and infants' foods, it is only a fraud to retain the item. When I rose to speak a little while ago, no my purpose was misconstrued. I object be to power being given to the Minister which will enable him to take one article to of invalids' or infants' food out of the free list and replace it by another simply for the purpose of affording protection the local maker of any particular line the of foods. I would be perfectly satisfied is deif the Minister were to do this on the ground that the article was not an invalid's or infant's food; but certain all papers I have in my possession indicate he has taken action in the past, not upon that ground, but because the free importation of an article was interfering with a local industry. Is the Minister of to be given the power to destroy one. infor the sake of givina; protection The present Minister has accepted the full responsibility of havfrom ing done so in regard to sheep-dip.

If that it amendment be carried, the words "" as as prescribed by departmental by-laws "" will be retained, so that the Minister will continue to wield exactly the powers with which he is clothed today. In reto the 180 foods to which the honDeorable member has referred, I would remind him that only twenty-eight are now admitted free.

94,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It represents both the letter and the spirit of it. It gives effect to the intention of this Parliament. The real issue under consideration is, "" Should the words' as prescribed by departmental by-laws' be retained ? "" I say that they should be, and I ask the Committee to agree to the item in the form in which it now stands. The amendment of the honourable member for Dampier, if carried, will merely add another duty to those which already devolve upon departmental officers. It will necessitate the issue .of a certificate that any particular article is an infants' and invalids', food, but it will really not affect the existing position so long as the words "" as prescribed by departmental by-laws "" are retained.",31
95,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Melbourne Ports) be [3.58] - This is merely a repetition of the fight we had upon Glaxo when the last Tariff was under consideration. Upon that occasion we had half-a-dozen 5 persons assuring us that we would ruin the children if ' w e did not admit Glaxo from New Zealand free of duty. We were solemnly told that the children must have Glaxo or they would die. Now we are informed that they must have Horlick's malted milk or they will die. What arrant humbug it is! When we began the consideration of this schedule by imposing a duty upon alcoholic liquors we robbed the children of every man in this country, who drinks. Yet not a word was said then about the poor children. Now, however, we hear a howl about the injustice which will be done them if a duty be imposed'upon Horlick's malted milk. We are assured that they will die in thousands. I can quite understand: Eree Traders using such an argument, but I cannot understand it being used by Protectionists. As to the reformed drunkards who are said to want Horlick's malted mills, all I have to say is that, independent of their requirements, I have tried it myself, and found that it is not bad. But if any one cannot get Horlick's malted milk, I advise him to take a spoonful of ""Worcestershire sauce in the morning, and he will find that it will do him good. If enough persistence is shown, Horlicks will manufacture here, the same as in the case of the Glaxo Company. I assure honourable members that if we tax Horlicks, they will soon have an establishment in Australia. It is the same old cry. We were told that chocolates could not be manufactured in Australia; that they would not have the same taste or appearance or general appeal to the palate as the English-made cholocate. But we know the position in regard to the manufacture of chocolates in Australia today. was the same argument concerning imported soaps; but today we have Sunlight soap and other products of Lever Brothers turned out in Australia. Similar remarks could be applied to numbers of other commodities. All I would say, in conclusion, is that the Free Traders should stick to their old arguments, and that the (Protectionists should cut out cant and humbug.",31
96,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Nepean) [4.2] - I regretted to hear the interpretation which the Minister has placed upon the powers given to him by the similar section in the old Act to the one we are now considering. In plain English, that section means that the Department is to determine whether certain articles are infants' and invalids' foods, and to do that only. The Minister states that the section gives him power to make certain articles dutiable or not dutiable at his discretion. I maintain that if he were to follow that' course he would be guilty of a misuse of the powers given him under the section. If it is a fact that, of 184 articles which were regarded as infants' and invalids' foods, nearly the whole of them have been taken off the list, and now have to pay duty, such action amounts undoubtedly to a misuse of the Minister's powers. The section reads plainly enough, and the only discretionary power that should lie with the Minister is in respect of the determination whether or not a certain article comes under the head of infants' and invalids' food. And, if it does, it should be admitted free. The use of this power by the Minister in order to make some of these foods dutiable because certain manufacturers may have made representations to him is establishing a very dangerous precedent.",32
97,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Dampier) [4.4] - I have in my hand a copy of the first Tariff introduced in the history of the Commonwealth. I would like the Minister to show me a single indication that he has been given the power which he is claiming under the new Tariff. I have gone through the greater portion of the 1907 schedule as submitted to Parliament, and can findno indication of any such power. I want to impress the Committee with the serious fact that a practice has developed which amounts to There autocratic control by the Department in respect of almost every item. Either by way of regulation or by the Minister's decision, a system has.been evolved whereby an exceedingly heavy embargo is being placed upon trade. It should be for this Parliament, and Parliament alone, to fix duties; and the Tariff schedule should be as simple as it can possibly be made. Every person interested in the importation of anything into the Commonwealth should know exactly what he must pay by way of duty. There should be no logrowing through the medium of a member of Parliament, or by way of departmental officials. During the past few days I have been reading through the particulars of the Tariffs of four or five different countries. They are all very simple, and traders generally are under no difficulty in ascertaining their exact position with respect to any and every item. To-day, the Australian importer has to battle with an enormous accumulation of difficulties emanating from constant streams of departmental instructions. In order to place the sole responsibility for fixing a duty upon the proper shoulders, namely, those of the Parliament, I move That the words "" as prescribed by departmental by-laws"" be left out.",32
98,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,East Sydney) [4.7] - The Minister has brought forward a proposal - which has actually been in existence since the passing of the 1908 Tariff.,32
99,Mr GKEGOEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That is not so.,33
100,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The honourable member may see for himself. I know that the Minister is in a difficult position. He is differently situated from any of his colleagues. He has to compete with unscrupulous persons who are out to fleece the public by any and every means, including, the wrong description of their articles upon labels. At the time of discussing the 1908 Tariff, it was deemed advisable that the Minister for Customs should be given power to deal with unscrupulous people, and I consider that it was wise to give him such power. We have to place confidence in the Minister for Customs and his departmental officials. I ' defy any Parliament to frame a T a r i ff so simply that it will not require the tact and wisdom of the Customs officials to insure smooth working. During my Federal parliamentary career, I have had much to do with Customs officials, and have always found them very capable and trustworthy. When I was a child, there were none of these patent infan t food3, and the mother who could not give her offspring milk had to obtain it from the nearest dairy. It is only of late years that these patent nostrums have been considered necessary, and if half of them were done away with the children would be better off. At the present time, infants' foods are admitted free of duty, but a commodity that can be used for other purposes than the feeding of infants, although described as an infants' food, is dutiable. Most of the patent foods, we are told, have milk as their basis. I am one of those who, when passing a cow, are inclined to lift their hats, because of the value of that animal to the human race. Our dairy products are the equal of any in the world, and why should we not make here the infan t foods required by the community ? Malted milk is now for sale in every refreshment room in Sydney, many persons being forced to drink it because they cannot get a glass of beer after 6 o'clock at night. Personally,"" I do not like it , and would prefer to drink beer, which cannot be said to have done me much harm, for I have been a beer drinker throughout my long life.",33
101,Mr GEEENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minute r for Trade and Customs) [4.15] - On e of the reasons given by the honourable member for Dampier for his amendment is that the use of the words which he proposes to strike out is of comparatively recent date. He defied me to show a single instance of their use in the first Tariff of 1901. My reply is that on the last page of that Tariff he will find no fewer than four such instances, and others are scattered throughout it . Among the special exemptions at the end of Division XVI . are these- . , (u) Minor articles to be specified in departmental by-laws for use in the manufacture of goods within the Commonwealth. (aa) Scientific instruments and apparatus for use in universities, colleges, schools, or public hospitals under departmental by-laws. (ac) Theatrical costumes and properties, subject to departmental by-laws. (ae) Works of art, being statuary and paintings framed or unframed, also 'windows for churches or public institutions, under departmental by-laws. The honourable member should make oertain of his facts before being so definite in his statements. Without a provision such as that to which he objects, a Tariff becomes an absolutely rigid instrument. There may be no doubt as to the duties imposed by Parliament, though difficulty of interpretation nevertheless arises from time to time, but all sorts of hardship occurs if there is not provision for give and take, and this was recognised from the very beginning, the Minister being given a discretionary power in regard to many items. The exercise of this power throws on him a grave responsibility, and requires due caution; but I have not heard of any case of abuse.",33

105,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Of course, opinions will always vary as to the wisdom of any action of a Minister, and one man may declare the exercise of this discretionary power to be an abuse, while another may regard it as legitimate and proper. The commodities mentioned in this item are, under one head or another, dutiable; it is only by being named in a departmental by-law that they can secure admittance free. That has always been the position. I hope that the Committee will not make the amendment.",33
106,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"South Sydney) [4.18] The Minister, by the exercise of his discretionary power, saved an important industry in my electorate. During the war, two enterprising men from New Zealand established worts at Botany for the manufacture of gelatine, using a by-product which was previously a nuisance to the community. The Japanese were making gelatine from seaweed, and it was being admitted free. Had not the Minister exercised his discretionary power, the Japanese gelatine would have swamped the market, and those who had put their capital into the works at Botany - on e of the largest gelatine works in the Empire-woul d have lost it. By his action the Minister preserved their occupation for 500 or 600 persons, who were employed under the best conditions.",34

An ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. The action taken by the Minister did no injury to the community, and put an important industry on a sound footing. It would be a mistake to take from the Minister discretionary power. Any misuse of that power must be accounted for to Parliament.",34
109,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Dampier) [4.23] The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) has given an instance which affords the strongest reason for taking this discretionary power from the Minister for Trade and Customs. During the war, Parliament was sitting almost'constantly, and, had the Minister wished action to be taken for the preservation of valid's food. any industry, he had only to propose an amendment of the Tariff schedule. That would have taken effect immediately, and would have remained operative until Parliament had otherwise determined. What members now have to consider is whether Parliament shall be supreme in regard to the Tariff, or whether the Minister is to be allowed to alter the Tariff in compliance with the requests of individuals. In the interests of the Minister himself I hope the amendment may be carried. Question-That the words proposed, to be omitted stand part of the item-put . The Committee divided.

The increase I propose is equivalent 9d. per bushel, and the reason for my amendment will be apparent to most orable members. Maize-growing, in many parts of Australia, is of as much importAfrican ance to people on the land as the wheat industry is in other districts. We have by the imposition of protective duties some years past been trying to build industries for the manufacture of maize into several products utilized in the monwealth.. The farmers engaged in the cultivation of maize desire that the ingrowing dustry should be stabilized, by the pretralia, vention of dumping from foreign counwhich tries which might lead to their crops ing held over until they would be demaize stroyed by weevil.

Arrangements were made with South Africa by which South maize may be permitted into Australia under more favourable conditions than maize grown in other parts of for the world. I understand from the Minup ister of Trade and Customs, who has gone into this matter, that after the ComTariff now under consideration is passed that privilege will be withdrawn. Maizeis already a big industry in. Ausand will extend. It is an industry immigrants or returnpd soldiers bemay take up, because the cultivation of does not involve the same amount of expenditure as the cifltivation of many Plenty of land suitable for the growth of maize is available, and all that is necessary to greatly encourage the industry is that it should be stabilized in such a way that there will be an assured local market tor it, and that it will not have to compete with maize dumped here from other parts of the world. I understand that those engaged in the secondary industries, of which maize is a raw material, have no objection to the increase of duty I propose, as they are .satisfied that they will be able to depend on production in Australia for all the maize they require. Mr WIKNUOI.T - A great deal of maize is imported in times of drought. Mr OOKSEIi - That has been necessary in the past, because the maize-growing, industry has not been stabilized. On that account, a number who were growing maize gave up growing it. I have had many years' experience of the industry, and I may say [ have never known a time when things looked brighter for the maize-grower than they do at present. We have by protective duties encouraged the establishment, of industries for products maize such as that of the company established at Footscray, by imposing a duty of 3d. por lb. on rice to be manufactured into starch. The result of the imposition of that duty was to make it practically compulsory that starch used in Austral'a should be manufactured from maize instead of from rice, which is produced by black labour. In America 98 per cent, of the starch wed is .made from maize. Another product manufactured from maize is glucose, and we recently increased the Protection on that artclc from £8 to £12 per ton. The protective duties already imposed on manufactures of maize have induced people to invest large sums in their manufacture. understand that the factory at Footscray to which I have referred could not be built today for under about £90,000. There were faetor'es in Victoria and in the other States, such as Harper Bros, and others, engaged in manufacturing starch from rice; and I understand that they are now altering their plants to enable them to manufacture the article from maize. To make this industry safe for the grower and the manufacturer wo require an assurance tlint the grower will be able to secure a market for his crop which will not be suddenly interfered with by the dumping of maize grown in other parts of the world, and an assurance for the manufacturer that sufficient maize will be grown here to meet his requ rements. To show that we run no risk in this respect, I may say that manufacturers are making contracts twelve mouths ahead with maize-growers to buy from them the maize they require. We have any amount of good land in Australia suitable for the product'on of rnaize; but our cost of labour in the industry is higher than it is in the countries growing the maize that comes into competition with what is grown in Australia. I hope that honourable members will be prepared to assist the primary and secondary industries dealing w'th maize by agreeing to the increased duty I propose to prevent dumping.",34
117,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Robertson) [4.50""| Apparently the only definite result of the discussion of the Tariff so far has been in the direction of an improvement of the English language. There is a great tenof dency nowadays to express everything as briefly as possible; and I have noticed dur'ng the discussion of the Tariff that whenever an honourable member desires to say, "" I wish to be in a position to increase the price of a certain article,"" he condenses the statement into "" I want to stabil ze the industry."" The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) was very strong on the stabilizing of the maize industry, but he has proposed a very dangerous way of doing it.",36
118,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,There is a great deal of conipetit'on in the industry.,36
119,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There is considerable competition. We sometimes import, maize from the United States of America, 1 and more frequently from South Africa; but we never have 'mported it in quantities worth considering except during drought time. At present our maize growers can carry on, with a good margin of profit.",36
120,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,They cannot do so in Queensland.,36
121,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There is a cons der- : able area under maize cultivation in Australia, and it is a paying crop, as the honourable member for Wide Bay has admitted.",36
122,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,- Just at present.,36
123,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It is a crop that costs very little to plant.,37
124,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,' L did not say that.,37
125,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The honourable member said that returned soldiers could go in for maize cultivation because of the small expenditure necessary. It is one of the cheapest crops to grow, and is, perhaps, most frequently grown with pumpkins in the same field. It is a crop, also, which give3 very good returns. There is a considerable area in Australia of suitable land, with a good ra nfall, for the production of maize, and under existing conditions the maize-growers are doing well. Since we have had Protection for the secondary industries using maize as a raw material the growers of maize have had a good market for their product in Au'tralia. I am glad that that has been so, but I do net des're that the production of maize should be extended at the expense of what is undoubtedly the greatest industry in Australia, and that is stock-raising. There are times when stock, and particularly sheep, are dependent absolutely on the importation of maize and other grain. Any man who has had anything to do with stock in drought the'is aware that the cheapest and most effective way of feeding stock is with grain. The old method of feeding stock with chaff has gone out, and, while lucerne hay is good feed, it is hard to place it in the right way.",37
126,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"In ca-e of a very severe drought, the duty on maize might easily be suspended.",37
127,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It might easily be suspended after the stock were dead.,37
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The duty could not be suspended unless Parliament were sitting.,37
129,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Stock-owner s want to be able to import maize for their stock whenever it is necessary to do so. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) has appealed to the Country party, as representing the primary producers, to support the proposed increase, but primary producers who take a general view of the position of primary production in Australia must vote against it, since, while it might put a few pounds into the pockets of a few hundred people, it would take thousands of pounds out of the pockets of hundreds of others and go a long way towards damaging the greatest [ 3 4 7 ] -2 producing industry in Australia. In time of drought, hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent' on the feeding of stock. 1 could take honourable members to oue station in New South Wales, where during a drought over £70,000 was spent-to a large extent on maize-in trying to keep the stock alive. During the last drought in New South Wales the majority of stock-owners, after trying various forms of feeding, came to the conclusion that Indian corn or maize was : the best of all foods for their stock. If you feed with the smaller grain, trailing it along the ground, which is the most effective method, a great deal of it is lost; but Indian corn is so large that it is easy for the stock to pick it up, and they do well on it. I would urge the Minister not to be led away by this appeal on the part of the honourable member for Wide Bay for an increased duty, which, I repeat, would benefit a few hundred peopio, but do very grave injury to what is the greatest of all industries in Australia at the present time.  honourable member for Wide Bav (Mr. Corser) succeeded in carrying his proposal for an increased duty, he would find in the long run that the benefits which he predicts wonld be derived from rather it were purely illusory. In time of drought, when the duty would have a protective incidence, a demand would be made for its removal,- and there can be no doubt that it would be suspended or removod. As the grower of another cereal for over twenty years, I . can say that the only time within my experience when the duty on corn would have been of any service, it was removed in the interests of the consuming public. The honourable mombcr must recognise that the duty would be of sen-ice to the maizegrowing industry only in time of drought, and with a drought upon us the odds are ten to one that it would be removed. The primnrv producer it spems must always "" knuckle down "" to the interests of other people, whether it be in the matter of a duty on machinery or anything else. The primary producer is not to he helped in this wr»v. 1L> csn bo helped, however, '-nder otlier items of this schedule, and also in connection with the taxation of the Commonwealth. During recent years most farmers have had to pay, by way of taxation, just about three times as much as that paid by citizens who receive their income regularly by way of salary or fees. That is a scandal. . Mr MATHEWS - It would be if it were Arue, but the honourable member cannot prove that it is.  figures the accuracy of my statement. Hitherto, there has been no one to look after the interests of the people who have been struggling under such a burden, but I hope that they will soon receive attention. I am prepared to vote for the proposed increase if the honourable member for Wide Bay thinks it will assist the industry, but' I am not sanguine that it will be of any avail. MT. CHARLTON (Hunter) [5.3] - I - do not think the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) need press his amendment. The present duty on maize appears to be adequate. I find that, during the year 1912-13, we imported -634,903 bushels; in 1913-14, 152,949 bushels; in 1914-15, 816,290 bushels; and in 1915-16, a year of drought, when we had to make special arrangements for the hand-feeding of our stock in order to save them, 1,922,240 bushels. After the drought had broken and .We returned to normal times, the importations of maize fell away enormously. In 1916-17 only 53,493 bushels were imported; and in 1917-38, 1,807 bushels. The value of our imports of this commodity in 1916-17the year after the drought-wa s only £8,162, while in 1317-18 our importations were valued at only £770.",37
130,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"But we know that freights at that time were very much against importations. We have now established the industry, and as freights are tumbling tdown every day, maize will be dumped in Australia unless we adequately protect the industry.",38
131,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Freight s may haye had something to do with the reduction in our imports, but taking these official figures as a guide, it seems to me that the existing duty will fully protect our growers. We do not want to impose unnecessary duties.",38
132,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I agree with the honourable member, but having consulted the growers and the manufacturers of maize products, I say that the increased duty which I propose is necessary.",38
133,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Seeing that we imported only £770 worth of maize in 1917-18, there is no occasion for increasing the duty.",38
134,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maranoa) [5.5] Whilst sympathizing with the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), I cannot vote for his amendment, knowing as I do that such a duty as he proposes would become effective only when we were practically starved out. It is not many years since I and other honourable members - particularl y from Queensland-urge d the Minister for Trade and Customs to remit the duty, and to allow maize to come in free, in order that our starving stock might be saved. That request was granted, with the result that ship-loads of maize from the Argentine were brought into New South Wales and Queensland, and helped us to save our stock.",38
135,Mr JACKSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The honourable member thinks that the duty as it stands is sufficient under normal conditions?,38
136,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I do.,38
137,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maize-grower s do not think it is sufficient, nor do the manufacturers of maize products. I have no interest in the manufacturers except that I desire that they shall be given fair play, so that they may use what wo produce.",38
138,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I have not heard of any demand for an increase on the part of maize-growers. The honourable member suggested that maize might be dumped here. What is the freight on maize today?,38
139,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,About 2s.,38
140,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Surely , that in itself is a sufficient protection.",38
141,Mr STEWART,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,When we spoke of the freight on machinery affording sumcient protection to local manufacturers we were laughed at.,38
142,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But you do not want machinery to grow maize.,38
143,Mr ROBERT COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,We certainly do.,38
144,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I know the maizefarmers down here want the most up-to-date machinery, but many of the best farmers in Queensland have had to do without the latest machinery. Relying on pure Scotch navigation-pig-headednes s and a long hoe-the y have grown maize to perfection, . planting it by hand - If drought overtook the country, the Minister would at once be asked to remove or suspend the duty. That has been done before.",38
145,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,There would be no objection to the suspension of the duty in time of drought.,39
146,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Then , what is the use of the honourable member's proposal? If the maize-growing industry needed protection, I would be pleased to give it.",39
147,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I assure the honourable member that it does.,39
148,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The honourable member has given no sound reason in support of his proposal. I see plenty of maize being grown in Queensland, and there is a big market for it. Those who have to buy maize to feed stock say it is sold at a terrible price.",39
149,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Jus t before the drought a farmer showed me 150 acres of prime maize, which he said I could have if I would take the crop off and leave the ground fit for the next crop. I persuaded him not to do this, and afterwards got him 3s. per bushel for it. His return was 50 or 60 bushels to the acre.",39
150,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That is only one case. My principal objection is that if an increased duty is put on it will be of no use, because, when the time comes when we want to import maize, the whole of us will go cap in hand to the Minister and ask him to remove the dutyo for the sake of the starving stock.",39
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.12] - I hope the honourable member will not press the amendment. I considered .this mattervery carefully when framing the Tariff. This is the first time that maize, as an item, appears on the Tariff at all. I recognise, as the honourable member does, that the maize industry is very useful to small settlers in suitable areas. I thought the be3t means to protect the industry, although I did raise the duty slightly, was to give a generous measure of protection to those secondary industries which have been built up in this country, and which will take the surplus maize off the market at periods that come along from time to time when more maize is produced than the country can consume. My experience of maize-growing was that there were seasons when the grower could' get a decent price, and other seasons when he could not get a good price at all, particularly for the softer corn grown in the coastal areas. That corn will not keep in definitely, or as well as that grown in areas further inland, ajid it was a question' of either getting rid of it at what one"" could get for it or letting the weevils take it. It is a fact that maize is very largely used in periods of stress in this country. The figures which have already been quoted show that there is no material import of maize except at thoseperiods. If the honourable member succeeded in imposing a relatively high duty - I do not say that he is asking for an exorbitant one-o n maize under normal conditions, the cry that would be raised for the removal of the duty at crucial periods would be a far stronger one, and would more probably be listened to, than if we retained the comparatively moderate duty now contained in this Tariff. It is 100 per cent, higher than it was on the South African product, and it is from that country-that the greater part of the imported maize comes. The duty on maize in the South African Tariff was Is. We have now made it 2s., and there we propose to leave it.",39
152,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That brings South Africa under the same conditions as other countries? Mr MASSYGREENE Yes. If the honourable member succeeded in making the duty 3s. 6d., and a period of drought arrived, I am certain that the Government of the day would say to those who asked for the removal of the duty, "" We cannot refuse your request,"" whereas with the present moderate duty it would he a fair thing to say, if maize grown by black labour was being brought in, that the people here should get the import parity, plus the duty. The honourable member would therefore be serving his people best by allowing this item to stand, and supporting, as he has done, those duties which, by benefiting the secondary industries, form the best protection for the primary industry itself. Mr CORSER, (Wide Bay) [5.17] - I am sorry the Minister does not see his way to accept the amendment, or that I have not had support from the Country party which I felt sure I would get. T know that those members have been asked - by the people in their districts to support my proposal. The growers there are in a different position from those in Victoria, - who have all the land cleared. Hundreds of n.en had to fell the scrub, and then, after burning it off, had to go out with a hoe, and put the corn in by hand. They also had to take the crop off without any machine;, in fact, all the work is done by hand. . My idea was to encourage men of that class to go on to the land, and make a start, by giving them some security that when the maize was harvested Would not have to take an inadequate price for it . If , however, those who ought to support the primary producers will not support my amendment, 1I have no alternative but to ask leave to withdraw it . Amendment,, by leave, withdrawn. Item agreed to.

It is suggested that the duty should be increased to 2Ad. British preferential Tariff, 3d. intermediate Tariff, a«d '4d. general Tariff. It is suggested also that there is no reason why Semolina should be listed as free under the British preferential Tariff, and that we should omit the line ""Semolina,"" and substitute in itsp'ace "" Cereal Breakfast Poods, in packets, 2 i d . British preferential Tariff,' 3d.. intermediate Tariff, and 4d.. general Tariff."" Several linesof cereal breakfast foods are imported, such as Quaker Oats, which are classited for duty under sub-item e, n.e.i, and carry a duty of only l j d . per lb. Many large factories in Australia are manufacturing oatmeal, flaked oats, rol ed oats,, and various. other kinds cf cereal breakfast f j c d s. It is urged that the industry shou'd be effectively protected from American competition by inserting the new sub-item I have indicated. In that they way primary products will be prepared and used in Australia on the breakfast table, instead of foreign-grown and foreign-prepared cereals taking their place here to the value of something over £10,000 per annum in normal times. I make these suggestions to the Minister so that he may consider them before he speaks. - Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 5 . 2 5 ] - I propose to submit two amendments, which, to a great extent, will meet the desires of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton). So far as corn flour is concerned, I have received no request from the manufacturers, and I understand that they are satisfied with the duty of 2d., which is, in my opinion, a fair l y high one. I see that the average price of i m ported corn flour before the war was 3 f d . per lb., and this duty represents nearly - I 50 per cent.  duty onsemolina is a fair one? 0",40

157,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Can it be imported any other form than packed? It is put up in hermetically sealed tins, for otherwise it is dangerous to handle.",41

161,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I do not know that there is any imported, but I thought that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) wished something done in regard, to the item. The effect of the amendment I have indicated will be that,, if phosphorized wheat is imported for retail sale,' it will fall automatically under an ad valorem duty, which will return a higher rate than that set down in the item.",41
162,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Quite right.,41

164,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"For the moment, I cannot tell the honourable member, but the duty will be higher, and, I think, effective. I move That sub-item D be. amended by inserting after the word ""Semolina"" the words, ""up to and including 19th May, 1921."" The effect of this amendment is that semolina will be free, so far as today is concerned., but tomorrow will disappear from the Tariff aud become dutiable. ",41

I have already explained the effect of this amendment. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 59Hay and chaff, per cwt., Is.  the Minister seriously think that Is. per cwt is going to protect this industry? in The argument that applies to maize also applies to this item, which is one bf those scarcely ever exported, the aim of the producers being to meet the local market. In drought time, however, the aim and object of the Governments of the States have been to import, or assist the farmers:in importing it. How long has this duty been on?",41
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"So far as I know, since the beginning.  the revenue that comes into the exchequer from this item. As a matter of fact, its importation, as a rule, does infinitely more harm than good. Many of the pests with which we have to contend, and which have done millions of pounds' worth of harm, were imported in hay, chaff, and seed. There is no real protection, or even assi tance, given by this duty, which., in my opinion, only cumbers the Tariff. This is not the way in which the grower of hay and chaff can be assisted. I would not be one to impose this duty when there was starving stock in Australia. If any one wished to import chaff in competition with the Australian grower, this duty will not prevent him.",41
168,Mr STEWART,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If you leave the duty it will enable the Ministry to say that they are protect'ng the Commonwealth.  as I have already intimated, I grew a cereal that cost me £3.10a. a bushel. The local Government seized it at 6s. 8d., and imported Argentine stuff at 12s. 4d., and the Federal Government removed the duty that was in my favour in order to favour the general public. In the face of these experiences, one looks on rhosa duties with a certain feeling of amusement.",41
169,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Corangamite) [5.32] Thi3 small duty is not going to benefit the industry. Personally, I would welcome absolute prohibition, of the importation of hay and chaff. We know what happened dur'ng the 1914 drought, wl.3n many weeds were brought in which we have been unable to exterminate. ""Very great care should be taken to see that hay and chaff imported are free from these pests. In my own district, where small quantities of fodder came in during the drought, we can see traces of the weeds all over the countryside.",41
170,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Can .you see that they are exotic plants?,42
171,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There are all sorts _ of plants, including the Californian thistle. The Government should see that imported hay and chaff come from countries where none of these weeds exist.",42
172,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Robertson) [5.34] A little while ago I was speaking strongly in favour of as low a Tariff as possible for corn, and now I wish to support the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) in his contention that the importation of hay and chaff should be prohibited. I do this for the same reason which actuated me in proposing to keep down the duty on corn. The introduction of corn brings in no pests, whereas any practical man knows that hay and chaff bring in innumerable specimens. There are such weeds in Australia that have cost, and will cost, hundreds of thousands to destroy-the consequence of careless importation. The point is, however, that, no matter how careful we are, by no method of analysis can we detect all those dangers. For instance, dodder in lucerne has defied any method of inspection, and there are other pests, which do not occur to me at the moment, but which are quite a3 dangerous. When chaff is introduced, as in New South Wale3 during the drought a few years ago, it is found in nearly every case to be more or less useless, not worth putting out to feed stock. Then, further, such importations are certainly dangerous from the producers' point of view; and the Government would be well advised, despite the fact that it is necessary to introduce corn in times of drought, to prohibit the importation of hay and chaff, which at best are only used as a substitute for the more concrete, if I may so term it, forms of feeding.",42
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.35] - Per sonally, I rather favour the prohibition of hay and chaff, but that is a step we eannot take on this occasion. I promise honourable members, however, to give consideration to the matter, and see whether we should not go the whole length of entire prohibition. For feeding stock, imported hay and chaff are precious little gccd; and I thoroughly agree that the most economical feed we can import is probably grain or cake of some kind.,",42
174,Mr STEWART,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Some more concentrated form of food.,42

This amendment is really to facilitate departmental administration more than anything else..

"" Mr Charlton (Hunter) [5.43] - It is claimed by those interested in the manufacture of macaroni and vermicelli that the duty should be considerably increased in order to protect the industry in Australia. In normal times, the importation of macaroni and vermicelli is over £5,000 per annum, notwithstanding that Australian factories are fully equipped and are manufacturing these products under clean and wholesome conditions in accordance with our Pure Poods Act. The imports are chiefly from Italy. .",43
182,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Where the product is manufactured under dirty conditions.,43
183,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I believe that is so. Our manufacturers have to comply with the provisions of our Pure Foods Act, so the least we can do is to give them adequate protection.",43
184,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Robertson) [5.45] I rise to support the request made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton). There is not the slightest doubt that, in ths country referred to, .macaroni and vermicelli are manufactured under conditions that would not be tolerated in Australia. Our industries should not be subjected to unfair competition. These commodities are the product of hard wheat, and as we can pro.duce the raw material in unlimited quantities, and equal in quality to the hard wheats from any other.part of the world, except, perhaps, some of the provinces of Canada, we' ought to do what we can to encourage our own manufacturers.",43

It is difficult to get the e^act figures, but we used to import over 500,000 lbs. of these commodities yearly, though in 1918-19 the figure dropped to 81,000 lbs.",43
186,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That was under war conditions.,43
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes , and I understand there was some slight advance in importations in 1919-20; but, on the other hand, the Australian production has risen to 2.240,000 lbs. I think it likely that if we put a little higher duty on the general Tariff, the position would be met.",43
188,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If British merchants imported macaroni from Italy, and then sent it to Australia, would it be admitted under the British preferential Tariff ?",43
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"No ; because in the case of goods re-exported from Britain, it is necessary, if they are to enjoy the preferential rates, that they sha 1 be 25 per cent, in value of British origin.",43
190,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"But Italy was an Ally in the late war."" Should not imports from that country come in under the intermediate Tariff?",43
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"No . The intermediate rate is inserted for bargaining purposes, but we do not propose to enter into any reciprocal - Tariff arrangements without the approval of Parliament. If we see a chance of doing trade with any other country with some of our primary products upon which, say, there is a high Tariff, we can negotiate, using this intermediate Tariff as a basis upon which to bargain. If such negotiations are satisfactory, the arrangement will be embodied in a Bill, and presented to Parliament. In regard to this item, if it is the wish of the Committee, I am prepared to increase also the intermediate Tariff, and I therefore move[5.46] - That the item be amended by adding the "" And on and after 20th May, 1921-, British, I d . ; intermediate, 2d.; general, 3d.""

The effect of the alteration would be to make the duty on kernels 2d., 2d., and 3d., and on unshelled nut?, 4d., 4d. and 6d. in the respective columns. The. reasons for these, alterations areAs to paragraph D] nut kernelsare imported mostly for manufacturing ' purposes, being used extensively by confectioners, pastry cooks, and biscuit and cake manufacturers. Although almonds are grown in various parts :.of Australia, yet the total crop at no time has approached within 50 per cent, of the consumption. Owing to the high cost of labour arid the difficulty of removing the kernel in a sound condition, only a small proportion are offered unshelled - A large manufacturer has repeatedly tried to purchase his requirements without Buccess; in fact, twelve mouths' purchases are not equal to one-twelfth of his consumption. As to paragraph E, nuts in shells are mostly used for dessert purposes. The bulk of the Australian crop is sold for this trade owing to the reluctance of the grower..tp undertake the removal bf the nut from Item 75 (Milk, including cream).",45

197,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Herbert) [6.3] - The - peanut-growing industry is becoming somewhat important in the' noTth. A friend of nfno, who has 25 acres under peanuts, expects before long to have at lea^t 100 acres under the same crop. He tells me that the nuts come'out of the ground perfectly white, and ready to go on the market, and that the tops form the best food cattle could have. I am told that cattle fattened on peanut tops are fit to go into any show in Australia. The Peanut Promoter, a journal which is devoted entirely to the peanut industry of America,- gives T.ustrations of the various classes of machinery employed in handling the nuts, and contains a photograph of a convention of peanut-growers called for the purpose of promoting the industry. In the United - States of America there are 1,250,000 acres under peanuts, and the est'mated yield in 1920 was 450,000 tons. In addition, a large area is hogged down. That is' to say, pigs are turned into the crops to be tened. The United States of America also imports 70,000,000 lbs. of peanuts, principally from Japan and Manchuria. At Marrickville, in Sydney, a large tory has been built for treating peanuts and extracting peanut oil. It produces milk, butter, and an oil which, when fined, is equal for salad-making puramounts poses to the best olive oil. It is signifilarge cant that the Commonwealth Year-Book makes no mention of this splendid edible product. But it is not merely an edible product. Only the best nuts go into the market for edible purposes. The others are used for the purpose of extracting oil. Even in America, where the industry so well established, the growers are askspecial ing for protection against imported peacontent. nutsand last week Australian growers asked me to put in a plea for a - duty that. of ' 6d. per lb. on . nuts used for the extraction of oil. The nuts treated at the Marrickville factory are mainly imported; but the factory can readily take all that can be produced in Ausundertake tralia. However, the growers are asking for an increased duty of Id. per lb. The bulletin of the Un'ted States of America Bureau of Agriculture shows that from November, 1919, to August, 1920, the portation of peanuts into the States amounted to^sbelled, 66,021,965 lbs.; sheHed, 13,291,017 lbs. These figures approval. indicate what a big industry it is. An increase of l d. per lb. on the duty imtoposed here would considerably help to promote the peanut-growing industry in item Australia. We import nuts from Japan Peanuts, and Manchuria, where wages are 6d. to 9d. per day, whereas labour in Queensland costs l is . to 16s. per day. The quest of the growers is a very reasonable one, and I hope the Minister will grant it.",45
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If the honourable ber chooses, I am willing to a special item, but I am not prepared to increase the duty upon unshelled nuts all round.",46

There is also a considerable production . in New South reWales, but I do not know exactly what it to. I do know, however,' that areas have been put under peanuts since these figures were compiled.

210,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I do not think so. The words to which the honourable member has d rected attention would be so : much surplusage in the schedule which we are now considering, because the Customs Act provides that under the Tariff the highest duty which can be charged upon any good3 shall be charged.

211,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Corangamite) [6.21] The onion-growing industry in Victoria has points of similarity with the banana industry in Queensland. I am sorry that I have no film with which to entertain honourable members during the dinner adjournment. Had I benn able to present a moving p cture of the onion-grow: ing industry, honourable members would be struck with the fact that, whereas men employed in banana-growing were seen travelling about the country in motor cars, onion-growers would be depicted crawling along on their knees weeding their hold'ngs. The industry is suffering perhaps more than any other primary industry in Australia. In my desire to secure increased duties, I feel certain that I shall have the support of the whole of the members of the Labour party, seeing that they are determined that Australians shall not consume any importation winch has been produced by black labour. At present the price of onions is £3 per ton. That is an unprofitable figure; it is impossible to grow onions and market them for such a return. The industry is not one which is carried on upon any large scale. Generally, only a few acres are sown, probably in conjunction with dairying and mixed farming. Present prices for onions are having the effect of driving growers into a strong association. They have had to combine for their own protection.",47
212,Mr RODGEKS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Amon g their disabilities, it is a fact that onion land is about the highest priced of ""all.",47
213,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes ; the cost is about intended £100 per acre, which apnroximates to the cost of banana land in Queensland. The production cost is about £30 per acre, which is approximately the same as in the case of bananas. But the return from the latter amounts fo about £180 per acre, while for onions the return varies from nothing to £100. The average rent paid for onion ground in Victoria is £7 per acre.",47
214,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,How can the high values for onion land be maintained when the industry is unprofitable?,47
215,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"They have been maintained through a few good seasons; and, during the years of the war, there was Brinot much imported produce to compete against.",47
216,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Are the onion-growers satisfied with a duty of Is. per cwt.?,47
217,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"They are not. I shall furnish honourable members with statistics concerning costs of cultivation. This involves, ploughing, scarifying, harrowing, and, by other means, working the soil; and the cost is calculated at £2 ,10s. 6d. per acre. The cost of seed is £1 Is.; that is to say, 3 lbs. to the acre at 7s. per lb. Sowing with hand drill costs 8s. per acre. Cleaning during the growing stage, based on a wage of Is. fid. per hour, amounts to £8. Skinning costs 103. per acre. Bags for a 6-ton crop are calculated to cost £4 4s. per acre. Twine, and sewing bags, on the basis of a 6-ton crop, means an outlay of 11a. 6d. Stripping, at the rate of Is. per bag, amounts to £3 12s. Carting to the railway station, at the rate of 7s. per ton, involves an expenditure of £2 2s. Loading and weighing, together, add a further 9s. The total cost per acre for growiug and placing on trucks is set down at £30 Ss. It is calculated that the average annual area under onion crop in Australia is 6,000 acres, and that the average yield is 4£ tons to the acre. ing the return at 6 tons to the acre-the present price being £3 per ton-the oniongrower's return amounts to only £18, while his costs are more than £30 per acre. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will agree to an increase of the duty from Is. 6d. per cwt. to 6s. per cwt - that is, to £6 per ton. Honourable members may be interested to know that Australians get most of their onions from Japan. Importat ons from that country last year : amounted to 43,796 cwt., valued at £32,631. The total importations for 19.19-20 were 55,245 cwt., valued at £39,326. From the United Kingdom we got only 62 cwt., valued at £60. From New Zealand, 7,S92 cwt., valued at £4,363; from other British countries, 49 cwt., valued at £61; from China, 32 cwt., valued at £50; and from the United States of America, 3,053 cwt., valued at £1,695. The enormous preponderance of our importations came, as I have just shown, from Japan. The local objectionis not in respect of importations from countries where the produce is grown by white labour, but there is a very great objection to the great proportion of our imports coming from Japan. There, the onions are grown undur conditions which, if the Australian consumer were aware of them, would put an end to his desire to purchase the Japanese product. The cultivation is carred on in very small lots, generally in back-yards; and I am not willing to indicate the kind of manure used. The. Australian industry requires adequate protection, or it will be crushed. I ask for a substantial increase. Deputation after deputation has waited on the Minister for Customs from different districts in Victoria, which State grows practically the whole of the Australian produce of this kind. If the onion-growprs were to ask for the same degree of protection as the banana-growers succeeded Sir. Oibson. in getting, their request would be for a duty of about £9 per ton.",47

Onion-growing can be carried on profitably only in connection with dairying and on small areas-area s of about 10 acres.

It calls for hard work, and the product, which is a perishable one, has to be marketed between April and November, those months being included. We should protect our growers from the competition of Japanese onions, which are imported about July or August. Mr JACKSON ""(Bass) [8.5] - I support the amendment.

244,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Dampier) [8.20] With your permission, Mr Deputy Chairthat man, I desire to make a personal explanaalso tion in regard to an attack made upon by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), wbo charged me with givmoved. ing incorrect information to the Departaction ment in connection with a matter to which as I previously referred. At that time, had the schedule issued prior to the one our which was adopted by this Parliament, and I was pointing out the change that was beingmade. I find that in this schethere is one item in the first portion and two or three towards the end that are on the free list, as well as others. I rather resented the statement of the Minister when he asked the Committee to believe that I was not right in the statement. I the was making, because I have endeavoured to be very careful. I have not the priviof the Minister in dealing with in matters of this kind, but I have always endeavoured «to be as fair as one can possibly be in dealing with questions of this In connection with the duty on rennet, honourable members will notice that importations in liquid form are subject to a duty of 6s., 7s., and 8s. per gallon, and 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 40 preper cent. I uttered some very strong statements in connection with this matter in the general debate, and I now desire to refer to the action of the Ministerof who was probably advised by his departmental omcers-in placing an embargo on importation of goods, particularly when the Minister assumes the power to embargoes on importations on the advice of the officers of his Department. Rennet is a commodity required in conwith the manufacture of cheese, which is one of the big industries of this country. The Minister, probably at the imbehest of the Department, placed an embargo on the importation of rennet into Australia. It is a very difficult proposition to make good rennet, especially when the veils are not available for the purpose. I have in my possession nearly a hundred statements, which have been received from all parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and some from South BriAustralia, complaining of the action of (u) the Department in imposing an embargo on rennet, and which was shortly afterwards removed. I mention this to show the Minister and his officers can make mistakes, because when they me found that their action was destructive to the industry, 'the embargo was reI lay particular stress upon the of the Department in this instance, because I desire to emphasize the necessity of the power being placed in the hands of the Parliament instead, of the Minister. The Minister recognised that principle when dealing with carbide, cause he submitted a motion to Parliament when it was decided to place an embargo on the importation of carbide. c.i.f. Melbourne. When one considers the peculiar difficulties surrounding the manufacture net in a country such as Australia, it must be admitted that special should be made in the Tariff to protect such an important industry. I move That the item be amended by adding the following words :- "" And on and after 20th May, 1921, free.""",50
245,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.25] - I trust the Committee will not agree to the amendment submitted by the honourable twelve months. member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I admit that the manufacture of rennet more or less a difficult process, but I draw the attention of the Committee the fact that during the war the cheeseable making industry would have come to an abrupt termination if the local manufacwith turers had not set to work to manufacture rennet. A considerable quantity made, and it was found by the cheese manufacturers to be entirely satisfactory, although there were isolated cases where it was not so. It is a delicate process, small. and the production of the veils was difficult work, which required to be handled by men of long experience before the satisfactory nature of the veils could guaranteed. Since the time to which the honourable member referred, when there were complaints, a number of people have been devoting a good deal of attention to the production of this necesfacture, sary commodity. The New South vernment Wales Abattoirs Board has given attensity tion to the matter, and it is now turning out a thoroughly satisfactory veil, that if our supplies should be cut off a moment's notice one of our great pricheese mary industries is not likely to suffer very severely. Now that the industry has been established and is employing large number of men, I think it would a retrograde step to place this article the free list.",51

We can only say, looking back on our experience in connection! this matter, that it is desirable to continue the manufacture of rennet in was the Commonwealth, and we should, therefore, give the industry some encouragement, particularly when the actual quantity used is comparatively",51
255,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maribyrnong) [8.30] I hope that the amendment will be rejected. During the war it fell to my lot be to visit the Commonwealth Laboratory, where Mr Wilkinson, the Commonwealth Analyst, who did magnificent work during the war, was successful in manufacturing: rennet, if he did not originate its manuin Australia. The British Gohad said that owing to the necesfor conserving shipping space we should, as far as practicable, supply our so own requirements in Australia. It was at impossible during the war for makers of in this country to import rennet, and, but for its manufacture here, cheesemaking in this country would have come a to a standstill. If at any time am be attempt is made to take undue adon vantage of manufacturers of cheese ns Australia, the Minister' for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will have in Mr Wilkinson a gentleman'-'who will be fully competent to advise him. Now that we are practically self-contained in connection with the manufacture of cheese, we certainly .should not aliow rennet made in Denmark and in other countries to be admitted free of duty to the Commonwealth. We should give some protection to those who have gone to the trouble and expense of manufacturing rennet in Australia. They have produced an article which is satisfactory to our cheese-makers, and it has not been found that the quality of Australian cheese has deteriorated as a result of the use of Australian-made rennet. The rennet industry is a valuable adjunct to the more important industry of cheese-making, and we should do what we can to protect it.  right enough to protect the great cheesemak ng industries, but we snail not do ; so by imposing a duty on rennet. In imposing this duty the Minister for Trade and. Customs (Mr Greene) is departing from an important principle of the Tariff. Under the item immediately before that which we are now considering a number of articles of manufacture are made dutiable, but the raw material essential to their - manufacture is admitted free. Rennet is essential to the manufacture of cheese. It is not a big item, but it is an essential factor in the manufacture of cheese, and we should have the best we oan obtain. We cannot expect to compete with other countries in manufactured articles if we do not use the best materials. The Minister should recognise the principle that the raw materials of an industry should be ,admitted free of duty. The manufacture of rennet can never be a very big industry, but cheese-making is a very important industry, and we should consider it in dealing with this question. Mr HILL .(Echuca) [8.34] - I support the amendment. I have here a sheaf of correspondence from all the principal butter factories and dairymen's assothe ciations of the Commonwealth, protesting against a duty on rennet. We should be guided largely by what these people have to-say. L shall read one letter from Mr. James Cameron, representative in London of the'Victorian Butter Factories Association, as it is typical of the other correspondence that has been received. Writing under date 18th June, 1920, he says:With reference to the impost of a duty of 8s. per gallon on foreign manufactured rennet and 6s. per gallon on British manufactured rennet, I wish to draw attention to the fact that this is an injustice to the cheese producers of Australia. 1 understand thatone of the principal objects in imposing this duty is to foster local manufacture. To carry this out it means that it will cost the producers of Australia thousands of pounds.' This does not altogether seem a fair proposition, more especially as it is made with the object of bolstering up an industry that will never be a success for the following reasons:(1) There are not sufficient calf veils obtainable in Australia, for the reason that the dairyman does not as a rule kill all his calves. He invariably keeps the best heifer calves, and if the price of stook is a payable one he will not kill the steer calves either, and even when he does kill them lie will not bother about saving the veils, as the price obtainable for these is so low. For calf veils to be good they have to be taken when the calf is a few days old. The law of the country here prevents the selling of calves under a certain weight. Consequently, the calf .has to. be kept until it is too old before being kil'ed, and on this account a great many of the veils are useless. Again, it is impossible to .rely upon the veils, as the climatic conditions are against them. . In Continental countries the veils are taken from the coldest climates, such as the north of Russia, . and they are taken when the calves are very young. (2) The price of good imported foreign rennet is fully 10s. per gallon cheaper, and almost twice the strength of that of the local manufacturer. The latter .can be proved by the evidence of the principal manufacturers of cheese. Even if the locally manufactured article could be made of the same strength, there is not anything like enougn to supply the requirements. Special strong pure rennet can be supplied at 25s, c if. Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane. Here is another letter from Mr Edmund Turrell, secretary to the Queensland Cheese Manufacturers AssociationMr Galbraith bas handed me your letter of 20th instant, referring to the Government prohibiting importations of rennet, and asked me to reply, as this association had already taken the matter up, with .the Minister for Customs . . . . Locally-made rennets have been used by our manufacturers, and the results have been unsatisfactory, the strength of the article being unreliable. Prices were from 30s. to 35s. ""or gallon. Canadian rennet has been given a trial. Two small trial shipments gave good results, but a large shipment gave very unsatisfactory results, and I understand that agents here now decline to' handle any more of this particular manufacture. All this correspondence goes to show that the rennet that is being manufactured in Australia does not meet the requirements of local cheese manufacturers. I am of opinion that in the circumstances foreignmade rennet should be allowed to come into Australia free. The cheese manufacturers of this country say that unless tney can procure good rennet at a reasonable price they must be content to make poorer cheese or go out of the business altogether.

257,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Hindmarsh) [8.47] This item offers me a favourable opportunity to enter my protest against combinations of manufacturers that are operating today contrary to the best ih^ terests of the community. In my contribution to the general debate, ' I ""mentioned that the wholesale warehousemen were the greatest factors ' controlling prices, but that there were manufacturers - fortunatel y limited in number-wh o .. 19 did not recognise their obligation to give .. 25 the people their p'roducts at a reasonable price. I find that there are certain associations or combinations of manufacAYES. turers working to the detriment of the people. There is a Salt Refiners and Manufacturers Association; and the In ter-State Commission, in one of its', reports, states that the Association has an agreement binding the manufacturers and refiners to certain methods of distribution and prices. This organization controls the whole industry. It not only fixes prices, but. according to what is best in NOES. the interests of its members* determines the area in which this man or that may trade. I understand that each member of the Association has to put up £250 as"" a guarantee that he will observe any agreement that is arrived at. The salt companies have also made an undue in crease in their profits during recent years, and consumers have not received at their hands the consideration that is due to them in respect of a commodity that is used by every family. When I learn of any combination acting to the detriment of the people's welfare, I do not hesitate to voice my protest against it . notwithstanding my adherence to the policy of Protection. In respect of, not only salt, but biscuits, rice, cereals, pickles, jams, and soaps, there are asso- I ciations and combinations working against the best interests of the general community. There are in my electorate quite as many industries as there are in any other Commonwealth division, and I realise my duty to those of my constituents who .are employed in connection 'with - them: - One of these industries is that of soap-making, and I find that soap manufacturers have not only increased ftheir prices, but have decreased the - weight of the bars or packages, sold by 4hem. It would not be right for me to allow this opportunityto pass without protesting against such action. The Protectionists in this House are prepared to help our industries, but we expect those engaged in them to give a fair deal to the rest of the community. Even the most ardent supporters of Protection vote for some items with'a-greater degree of satisfaction than they have when voting for others: I am sent here to protect and encourage Industrie's,, not merely for the future welfare of the country, but to secure an immediate advantage to those who are employed in it , by the of better conditions in employment, having due regard always to the protection of Ihe - consumer"" from the avarice of commercialism, 'either in the form d>f the warehouseman or manufacturer.

If we are not to discuss the actions of the people who are benefited by this protective duty on salt, then why continue the farce of pretending to debate the Tariff? The action taken by the Minister confirms the statement. I made during the general debate; that the whole Tariff was cut-and-dried, arid that the discussion of it was a mere piece of "" tomfoolery.""

If the statement of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that the people do not take an interest in the proceedings on the Tariff is correct, the tenor of the bate, so far, has justified their valuation of what happens here. The combinations, companies, and industrial concerns particularly interested in salt were criticised by the previous speaker, who complained that they took an unfair advantage of the Protection given to them and unduly harassed the public. If honourable members condemn these commercial enterprises for fleecing the public, and know that they are doing so, I cannot understand honourable members supporting these concerns in what they are doing, and helping them to do it more effectively by increasing the duties on the very articles which they are manipulating",54

268,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maranoa) [9.3]. - The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has accused the people who manufacture salt of forming a. combine, restricting the output, and restraining those to whom the salt is issued for retail Tariff. purposes. Will the Minister state whether that sort of thing will be dealt with under the Bill which he intends to duce?",55
269,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes , certainly. If Tariff Board reports to the House that the manufacturers are taking undue advantage of the Tariff, it will be for the .House to say whether the duty shall be continued.",55

272,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation. I should also like him to tell the Committee dehe has increased the duty. Is it for revenue purposes, or to give further Protection?",55
273,Mr GEEENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.5] - There is no advance in item 89, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned. Under sub-item A, salt from the United Kingdom is free, and under sub-item », salt, n.e.i., from the United Kingdom, is subject to a duty of 20s. per ton. All the rocksalt we import comes from Great Britain. Still there are rock-salt mines in Germany and elsewhere, and I thought it desirable to give the United Kingdom a bigger preference than heretofore. I raised the general Tariff rate for that purpose. Item agreed to. Item 90Sausage casings, free.  vote for this item I should l.ke the Minister say if none of these sausage casor sausage rennets, are manufactured in Australia. Here is this wonderful principle again. These things are free, and that was the principle I advocated on another item a little while ago.

274,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister introfor Trade and Customs) [9.7] - The reason we have suggested no duty on this item is that we export large quantities of the sausage casings. Nobody has ever asked for a duty on the manufactured casings. We produce a great many more than we actually require. It is true that at times import certain quantities, but no one has ever asked for a duty on them. Item agreed to.

276,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The Chairman has not ruled so at all.,56
277,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE," The ""honourable member will not be in order in moving for the introduction of any new item.",56
278,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Then I can only make an appeal to the Minister. In this item cotton seed oil and castor bean oil are not provided for. The manufacture of those articles would mean a great deal for many parts of this continent, more part'cularly in Queensland. The castor bean is now being grown very largely in Queensland, and is proved to yield about 50 per cent, of oil, wh'ch is as good as that produced in any other part of the world. Thero is no protection whatever on it, and we want to encourage this industry. Honourable members desire a larger population in this continent, and to establish this industry would be one way of insuring it. It would give good employment, not only to the men who would grow the beans, but also to those who would manufacture the oil. Then, as regards Cotton seed oil, the Bureau of Science and Industry says that the consumption is about 4.000 tons per annum. Cotton is now being largely grown in Queensland, where it is anticipated that we shall have no less than 3,000 acres under crop. That area will produce 3,500 tons of seed cotton, from which will be obta ned 500 tons of lint and 1,000 : tons of sued. Surely that quantity is of sufficient magnitude to justify us in giving some protection to the oil produced from cotton seed grown in the Commonwealth.",56
279,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Cotto n seed appears in item 92.,56
280,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It is the oil I am speaking of.,56
281,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Cotto n seed oil is protected, Mr CORSER,-Casto r bean is not. I should like the Committee to understand the importance of both these industries to Australia. Any encouragement that can be given to growers of cotton seed or castor beans will be a matter of great importance to the Commonwealth, and there is no protection on castor bean or cotton seed.",56
282,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.12] - There is a duty on cotton seed, and so long as cotton seed is being produced in Austral'a we shall uot prescribe it under departmental by-laws as included in sub-item A of item 91. That is, we shall not admit it free. The oils made from castor beans and cotton seed are protected.",56
283,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The Department could not tell me. where. They suggested to me that I should get them included in this item.,56
284,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The honourable member will find in item 229, sub-item F, that castor o l is subject to a duty of 6d. per gallon under the British preferential Tariff, and 8d. per gallon under the intermediate and general Tariffs. All the things the honourable member mentioned are protected, except the castor bean. There is no protect on in the Tariff for it, and no item which includes it. The reason I have not included castor beans in the Tariff is that all my inquiries went to show that you could not at present expect to have a reasonable quantity of them produced in Australia.",56
285,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,You can get any quantity you want if you give the industry encouragement.,56
286,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There is no question that the plant will grow in Australia. It does grow prolifically in many parts of the Commonwealth; but the seed cannot be gathered at any one time. You do not get a crop which ripens so that the whole of it can be taken off at the one operation. The Seed goes on ripening all the time. My information, so far as it goes, is that this seed has to be gathered by hand all the time, as it were, from week to week and day to day as it ripens. That is the reason this commodity is left Out; but I promise to look further into the matter, and, if necessary, I shall. «ee that some action is taken before the Tariff is finally disposed of. I now have to move as a mere drafting amendment That the letters "" n.e.i."" in sub-item A be left out. The reason for this is that if the item, as it stands, was strictly and literally interpreted, the effect, without the amendment, would be to exclude seeds and nuts, wlrch are elsewhere included in the Tariff.",56
287,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Does that mean that it will be at the Minister's discretion to admit all seeds and nuts free for manufacturing?,56
288,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It does not mean that at all. Amendment agreed to.,57
289,Mr MACKAY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Lilley) [9.17] - Has the Minister received any request from the Queensland growers in regard to canary seed? Ju3t recently, I received a communication from them informing me that owing to an extraordinarily heavy crop it has been suggested that, a Pool be formed. I have seen some of the wholesale seedsmen, who agree that the price is - extremely low and the demand very small. The Under Secretary for Agriculture in Queensland has given me some figures, which show that in 1915 there were 15 acres under cultivation, producing 4,800 lbs., whereas in 1917 there were 7,596 acres producing 4,406,904 lbs. That fell away in 1919 to 226,599 lbs. from 1,698 acres, and in 1920 there were 2,500 acres under crop, producing 2,000,000 lbs. I am informed that the seed grown in Queensland is of very good quality, and the wholesale merchants of Sydney and Melbourne are quite prepared to buy it at a reasonable price. From time to time, however, they are troubled with imports from Argentine, Turkey,. Morocco, and Japan, and I suggest that the Minister mi?ht ra se the British and intermediate ; duties by 2s., and the general rate by 2s. 6d.",57

291,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Robertson) [9.21] Lucerne seed occupies rather an unusual position. A great number of returned men who have been given land in New South Wales, and, I presume, in other ^States, have settled on ""small areas for the purpose of growing lucerne. I have received a letter from a number of such returned soldiers asking me to move the Minister in the direct.on of prohib.ting the importation of lucerne seed. That sounds rather drastic, but I think it is essential that it should be done, not only for the protection of the man who grows the seed, but also for the protection of our pastures and crops. By the introduction of foreign lucerne seed, we have already brought into this country more than one great menace to our cultivation-fields. I have here a letter from the Primary Producers Union of Aberdeen, New South Wales, from which I should like to read one or two extracts. The meeting of the union was specially called to consider the question uf imported lucerne seed, and the following is from a report of the proceedingsThey would remember that, owing to the grave danger of the introduction of foreign noxious weeds, this branch made representations some time ago to have the importation of all foreign seed prohibited. The Government of the day, recognising the wisdom of this, met the request by imposing what they reckoned was a prohibitive duty of 6d. per lb., and, as a further safeguard, issued a regulation that all imported seed should be stained so that it could be identified. However, the drtv and resrnl-tion have now been suspended.",57
292,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That is not so; .the duty has never been suspended.,57
293,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Then what as to the regu'ation that imported seed must be stained 1 Has that been suspended t,57
294,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Yes ; but I shall explain by and by.,57
295,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Thes e people on whose behalf I speak are deeply interested in this industry, and know what they are talking about. In my electorate, and just north ofi t , in the electorate cf NewEngland, and also in the Hunter electorate, are found the greatest lucerneproducing centres in Australia, capable of supplying all the seed requirements of the Commonwealth. Another representative at the meeting saidMerchants were very loath to admit that they stocked imported seed. However, he knew definitely that some seedsmen had offered to do business. Dealings in this class of stuff would be most lucrative to merchants so engaged, hence the traffic in this inferior article. This seed would be sold out to the unsuspecting farmer as prime Hunter Biver, Tamworth, Mudsee, or any brand the buyer fancied. Again it was contendedthat there was np justification, for the suspension of the duty, or, more especially, the staining for identification purposes. One representative saidOwing to access to it, this inferior seed had been re-exported from here as best New South Wales grown, with a result that our trade had been ruined, and New Zealand had now prohibited us landing lucerne seed there at all. If we kept clear of imported seed we would soon get our good name back, and trade also. The position is that not only have some of our fields been destroyed, but, as stated at the meeting by a man from New Zealand, who has resided for some time in New South Wales, imported seed carries so many dangers that we have destroyed our trade with the sister Dominion. I impress on the Minister the absolute necessity-if we are to do any trade, and maintain this necessary fodder in its pure state-of prohibiting the imported article, especially in view of the fact that Australia can produce a'l we can possibly require. The dangers of importation are much greater than any benefits that can be derived.",57
296,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.27] - The duty was never suspended after being put on. This is the first time there has been any duty on this commodity, and it has been collected. There was a regulation issued in connection with the staining imported seed.",58
297,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Was not the importafor tion of seed altogether prohibited?,58
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"No ; there was a hibition on importation, but it was merely technical in order to secure the staining. It was subsequently discovered that the stain prescribed interfered with the germinating powers of the seed. consequence, we felt we had to withdraw the regulation. However, we set to work and know that no pests are being intro to find another stain, and the Commonduced. wealth analyst has been successful. now use rouge, which produces the delabour sired indelible effect, and does not intersecond fere with the germinating powers. The fact will soon become known throughout the trade, and it will be impossible to the imported for the Australian seed.",58
299,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,What about the other dangers ?,58
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That matter has been very carefully inquired into, and keen supervision is exercised.",58
301,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,You cannot examine the whole.,58
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Bul k samples are taken and gone through carefudy'. At the present time, I think, it would be a hardship to some of our producers if we absolutely prohibited importation. However, that is a matter which we cannot deal with here, and I only desire to explain what has been done. The honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) has also interested himself in the matter, and he knows that I have taken a considerable amount of trouble in this connection.",58
303,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Hunter) [9.28] - I am in accord with the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming). It is quite true, as the Minister (Mr Greene) states, that, prior to the present Tariff, there has been no duty on lucerne seed, and I find that a great deal is coming in. A return shows that, during the last twelve months, Victoria imported £2,000 worth, chiefly from South Africa. This South African seed is sold 5d. or 7d. cheaper than the Hunter River seed, although the latter is probably the best in the world. It is now proposed to impose a duty of only 6d., which means that the South African seed may be brought here, and sold at the of same price as the Australian seed. Probably many farmers who do not know the difference may purchase the imported seed Australian. The Minister has done good work in imposing a duty of 6d., but proI think' he might add another 3d.",58
304,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Mak e it a shilling.,58
305,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I Would agree to that, for the duty certainly ought to be As a higher than is proposed in the Tariff. It is more satisfactory to produce our own seed, 1 The South African seed can be We produced much more cheaply owing to conditions, but as our own seed is to none, and can be produced in abundance, our farmers should have the benefit. It is bringing about Is. 5d. to sell 2s. 2d. per lb. This duty is not going to make lucerne any dearer, for the simple reason that at present the South African seed is being sold at from 5d. ""to 7d. per lb. below the price charged for the Australian product. Would it not be better to add something to the duty in order to make sure of the market for the local article? - It is a fair request.",58
306,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,rAn y man who knows anything about lucerne seed admits that our seed is worth double the price paid for the imported article.,59
307,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Exactly . better in every respect, and, therefore, we ought to encourage its use.",59
308,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"""Will you accept 9d. in the general Tariff?",59
309,Mr HAY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"New England) [9.31] - As the Minister (Mr Greene) has mentioned, I have taken a considerable amount of interest in the production of lucerne seed. Lucerne is our greatest insurance during a period of drought. My constituents have brought this question under my notice, and I want to emphasize the danger of introducing very serious pests in imported lucerne seed. Minister has told us he has consulted the Government Analyst, and I am satisfied that the regulation, which was suspended but which is now in force, meets the case, so far as the staining of imported seed is concerned, but, in my judgment, the duty is inadequate. I would prefer to see it raised to Is. 6d. per lb. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), who represents one of the most important lucerne districts in New South Wales, and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), whose constituents also grow large quantities of the seed, are both satisfied that we can produce enough for the whole of our requirements.",59
310,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Can you if the South African seed suits certain climates ?,59
311,Mr HAY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I am not considering the slimatic conditions at all. I am considering the evil results that might follow the further introduction of South African seed. All those who are engaged in agricultural and pastoral undertakings know that this country is loaded with imported pests introduced chiefly in fodders from other countries. At a certain period of the year the Cape weed covers Victorian fields with a carpet of yellow flowers. We should: take every care to prevent the introduction of further pests. I move That the item be amended by adding the following words:-""And on arid after 20th May, 1921, per lb., U . 6<L""[349]",59
312,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Echuca) [9.35] - I hope, the Committee will pause before agreeing to the higher duty suggested by the honourable member for New England (Mr. Hay). Surely the introduction of imI t is purities in seed can be got over without actually prohibiting the introduction of the seed itself. In Victoria alone thousands of returned soldiers are engaged in the dairying industry on small areas, upon which they are producing lucerne, and I say it would be absolutely criminal to penalize them to the extent of an extra Is. per lb. for their lucerne seed. What is wanted is better supervision over the seed that is imported. I appeal to the Minister not to accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for New England, and I also urge him to The take adequate measures to see that imported seed is absolutely pure. I have been informed recently- I am not in a position to stand up to the statement that impure lucerne seed has been imported from other countries, sent to the Hunter River district, and from there to all parts of the Commonwealth, branded as Hunter River lucerne seed. Our Agri-. cultural Departments should take steps to check this practice.",59
313,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Wakefield) [9.37],- I agree with the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) . We all admit that Hunter River lucerne seed is. the best in Australia, and I think our farmers will have it if they can get it, even if they have to pay a higher price for it. But it is quite conceivable that the South say African seed may be preferred for some climates, although as a general: rule the Hunter River seed is asked for. It is unnecessary to increase the duty to Is. 6d. If there is to be any increase at all, I hope the Minister will not agree to more than 3d. upon the present Tariff.",59
314,Mr LIVINGSTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Barker). [9.38]. - It would be a mistake to increase the duty upon this important fodder. Instead of having any duty at all we ought to let it come in. free, in the interests of our agriculturists. I know of no. other product, saving perhaps sugar beet, which is of greater value to our producers.",59
315,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.3Q],-In face of the opinions expressed by the several farmers' representatives, who; have spoken, it is - rather difficult for me to determine what is right and proper. I have said , that I will agree to make the general Tariff 9d. I think that meets the views of most honourable members who have spoken.",59
316,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Robertson) [ 9 . 4 l ] should like the Minister to give us an assurance that something will be done to prohibit the importation of seed which may be dangerous to the producers of Australia. A very real danger is to be apprehended from the introduction of impure lucerne seed. I have done some practical work myself in connection with lucernegrowing, from the actual preparation of the fields to the reaping of the lucerne seed, so I am not speaking as a theorist.",60
317,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I will undertake to do whatever is possible.,60
318,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It is possible, by very careful inspection of small quantities of seed, to prevent the importation of pests; but the position is different when the Department is called upon to handle bulk quantities of lucerne seed. The officials might handle the better part of a ton, but if the last few pounds are not closely inspected there is always a danger of the introduction of some seed pests from South Africa or South America. The honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) has emphasized that lucerne is our greatest stand-by in our time of drought. It has saved Australia millions of pounds, and, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) has pointed out, quite a large number of returned soldiers now engaged in the dairying industry require the lucerne seed for their fodder paddocks. Surely the honourable member does not think that I would advocate anything against the interests of our returned soldiers. The locally-grown seed is worth twice as much as the imported article; hut, unfortunately, most of these men do not know that. They have had no practical experience, and so they are induced to buy the imported seed. I again ask the Minister, if he does not increase the duty, to give us an assurance that there will be the strictest supervision over the importation of lucerne seed from other countries. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr GREENE) agreed toThat the item be amended by the addition of the following words:-""And on and after 20th May, 1921 (general), 9d.""

319,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Echuca) [9.44] - I cannot let this item go through without raising my voice against any further Protection being given to the soap manufacturers of this country. The prices charged at present are outrageous. Our honourable friends on the other side now have the chance of a life-time to do something against the soap manufacturers' Combine which exists, not only in this country, but in every country of the world.",60
320,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"That is the fault of the honourable member's supporters. Mr RICHABD I OSTEB -""Why ?",60
321,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Because they would not give us power to check Combines.,60
322,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I do not know whether this Tariff was designed for the purpose of creating a nation of millionaires and paupers, but I am very much afraid that many of the items will have that effect. Twenty-five years ago I was engaged in an industry in which I handled a large quantity of tallow. To-day I can buy it at a lower price than I paid. then.",60
323,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,At what price could you buy it two years ago?,60
324,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"To-da y I can buy the best mutton tallow in tins at from £14 to £15 per ton. Two or three years ago it was worth about £60 per ton. But what reduction has taken place in the price of soap and candles? Practically none. Therefore, I hope our friends opposite will oppose the granting of any further protection to one of the greatest Comb'nes we have in our midst until they are prepared to give some of the benefits of it to their consumers. '- Dr .MALONEY - Will the honourable member be prepared to vote in the direction of fixing the price at which they can Bell their commodity?",60
325,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Yea .,61
326,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Melbourne Ports) [9.48] - If the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) had studied economics, he would have realized that even without Protective duties we would have millionaires and paupers. It is quite true that the price of soap is too high; but the fault lies with those who would not give this Parliament the power to prevent the local manufacturers from imposing high charges on the consumers. If we appealed to the people tomorrow to give us further legislative powers, those who are talking Free Trade to-night would oppose the grant ng of them.",61
327,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE, The honorablo memher is out of order.,61
328,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It is remarkable that, although the price of tallow has fallen from nearly £100 per ton to under £20, the price of soap has not decreased proportionately; but the trouble is that there has not been an all-round reduction in the cost of living. The men employed in making soap are still being paid high wages- I hope their wages will be even higher-and , as the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has pointed out in regard to flour, if the bakers got their flour for nothing, the consumers would still be obliged to pay 7d. per loaf for their bread. In just the same way, if the soap manufacturers got their tallow for nothing, the. people would not get their soap for nothing. The duty under review ought to appeal to honourable members in the Comer, because it affords an opportunity for protecting the primary producers of fat. Honourable members laugh, but do they claim that the fact that tallow is a marketable commodity is of no use to them ? Then, they might as well, say that the h'de of the animal they grow is of no use to them!",61
329,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,At present it is of very little use.,61
330,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Jus t at present it might not be, but a little while a<*o it was worth a considerable amount. The price the primary producer gets for his tallow from the local manufacturer must be of some use to him. The home market is always the best. Other matters bes'des the price of tallow must be taken into consideration with regard to the manufacture of soap. I hope that we will make the conditions in Australia the best we can.",61
331,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,For the manufacturer?,61
332,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The honourable member would assist us if he helped us to get the powers necessary to prevent the manufacturer from making huge profits.,61
333,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I "" will help you.",61
334,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,At the last referendum on this question the Echuca electorate voted five to one against' the proposals. I hope that the Government will adhere to the duties on soap as set out in the schedule. Honourable members on this side will not help millionaires. : If we were given the power to do so we would speedily pluck them.,61
335,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Wakefield) [9.52] - I would like the Minister (Mr. Greene) to state his reason for having increased the duty on soap, but before he does so I ask him to compare the conditions obtaining during the war with those at the present time, and to remember that the two big soap manufacturing companies in Australia, which practically determine the price of this article on the Australian market, are largely owned by British companies. British interests predominate in one, and in the other they are nearly equal to the Australian. The big drop in the price of raw material has not resulted in any reduction in the price of soap. In my opinion, the encouragement given to this industry in the previous Tariff was more than ample, and I shall require very strong evidence from the Minister to justify any increase. If the increase is agreed to we shall soon be obliged to consider the position of the Combine that determines the price of the commodity. - Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.54] - Hon orable members are complaining about the duty on toilet, fancy, or medicated soaps, because there has been no increase, so far as the British preferential rates are concerned, in the duty upon soaps n.e.i., under which heading all household soaps fall, and'the household soaps which came into Australia in previous years - ' not irt any very large quantity, because'the local manufacturers practically"" covered the whole market-cam e from, the United Kingdom. Honourable members say that we should not retain the duty because there is a Combine operating here and in Great Britain; but even if action were taken which made it cheaper for the British companies to dump their soap here iustead of purchasing our tallow and manufacturing it locally, they would do it. It would be exactly the same Combine, or exactly the same controlling force) and Australia - would not be any better off. Indeed, it would be worse off to the extent that the commodity was not being manufactured here.",61
336,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,There are other manufacturers outside the Combine.,62
337,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Exactly , and that is the point to which I am coming. There are manufacturers outside the Combine which keep it in order.",62
338,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,They are not strong enough to do it .,62
339,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I think they do. But at ali events we are giving them an opportunity to try to do it. The manufacture of toilet soaps was to all intents and purposes not established in Australia prior to the war. ""We imported them from the United States of America, the United Kingdom-no t very much from there-Germany , and France, and some from Italy. But during the war, when supplies of these costlier soaps were cut off, the local manufacturers set out to make them, and I have raised the duty in order to try to retain the industry here. It means more than the actual utilization of tallow, because other able industries are created in the making of boxes and in the packing of these fancy soaps. There are all sorts of ways in which the industry helpsothers and the country generally. The manufacture of toilet soaps is undertaken by quite a number of firms in Australia, and is-not at all confined to the two companies to which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) has referred. In fact, it is proportionately distributed to a much greater extent than is the making of household soap. Prior to the war we imported well over £100,00.0 worth of toilet soaps every year. It is a valuable industry to try to preserve, and for that reason I have left the British preferential rate as it was in - regard to household soaps, but have raised the duty slightly npon toilet preparations and fancy soaps.",62
340,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Darwin) [9.59] - I shall support any proposition to reduce the duty to ,the level of the previous Tariff. The soap-making industry has been well protected in the past and has flourished. Therefore, an increased duty seems to be unnecessary. The Minister (Mr. Greene) has not told us that he thought an increase was really necessary.",62
341,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I have already said that the toijet-soap industry was not established before the war; but it is established now, and I thought that it was worthwhile endeavouring to retain-it.",62
342,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It does appear to. me that the protection of 40 per cent., which is accorded to the industry under, the intermediate Tariff, is more than, is necessary. The measure of protection previously extended to it, namely, 30 per cent., was ample. The price of, tallow today is very, low, and the price of soap is very high. Taking everything into consideration, it appears to me that the protection which we are at present giving the industry is ample.",62
343,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Hindmarsh) [10.1] There are somewhat extensive works connected with the soap industry in Australia. Some of the firms engaged in this industry are, I believe, associated with Lever Brothers, which represents a Combine. If it were essential to establish or protect from unfair foreign competition by reason of inferior industrial condivalu- tions, thesoap-making industry within the Commonwealth, I would give, it all the protection that was necessary; but; as I declared previously, I am not a. revenue Protectionist, and, therefore, as. the industry stands at present, I cannot see the justification for an increase on household soap. Of the soaps annually used in this country,,82,000,000 lbs. are manufactured locally, whilst only 1,468,000 lbs., are imported. Moreover, the importations consist chiefly of fancy soaps.",62
344,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I have not altered the duty upon household soap.,62
345,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Then I am quite satisfied.,62
346,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Hunter) [10.3] - In reply to the remarks of the, honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , I would point out that the cost of tallow has fallen considerably during recent months. As a matter of fact, the price of almost every commodity that we have been discussing has materially declined during the same period.",62
347,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But not in the same ratio.,63
348,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Compar e the price of hides with the prices which are being charged for boots. I could cite dozens of instances of a similar character. This is a question which will have.to be faced in the near future. ""We must take the necessary action fo prevent our manufacturers exploiting the people of this country. So far as soap is concerned, it is in a similar position to that occupied by tallow. The great body of men who use tallow in mining enterprises have been compelled to pay three times its pre-war price for it. The same remark is applicable to soap.",63
349,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The price of tallow has fallen considerably.,63
350,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But it has not fallen to the extent that it should. Some time must elapse before articles of this character decline to reasonable prices. But that is no reason why we should not attempt to buttress our own industries. Soap making is not confined to a couple of companies in the Commonwealth.,63
351,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,There are about sixty or seventy firms engaged in it.,63
352,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Many of those firms conduct operations only in a small way, and some of them are located in country towns. Consequently they must be protected, and as we are about to impose an additional duty upon ordinary 3oap, I see no objection to the duty which it is proposed to levy upon fancy soaps. We shall have to do something in the near future to insure profitable employment to our own people, because nobody knows what the next two or three years will bring forth. It is possible that we shall experience a very trying time. Fancy soaps are luxuries, and if people want them they should be compelled to pay for them.",63
353,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Grampians) [10.6] - I hope that the Committee will support the proposal of the Minister (Mr. e Greene). As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), it is not proposed to increase the duty upon household soaps [350] from the United Kingdom. These are the soaps which are used by the multitude of the people in Australia. There is, however, a proposal to increase the duty which is at present levied upon fancy soaps - That increase, in the case of toilet, fancy, or medicated soaps from the L-nited Kingdom, amounts to only 5 per cent. It is a very small increase, and I shall support it upon the ground that these soaps are generally absolute luxuries. They are mainly used by the rich, and if the. ordinary household soaps are not good enough for them, they should be obliged to pay a little more for their luxuries. It is in the highest degree desirable that articles of luxury should pay duty upon a considerably higher scale than should articles of necessity. This is a clear case of granting protection to an industry without doing harm to any considerable body of persons.",63
354,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Dampier) [10.9] - In regard to household soap, I imagine that we could almost dispense with any duty whatever. The industry has been established so long, and the raw product is sold, at such a cheap rate, that we ought to be able not only to supply the requirements of OUT own people in the matter of ordinary soaps, but to become large exporters of them.",63
355,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I hope that we shall be, before long.",63
356,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"So far as toilet soaps are concerned, I have here statistics relating to the operations of the huge English Combine which has been created. - a Combine which has its tentacles here in Australia. There are certain local firms which are part of that huge combination, and we ought not to give our support to such a monopoly. I desire to help forward trade with the Empire, and particularly with Great Britain",63
357,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,To which soap monopoly does the honourable member refer?,63
358,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"To Lever Brothers. The Minister (Mr Greene) has already pointed out that a large quantity of these soaps come from Germany and Italy. I am not prepared to grant any concession to these countries. But I think that we ought to endeavour to build up trade with the United Kingdom. I cannot follow the arguments of the honourable member fox Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), becaus*. it has not been sbown that in these industries any great care has been taken of the workers. Complaints have been made of the high cost of living, and in almost every country of the world the wages paid have been better than those paid in Australia. The people who have been making fortunes here have not been too careful of the interests of the workers.",63
359,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,But prices are based upon the capacity of the people to pay.,64
360,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"We have been going absolutely mad in this Chamber during the past few days. I am satisfied that a day of reckoning will come. I move That sub-item A be amended by adding after the words "" 35 per eent."" the words ""And on and after 20th May, 1921, per lb., 5d., or ad val., 30 per cent. (British).""",64
361,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Melbourne) [10.14]. - On e must admire the pertinacity of a good Free Trader like the honourable member for Dampier, who, nevertheless, is not a Free Trader in the scientific sense of the word. He has advanced the same old argument about the existence of a Combine. But if this Parliament chooses to do so, it can legislate to control that Combine. The Soap Combine in England is one of the greatest in the world. But surely the honourable member will agree that no more important pronouncement has been made by a manufacturer than that which was recently made by Lord Leverhulme, who is the head of Lever Brothers. He has gone so far as to advocate a six-hour day, and'for that I thank him. He was one of the first men in England to reduce the working day to eight hours.",64
362,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,And well he might.,64
363,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I quite agree; but when one is not expecting it from such a source, there is all the more credit in that it should have emanated therefrom. He also reduced women's working hours to seven per day. He built healthy cottages at Port Sunlight, where the death-rate was not one-half what it was, only 2 miles distant, in one of the suburbs of Liverpool.",64
364,Mr HILL,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,And the poor people all over the United Kingdom paid for it.,64
365,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Possibly . the less, his was a splendid example, which was not followed all over Britainbecause the House of Commons did not do its duty, just as this House does not do its duty. If Lord Leverhulme were to introduce a six-hour day in Australia,, his example would be followed much more widely and swiftly by Australian manufacturers than by those in the United Kingdom. I would prefer not to see 1 lb. of soap come into Australia. Are we not capable of making all our own requirements? If there should be a. combine charging unjustly, there is a limitation of prices upon which this House can insist - I hope the honourable member for Dampier- (Mr Gregory) will not continue to advance the old ' argument, "" It will build up a big combine here."" I agree with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Port Melbourne (Mr. Mathews). I , too, if it were possible, would prevent anything coming into Australia that can be manufactured heremaking this reservation only: that Parliament should control and insist upon the observance of fixed prices. And, further, when the law is broken in that respect, the punishment should be gaol. Fines are no good in the cases of rich combines.",64
366,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Werriwa) [10.20]. - I am in sympathy with the desire to impose high duties in respect of all goods which are imported, but which could be adequately manufactured in Australia. My one objection to the imposition of duties is where. they apply to articles which are not made locally in sufficient 5 quantity to fulfil our requirements. This reservation cannot apply, however, to the manufacture of soap. It is fallacious to say that the imposition of high duties is bound to build up monopolies; but even if that were the outcome, they would be monopolies which we could deal - with. Does the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) think there is not a monopoly among the importing agencies? They are the most easily constituted, the most dangerous, and the greediest of all monopolies. I have been pleased to listen to the arguments advanced to-night from the corner in denunciation of monopolists. I look for the support of honourable memNever- bers of the Country party whenever motions may be launched from this side t to deal with monopolies and profiteers. I trust the proposed imposts will stand. I would support an even higher duty on soap. Mr JAOKSOlf (Bass) [10.28] - I desire, very briefly, to call attention to one interesting phase of the soap-manufacturing industry in Australia. It is now beginning to build up an export trade. Over-sea markets are being secured. Last year we exported, in fancy soaps, 500,225 lbs., of a value of £47,206; and in household soaps, 8,007,856 lbs, valued at £174,724.",64
367,Mr EILEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"South Sydney) [10.24]. - Some honourable members think that, so long aa there can be provided common soap for the common people;, there is no need to worry about anything, OT any one, else.* But there are such things as fine toilet soaps. Wby should not the common people, who are the backbone of this country, use good soap? Honourable members now want to put up the price of fancy toilet soaps in order to keep the common people from using them. I will not oppose the proposed duty, but I warn honourable members that the result will be that Lever Bros., and one or - two other firms which control the industry in tha Commonwealth, will merely employ tile opportunity to still further increase the price of toilet soaps. The English firm is making toilet Boaps in Australia today, and the imposition of this duty will not cause it to make any more here than at present. When we import toilet soaps from England we get them from a branch of Lever Bros. If we impose a high duty, that firm will import just a little of its English manufacture, and will then supply the local market with its locallymade article, upon whioh the price will have been put up. The poor people will suffer a little more, and the wealthy manufacturers will make a little more. Amendment negatived, - Item agreed, to. Item 95 (Sparklets), item 96 (Spices), item'97 (Starch), item 98 (Staroh flours, including custard powders), and item 99 (Straw) agreed to. Item 100 (Tea). Mr GKEqOBY (Dampier) [10.28] I do not propose now to enter into serious discussion of. this item further than to suggest that the Oommittee might agree to allow tea from within the Empire to come in free, and to impose a duty upon tea produced in foreign countries. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.86 p.m, [350]- 2",65
