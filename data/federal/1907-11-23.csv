4,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question relating to - a clause in the mail contract with the - Orient Steam Navigation Company, which - I had intended to refer to last night, which, owing to the lateness of the hour, - I refrained from dealing with. The clause specifies that certain steps shall be taken by the contracting companv with reference to establishing communication with a wireless telegraphy station oh Rottnest Island. I wish to know whether the establishment of a wireless telegraphy station on that island is lik'elv to at an early dale. There certainly is a great necessity for its establishment.",14
5,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The matter of establishing a wireless telegraphy station on - Rottnest Island is receiving the attention of the Post and Telegraph Department, and I. hope that long before the commencement .of the contract it will be established. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the the Postmaster-General yet made any arrangeto ment to connect King Island, a very imcost portant part of the Darwin electorate, with the mainland, by means of wireless telegraphy ?",14
6,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No such arrangement has yet been made, but I have no doubt, that so important a place will receive every consideration. RAB-BIT DESTRUCTION.",14
7,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I see by this morning's Argus that the report of Dr Tidswell, with reference to rabbit destruction, has' been furnished to the press. So far as I am aware, no information on the subject has yet been given to the House. I desire to know whether the Treasurer proposes to furnish the House with the refit port, and also why it should be supplied to the press before its supply to honourable members.",14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not yet received, nor has the Prime Minister, received, the report of Dr Tidswell. Yesafternoon I received from Mr. Ashton a letter advising me that he had furnished with a copy of the report by Dr Tidswell, who had informed him he bad posted one to me, which I . would receive yesterday afternoon, and 1 me not to give it to the press here until the time when he intended to give his own-copy to the press in Sydriev. I did not receive the report by yesterdav's mail, nor have I received it by this morning's .mail. Knowing that it would be handed to. the press in Sydney, I informed one or two persons connected with the press here yesterday that it would be available in Sydney, and that they had better get it but telegraphed to Melbourne. With the concurrence of the Prime Minister, I shall 'lay the report upon the ""table of the House - as soon as it is received, and ""the Cabinet will-consider' what'action shall be taken. PAPER.

11,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I find that in - the Age report of the division on the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier for the nationalization of the ocean mail service, a number of honourable members are reported as having voted on the side of the "" ayes "" who ought to have been reported as having voted on the side .of the ""noes."" "" I find also that the names of certain, members have been entered in ,the pair-book in the same way. The division is reported in the Age as twenty-four ""ayes"" and seventeen ""noes."" seventeen "" noes"" comprise members of the Labour Party. Those honourable members who paired against the amendment are re-, ported in the newspaper as "".noes.""",15
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The pair-book is wrong ?,15
13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Yes . The impression is given to the public that Mr. Wise"", Mr Archer, Mr Bowden, Mr J. T. Brown, ' Mr Fairbairn, Sir John Forrest, Mr Deakin, Mr Bruce Smith, Mr Harper, Mr W. H . Irvine, and Mr Knox paired in favour of the ""nationalization "" amendment, ' With regard to the laughter which 'my remarks' evoke, I think it will be sufficiently suggestive to the public of the error that the idea of those honorablegentlemen pairing for such an amendment has provoked so much humour on the part of members of the House. The pair-book justifies the report in the newspaper, because the names I have read are entered under "" For,"" and the absent members of the Labour Party are reported as - having paired against their colleague's amendment.",15
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I may mention that the House does not recognise pairs in any way, and that the pair-book is kept merely for the convenience of honor-.able members who desire to be absent. : ADDITIONAL SITTING DAY. .'

How- ever, it seems to me that in the closing hours of this period of the session we are to be treated to what I described the other night as a "" legislative orgy."" It is to be deprecated, in the interests of the commercial classes, that we should be driven intothese straits in the consideration of the Tariff. On the other hand, there is the difficulty that, if we do not make some progress now, the commercial classes-indeed , all sections of the community-wil l suffer still more by reason of the delay. We are The in one of those difficult positions in which one does hot quite know the best way to proceed. I believe that we shall be consulting the best interests of the country if we err in favour of a full and favourable consideration of the interests of those outside, who are so profoundly affected by the Tariff. With that condition I shall support the proposal. I hope that it will not be necessary for the Government to resort - to all night, sittings if we are going to sit six days a week and all the hours of the clock except the night hours. It should be made a rule not to entrench on those hours which we ought to devoteto sleep. We shall have little enough time if we are to get any sleep at all to devote ourselves to business ; and the Tariff is, after all, the most important business which can engage this Parliament at the present time. Every man, woman, and child in the country is directly affected by it. I trust that we shall devote ourselves uninterruptedly to it - I say that advisedly - without ' the interpolation of other measures in the manner attempted during last week by the Government. Last night we were actually asked by the Attor-; ney-General to consider the Quarantine Bill. Surely that is a matter which can wait until we meet again, when we can deal with it with minds free and untrammelled by the weight of other important business, such as we are engaged upon now. The country will lose nothing, and no interest will suffer if the Quarantine. Bill is delayed House a little. Indeed, I think that the country will gain 'from the more careful and deliberate consideration of such a measure rather than by rushing it through during the closing hours of sittings when honorJ ; able members are'""tired ""and cannot possibly give to it the attention that"" it"" deserves. That is the way not to do the country's business. One reason why this Parliament is becoming so unpopular in the States as a whole is by reason of the crude and ill - today. digested legislation which has been put - through during the closing hours of sittings when honourable members have been too tired to give to the business the consideration to which it is - entitled. I hope, therefore, that no polations of the kind will be attempted. We should address ourselves steadily to the specific task before us, and pursue it uninterruptedly, in the hope that we may Teach a conclusion with every interest fully conserved and properly considered. . I should like to ask the Prime Minister what be proposes to do regarding Saturday sittings? That is a point upon which he was very vague.",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I thought that the fairest their arrangements. thing was to allow the House, next day, tofixits own time. Mr. JOSEPH ""COOK - If the Prime Minister leaves it until next Friday, orable members from other States will have made their arrangements. The trouble seems to be that no one is thought these matters but honourable members from the Prime Minister's own State. That not fair to others. I submit vernment ought to forecast the business for the week, so that honourable members may know when the House is going to sit. two hours. In that case, those who have homes in other States will be able to make their aralso? rangements. Their convenience ought to be met. I should like to suggest, also, if we are to sit on Saturday, we might try to get more than two hours' It is hardly worthwhile for the House to meet for two hours.",16
16,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We should not have the Mr.. been meeting to-dav. except for the honorHouse sit on Sunday able member for Hunter.,16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That was quite a misunderstanding.,16
18,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,We should have sat today under any circumstances ,16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Treasurer gave us his assurance that he intended ask the House to sit on Saturday, as well as on Monday. If he made a different statement to other honourable members, was not aware of it.' Mr.THOMAS - He said that we need not will sit today because we sat late last night.",16
20,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The Treasurer stated while the discussion was going on that he did not intend to ask the House to meet,16
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Treasurer told me distinctly that he proposed that we should sit today as well as on Monday. It is just as well that the' honourable gentleman should clear the matter up. In inter- the meantime I ask the Government to state what they propose to do in the matter of Saturday sittings.,16
22,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"(Wide Bay) [11.15] I agree that the principal business to be dealt with by the House before the Christmas holidays should be the Tariff, and that the Government should, as far as possible, arrange to devote the whole of our time to it. They should also endeavor to look ahead so that honourable members from other States may be able to make I suggest that the FriPrime Minister should make his motion include Saturday sittings. If that is done it will be quite easy on any day during hon the week to move that the House at its rising on Friday adjourn until Monday, if it is not desired to sit on Saturday. That of in is the best course to take.",16
23,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honoris able member wants the House to sit on that the GoSaturdavs, I suppose?",16
24,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Oh yes.,16
25,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But not for,16
26,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Why not sit on Sundays,",16
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,For the obvious reason that that we have other duties to' perform. Some of us would prefer to be' with our work done. families on Sundays.,16
28,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The better the day, the better the deed ! FISHER - I have no objection to honourable member moving that the if he chooses, but I do not recommend such a proposition to the Government. I do hope that the Tariff will be the principal work, and that we shall complete it before we rise for the Christmas holidays. But I also desire to observe that the Government should see to.it that the wages prescribed by Mr Justo tice Higgins shall be paid"" to the workmen who are entitled to them. If that be done, I desire to say, on behalf of myself and I the party to which I belong that, those conditions fulfilled, very reasonable terms be agreed to regarding other matters. The intention of Parliament clearly was to insure the payment of fair and reasonable wages to the workmen, and not to collect revenue in the form Qf an Excise duty. I think there will be time enough to have that matter attended to before we adjourn. I shall do my utmost in assisting the Government to get the Tariff through before the Christmas holidays.",16
29,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The honourable member believes in sitting all the year round, holidays included.",17
30,Mr FISHER,Unknown,All that I have to say in reply to that remark is that it is one of those interjections that are not only irrelevant but utterly incorrect.,17
31,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member should not take such a remark too literally. ,",17
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The two matters to which I wish to have attention given are, first, that we should get the Tariff through before the holidays, and, secondly, that justice should be done to those people who are interested in the Excise legislation in securing them that which Parliament intended that they should have, and lo which a High Court Justice has decided that they are entitled.",17
33,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [11.19] The extraordinary part of the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta was, that being as he has told us, intensely opposed to this motion, he should yet be able to give his vote for it. He has put forward the plea that the commercial community are waiting for the settlement of the Tariff, If the Tariff could be definitely fixed before Christmas would be a great deal to be said for what the honourable member has urged. But he knows, as we all know, that if we pass the duties remaining for consideration it will not mean finality with regard to the Tariff, and that the unrest which is affecting the commercial community will continue just the same. There can be no doubt about that. Therefore, there is no excuse whatever for rushing the Tariff through.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope honourable member does not think that I desire the Tariff to be rushed through the House. I say emphatically that I will not assist in rushing it through.,17
35,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But the honourable member is supporting this motion, the object of which undoubtedly is to facilitate the rushing of the Tariff through this House.",17
36,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Not at all.,17
37,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Then what is its object ? Finality will not be reached even if this House does dispose of the Tariff before Christmas.,17
38,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The passing of the motion will not induce me to forego any protest that I think I ought to make. . Mr Mahon - Quite so; but surely the honourable member must recognise the condition into which the House is drifting. When honourable members are utterly worn out physically, it is impossible for them to attend here regularly to support, his eloquent protests, so that the duties proposed by the. Government are agreed to. The honourable member for Parramatta has rightly siaid that the Tariff profoundly,, affects every man, woman, and child in the community; hence 'it should be considered when members are in full possession of their faculties. Our work cannot be properly done otherwise, and the public will suffer from our slipshod decisions. I fail to recognise the necessity for this motion, and think that it is little short of an affront to the House to submit it without any explanation. I should willingly make any reasonable sacrifice in order that the Tariff might be finally disposed of before Christmas; but we all know that although the powers of the Senate are not exactly co-ordinate with our own, it can make requests and hold up the Tariff until we either approve or disapprove of those requests. That being so, is it reasonable to suggest that it is necessary for this House to dispose of the Tariff before Christmas? I see no urgency in the matter, and am prepared to endorse the there views of the honourable member for Parramatta not only as to the manner in which the Tariff has been submitted, but as to the general conduct of business during the last three or four months. If the Government had desired an honest discussion of the Tariff, instead of introducing it and endeavouring to rush it through the House in the closing weeks of the session, they should have made it the first business ",17
39,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"And it should be dealt that the with in sections in different sessions in order that it might be carefully considered. Mr Mahon : - My experience of the .consideration of two Tariffs in this House has satisfied me that Parliament is, perhaps, the worse tribunal that could be selected for the adjustment of duties; the work is one that requires expert knowledge and the utmost deliberation on the part of those to whom it is intrusted. We have, however, to make the best of the position, ancl that I contend we are not doing. fully endorse"" the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta regarding the practice of rushing legislation through Parliament at the end of a session. During the consideration of the Tariff schedule 1 had occasion to move for a reduction in the monstrous sugar duties, and was then reminded of a provision in an Act of Parliament passed some time ago in which wefixed the Excise and bounty. As a matter of fact, that measure was rushed through this House, just as the Government are now rushing the Tariff through it, and without anything like adequate or fair consideration. A bargain was then made which I was reminded the other day must bind the whole Commonwealth for many years. That in itself constitutes a valid and forcible reason for OUT refusing 'to hurriedly fix duties the effect of which may be to divert the whole course of trade and business. If the Government had had any real desire that the Tariff should be properly considered, instead of wasting the early part of the session they would have submitted it to the House as soon as we met. There was nothing to prevent them doing so. They had before them the progress reports of the Tariff Commission, and should have been able without difficulty, to decide what recommendations they were prepared to support, and what variations of the recommendations of the Commission they desired. I have spoken but rarelv during the consideration of the Tariff, believing that an honourable member should confine his attention to those items of which he has expert knowledge. On several occasions, when I intended to speak, I have been forestalled by gentle-, men who are continually on their feet, and who in some way have secured a monopoly on the debate. I am not going to continue that line of action, and 1 do not think that the passing of this motion will facilitate business. I protest against this House meeting on Saturdays, as well as on Mondays. If honourable members would come to a reasonable frame of mind, and speak only on the questions of which they have expert knowledge, the volume of talk would be considerably reduced, and the ordinary days of sitting would be ample to enable us to pass the Tariff within a reasonable period. It is true that the Government, when rearranging the business of the House, have got into the habit of consulting the convenience of certain honourable members. But they make a mistake if they think that everybody else is going to acquiesce 1 in these secret bargains in which their convenience is not considered. In such circumstances, the Government cannot complain if they are subjected to a little criticism. The arrangement to rush the Tariff through the House before Christmas, and then to have a fairly long adjournment does not particularly suit the convenience of members from other States. I am uot one of those who will be specially convenienced.",17
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Government consult the leaders of the various parties.,18
41,Mr MAHON,Unknown,And the leaders should consult their followers before making a bargain.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to know what leaders have been consulted.,18
43,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"When I asked the honourable member for Wide Bay yesterday whether there was to be a Saturday's sitting,. I received the answer "" No "" ; yet I find myself here today when I should preferably be somewhere else. It is the duty of the Government to consult honourable members generally.",18
44,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We are here today.as the result of the action of one honourable member.,18
45,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That view has been disputed by the honourable member concerned,18
46,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,B y whom?,18
47,Mr MAHON,Unknown,B y the honourable member for Hun ten.,18
48,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why he has stated that he would take the same course again.,18
49,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I am not responsible for that. I want to know where is the necessity for this House sitting on Saturdays ?,18
50,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. I - wish to know whether it is fair that an honourable member's name should be used in discussion Avhen he cannot hear the remarks which are being made concerning him ?,18
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I would point out that the dialogue which has been proceeding is altogether irregular.,18
52,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have endeavoured to make my remarks relevant to the question before the Chair. I understand that the House did not adjourn till 1 o'clock this morning. I do not believe that the public expect a man to ruin his health by sitting in this badly ventilated chamber till such an unreasonable hour. Xo adequate reason has been assigned why we should be required to do so. I would point out to the Government that honourable members like myself have a large correspondence with our electors to transact, and a great deal of departmental work to perform. I represent a considerable area-a n area which is rapidly-developing-and I have a voluminous correspondence with various Departments to attend to, and especially with the Postal Department. That work must be neglected if I am required to attend here every day in the week and practically all the hours of the clock.",18
53,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,The honourable member is not suffering in health yet. He looks splendid.,19
54,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his compliment, but I would remind him that people sometimes belie their looks. Although honourable members may not feel the effects of this legislative debauch immediately, I am satisfied that they will feel it eventually, and that they will regret having given their assent to the proposal now under consideration. I would remind honourable members that the first. all night sitting in connection with the Tariff resulted from - the Government's anxiety to get the hat duties passed. Now, a certain member of the Ministry was aware that I had in my possession a document which, would have changed the views of a great many honourable members regarding those duties.",19
55,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Where was the honourable member on that occasion ?,19
56,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I happened to be unwell, and consequently went home, having been assured by the Government Whip that the hat duties would not come on for consideration that evening.",19
57,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"I do not think that, statement is correct.",19
58,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is quite correct. T took a note of it at the time. Further, the honourable member made an arrangement to provide me with a pair upon every division taken in connection with those duties. I was to be paired in favour of the lowest duty on each occasion.' But, notwithstanding that definite arrangement with him, find that my name appears in the paira daily Hansard. book only in connection with one division, [ f it. would be in order for me to do I should read the document to which I have alluded to the House. I repeat that one member of .the Government was ""aware that I had evidence which I intended place before the Committee, and which stances. would have considerably influenced the votes of a large number of honourable bers occupying seats in this corner of the chamber in respect of the hat duties. It is impossible to absolve the Government from condemnation for having compelled the House to sit all night for the purpose of passing those duties.",19

60,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member knew as much as I do, he would think that the circumstances were very suspicious.",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,At the end of that debate I stated that I would endeavour to obtain a recommittal of those duties. I hope that the honourable member will support me in that.,19
62,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member moves for a recommittal, I shall be found supporting him. I hope, too, that he will move for a recommittal - of other duties which were put through under very suspicious circumstances.",19

Although I have been absent from the House, I may inform him that I have kept a very close watch upon its proceedings. I have read the newspaper accounts of them, and also the Hansard reports, so that I do not think I have missed very much.",19

I believe there are several honourable members who hold a similar The members the Government are well aware fodder that I have so far treated them with absolute fairness. I have not been obstructive in any way, although they have done many things I heartily disapprove of. 1I have sympathized with them in many of retheir difficulties. I think now, however, that they are proposing to put the last straw on the animal's back, and it is about time. It was resented. The excuse is the necessity of removing the uncertainty which That uncertainty will continue to exist in a greater on or lesser degree until both Houses have passed the Tariff. Such an excuse is' inadequate to justify the undue haste now being made; which, if persevered in, will result in the imposition of duties in their incidence and injurious alike to the producers and consumers of Australia. I do not often suppoitthe Government, but wish to say that during the whole of this disweek. I have distinctly understood that the . House would sit on Saturday morning, and on Monday next. I should have been very much disappointed if that course were not adopted. The Treasurer is blunt, and tells < honourable members straight what he means. That is one good trait in the honourable gentleman's character. As a doctor, the honourable member for Hunter may be perfectly justified in urging a reduction in the hours of sittings in the interest of the health of honourable members, but, taking a general view of the House this morning, I have not in my long experience seen a better or a fresher-looking lot of men. Judging by their appearance, honourable members might sit for ever. I do not blame the Government for trying to get on with the Tariff. It is idle to say that if we pass the Tariff in this House it will not lead to finality. There may be a few alterations suggested in another place, but honourable senators will be found willing to study the wishes of this House. I hope that whatever the Government do they will push on with the Tariff, and I urge the Prime Minister not to allow honourable members to go away from Melbourne until they have dealt with it. If that were done, we could look forward to a fairly long Christmas : recess.",20
89,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Bourke) [11.50]. - The honourable member for Coolgardie seems to be unden the impression that I have treated him unfairly. He says first that I informed him that the hat duties would not come on on a certain night. I do not remember making that statement, but it is probable that I said that in my opinion .they would not or might not come on. One cannot tell exactly what is going to happen with regard to any particular item, because sometimes a great many items are passed, and at other times only a few. I can only give my opinion. I will further dispute as to that matter. With respect to the pairing business, it is true that the honourable member told me that he desired to have a pair always for the lowest duty, and, as far as possible, I ' have endeavoured to arrange it for him. But a most serious difficulty arose as to giving pairs to any honourable member on the particular occasion! to which the honourable member refers. The honourable member for Lang, who is the Opposition whip, will bear me out that' we had extreme difficulty in making matters fit for all sides of the House. The Government decided to propose a fixed instead ot an ad valorem duty on hats.",21
90,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,How long before the vote?,21
91,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The Government, are responsible for that part of the business. I will simply explain my part. When the question was put, the honourable member for Parramatta began a series of amendmentswhich culminated in an amendment for a 75 per cent, ad valorem duty on hats. Knowing that the honourable member for Coolgardie desired to vote for the lowest duty, and that he was returned as a free-trader, I could not conceive that I would be doing him justice by recording him as in favour of a 75 per cent. duty.",21
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As against 150 per cent. ?,21
93,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,That is not the point.,21
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must confine himself to a personal explanation on the matter with which he is now dealing. Otherwise he would open up a discussion upon the whole question of the Tariff,",21
95,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am simplv making a personal explanation. It seemed to be doing-an injustice to the honourable member, to have it telegraphed to Coolgardie that he had voted for a duty of 75 oer cent, on hats. - Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - The honourable member must not debate the question.",21
96,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,I am giving the reasons why I took a certain course.,21
97,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I understand : that the honourable member for Coolgardie complained that' he was not paired on a number of other occasions.,21
98,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member does not complain about other ocnot casions. His pairs were recorded. I consulted with the honourable member for Yarra generally over the question of pairs on the hat duties', and he also agreed that it was difficult to know what to do. In the circumstances I submit that, in fairness to the honourable member for Coolgardie, I did what I thought was best in his interests, and just to the party to which he belonged. With regard to the matter to which the honourable member for Parkes has referred, there has been no mistake in the way in which the pairs are recorded in the pair book. The proposition of the honourable member for Barrier - was to omit certain words from the motion of the Postmaster General. The pairs are recorded in the pair book on that question exactly as they have been recorded on every similar occasion. Those who desired to omit the words would vote with the noes, because the question put was "" That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.""",21
99,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The amendment is not set out in the pair-book. It simply says "" Mr Thomas' amendment.""",22
100,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am not responsible for the way in which the press records the pairs. The honourable member for Parkes and others, who desired to vote against the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, voted ""Aye"" for the retention of the words in the motion. Consequently no mistake has been made. The honourable member for Lang, who with me helped to enter the pairs, can bear out my statement. Mr KNOX. (Kooyong) [11.55] - As a city member, I desire at all times to fall in with the wishes of those who are not able conveniently to reach their own homes. I am sorry that the honourable member for Coolgardie has taken up an obstructive position, but T trust that on consideration he will recognise that the public interests must be above any personal consideration in a question of this great importance. Speaking with some authority, I may tell the honourable member that he is quite in error in supposing that no great inconvenience exists in Melbourne, or elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth, through the Tariff not being settled. He would find the .bonds all over Australia at present crowded with goods which are awaiting the fixing of the duties before they are taken out. I know in two cases of large mining enterprises whose machinery hasobeen stored in Sydney waiting for the settlement of the machinery duties. It is the most pressing and important duty of the House to get the Tariff completed without delay. Regarding the days of meeting, if honourable members decide to miss the Friday expresses to Adelaide and Sydney, surely they might as well sit as close up to the departure of the expresses on Saturdays as is convenient. If they miss the trains on Saturday, then by all means Monday should be available as a sitting day. understand that these extra sittings are only for the purpose of endeavouring to get the Tariff through before the House rises over Christmas. I shall support the Government on this occasion, but I earnestly urge that there should not be a repetition of what took place with regard to the hat duties. If we have to attend here morning after morning at 11 o'clock, there should be some limitation as to the time to which we are expected to remain, because we have not only to give our artendance, but also all the ability, knowledge, and information that we possess to the consideration of the important question of the Tariff. While 1 support the Governm;nt on this motion, I recognise that much of the feeling which exists is due to their own want of business foresight. With them must rest the responsibility for the present confusion, because they might easily have enabled a much speedier consideration of the Tariff to take place. I am anxious that we should make as much progress as possible before Christmas.",22
101,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [12.0] - I shall oppose this motion, even at the risk of being misunderstood by my fellow members and the country generally. It might be suspected that my opposition is on personal grounds, and that I objected to attend the sittings of Parliament every day of the week. But I have no personal feeling whatever in the matter; I am prepared to sit day after day, as often as may be necessary for the proper expedition of business. My opposition to the motion is based entirely on other grounds. I quite agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Coolgardie, and I am glad to think that he supports the position which'I take. My object is to direct attention to the action, in the past, of the present Government. I am perfectly satisfied that the end which the Government have in view, in wishing us to sit day after day, is to rush the Tariff through when members are in a state of mental exhaustion. It has been suggested that my action in this connection is based on health grounds; but that is not so. I would point out, however, that it is impossible for us to carry on the business of the country satisfactorily if we are overworked. There is a marked difference between men who work regular hours and those who work irregular hours, such as we do; and I have felt the evil effects. I may not talk so often, or at such length, as do other honourable members, but I endeavour to be here when I ever a division is taken: and I think that my attendances will compare favourably with those of honourable members generally. When I entered the chamber the other night, after having been absent for the greater part of the day, I noticed the exhausted mental condition of honourable members. I noticed that Mr Speaker, in mistake, named three tellers on one side; and I am satisfied that that would not have occurred if his brain agement had not been nearly exhausted. Furthering more, if we have continuous sittings this period of the year, when the ture is so high, and in a chamber ventilated as this is, it is absolutely impossible for honourable members to do themselves justice. A ll the non-contentious items the Tariff have been passed, but the portant items have been postponed until, I suppose, members are exhausted, ancl anxious to get to their homes. such circumstances honourable members sire to pair, and are not here to oppose with their voices the proposals of the Goprepared vernment.",22
102,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The honourable member knows very well why the items have been postponed.,23
103,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I am explaining that, in my opinion, the Treasurer, expert unister derground engineer as he is, has brought about the postponement of the items with the object of rushing them through at the end of the session. I see no reason there should be great anxiety to dispose in such a hurried manner of the Tariff. and No doubt the commercial world, and the both the community generally, are anxious to have this matter settled; but I fail to see how there can be any satisthe factory result if we are called upon to work long hours on six days of the week. Why should there not be a reasonThe able adjournment at Christmas, so that we may come back fresh to the work of setdays, tling the Tariff? I consider that Treasurer, and the Government generally, and to a certain extent the Labour Party, are responsible for the present position' affairs. From time to time the Governtuency ment have thrown the Tariff aside, and troduced other measures, such as the Contract, or the Bill to grant a bonus the iron industry. No doubt it was necesextra sary that the Mail Contract should be fied ; and I am sure that, in this connection, the Opposition have been most reasonable. But we find the new leader of the Labour Party, who,- apparently, is prepared to take more drastic steps than was his predecessor, supporting a proposal for nationquarter, alization.",23
104,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Surely the Mail Contract is an important matter?,23
105,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"That may be, but this - is not the time for the discussion of nationalization, proposals. Then the members of the Labour Party took advantage of the introduction of the Manufactures EncourBill to cause further delay in deal with the Tariff. I hope I shall find at many honourable members to support me in temperamy opposition, to this motion.",23
106,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [1.2.8] - If the Prime Minister proposes an amendment to the motion he has placed before us that of will, so far as I understand, preclude us imfrom subsequently debating the question; and as such a position would be absolutely unfair, I wish to say a few words now. Under Before we decide to sit every day in the deweek we ought to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal. Personally, I am to<sit, if necessary, even all night in: order to expedite business. No time has been wasted,"" and, as a vast amount of work has been accomplished, there is, in my opinion, no necessity to sit on Saturdays as well as on Mondays. Let the Prime Minadhere to his determination to call the House together on Mondays; but I think it ought to be left to us to decide whether it is absolutely necessary to sit on Satur-. why days. The honourable member for Hunter has charged the Labour Party with taking up time over the Mail Contract proposals Manufactures Encouragement Bill, of which measures he describes as side issues. In, my opinion, however, both are most important, in view of the fact that Mail Contract, for instance, binds the country, during the next ten or twelve years, to a large expenditure of money. honourable member for Wide Bay, when he expresses a desire to sit on Saturspeaks for himself alone, and not the for any other member of the Labour Party. Every honourable member who does his duty has a good deal of departmental and perof sonal work in connection with his consti;- and such work cannot be done proinperly if we are comnelled to sit every day Mail of the week. The honourable member for to Kooyong has expressed"" his approval of sittings; but I ' notice that, when the ratiHouse sits until a late hour, the honourable member generally goes home to his comfortable bed and allows others to keep - a quorum. The Government are' yielding . to clamour from other parts of the cham. ber to sit on Saturday, but that is not the to which they will look for making a quorum, if they cet into"" a"" corner. If - they will not extend'to us some consideration with -'regard to Saturday, I do not intend to consider them when they get into - difficulties. T have come to their rescue on several occasions, of which they are well nware. I want not only to give a vote on the various items in the Tariff, but also to be present in the chamber, and to intelligently follow the discussion oni each item. 1 want to be able to justify to my constituents every vote that I give. I do not want to be compelled to attend to the affairs of my constituency or departmental work in some part of the building, and to trot down to the chamber, like a blindfolded man, to vote on one side or the other. On the contrary, T. desire to be able to sit in the chamber and to intelligently follow the discussion on every item. If , however, the Government are determined to sit on Saturday, as well as on every other day, it will preclude honourable members from sitting here, and giving their undivided attention to the arguments, and also from performing their duty to their constituents.",23
107,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It will be for only two Saturdays.,24
108,Mr CATTS,Unknown,"If it is determined by the House to sit on Saturdays, "" unless otherwise ordered,"" I do not know how long that arrangement may last. We are expected to transact the business of the country with reasonable despatch, but that does not mean that we are to do an unreasonable thing-to rush and bullock the Tariff through without its receiving decent consideration. I suggest to the Government that, while they are prepared to consider the suggestions of honourable members who are opposed to them tooth ancl nail, and will do everything they can to discredit them and defeat their proposals, they ought also to be prepared to treat those who try to be fair to them in a sympathetic fashion.",24
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.13] - In view of certain remarks by the honourable member for Hunter, I think it will be wise for me to say a few words in reply. He must know that the consideration, of certain items, in the machinery section of the Tariff was deferred with the concurrence of the deputy leader'of the Opposition. The items were submitted to the honourable gentleman before their consideration was deferred, so that we could deal at once with those items which were not contentious. contentious items have been deferred. I do not think that the honourable member for Hunter intended to misrepresent, but I feel that he has misreoresented'mv attitude in regard - to deferring items in, division V I . of the Tariff. The reason why the Government wish honourable members to sit almost continuously until near Christmas is to get the Tariff put through this House, if possible, in order that the Senate-whic h will reassemble perhaps a month or six weeks before this House does, if honourable members do as we desire-ma y be able to deal with a large number of the items before we re-assemble. Our proposal is also made with a view to giving to honourable members a little rest. The Prime Minister has already stated that if we can get the Tariff put through this House by the second week in December, we shall probably adjourn until the end of February or the beginning of March.",24
110,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That has been said very plainly.,24
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes . I am prepared to sit day after day, except on Christmas Day ancl Sundays, but my feeling is that honourable members do not want to sit continuously, and it is only with a view to meet the general desire that the Government have submitted this proposal. I have had an analysis made of the remaining items in the Tariff, and the deputy leader of the Opposition has seen how it has been made. There are about 118 items which are not very contentious. Some items are not contentious at.all.",24
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not agree with the honourable gentleman about that.,24
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That may be, but, according to a memorandum I have received from the Deputy Comptroller General, there are still 215 items to be dealt with; of which 62 items are free; 24 items, free with preference; and 129 items, dutiable. He considers that there are 118 items which are practically non-contentious, and 97 items which are debatable.",24
114,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"Can 'the honourable gentleman give us an analysis of the items which have been dealt with, for the purpose of making a comparison ?",24
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I think .that more than one-half of the items in the Tariff have been dealt with.,24
116,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,In three months? Only Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - We bave spent only two months in dealing with the items.,24
117,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Thos e figures are not quite correct. In addition to the 129 dutiable items, we have to deal with a number of postponed' items, and consider the items in divisions VI.A and VI.B ",24
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , not the items in division V [ . B Mr DUGALD 'THOMSON - The honorp.m. ? able gentleman is not going to proceed with that division?",25
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The House has affirmed the principle of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill and division 10.30 a.m. VI.B in, the Tariff was only intended to be considered in case the grant of the iron bounty was not approved. At the present moment I do not see that we should deal with that division at all.",25
120,Mr DUCALD THOMSON,Unknown,But we have the postponed items to deal with.,25
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have gone 2.30 p.m. through the Tariff, and it seems to me that the memorandum I have read represents position. Suppose that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not passed by the Senate, we shall have to deal with division VI.c afterwards.",25
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,25
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I only want say a few words more, sir. I think that there has been very little waste of time. the early days of the discussion of the Tariff items, many items of business cropand ped up. When we started in earnest to deal with the Tariff in detail, I gave assurance that,, so far as I was concerned, would prevent its consideration from being interfered with, and, until this week, I I may say that, practically, its consideration has not been interfered with. Of course, when the Senate decided to adjourn over a certain period, we had to submit some urgent business, and that is what has caused the loss of this week as regards the Tariff. However, if we sit day after day until 13th, 14th, or 15th December, we shall have a good many days in which to deal with the Tariff. I ,im sure that a large majority of honourable members desire to get it through if possible by Christmas. I do not delivered think that there will be any slumming. Reasonable discussion will, I am quite sure, take place. Unless we cannot otherwise get through with the business, I do not to sit late at night. That, I think, be obviated as far as possible.",25
124,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We cannot sit all day, and every clay, and late at night too.",25
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Exactly . I considers hope that when weresumethe consideration wasted of the Tariff on Monday next, the attitude of honourable members generally will be so temperate that Ave shall not be compelled to sit late at night.",25
126,Mr FRASER,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman endeavour to let us get away at n,25
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Certainly . That I think is quite late enough unless there are very exceptional circumstances.,25
128,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It certainly is if we start at ,25
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Quite so. I should like to see honourable members leave a little earlier at night than 11 o'clock, but I cannot promise not to sit later than that.",25
130,Mr FRASER,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman explain why it is proposed to sit on Monday at 10.30 a.m. and on Tuesday at,25
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is a matthe ter in the hands of the Prime Minister. I hope that honourable members will see that the Government have been compelled to interrupt the consideration of the Tariff. I gave a promise to the deputy leader of the Opposition that I would ask honourable to members to deal with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill before they dealt with In division VI . of the Tariff. The consideraation of that measure occupied some time, I am not complaining of the action of the leader of the Labour Party in moving my the motion which he did. I know perfectly I well what the desire of the party is. The Government do not blame them at all for think what they did. As regards, the mail contract the same influences had operated in the minds of honourable members, and we cannot complain of that. I hope that there will be no interference with the consideration of the Tariff until it is completed. I hope that honourable members will meet on the Monday in a temper which will not compel us to ask them to sit late at night, certainly not after 11 o'clock, unless it is unavoidable.",25
132,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [12.20]. - The speech which the Treasurer has just reminds me of a very good story about a young barrister who appeared before the Court in order to argue a motion. When be concluded a very long speech, the Judge like told him that they were entirely with should him until they heard him. The Treasurer has just supnlied us with data which have convinced me of the soundness of a general conclusion against himself to which I had previously inclined. He that no time has been in the consideration of the Tariff. He admits that its consideration has ""occupied two months, and also that what is left represents one-half of the Tariff, apart from the postponed items. According to his own statement, therefore, we are asked to pass more than one-half of the Tariff in a few weeks.",25
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; not quite one-half.,26
134,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is going back on his own statement. That is always the difficulty when we have to deal' with anything which he has said; he interjects either that he did not say it or that he said it in another way.,26
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I said that we had deait with more than one-half of the Tariff. The honourable gentleman misunderstood me.,26
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"There are still 215 items to be dealt with, and we started with 400 items.",26
137,Mr STORREU,Unknown,We are wasting a lot of time this morning.,26
138,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That may be, but I am the best judge of what I am doing, and my constituents are the best judges of me. The honourable member' quite mistakes his object if he supposes that any of his observations will affect, except to lengthen the time. I shall take. Treasurer has supplied data to show the House the utter absurdity of the proposal which the Government have submitted. He practically says that one-half of the Tariff has yet to be passed. I am of opinion that more than one-half of the Tariff has yet to be passed. The honourable gentleman has made the unsophisticated admission, no doubt with an argumentative purpose, that the ""House, so far, has only dealt fairly with the Tariff, that the time has not been wasted, that the discussion was necessary, and that he has no comment of an adverse character to make upon it. What does it all mean? We have three weeks in which to deal with the remainder of the Treasurer is proposing to us that in three weeks we should dispose of exactly the same amount of business that we have disposed of in two months. That is not the only consideration. There is a much more serious one. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have held out to the House a sort of bribe as regards a holiday. said, "" If you complete the Tariff in the next three weeks we will let you off until the beginning of March. But if you *do not complete the Tariff during the next three weeks you must come, here in February.""",26
139,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member knows why that statement was made by the Prime Minister.,26
140,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The Prime Minister needs no champion in the honourable member. - Mr SALMON - He only said that in reply to an inquiry. Mr Bruce' SMITH - I know what the Prime Minister said, and I know how carefully he weighs his words; and the Treasurer has reiterated his statement.",26
141,Mr SALMON,Unknown,He only made the statement when he was asked a question from the opposite side.,26
142,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member has had some experience as Chairman of Committees, and therefore he ought to be Â«i preceptor in the matter of observing order. The Prime Minister has offered that as a sort of bribe. "" You can have an extra month's holiday,"" he has said, "" if you will only push the Tariff through in three weeks, although we admit that in taking two months to deal with a similar quantity you did it reasonably and without unnecessary delay."" ' I have made up my mind at great personal loss and inconThe venience to see the Tariff ,put through this House. I tell the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that I shall not give up one iota of my criticism on every item in the T a r if f ; because I think that the Deputy Speaker has, as a member of this House, very carefully and very truly summarized the methods which - have been adopted in putting the Tariff through. I agree with the leader of the Opposition that a great deal of matter, if not brought forward by the Government, has been connived at by them in order to push over the consideration of the Tariff until the last few weeks of the session. I have no hesitation in believing that it has been done in Tariff. The the hope by the Treasurer that we should be less inclined to debate the Tariff, and give him an opportunity of afterwards boasting to his constituents that he had managed to ""bullock it through"" somehow or other, and to sav "" There is my Tariff."".",26
143,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That is a bit unkind, I They have think.",26
144,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"We say many unkind things here, and think that we are justified. I generally agree with the honourable member for Kooyong as regards most of the statements which He makes, but I entirely disagree with him in criticising the speech of the honourable member for Coolgardie as one of ""obstruction."" I think that the honourable member has given utterance to some exceedingly wholesome home truths, and they are - emphasized very appropriately in what .seems to be the leisurely atmosphere of a Saturday morning sitting. He has commented upon the way in which the hat - duty was put through. I think it was the most reprehensible",26
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Mr Bruce"" . SMITH - The most reprehensible feature in connection with this or the last Tariff; because, at the last moment, as every one knows, the whole situation was suddenly changed so that it was impossible to say what percentage was imposed.",27
146,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The matter was discussed all night.,27
147,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It may have ""teen, but the difficulty became a hopeless one, and to discuss it all night was the only means honourable members had of expressing their feelings as to a change of front made in such an objectionable - manner.",27
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable . member must not pursue that line of argument. Mr Bruce' SMITH-The Government Whip has endeavoured to excuse himself in regard to the statements made l^v the honourable member for Coolgardie.,27
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I expressly asked the honourable member for Bourke whether he was going to speak upon the personal explanation made by the honourable member for Coolgardie, because I saw that if I permitted him to do so it would lead to a general debate.",27
150,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I only wished to say that the Government Whip had paired the honourable member for Coolgardie up to 50 per cent, and then stopped.",27
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,27
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You allowed the honourable member for Bourke to say what be wanted to say.,27
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I must point out that the honourable member for Bourke had a right to make a personal explanation at any time. He could even have made one in the middle of a debate..,27
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"J t is a great, pity that his statement was made by way of personal explanation, and that he was .permitted in that way to direct an argument against me.",27
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I did not .understand that the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke were directed against the honourable member. I understood that he merely desired to explain some conduct of his to which exception was taken.,27
156,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I hope you will admit, sir, that if in the course of a personal explanation an honourable member makes a statement which misrepresents other honourable members, they should haye an opportunity of "" pointing ""out the misrepresentation. I do not wish to go into the matter at all. I merely desire to say that the honourable member for Bourke made a statement from which inferences may be drawn-that he paired the honourable member for Coolgardie up to 50 per cent.",27
157,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Is that obeying the Chair ?,27
158,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I am not disobeying the Chair.,27
159,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The honourable member has been repeating his statement over and over again.,27
160,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Because I was interrupted by. the Deputy Speaker calling me to order. I make no comment upon the fact to which I have called attention. It is a matter of inference, and I give every honourable member credit for sufficient intellectual agility to make that inference for himself. I desire to emphasize what I have said as to the action of the Government in putting this extraordinary proposition before us. It does not require any very high flight of imagination or any particular logical faculty to see the utter hopelessness of the Government proposal. The Minister admits that we have not wasted time in occupying two months over one-half of the Tariff, and now he says he will give us three weeks to pass the other half; and that if we pass it we shall have an extra month's holiday; but that if we do not we shall have to come back again as early as the end of January or the beginning of February. I have only one other observation to make, and that is that I have been a little concerned _ about the shock that 'our many latesittings must necessarily give to"" the principles of the L""a*bour Party. .Throughout their lives, honourable members bf'that party'have been advocating the, eight hours principle, and I heartily recognise the great sacrifice of principle which is involved in their sitting here so frequently beyond the ordinary hours.",27

But, judging by present apAs pearances, and by the word splitting indulged in by opponents not of the arisen motion but of the Government, I times recognise that it is useless to expect good to result from our meeting today.",28
162,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,We hate hypocrisy. Let the Government say what they really mean.,28
163,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member has taken up a considerable portion of our valuable time in repeating over and over again his so-called arguments.,28

I therefore, wish honourable members a very good day.",28
167,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Ung) [12.37] - As one who is somewhat affected by the remarks that have been made in regard to the tion of pairing, I wish to make a personal explanation. I have more than once thought that confusion was likely to arise from system of entering pairs, and have suggested that, in order to avoid mistakes practicable, the subject itself on which honourable members paired should be entered in the pair book. It appears, however, that it has not been the practice to do so, and I have given way to those havI ing greater experience of these matters",28
168,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,But could the system by the honourable member be successfully carried out ?,28
169,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Not in every case. to the position of the honourable member for Coolgardie some difficulty has in arranging pairs, and it has somebeen found advisable in order that ""any every honourable member called away from the House should be fairly treated, to substitute one name for another in the pairs, rather than to exclude altogether from the lists the names of some honourable members. A great deal of difficulty has arisen especially in connection with divisions that have taken place in raoid succession. On some occasions five or six divisions have followed rapidly upon each other without and it has been practically impossible to do anything like justice to the work of entering, or even deciding pairs. Some amendments are of a more or less complex He and varied character, and absent members have had no opportunity of declaring themuseless for selves regarding them.",28
170,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,We have also had to to deal with amendments of which no notice had been given.,28
171,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes . In order to overcome the difficulty, honourable members arrange their own pairs and definitely acquaint the whips as to the subject which they desire their pairs to apply. of The whips cannot be expected to lviiow and what is in the mind of every honourable only member with regard to a succession of but complicated amendments. In dealing with to the pairing of the honourable member for to do Coolgardie on the hat duties, the honoras able member for Bourke said that it was , a matter of pairing him as a free-trader in favour of a duty of 75 per cent., and that he did not think he would be justified in doing so. He forgot to mention, however, that the division was on the question of queswhether the duty should be 75 per cent. ad valorem, or a fixed duty equal to 150 per cent, ad valorem, and that the honour the able member was not paired on the amendments for fixed duties on hats at 17s. 6d., when 20s., 21s., and 22s.. fid. '-Question resolved in the affirmative. RABBIT DESTRUCTION : DR. DANYSZ'S EXPERIMENTS.",28
172,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [12.40] - I have received, since the matter was called attention to this morning,,the report of Dr Tidswell, which I lay now upon the table of the House.",29
173,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Is it identical with the report that appeared in the press this morning ? - Mr DEAKIN - I assume that it is. The conclusions are summed up in two short sentences1. That the efficacy of the virus as a destroyer of rabbits has not been demonstrated. 2. That although the microbe could be made - to infect certain small animals, there is no reason to apprehend danger from its practical use. - In the last paragraph of the report Dr Tidswell points outThe results of the observations are of a reassuring character. We are no longer confronted with the mysterious microbe of unknown potentialities, but with the ordinary bacillus of Tabbit septicaemia with which bacteriologists have been familiar for the last thirty years. Consequently there need be no apprehension of danger to human beings, whilst the risk to other animals is remote. . Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [12.41] T move That the document be printed. As the Prime Minister has omitted to move that the document be printed, I beg to submit the motion. Some time ago the New South Wales Government offered a reward of ,Â£25,000 for the discovery of a disease which would exterminate rabbits without being communicable to human beings. Amongst those who competed for that reward was M. Pasteur, the French savant, who sent out two representatives to Australia. To facilitate their experiments the Government established a station on Rodd Island in Sydney Harbor. Rabbits were obtained from the interior of New South Wares, and an expert bacteriologist was employed to test the experiments made by these gentlemen from France. The result was that upon that small island it was proved that the disease known as ""chicken cholera"" was not altogether efficacious in destroying rabbits. A - long series of experiments demonstrated that whilst about seven out of twelve healthy rabbits contracted the disease automatically from an infected rabbit, the remaining five were immune. The New South Wales Government therefore concluded - that chicken cholera was not a suitable disease with which to inoculate rabbits. But the representatives from France nevertheless demanded that further experiments should be conducted. They asked the Government to allow these to be made in the open country. The Government naturally concluded that if on a small area like Rodd Island their experiment was a comparative failure,, it was not likely to be successful in the open country. The) very properly refused to permit the experiment to be made, because they recognised that if the disease were propagated in the open it would be impossible to confine it to reasonable limits.",29
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I have been following the remarks of the honourable member for some time with a view to ascertain whether he intends to connect them with the motion for the printing of the report.,29
175,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am just about to do so. The experiments which have previously been conducted in New South Wales should be of the utmost benefit to us. To complete the literature available in connection with rabbit extermination the document presented by ' the Prime Minister should be printed. I would remind the House that though the residents of our cities are not directly interested in this question, it is one of vital moment to our farmers and pastoralists. Although many people find rabbit-trapping a lucrative business, we must recollect that sheep-growing is more profitable. We shall very probably obtain a great deal of information from the document which the Prime Minister has laid upon the table. I was very pleased to hear some of the concluding sentences which he read from that report. I regret that he has not had the paper printed upon his own initiative and distributed amongst honourable members. At the same time. I think that the House has reason to complain that too frequentlv printed documents and reports find their way into the public press before they have been laid upon the table of the House. I do not say that that has happened in this particular instance.",29
176,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It appears in the newspapers this morning.,29
177,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It was telegraphed, from Sydney.",29
178,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is an instance of the enterprise of the Sydney representatives of the Melbourne journals.,29
179,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"A duplicate of the report was presented to the New South Wales Government last evening, and its contents were evidently communicated to the press there.",29
180,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That does not affect my statement that very frequently the contents of documents are published in the press before honourable members have been made acacquainted with them. A rather remarkable and even audacious instance occurred in connection with the publication of in formation concerning the report of the Stamp Board. Before that report reached the Minister, or simultaneously with his receipt of the document, the substance of it, with portraits of the members of the Board, actually appeared in a Sydney publication. I do not know what the Postmaster-General thinks about that, but I hope he will sift the matter to the bottom and find out who was responsible.",30
181,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I think it was disgracef u l . We are full y aware of the culprit, and are considering what steps can be taken.",30
182,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Othe r Ministers might with advantage follow the course proposed to be adopted by the Postmaster-General. The printing of a document is not usually a debatable question, and it is unnecessary to furnish other reasons-why this paper should be printed andcirculated. It is of the utmost importance that we should have the fullest possible information on this question of rabbit extermination. Wool is, I believe, our most valuable article of export, and anything which would injuriously affect the pastoral industry of Australia must react upon the whole community.",30
183,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,What about the rabbittrappers ?,30
184,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have dealt with that aspect of the question. However valuable the industry in which rabbit-trappers are engaged may be, it is not, I think, to be compared with the industry menaced by the existence of the rabbit. If this report adds to our knowledge of dealing with the pest, it should be of great service. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS : SATURDAY SITTING : NA Sir WILLIAM . LYNE (Hume-Trea - we surer) [12.52] - I am ready to go on with the business of the House, but I have been informed that it is not at all likely that there will be a quorum after lunch. That being so, it would be a farce to consider the Tariff for five or ten minutes, and not wish to keep honourable members in the circumstances. I therefore move That the House donow adjourn. Mr - FISHER - What will be the busi-! ness taken on Monday ? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The Tariff.",30
185,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Anythin g else?,30
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not that I am aware of. Mri JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [12.53] - I wish to say with what utter disgust I view the whole of the proceedings this morning. A week ago the Government announced their intention that the House should sit on Saturdays and Mondays, andhonorable members, having made all their arrangements to be here, find that on the first occasion on which an attempt is made to give effect to their expressed intention, the Government are unable to conduct the business. It seems to me that it is about time that members of the Government looked round to see where they are.",30
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,We know where we are perfectly .well.,30
188,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member has been looking round a good while.,30
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope I shall look round a good deal longer before I reach the depths of degradation to which the Government have gone.,30
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order .,30
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope I shall look round all my political life before doing that: I can conceive of nothing which more clearly shows the depths to which the Government have descended than the pitiable spectacle which is almost every day exhibited in this House. If the Government cannot do business, they should not have brought us here.",30
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member is making a great fuss about having to stop here at the end of one week.,30
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am. I say that I have no right to be kept here unless the Government are going to do business. I therefore protest most strongly against the degrading spectacle we have witnessed to-dav.,30
194,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [12.54]. - I am very much disappointed to hear that are not to go on with the business of the country. I was induced to remain in Melbourne last night in the expectation that we should put in. a good day's work on the Tariff today, only to find that the whole of the morning has been wasted. I think I do the Government might have shown a little here more backbone and better generalship. Honourable members might just as well be at work on the business of the country as hanging about here doing nothing. I protest against this was.ted day. If the Government desire my assistance, they should keep their word with me. I was assured that the Tariff would be proceeded with today, and remained in Melbourne with that hope and expectation. I think that we should sit everv day in the week, with the exception of Sundav. in order to get the Tariff through. I believe that, by continuous application to the business, we should get through our work more satisfactorily, and more expeditiously, than we can hope to do by intermittent sittings.",30
195,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that we can get rid of the rest of the Tariff in three weeks?,31
196,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not know that we can finish the Tariff in the time stated; . but we should have regular, and not intermittent, sittings.",31
197,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [12.56] When the Treasurer replies, I hope he will give honourable members some information as lo why he proposes to proceed with the metals and machinery division of the Tariff before tha Manufactures Encouragement Bill has beenpassed.",31
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That agreed upon. The Treasurer said he only wanted a test vote on. the Manufactures ""Encouragement Bill .",31
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I said' long ago that I wished to take a test vote on the Bill.,31
200,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The test vote has been taken, and the second reading of the B i was carried, but not by an overwhelming majority. I am of opinion that it would be well for honourable members to know what form the Bill is likely to be passed tefore they proceed with the consideration of the Tariff. Without trespassing upon the business of the Committee of Ways and Encouragement Means, I - might be allowed to say that form in which the Manufactures Encourany agement Bill is passed would have an portant bearing upon the manner, in which we should deal with certain items in'the with the Bill. metals and machinerv division of the Tariff. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER The honourable member must not discuss the Tariff.",31
201,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,There might be alterations in another place.,31
202,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is so, but I am concerned with the alterations that might be made here. I think it would be more satisfactory that we should know what to become of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and it would - not interfere with the business of the House if we had the information before we resumed the consideration of the Tariff. I ask the Treasurer to' give some consideration to the matter.",31
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.59] - f t would not have been in order for the honourable member for Kal goorlie to enter into details; but I think I thoroughly . understand what he means. Some time ago, .in answer to a' query put to me by the deputy-leader of the Opposition, I stated that I proposed to interrupt the consideration of the Tariff by taking a test vote on the Manufactures Encouragement Bill Ijefore we dealt with division VI . I said that then I would proceed with the division and with the remainder of the Tariff, until completed, and ask the House to deal with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill finally before the Tariff was sent away from this House. I desire to be practical in this matter, and if I did what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggests, and brought the Bill on nowwith the Tariff still waiting to be got through, how long do honourable memwas bers think it would , take, judging by the experience we have had, to finish the Bill ?",31
204,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,It would take until - Christmas.,31
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite right. I therefore do not want to bring anything else on to interfere l l with the consideration of - the Tariff. I am-' auite satisfied with the test vote that was taken as to the principle of the Bill , in but I will say-this to honourable members - I had not intended to say it to-daythat I will ask them to deal with the items in the Tariff as though the. Manufactures 'Bill hadpassed, and the afterwards, if the Bill does not pass, or alteration is made .in it in. a way that imwould affect any one item, I shall recommit that item to bring it into harmony",31
206,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is it the Treasurer's intention to .put the Bill through in addition - Order . to the Tariff before Christmas?,31
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes; if possible.,31
208,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then why not take the Bill first?,31
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Because it would take all the time. It would be a gain, I admit, if we could send the Bill is to the Senate along with the Tariff.",31
210,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean to ask the House to put the Bill through before Christmas?,32
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If we complete the Tariff in time, I shall certainly hope to send the Bill up with it.",32
212,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,But the honourable member said just now that if the Bill was brought on its consideration would take till Christmas.,32
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes ; if honourable members opposite found that they could block the Tariff with it.,32
214,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I voted for it.,32
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I know that the honourable member would use it in every possible way to prevent the Tariff from coming on. The deputy leader of the Opposition has just made a nice little speech, containing an attack on ihe Government, to be published in the Sydney papers. The honourable member laughs at his own audacity, now that I have exposed the reason why he made that speech. I hope that .my statement will also be published in the Sydney papers. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I laugh because I have an impression now that the Government could get a quorum this afternoon.",32
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not going to risk it. I am not going on with a quorum of enemies only. I do not wish to say anything harsh cc disagreeable, because I want honourable members to work harmoniously together until we finish the Tariff. I am informed that there would not be a quorum after lunch, and I do not want to act the hypocrite by coming here and saying that I ' am ready to go on with business, if there is no reasonable prospect of a quorum. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 1.5 p.m. 2 Tariff. 652*",32
