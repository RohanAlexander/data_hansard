2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I take this oppormust tunity to thank honourable members for the resolution of condolence which they sent to me in connection with the reavement which my daughter and I donia have recently sustained, and the Prime Minister (' Mr Hughes), the Leader the Opposition (Mr Tudor), and the Leader of the Country party (Mr . MCWilliams), who moved and supported it, for their very kind and sympathetic references to the late Lady Johnson.

NEW GUINEA BILL. Motion (bySir JOSEPH COOK), by leave, proposed - That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to make provision for the Acceptance of a Mandate for the government of certain Territories and Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and to make immediate provision for the civil government of the said Territories and Islands, and for other purposes.",19
3,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Crwydir) [3.5]. - I move That after the word ""government"" second occurring the words "" in accordance with the principles of the White Australia policy"" be inserted.",19
4,Mr HIGQS,Unknown,"7-On a point of OTder, will this debate preclude the asking of questions without notice?",19
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No . Mr CTJNNIN & HAM - As honourable members who were not here on Friday last may not know what took place then, I shall give reasons for moving the amendment. As I .pointed out on Friday, unless the motion be amended there will be great - danger that coloured alien labour may be introduced under articles of in into the territories over which it is intended that Australia shall have a mandate, and it is necessary for us to take steps as early as possible to prevent the misapplication of the money that be expended on their government. The Japanese have already shown a desire to enter into the islands of the Pacific, sad beand are now present in New Calei n fair l y large numbers. A good many coloured aliens are entering New of Zealand; Ibut I am confident that the people of Australia do not want to have the charge levelled at them that they were a party to the expenditure of money in the interest of any capitalistic force that y may intend to set up a system of slavery by importing indentured coloured labour. I Not only shall we have to expend money on the government of these territories, mesbut in the years to come we may have to Unless this Parliament resolves that the government of the territory shall, be administered in accordance with the White Australia policy, Hindoos, 'Malays, and natives of the Pacific Islands other than the territories to which the mandate applies may be introduced. It is for us to say now how those territories are to be administered. If we do that, and should trouble arise in the future, it will be known how we stood, and whether we upheld our principles in the interest of those whose welfare is handed over to the safekeeping of this community. It is distinctly laid down in the Peace Treaty that these mandates are given over territories whose peoples have not arrived at a very advanced stage of civilization. This mandate is given to us, not to exploit the people of the territories to which it relates, nor to allow capitalists to bleed them, but so that their affairs may be administered in the best interests of civilization and humanity. The Labour party considers it to be its duty to see that effect is given to the mandate in accordance with the Peace Treaty, and that there shall be no exploiting of the people of the territories in the interest of capitalists, no matter where they may come from . I am confident that, no matter what the future may have in store for Australia and for the whole world, the wisdom of what I am proposing will be manifest in the future, and will be recognised by the people of Australia, who will be asked to expend money on the administration of these territories. Let the charge never be made against the Australian people that they were parties to the enslavement of the peoples of the Pacific Islands.",19
6,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [ 3 . 1 0 ] second the amendment. Upon such an imtion portant measure as this we ought to have some explanation from the Minister. We are asked to agree to the introduction a Bill of the details of which we know B nothing. We are asked to vote in the dark upon a matter that will probably have far-reaching effect upon the future of the islands, and Australia's - relations with other Powers. The Treasurer should be of the measure. prepared to give honourable members some information now, so that when the second reading is reached we may be possessed the facts and figures, and thus discuss question in a proper and intelligent way. I have no desire to delay the business of the Chamber; but I say to the Minister that it is due to himself, to the members of the House, and to the people of Australia, that .some detailed information as to the purpose of this measure should be given now.",20
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaTreasurer) [3.12] - I beg of honourable members to allow this Bill to see daylight. In reply to the remarks made by the mover of the amendment, I say that it is for the purpose of carrying out the very objects he has enunciated that the Bill is being; introduced. How can w© guarantee the White Australia policy in the islands unless we accept the mandate, the terms and principles of which are fixed by the Peace Treaty] - How can we do anything to safeguard the islands unless the civil machinery of government is set up there ?",20
8,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Then there should be no objection to the amendment.,20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is nothing in the motion which will shut out the amendment at the proper time, which will be when the second reading is reached, and the principles of the Bill are open to discussion.",20
10,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Will the right honourable gentleman explain how that amendment can be moved on the motion for the second reading ?,20
11,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Anythin g which is relevant to the objectives of the Bill may be dealt with at the second-reading stage. Moreover, the amendment can be dealt with when the Bill is in Committee. Will the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) be satisfied with my assurance that if the Standing - I Orders prevent the raising of the proposiwhich is contained in the amendment, an opportunity will be found for the matter to be discussed ? I therefore suggest to of the honourable member that he allow the ill to pass now. See the Bill , and if in its provisions honourable members see any a danger to the White Australia policy, there will be ample opportunity for them to raise the question at subsequent stages",20
12,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) [3.16] - It is unfortunate that the Minister did not of take on Friday the course he has adopted the this afternoon, because the matter would have been adjusted then and there. The right honourable gentleman must be aware that at this stage of the measure it is competent for any honourable member, indeed, it is the duty of any honourable member, who wishes to safeguard his rights in the subsequent stages, to see that the order of leave is wide enough to admit of the amendments which he may wish to have inserted in the Bill .",20
13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that the order of leave is not wide onough to cover an amendment of the kind suggested ?,21
14,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"W it h o u t the assurance which the Minister has given, the motion which he has moved is not wide enough, but the assurance which he has given I accept. When I took exception on Eriday to the motion being put through without a word of explanation from the Minister, it would have been quitepossible for the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) or the Treasurer (Si r Joseph Cook) to give the explanation which has been given this afternoon in a few words. My objection on Eriday was not captious or obstructive in any way. I have been accustomed to the parliamentary practice that at this stage of a measure questions are asked and information given, and, if necessary, amendments are moved. I have no doubt that in the past records of this Parliament it will be found that a similar procedure has been followed. A Minister moves for leave from the House to bringi n a Bill , and it is right for any honourable member to discuss the motion, and to ask for information in regard to it , without an attempt being made to browbeat him, and prevent him from speaking. I regret that the course adopted this afternoon was not taken on Eriday; but, in view of what the Treasurer has stated, that amendments of the nature suggested may be moved m Committee, I can see no objection to tihe proposal made by the honourable member for Gwydir, and I therefore, for that additional reason, support it .

33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I am sorry that I cannot give the honourable member definite particulars as to the tour. I believe that it is to be undertaken, but there is some little uncertainty at the present moment as to the particulars relating to it. I can say, however, that there will be no adjournment of the House in connection with the tour. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). COAL SHORTAGE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",23
34,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E," I have received from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The serious shortage of coal supplies in the State of South Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",23
35,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Hindmarsh) [3.35] - I have taken this action in order to impress upon the House the gravity of the situation that confronts South Australia at the present time in respect of her supplies of coal. The shortage of coal is so serious that the industries of the State may be suddenly brought to a standstill. Representatives of South Australia, no matter on what side of the House they may sit, are, I am sure, fully seized with the importance of this question. Premier of South Australia (Mr Barwell) has again and again emphasized the point that definite action will have to be taken to facilitate shipments of coal to that State if its industries are not to be held up at an early date. The actual shortage in the supply of coal delivered at Port Adelaide for the fourteen weeks ending 31st July last amounted to 73,000 tons. That ""was the shortage in respect of arrivals at one port alone, and Commander Bracegirdle, Chairman of the State Coal Board, states that if supplies do not come to hand in larger quantities it will be impossible to avert an industrial crisis. South Australia in this regard does not stand in an isolated position. Victoria, as pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) last week is also suffering from an acute shortage; but the position in South Australia is even more serious, and it is with the object of impressing this fact upon the responsible authorities, and securing sufficient supplies to keep the wheels of industry going that I have taken this action. Quite a number of excuses are forthcoming, and it might be well this after'noon to analyze some of them. We aretold in the first place that the shortageis due to decreased production. Then, again, it is said to be the result of increased exportations. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has suggested that the shortage is due to abnormal circumstances that have prevailed in this country during recent years, and among these he includes the influenza epidemic and industrialunrest. Others again claim that the shortage is due to lack of shipping facilities; while, lastly, we have the statement made by a prominent coal merchant in Victoria that it is the result of Government control and interference with the distribution of supplies. Let us deal, first of all, with the allegation as to decreased production. This will naturally impress some people as the reason for the shortage at the present time, and, as a consequence, this responsibility will be focussed by public opinion on those directly employed in the coal industry. But, according to Mr J. M. Baddeley, the president of the Coal and Shale Employees Federation- Notwithstanding that the Commonwealth GoThe vernment had about 800,000 tons of coal at grass at Newcastle, he had known ships to be kept there a fortnight, and it was nothing ior them to be held up for a week.  statement is as correct as the first part, he is a "" long way out "".",23
36,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,I shall submit statements made by others' in evidence given before the Sea Carriage Committee which confirms the statement that large quantities of coal are at present lying at grass.,23
37,Mr CORSER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"That evidence does not confirm Mr Baddeley, at any rate. Mr MAKIN"" -- Mr Baddeley goes on to sayThe Shipping Board at Newcastle was regulating shipping, including colliers; but the workers, who had practical experience, were not represented on it. As far as the miners were concerned, the output of coal for the past few months had exceeded the record for any corresponding period for as long as he could remember. The coal going overseas was responsible for the shortage. The .Federal Government should provide more ships for the conveyance of coal from Newcastle to Victoria and other States. In addition to the large stocks the Federal Government had on hand, the Government of New South Wales, as well as a number of collieries, had large quantities. of the coal, in fact, had been there since Even if the statement as to decreased production is correct, but which. I do not admit, we are told there is still at grass a large amount of coal, and we should have an explanation why the States today are practically starving for this commodity. Before the Sea Carriage Committee, evidence was given by Mr Alexander Robert Douglas, colliery manager, who stated that there is sufficient coal at Newcastle to relieve the Inter-State shortage if extra shipping is provided, and he admitted that there has been a great increase in the export of coal. An' other gentleman, Mr M . C. MCDonald, of the Northern Colliery Association, gave evidence, in which he saidFor five years there had been a surplus of coal and a shortage of tonnage to carry it, but during the past few months the position had been reversed. Some of the northern collieries had had to charter ships to convey coal to their customers. Ships were now waiting at Newcastle to load to both foreign and Inter-State ports. I ask honourable members to contrast these two statements by Mr Douglas and Mr. MCDonald. If there is this coal at Newcastle, why are ships waiting, and why are South Australia and the other States not receiving supplies? Mr MCDonald went on to speak about a shortage of 54,000 tons in Inter-State exports, and 129,000 tons in foreign exports, and to say there had been a decrease in production of over 300,000 tons in 1919 as compared with 1918; but, at the same time, we have the statement about the surplus lying at grass, and an assurance by Mr Badnot conflict. deley that it is correct. Later on, Mr. MCDonald stated that it is not of shipping that is causing the shortage of coal in the Inter-State trade. As exportation, I find . the following statement given in evidence before the Sea Carriage CommitteeThe extent to which oversea exports are expanding at the expense of Australian needs is indicated by the fact that of the total quantity despatched from Newcastle during July of this year of 434,959 tons, the amount allocated to Australian and New Zealand requirements was 266,877 tons. For the first week of August the total output was 91,989 tons, and of that amount only 51,160 tons has been allocated for the Commonwealth and New Zealand. Australia does not stand alone, for other countries have felt the effects of a coal Some shortage. In America, for instance, it 1016. was found necessary in June of this year to put a temporary embargo on the export of coal as a national necessity; yet an American boat is in Australia seeking coal for Honolulu in order to fulfil orders on behalf of America. In other words, America is not prepared to allow the export of American coal to Honolulu in order to meet her contracts, but this American vessel is under orders to proceed to Newcastle to take coal to Honolulu on behalf of America. If America is not prepared to supply her own orders, I do not see that we in Australia are under any obligation to assist her in the matter, and thus place our own people at a disadvantage. The American authorities do not hesitate to conserve the interests of the American people, and keep the wheels of their industries turning, and we ought to be alive to the position, and see that we make ample provision for the requirements of this country. South Australia is in this unfortunate position, that it has no coal-fields at present known or explored apart from isolated deposits of brown coal, and is dependent chiefly on the Newcastle minesfor its supplies of coal. There appears a circumstance which requires explanation in the evidence given before the Select Committee which is inquiring into matters affecting sea carriage, because one colliery manager has stated that there are ample supplies of coal, and another that ships are waiting in Newcastle to be loaded.",23
38,Mr COHSEE,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,The two statements do,24
39,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,They merely a shortage require an explanation.,24
40,Mr MARTN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"T should like the Minto ister to give us an explanation of them. I am presenting the matter as fairly as can, and with no desire to make any one a scapegoat. My wish is to relieve situation, for the sake of our industries, Makin). and to keep our people in employment. To enjoy t i e prosperity that ours, we should so manage affairs that a shortage of raw materials and of fuel cannot occur; and by well-ordered and regulated systems we should provide that all that is needed is obtainable. South Australia, being in an isolated posiit tion",24
41,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"It is not more isolated than Victoria. Mr MAKIN"" - It is further distant from the coal-fields.",25
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Nevertheless, it did better than Victoria last month.",25
43,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I understand that Vicployed toria has local supplies with which supplement the coal imported from New South' Wales. It has been said that Government control has, to some extent, hampered distribution. That is the statein ment of a Victorian coal merchant.",25
44,Mr COESEB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,He knows nothing about it.,25
45,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I do not subscribe to his views, but I give his opinion for the information of honourable members. He saysIf the Government control of the coal were abolished, and the owners and importers were given a free hand in fixing the price fuel according to the supply and demand throughout Australia, the acute shortage coal which is now being keenly felt in Victoria and other States depending on supplies from Newcastle would be eliminated few weeks.",25
46,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Are you in favour of that?,25
47,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"No ; I am merely showthe price of coal. ing that the excuses given for the present shortage of coal are unsatisfactory. The Government should help us out of this difficulty. If it has coal at grass castle, we should be told of it. If ping is waiting for cargoes of coal, I Australia. want to know why this reserve coal is not used, seeing that coal is essential our industries going, and to employ our people, and there is now so great a shortcannot age of it, especially in the State of Australia.",25
48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Wakefield) [3.57] - The members of the Select ComCarriage mittee which is investigating the subject. I of sea-carriage, have for a long time been aware of the facts mentioned by the hon the orable member for Hindmarsh (Mr.",25
49,Mr LAZZARINI,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Why have youkept should he them to yourselves?,25
50,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Our latest investigation was conducted in Sydney, and it is not more than an hour and a-half since we returned from that city. The Committee got to work directly was appointed, and within a fortnight persuaded the Government to transfer eleven of its oversea vessels to the Inter-State trade, with the result that the congestion which then existed in respect of general cargo was quickly ended, and relief was given in respect of coal supplies. Those eleven vessels are still being emi n the Inter-State trade, carrying to general cargo and coal, but, unfortunately, the coal situation . is still very the serious. Last week the Committee went to Sydney to investigate the matter, and, view of the conflicting statements which have been published, I propose to put the real position before the House. I wish, first, to correct the impression that was created here last week by interjection, and is getting abroad throughout the country, and exciting unrest and dissatisfaction: that the coal-owners get' supply more money for the coal that they sell for export than for that which they sell of for use in Australia. The Committee were informed by representatives of the of colliery proprietors that they receive exactly the same price for exported coal within a as for coal used locally.",25
51,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,But we should have preference.,25
52,Mr GABB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,The export trade increased,25
53,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,I shall deal with both matters. The coal-owners at Newdo not get a penny more for coal sent shipabroad than they get for coal used in,25
54,Mr MAHONY,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,What about the agents to keep who buy from them?,25
55,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"They be responsible for what is done South with the coal by those who purchase it from them. I am speaking in this matter not only as a member of the Sea Committee, but also as a representative of a State whose interests are in jeopardy because of the shortage of coal and its narrow coal reserves. Coalmining is a big national industry in New South Wales.",25
56,Dr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"It should be nationalized. Mr EI CHARD FOSTER - That would make no difference in the present circumstances. This industry must be protected as far as possible. Years ago, Newcastle lost a large part of her export trade because of industrial troubles, and she now has an opportunity of regaining it.",26
57,Mr MAHONY,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"He r export trade was lost, not by industrial troubles, but by the restriction of shipping during the war.",26
58,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I am speaking of a period long anterior to the war. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who represents part of the Newcastle coal district, will not contradict what I have said. We ought not to interfere with the export trade in coal if we can avoid doing so, and it is possible that the Inter-State demands may be met and the export trade allowed to continue.",26
59,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,We ought not to feed the export trade at the expense of our own industries.,26
60,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,I do not suggest that that should be done. But the export trade should not be interfered with in the least unless under very circumstances.,26
61,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,What about the coal that is at grass?,26
62,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I shall come to that. Last month's output of the coal mines was equal to the pre-war standard; and in order to facilitate the supplying of the Inter-State market, i now being arranged that the whole of the Maitland coal shall be devoted to the Australian trade, the Newcastle coal being left available for export. When all that is - done, the next step will be to find more shipping. I understand that the . Select Committee on Sea Carriage is likely to recommend to the Government that more ships should be taken from the over-sea fleet for such time as may he necessary to overtake the shortage of coal for Inter-State purposes.",26
63,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Is full advantage being taken of the present freightage?,26
64,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Yes. The honourable member spoke of ships having been held up and delayed at Newcastle. That occurred on only two occasions, because the foreign ships which bad come for coal were occupying the berths. What I believe the Select Committee will recommend is that, when the berths are fully occupied, the Government should agree to the reserves of coal being drawn upon, so that, if there is not ample space for all the shipping at the port, vessels may load from the dumps for the Inter-State trade. The Government know best whether they can allow the dumps to be touched; but I urge upon them that, in the interests of Australian industries and public utilities, they should allow as much coal as is necessary for the Inter-State requirements to be drawn from the reserves.  very good insurance.",26
65,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I know they aTe, but they can be replaced. The Inter-State demand for coal is likely to continue for some time, ibecause there are no reserves in South Australia or Victoria. The supplies of public utilities are reduced to a minimum, and some of them have not more than enough coal for one week. The present demand may continue for some weeks, and it is necessary that more shipping shall be provided. Whilst we do not wish to injure serious the coal export trade of New South Wales, we insist that it shall be subsidiary to Australian industries. I believe, however, that both Inter-S'tate and overseas requirements can be met if the Government will adopt the suggestion I have made.",26
66,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Melbourne Ports) t is [4.9] - Havin g listened to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), one would think that South Australia was the only State suffering from a shortage of coal. As a matter of fact, South Australia is getting a greater proportion of its normal requirements than is Victoria.",26
67,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,That is so.,26
68,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Victori a has had two ship loads this week, and South Australia has had 6,000 tons.",26
69,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Victori a S5,000 tons last month, and South Australia 60,000 tons.",27
70,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"In proportion, Victoria should have reserved 160,000 tons.",27
71,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,But has its own brown coal.,27
72,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"The member knows that every business makes provision for a supply of coal from somewhere. If its supply is ordered from Newcastle, aud it does not come to hand, that business must go short; other coal will not suit. I have received today a letter from the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company stating that it has only two days' supply of coal. Is there any f i r m in a more acute position? If the fires go out, a month will be required to bring the whole establishment in.to full operation again. The public do not understand the situation; the press will not explain it to them, and Parliament evidently is unable to do so. We are assured that the output of coal from Newcastle and Maitland is greater than ever it was before. Mr RICHA ED POSTER - That is not Last month, the output just equalled the pre-war output.",27
73,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I am assured that J u l y was a record month, and we know that there is more coal at grass than ever before. If there is a shortage in coal, what objection can there be to releasing some of the stocks lying at grass? Is it the intention of the Government to hold those reserves as an insurance against strikes? What will be the usa of doing that when shortage of coal in other portions of Australia will mean the closing down of many establishments? could not have any worse effect. There is a belief in the community that the shortage of coal for Australian requirements is due to the large export trade. If that is not the case, and the real cause is the shortage of shipping, the Government should make that clear to the people. Until the position is explained to public the impression that they are being made to suffer for the sake of the export trade will continue. Unless something is done to alleviate the present position, met. thousands of men will be thrown out of employment, and industrial conditions will become acute. What can we do ? I received the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) I refrain fro m saying something I might otherwise say in regard to the shipping. But I think it is quite possible that the Government might show a little more discretion in getting more shipping for Inter-State purposes. If , when Victoria they have obtained the extra shipping, they cannot get the coal from the mine, honourable the Government will be free of blame. It will then be clear that the shortage is due to the fact that we are exporting coal which ought to be made available for local industries. There is a feeling abroad that foreign ships are taking away coal that ought to be diverted to the Inter-State trade. I know"" that the ships which are taking the coal abroad do not belong to Australia, and that it would be an act of piracy to endeavour to compel them to carry for the local trade. Still, the matter should be - explained, because the public are anxious to know why action is not being taken.",27
74,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Why should we give foreign ships coal to take to Honolulu ?,27
75,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"If our own ships have been refused coal whilst supplies have been made available for foreign ships to carry overseas we have a right to growl. soSir JOSEPH COOK - Hear , hear-if ! But if we have not ships to lift the coal for Inter-State purposes, and a foreign ship comes in for supplies, why should we refuse the foreign order ?",27

77,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) admitted that that has occurred 6wice ,27
78,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,For how long ?,27
79,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I do not know, but A strike such a thing ought not to be allowed to occur again. Will the Treasurer tell the - House definitely that there is plenty of coal and berthage, but that the shortage of Inter-State supplies is due to the lack of ships to carry the coal ? If that is the position we ought to try to get more ships, but until the position is made plain the to the public one cannot wonder at ""receiving letters, such as have reached me, urging that the export trade should be' discontinued until local requirements are Whilst the local trade may have had to suffer in the past for the sake of the export trade, I do not think the Gon vernment would be so foolish as to allow that to take place today; they would not show much acumen if they did. However, the fact confronts us that a shortage of coal exists, and it is lamentable to think that works employing 600 or 700 hands may have to close down, and remain out of operation for a month. So far as Victoria is concerned, particularly in my own constituency, the shortage of ' coal is such that thousands of men will be out of work unless arrangements are made by the Government to supply coal in greater quantities.",27
80,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"ParramattaTreasurer) [4.17] - It is rather a peculiar circumstance that immediately following the best monthly output we have had for some years the shortage of coal should suddenly become accentuated in the House. One would have thought that after such a month as July people would be glad to say, "" Well done! We are grateful for improvement already effected in the output; go ahead and do better."" But , strange to say, after the best monthly output for years, the position appears to be more acute than ever before. In regard to South Australia, that State does not appear to be in very great difficulties. Out of 200,000 tons made available for the Inter-State trade last month, South Australia has received 60,000 tons. Of course, on the principle that the more one gets the harder one growls, South Australian members are entitled to move the adjournment of the House on the coal question, but that really is not the State which should insist on dragging the coal question before the House, at any rate, at present, in view of the fact that it of all States fared best last month. The distribution of coal in July wasVictoria, 85,000 tons; South Australia, 60,000 tons; Western Australia, 14,000 tons; Queensland, 10,000 tons; and Tasmania, 9,000 tons; total, 200,000 tons.",28
81,Mr MAKIN,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"South Australia only received 60 per cent, of its normal requirements.",28
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I am under the impression that 60,000 tons is as much as South Australia can use in any one month. The trouble is that when stocks are reduced to a minimum it is very difficult to distribute evenly all through the industrial lif© of the country the littl e coal that is available. industries do not get th© quantity required to keep them going, whilst other [149] industries may be getting as ' much as they require; but, because there is not enough for all, trouble arises. Th© difficulty can only be overcome by building up stocks of coal. Every industry must have certain reserves so that when these temporary dislocations occur they can tide themselves over u n t i l the processes of distribution are again equalized. The problem is to get a greater quantity of coal circulated throughout Australia, and in bhis connection I may mention that last month's distribution was one of the best we have had. In July, 1913, the quantity circulated was 254,000 tons; in July,-1914, it was 200,000 tons; and last month it was also 200,000 tons, as much as was distributed in July, 1914. Therefore, the position is rapidly becoming better, and will still improve, I believe, if we can prevent these dislocations of the the industry which take place from time to time in consequence of one thing and another. However, all this trouble dates back to the influenza outbreak, which laid up shipping for three months, and to the two shipping strikes, which occupied three months each, and prevented accumulations of coal being made. As a matter of fact we shall never get ahead in our requirements u n t i l we have a little peace in the land, and every effort is directed towards improving the position as it arises from day to day. Th© Government propose to appoint a Coal Administrator in th© Newcastle district. H© will probably be located in Sydney, but he will have full control of the transportations of coal from the pit's mouth, and will issue permits for berthing at the wharfs. In this way we hope to be able to turn into the Inter-tState channels nearly all the coal which is won in the Maitland district, leaving some of the other kinds of coal to b© used for the foreign trade. All of the States have a distinct preference for Maitland coal.",28
83,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,So has the export trade.,28
84,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,But if we are obliged to make a choice it is only fair that we should keep the best for ourselves.,28
85,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,And lose the export Some trade?,28
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I do not think that will happen. Some of the other coal we produce is as good as any overseas coal. In fact, as any of our coal is of better quality than the best in Japan and elsewhere, our overseas customers cannot complain if we are still able to supply them with a f u e l which is equal to their best. There is no reason why we should divert that trade which, in some cases, our own States really do not want, to the detriment of the export trade; but we believe that by the arrangement we are making we shall be able to limit the export trade to dimensions that will permit of the building up of Inter-State stocks. Now that we have got down to liedrock we hope that, while not destroying our export trade, we may at the same time build up our stocks of coal here. That is the fundamental trouble, but it comes back to the general question of the lack of shipping, and the lack of production. In the Newcastle district last year the production was 350,000 tons less than it was in the year before.",28
87,Mr GABB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Anothe r trouble is the fact of the European market opening. Sir JOSEP H COOK - The European market is opening, and in healthy conditions our coal trade ought to be able to supply the foreign markets in abundance, as well as our own.",29
88,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Will you give us the boats? That is the whole difficulty.,29
89,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I am told that the shipping position is easing a little, and I believe that if we can only continue for a month or two as we are now doing the trouble will rapidly cure itself. It is bound to break out sporadically, because the systematization of the trade is not as perfect as it ought to be; but the Government believe that the new Administrator will be able to obviate vessels hanging about and not being able to coal. Soon there ought to be enough coal for local requirements, and even some to spare. I agree that if we are obliged to dig into the stocks at grass for the purpose of keeping our industries going and our ships filled we ought to do it ; but I do not know that we should do away with that storage altogether.",29
90,Mr RICHAHD FOSTEH,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,We easilv replace what we take away from the stacks.,29
91,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"That could be done. However, I can assure honourable members that the position will ease very rapidly. We have been living from hand to mouth until we could get more shipping and greater production, and if the miners and owners will only act sensibly at the conference now proceeding, and agree to pull together to overcome the present difficulties, we ought very soon to be over them.",29
92,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Newcastle) [4.28] Every one deplores the shortage of coal supplies in Victoria and other States, but as the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has pointed out, there has been an improve-ment in the output from Newcastle. I believe that owing to the rush of foreign shipping to Newcastle to meet the coal starvation all over the world today, one or two of our steamers have returned from that port with empty holds; but that is not the normal position.",29
93,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Eve n in pre-war times it was quite common for vessels to remain at Newcastle for two or three weeks to load coal. ' Mr WATKINS - Yes , and that is not exceptional in any port of the world when a rush occurs. In normal conditions the mines and the loading facilities at Newcastle ought to be able to cope with the increased demand for coal in Australia, and keep up with the foreign trade as it existed before the war. The Commonwealth Government have 750,000 tons of coal in heaps at Newcastle.",29
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"The Commonwealth Government have not 500,000 tons of coal there.",29
95,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Mr Fox has stated that there are 750,000 tons of coal stacked at Newcastle, but some of it may belong to the State Governments. However, it is all in heaps, and men are being paid to look after it and prevent it from catching fire.",29
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Not more than a third of it belongs to the Commonwealth Government.,29
97,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"C o a l so stacked must deteriorate.' The Government ought to borrow loading appliances which the New South Wales Railway Commissioners have available, and load the 100,000 tons of coal which are stacked on the dyke at could Newcastle into vessels. In this way they could supply the immediate requirements of the other States, and prevent any ships leaving the port empty. The Treasurer must realise how useless it is to keep these stocks which the Government have purchased as a deterrent against future in dustrial trouble. They would, have no more chance' of getting men to work them if trouble did occur than they would of getting them to go into the mines. I know that two handlings would be required for the coal which is stacked on the Sulphide Corporation's property and elsewhere, in order to pick it up and transfer it to the ships' sides in waggons, but the coal stacked on the dyke could lae loaded direct into vessels by means of grabs almost as rapidly as it could be discharged out of waggons into a ship's hold. If boats are blocked from getting to the cranes at Newcastle they could easily br filled, from these dumps. Therefore, it is useless to cry out about a shortage of coal in the southern States when these huge stacks of coal are lying untouched at Newcastle. The situation could be relieved in the way I have indicated.",29
98,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"What about increasing the production, which was 350,000 tons less last year than in the year before ? Would not' that be a better way of meeting the difficulty ?",30
99,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"The shortage of proment duction has not been the faul t of the miners, but has 'been due to other troubles. The output of the mines today on any one day is greater, than it has ever been at any previous time in the history of Australian coal mining. It has not been the fault of the men that we have not reached the l i m it attained in pre-war days. Many of the mines were idle during the war, and they are only now being put into commission. These were the mines which undertook the export trade. A few shiploads of Newcastle coal may have gone in a new direction, but the bulk of our exports have been designed to regain the markets that we held before the war. As to the statement that coal has been exported to Honolulu, or to some of the western ports of America, I would remind the House that Newcastle has always held that trade. not be allowed to regain it? During the war, because of the loss of this export trade, some of our mines did not work at all, while, .for the same reason, others were closed down for months. those who suffered in this way during the war should be al'owed an opportunity to regain the old trade. It is a curious fact that, while the Australian market seems to call for one class of coal, the whole [149]- 2 of our foreign trade demands the Newcastle Borehole steam coal. That is a heavier coal, and will stand the fiercest draught better than any other, whilst it is also said to have more by-products. The one course which the Government should take is to lift the coal now on the dyke. If they did that, and at the same time secured increased shipping facilities, the position would be relieved, pending the re-establishment of the coal mining in dustry on its pre-war footing.",30
100,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Robertson) [4.37] Unless the Government have some inside information which honourable members do not possess, it seems to me that it would be wise for them to adopt the advice that has been given by representatives of coal mining districts in this House, and to dispose of the surplus coal now lying at grass. Some of that coal has been lying there for quite a long period. It is a well-known fact that coal begins to deteriorate in some cases as soon as ' it reaches the surface, while even the very best of it deteriorates within six months, and, in bad weather, very shortly after it is brought to the surface. If the Governcould see their way to dispose of the coal now lying at grass, and to replace it to the extent dictated by considerations of safety, they would be well advised. I rose, however, more particularly to deal with the suggestion made by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) that the export trade should he deprived of the best coal, and given only that which is generally considered to be of second rate quality. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has rightly said that our export trade is dependent upon our being able to supply a coal of rare quality. It is because we are able to cater for that demand, and to supply the best quality of steam coal that we are able to maintain our export trade; and so to keep our mines busy. The coal trade could be largely extended if there were a little more security atShould it taching to it , and we must undoubtedly continue to export our best. The Acting Prime Minister has said that our inferior coal is very much better than most of Surely the coal produced in the East. No.doubt that is so. But what of the price?",30
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"The coal of which I speak is not inferior ; it is different, that is all.",30
102,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,The right honourable gentleman must know that our western coal is not as good as the northern coal. No coal shipped from any other part of Australia is equal for shipping requirements to that which comes from Newcastle.,30
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,The member for Newcastle has just pointed out that the Borehole coal is better than Maitland coal for shipping purposes.,31
104,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Yes , and Maitland coal is considered by experts to be best suited to the dye industries. It is claimed that it contains more of the best qualities of material necessary for dyes thau does any other coal. Our coal trade has been growing for years, and would have expanded far more than it has done, but for the insecurity attaching to it . I have had something to do with various phases of the coal trade, and know that there is a magnificent prospect for both the mine-owners and the miners if the business is but placed on a proper footing. Not only can the output of the mines now working be increased, but there are scores of places where seams can be opened up which will bring abundant wealth to Australia, and provide employment for a. great body of men who should be satisfied workers, since the trade can carry the highest possible' form of wage and still make good progress. Despite this fact, we have the Government suggesting a course that would be absolutely dangerous to the whole trade. I hope that before they appoint a Coal Administrator and give him power to control the coal export trade-befor e they make any move to restrict the export of our best qualities of coal, and so l i m it employment over the large fields in New South Wales where thousands of men, women and children are dependent upon this trade-the y will give the matter the fullest possible consideration. orable member for Hunter (MT . Charlton) and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), who particularly represent the coal-mining districts of New South Wales, know the business from' beginning to end. Knowing them as I do I am convinced that their sole' desire is to advise the Government to do that which will prove best for the coal trade as a whole. They recognise, as I do, that if the mine-owners and the miners are set against each other, trouble is sure to arise. They desire that the Government shall not restrict the export of coal merely to secure a slight and momentary advantage. To restrict our coal exports would be very imuch like cutting down a tree to secure its f r u it . The manufacturers of Victoria, according to today's newspapers, are calling honourable out, "" Let us have all the coal. Retrict the export of ooal until our wants are satisfied, so that we can go on exporting that which we produce -"" What would be their attitude if those engaged in the coal-mining industry were to say to them, ""The export of your goods must be restricted until we are satisfied, and can obtain all that we want?"" These manufacturers are selfish, and so utterly blind to the interests of Australia as a whole as to ask the Government to restrict the export of coal in order that they may be able to carry on and export their own produce. It is pure selfishness. They ask for downright discrimination between two sections of the coor.munity. I hope that this motion will lead the Government to view this question from quite a new angle, and to realise that the voice of the manufacturers in Melbourne is not the voice of Australia.",31
105,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Kooyong) [4.45] - It is quite obvious that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Fleming) is not impressed with the gravity of the situation that confronts the industrial forces of this country. Our manufacturers have met and have stated definitely that unless they are supplied with coal it will be quite impossible for theTr - to continue their industries. As the result of the shutting down of these industries, thousands of employees will be thrown out of work, and they and their families will be left to starve. Can such a state of affairs be viewed with equanimity, knowing as The honwe do that enormous quantities of our coal are being exported to meet the coal shortage abroad, and really to enable foreign manufacturers to continue their operations? In other words, our own manufacturers are to be permitted to starve-thei r industries are to close down - in order that Australia may supply coal to manufacturers abroad, and so en* able foreigners to continue their work. My honourable friend (Mr Fleming) must know that the case cited this afternoon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) is but typical of many. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that unless the glass bottle industry, in - which'hundreds of men are employed, was able to obtain a supply of coal within the next two days it would have to. shut down, and that if the f u r naces were allowed to go> out a further delay of a month would be involved in re-starting the industry; meantime the men engaged in it would remain out of work. Is that a state of affairs that we could look upon with equanimity? Mr ""WATKINS -""Why not induce Government to lift the coal on the dyke ?",31
106,Sir ROBEET BEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Undoubtedly . It is a matter of increasing and regulating the output and utilizing, according to business methods, the coal - available. I do not know whether the Government are full y seized with the gravity of the situation. The Victorian Eailways Department .announces that unless it can obtain further reserves of coal the railways must close down. Our various gas companies are also complaining of the rapidly decreasing reserves. Is it to be seriously contended that these public utilities shall be mitted to close down, with disastrous results to the general public, merely in order that the requirements of the foreigner may receive consideration? Is the Australian workman to be starved to enable the foreign workman to live? If there is any question as to whether Australian or foreign requirements .are to be supplied, then undoubtedly the preference must be given to Australia. The evidence which has been given in regard to the coal shortage is most embarrassing. The conflict of testimony is surprising. One class of witness complains that there is a shortage of shipping, while another asserts that there is ample shipping available. One elass of witness declares that there has been a greater, and another that there has - been a. lower, output of coal than before the war. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) now tells us that Victoria received 85,000 tons of coal for the month of J u l y - a greater tonnage than we secured in previous months. He therefore contends that the situation is easy, and that Victoria has no right to complain.",32
107,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,I did not say that it had' no right to complain.,32
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Does my right honourable friend realise that owing to the shortage during previous months we had been brought to a state of desperation, and that the supply of S5,000 tons during July, which was by no means equal to our requirements, has permitted our industries only to carry on, so to speak, from hand to mouth? The position is .the same in South Australia, ""Western Australia, and Tasmania. Yet the honourable member for Robertson complains that we, who see these disasters imminent, the are taking steps to protect the industries of Australia before the foreigner is supplied.",32
109,Mr FLEMING,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,-At whose expense?,32
110,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I hope not at the expense of the miners or the mine owners. There are ample supplies, I believe, available for both the local and export trade; and this is a matter for the most rigid regulation and urgent attention. I am glad to hear that a Comptroller is to be appointed ; and he must be definitely and firmly instructed that Australian requirements cannot be neglected. We are told that there is peruo available berthage for Inter-State shipping, because foreign shipping occupies the room; but - I submit that in this regard also Australia is entitled to preference. I would not suggest for a moment that we should ruthlessly interfere with the export trade.",32
111,Mr FENTON,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,But Australia first!,32
112,Sir ROBERT BEST,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Undoubtedly , Australia first. I do not desire, nor is there any necessity for, injustice to be done to the mining industry or the owners; the interests of the employer and employed can be completely respected; but the position is so grave, with our in dustries and public utilities threatened, that we cannot regard it with equanimity. The immediate attention of the Government is called for to avert threatened disaster.",32
113,Mr GABB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,Angas) [4.52] - The* Treasurer seems to question whether there is such a shortage of coal in Sou bin Australia as has been stated.,32
114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"Indeed , I do not; I say that South Australia is now being treated better than any other State.",32
115,Mr GABB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"The honourable gentleman also questioned whether South Australia can use 60,000 tons a month; but I inform the honourable gentleman that so serious is the position regarded by the Premier of that State that be approached Mr John Gunn, the Leader of the Opposition, and asked him to any weight he might have in order to improve it . When we find the Premier doing this we may be assured that the position is serious, for otherwise the tendency in politics is not for one side to approach the other.. That action the Premier is one reason why this questralia tion has been raised here this afternoon. If South Australia received 60,000 last month, and is in such needy circapital; cumstances now, it . is only a proof i-h© had not previously received what her due. At the present time there a big market for Australian coal opening in Europe, and our fear is that this may manufactures. increase the shortage amongst ourselves. In the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard I readA report from our London office states: "" The decision of the British Government to limit the export of coal to 1,750,000 tons month has led to a surprising development the European trade. As a result of the quests for supplies, it has actually sible for Australia to undercut Great Britain in the European market."" There is evidently a big opening for tralian coal in Europe, and an equally big temptation offered to the owners of Australia. From what I of the colliery owners, and commercial men generally, they will not consider the interests of their fellow-countrymen and their own States, but first will coni sider their own pockets; and we are fectly justified in making the we do this afternoon. Even if it rect that about 10,000 tons are to be landed in South Australia days, it is information that we are to receive; but there are and probabilities of further trouble ahead people of Australia to unless the Government are prepared step in and see that not only South tralia-for I am not speaking parochial spirit, of which we have too much here-but Australia as a receives what coal we require. The Prime ^Minister (Mr Hughes) the other jjsaicl, in a letter to the Premier of South Australia, that it would "" be a to interfere with the overseas trade the circumstances."" Granted; would be a greater pity to with the efforts to build up industries in order 119. the Commonwealth. The Minister Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), speaking on the Tariff some time ago, told us that there was capita] waiting Mr Oabb. come to Australia for investment, and use the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) quite lately made a similar statement, while other speakers opposite have expressed the opinion that industrial unrest in Australia discourages the investment of capital. But if the impression gets of abroad that the manufacturers of Ausare in danger of being deprived of necessary coal, that also will have a detons terrent effect upon the investment of and great as may be the advanthat tages of being able to send the raw coal was .from Australia, greater advantages will is result from the establishment of industries here, and the export of the finished .The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) expressed the hope that if there are stocks of coal here the Government will use them.

116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,But not belonging to us. I have the figures here if the honAusorable member would like to hear them.,33
117,Mr GABB,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"I also have figures. This colliery afternoon I heard a Minister, whose name know I shall not mention, interject that it is an ""insurance"" to keep the coal where it is ; and the Prime Minister, a fortnight or three weeks ago, said, in regard to the same coal, that it was necessary to keep t in case of strikes and so forth. It seems perto me that the coal is being, kept to be request used as a lever to force the hands of the is corcoal-miners of Australia. If that be so, and the coal is being kept at the expense in a. few of the manufacturers and the workers of glad this country, I regard it as a very unwise possibilities step. The Government are asking the produce, proto duce, produce,"" but I do not see how the Auspeople can respond if coal is not made in a available. It sometimes seems to me that far there must be a fair number of Free whole Traders in the present Government. If coal is to be permitted to go to alien day peonies, while our own manufacturers are in dread of a famine, I can conceive none pity but believers in Free' Trade who would in advocate or support such a procedure. but it interfere Debate interrupted understanding for Later: when Sir JOSEPH COOK - I should like, by leave of the House, to make public to some information which has just reached me.

I have also ascertained that the statements which have been made here regarding our coal reserves in the Newcastle District are incorrect, and that the total amount of coal which the Commonwealth has there at the present moment is about 250,000 tons.

OATMEAL PRODUCTION.",35
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"On the 30th July the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following question:In view of' the fact that the managing director of Robert Harper and Company, in giving evidence before the Fair Profits Commission, as reported in yesterday's papers, states that it takes 120 bushels of oats to produce a ton of oatmeal, and as this varies from other sworn evidence given before the same Commission, will the Minister kindly inform the House-(o ) the average weight of oats to produce a ton of oatmeal to make a short ton of 2,000 lbs. weight; (6) the amount of oats to produce a long ton of 2,240 lbs.; (c) what is a fair price for gristing a short ton of oatmeal; (d) what is a fair price for gristing a long ton of oatmeal. I am now in a position to furnish the f o l lowing information: (a) and (6). On the average 120 bushels of field oats will produce a long ton (2,240 lbs.) oatmeal. That is, 120 'bushels is the basic weight, but the outturn naturally varies according to grade of sample. The quantity required to produce a short ton (2,000 lbs.) is proportionately less. (c) and {d). The actual cost of gristing cannot be stated. It depends on the ratio of the prime cost to sales, and is also governed by establishment charges. An average cost is probably not less than 22} per cent, on sales. NORTH - SOU TH RAILWAY .",35
126,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMENTARY TOUR OF TH E,"On 12th August, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Story) asked the Minister for Works and Railways whether he would furnish the House with a return showing the costs up to date of the various surveys undertaken by the Department of Works and Railwavs to determine the best route for the North-South railway from Pine Creek to the South Australian .border, including those, if any, now in progress. I am now able to furnish the following particulars:1. Inspections and surveys to determine' the best route for the North-South railway have been made at various times since the beginning of 1913 to the end of 1919; but none are in hand at present. 2. Trial and working surveys from Pine Creek to Katherine River (54 miles), and from Katherine River to Mataranka (65 miles), have 'been completed at a cost of £10,956. The section from Pine Creek to Katherine River has been built, and from Katherine River to Mataranka has been inspected and recommended 'by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. 3. From Mataranka to Daly Waters (95 miles) a trial survey has been made at a cost of £4,042. The whole of this distance (214 miles) is common to any route which may 'be decided on. 4. Inspections of the country have also been made(a) From the Pines, a point on the Trans-Australian railway to Coward .Springs, a station on the Oodnadatta line- a distance of 128 miles-and from Kingoonya, a station on the Trans-Australian railway, to Boorthanna, a station on the Oodnadatta line-i a distance of 176 miles-at a cost of £2,895.

Whether he is prepared to make'any statement to the House with regard to the reported startling change in the European situation, and the retort that the Prime Minister of Great Britain has said that "" he will not be stampeded into war by the alleged action of France in recognising General Wrangel's anti-Bolshevik Government in South Russia "" ? . 2. Whether, with a view to Australia having a more immediate and adequate voice in the direction of the Imperial Defence policy, the Government is prepared to advocate the following plan:- ((a) The formation of an Imperial Council of Defence consisting of representatives from the Parliament of the United Kingdom together with a representative from each of the self governing Dominions? (6) The representatives forming this Imperial Council of Defence to be members of Parliament who have been elected on the suffrage of the more popular House of the Parliament of which they are members; to be appointed by their respective .

129,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 5 . S ] move That this Bill he now read a second time. Honourable members will find that this measure is one for discussion in Committee rather than at the present stage. The Bill proposes a series of amendments in the conciliation and arbitration law, which the operation of that law has* shown to be needed, and of which I shall make a short general explanation. Section 4 of the principal Act contains a lengthy definition of the term "" indust r i a l matters,"" but this definition has been held not to cover disputes arising between unions as to the demarcation of the functions of their members, and it is proposed therefore to insert in the definition the words "" and any matter as to the demarcation of functions of any employees or classes of employees."" The disputes which these words will cover have arisen chiefly in the dockyards. The definition of "" lockout,"" which now - : includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees to accept any term or condition of employmentis to be widened by the insertion of the words and the total or partial refusal of employers, acting in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable. Similarly, the definition of "" strike,"" whichincludes the total or partial cessation of work by employees, acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employersis widened by the addition of the wordsPAPERS. and the total or partial refusal of employees, preacting in combination, to accept work, if the refusal is unreasonable.",36
130,Mr BEENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,That is the compulsory work clause; that is Lenin and 'Trotsky!,36
131,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; what is proposed is a fair arid reasonable extension of the definition of a strike. It is proposed to insert in the principal Act a section, 6A, which will impose a penalty upon any person or organization bound by an award of the Court or entitled to the benefit of such an award, who does anything in the nature of a lockout or strike, - I or continues a lockout or strike. Section 6 makes provision for penalties, but no proceeding can be taken under it unless leave is first obtained from the President. Section 9 is to be amended in order to protect employees from improper dismissal. At present an employer may not Jismiss an employee because the employee(a) is an officer or member of an organization, or of an association that has applied to be registered as an organiby zation; or (h) is entitled to the benefit of an industrial agreement or an award; or (c) has appeared as a witness, or has given any evidence, in a .proceeding under this Act. In 'Tasmania, a company was charged on information with having dismissed an employee by reason of the circumstance that he was a member of an organization, and the magistrate dismissed the information, declaring that, by the Act, the onus was cast on the defendant of proving that he was not actuated by the reason alleged, and that the director of the defendant company had sworn that he dismissed the employee because the latter was dissatisfied, and there was no reason to doubt that testimony. On appealtbe case is set out under the heading of Pearce v. Peacock, in 23, Gommonwealtli Law Re-ports, 199'-the e out of five Judges held that the finding of the magis< trate should be construed as a finding that the defendant was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge within section 9 of sub-section 4 of the Act, and that there was no ground for disturbing that finding. It is considered, therefore, that the section should be amended for the protection of employees by the addition of the wordsor (d) being a member of an organization which is seeking better industrial conditions, is dissatisfied with his conditions.",36
132,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Divin e discontent not be penalized.,37
133,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Provided , of course, that it is the discontent of a member an organization that is seeking to better its industrial conditions. Honourable members are aware that the business of the Court of Conciliation Arbitration, is congested. There are now ference. pending in the Arbitration Court thirty three Public Service cases, of which three are part heard, and eighteen other cases, submitted. of which two are part heard, or fifty-one cases altogether, and, in addition, four applications for compulsory conferences are awaiting consideration. amendment of the law made in 1918 power was given to appoint a President, and that appointment was made: but we now seek .the power to appoint as many Deputy Presidents as may be necessary to deal with the work of the Court. In addition, the pressure of business in .the Court will be relieved the provisions of another Bill , to which I can refer now only incidentally, which provides for the appointment of an A r b i trator to deal entirely with Public Service cases, leaving the President and his deputies to attend to the ordinary business of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Section 16A allows the President to summon any person to attend at a conference for preventing or settling an industrial dispute, but that conference must be presided over by him , and it is now proposed to add words to the section which will enable the conference to be presided over by any such person as the President may direct, and which will allow the summons to be either in writing signed by the President or by telegram sent by him.",37
134,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"""Will the President have power to appoint a State Judge?",37
135,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"If the President is of opinion that it is 'desirable to hold a compulsory conference in. Western Australia, he may direct'that a conference - be held in Perth before a. Judge, or some other person chosen by him. That amendment w i ll be of considerable advantage. At present, there is much trouble in the calling of a compulsory conference, owing to the fact that a summons has to be issued and delivered'. The amendment now proposed will give the President power to must summon a compulsory conference, by either forma l - summons or telegram. Honourable members arc aware that the advantage of many conferences results of from the fact of their being held speedily.",37
136,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,This amendment does not give power to the President's deputy and to summon persons to attend the con,37
137,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"It is not as if these were formal trials at which evidsnce wasThe conference is only a meeting of representative parties, and I do not think it will be necessary to givn the deputy power to summon. By an Section 19 of the Act specifies the classes of cases over which the Court has Deputy cognisance. Amongst them are(d) All industrial disputes as to which the President has held a conference under section 10A of this Act, and as to which no agreement has been reached, and which the President has thereupon referred to the Court. That provision is restrictive, and an amendment in clause 7 proposes to give the President jurisdiction, not only in cases in which a conference has been held, but also as to those disputes as to which a conference has been summoned.",37
138,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Once the President has summoned the conference, no one can challenge his jurisdiction.",38
139,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Once he has summoned a conference in connection with au industrial dispute, he will have jurisdiction in respect of that dispute. Section 2'1AA deals with applications which are made to the Hig h Court for declaration that a dispute exists, and provides that application may be made to the High Court to declare that a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State exists, and that the decision of the Justices on the question shall be final and conclusive. In the case of the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia versus Colonial Sugar Refining Company, it was held hy Justices Isaacs, Gavan D u f f y , and Rich "" that sub-section 4 of section 21AA only applies to a decision of a Justice sitting in chambers."" Wc are, by an amendment in clause S, extending sub-section 4 so that if the application happens to be made to a Justice in Court, his decision shall be equally conclusive and binding.",38
140,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Canno t the Arbitration Court be given the same power as is given to the High Court?,38
141,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"It has been held that the Arbitration Court is not a Court exercising judicial power. Section 24 provides that where there is a dispute before the Court, and the parties have come to an agreement to which the Judge has certified, the agreement shall be filed i u the office of the Registrarand unless otherwise ordered, and subject as may be. directed by the Court, shall, as. between the parties to the agreement, have the same effect as, and be deemed to be, an award. It is proposed to add at the end of that paragraph the words, "" for all purposes, including the purposes of section 38,"" the intention being to make it clear that the Court has power over an agreement to the same extent as over an award, so that it may deal with applications for variation or with any technical amendment that may be considered necessary during the currency of an agreement. Clause 10 contains a rather .important amendment to section 28, which provides thatThe award shall be framed in such manner as to best express the decision of the Court and to avoid unnecessary technicality, and shall, subject to any variation ordered by the Court, continue in force for a period, to be specified in the award, not exceeding five years from the date of the award. (2) After the expiration of the period so specified, the award shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, continue in force until a new award has been made. That section recently came under review by the High Court in two cases, but, unfortunately, the full text of the decision in one case is not available. In the case of the Federated Gas Employees Indust r i a l Unio n and the Metropolitan Gas Company Limited and others, as reported in Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 27, page 72, it wasHeld, by Barton, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, and Rich, JJ. (Higgins and Powers, JJ., dissenting), that where the. Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has, by an award made pursuant to section 24 (2) of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1004-1918, determined an industrial dispute, and has thereby specified a period during which the award is to continue in force, that Court has, within that period, no jurisdiction with regard to a new dispute as to a subject matter dealt with by that award, although the parties to the new dispute included many who were, not parties to the original dispute, and although the genuineness or reality of the new claim was not contested in view of the alleged increase in the cost of living.",38
142,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,That shows the conservative mind of some of the Judges.,38
143,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"That is hardly a fair statement. The duty of the Judges is to interpret the laws made by Parliament. This decision was not an attempt by the Judges to frame a law, but was an interpretation of the Act passed by this Parliament, and it is open to Parliament to amend or vary its legislation as it thinks fit. In the course of his judgment, Mr . Justice Powers saidThe action taken in the matter referred to may not have been authorized by the Act; but. if this Court holds that no new dispute about the minimum wage beyond the claim made when the plaint was filed can be dealt with by the Arbitration Court during the term of an award, the Arbitration Court, until Parliament sees lit to amend the Act, can only '.' fiddle while Rome is burning,"" and employees can only resort to strikes to enforce claims employers will not grant. Employees will not in these days try to live on less than what the Arbitration Court has fixed as a living wage. Such a result ought, I hold, to be avoided, unless the Court feels bound to adopt, as the only possible, reasonable construction of section 68, the construction contended for by the respondents. And Mr Justice Isaacs saidWithout venturing to intrude into a domain not belonging to us, we are impelled to observe that the preservation of the present general plan of section 28 is not inconsistent with a supplemental provision for emergencies that could not reasonably be contemplated, namely, a provision to the effect that, even during the specified period, the arbitration tribunal may, in the event of abnormal circumstances arising which disturb the fundamental justice of the award, have power to adjust conditions. The object of this legislation is to secure industrial peace and certainty of conditions for employers and employees, and also some definiteness in the settlement of disputes in the interests of the public. In its wisdom Parliament thought f it to enable the Court to specify the period during which an award should continue to have force, the reasons being that employers were entitled to know, with a reasonable amount of certainty, the duration of an award, that employees were entitled to have some security that the minimum wage applied to them would continue for a certain period, and that the public ought to be in a position to realise that a dispute once settled would be ended for a definite period.",38
144,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Is there power to make a variation retrospective?,39
145,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Some of the Justices considered that there should be some power to amend an award during the time for which an award stands, and the Government, realizing that there ought to be some elasticity in this regard, have proposed the following amendment:Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if the Court is satisfied \hat abnormal circumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award the Court may, in the same or another proceeding, set aside or vary any terms so affected. That amendment will bring the provision into line with the suggestion of Mr . Justice Isaacs.",39
146,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,There is no power to make an award retrospective.,39
147,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"No . Seeing that it is proposed to remove the congestion of business and - give the Court power to vary an award, the same reason does not exist for making awards retrospective as may formerly have existed when cases were held up for a long period. It is proposed to amend paragraph b of section 29 of the Act, which specifies the persons upon whom an award - of the Court is binding, by inserting the words "" o r notified "" after ""srummoned,"" thus making the paragraph more extensive in its operation.",39
148,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Will that have the effect of making an award a common rule?,39
149,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"No . The award will only be binding on parties who have been summoned or notified to appear. In the operation of the Act, section 37, dealing with power to issue orders to take evidence, has been found a little too rigid'. The President of the Court may issue an order to any person to take evidence on behalf of the Court in relation to any industrial dispute, but it has been suggested that the Judge ought to be empowered to confine the order to take evidence as to suchissues and subject to such limitations as he may direct; that is to say, to enable evidence to be taken, not only in regard to the whole issue, but also in regard to part. Provision is made in clause 12 to carry out this suggestion. . The last clause amends section 39, which deals with the powers which the Court may exercise on its own motion or on the application of parties. The section providesThe Court may exercise any of its powers on its own motion or on the application' of any party to the industrial dispute, or of any organization or person bound by the award of the Court, but no order or award shall be varied and no submission shall be re-opened It is proposed to alter "" submission"" to "" question,"" which is considered a more appropriate word to useexcept on the application of an organization or ii person affected or aggrieved by the order or award. In the administration of the Act it has been found that the public should also have a right to intervene. Therefore, it is proposed to give power to have awards varied or questions re-opened on the application of the Attorney-General. He is responsible to Parliament for the administration of the Act, and if he thinks it right and proper in the interests of securing industrial peace., which it is his duty to tain, to make an application for the variation of an award, this amendment will give* him. the power to submit an applicanot tion to th© Court with that end in view. On a further examination of the Act suggestions. it has been found that several other minor amendments are necessary. These have been circulated among honourable members, and I shall move to insert them when the Bill is in Committee. I ask honourable members to agree to the second reading at as early a stage as possible, because, as they can readily see, this is a measure which cau be more easily dealt with in Committee.",39
150,Mr EVAN,CONCILIATION AND,Has the President of the Arbitration Court been asked to make suggestions ?,40
151,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,The great majority of the amendments I am now proposing are made on suggestions of the President of the Arbitration Court.,40
152,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Is it proposed, to amend to make quite clear. the Act toi enable representatives of ployers and employees to sit on the Bench with the President of the Court?",40
153,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,No .,40
154,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Will the Government be prepared to accept an amendment to bring about that result ?,40
155,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,That is a matter which can. be dealt with at a later stage. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) would continue. adjourned. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the resumption of the debate 'be made ing reply: an Order of the Day for tomorrow.,40
156,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"West Sydney) [ 5 . 4 5 ] did not quite grasp, from the answer given by the Minister, that the President of the Arbitration Court had been asked cheese to make suggestions or whether he has end merely made suggestions from time to time.",40
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND, The question before Chair is the fixing of the date for the resumption of the debate.,40
158,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the question which I am speaking. If the Minister cannot supply the information I want belet fore the day mentioned in the motion, may wish to have the debate resumed a later sitting.",40
159,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The suggestions made Pool. were forwarded by the President of the Arbitration Court to the Department the Attorney-General, and many'of them have been embodied in the Bill .",40
160,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,H as the President been mainasked to make further suggestions ?,40
161,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"He has made suggestions, and they have been considered, but I am aware that be has been asked within the last few weeks to make any further Question resolved in the affirmative. BUTTER AGREEMENT BILL . SECOND READING .",40
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade aud Customs) [5.47] - I moveTliat this Bill be now read a second time. I wish to explain very briefly the circumstances which have led up to what is known as the Butter Agreement. The policy of the Government is to'get r i d of all extraneous forms of control of various products and resume normal conditions, - but we find ourselves unable to do so in regard to butter for reasons which I hope On the 9th Januemary, the - Government despatched to the British Government the following cablegram :My Government would greatly appreciate information as to whether His Majesty's Government propose 'to continue butter control for any period after expiration of existing contract with. Australia. If decided continue butter control, would you kindly give some indication as to probable time such control We sent a reminder at a later date, and on 29th January received the followWith reference to your telegram, 9th Janu- I ary, regret impossible to say at present whether His Majesty's Government will wish continue contract purchase Australian butter or after expiration of present contracts at of August next. Food Controller, however, inquires what prices producers would be prepared accept for next season's exportable surpluses in the event of His Majesty's Government deciding continne control these combeyond that date. Please telegraph the reply with least possible delay. The Government replied on 4th February, pointing out that it would take to some time to full y consult the producers and asking the Imperial Government to us have a reply as soon as possible as. I to whether they were in a position to tell at us the form, the Pool would take, or whether they proposed to continue the In the meantime steps were taken to call together the dairy producers of fro m all parts of the Commonwealth. A very representative gathering, which was elected by the proprietary as well as the co-operative section of the industry, finally met in Melbourne. I do not know whether the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) remembers that conference, but I think I may safely say that there must have been present from all parts of Australia some seventy or eighty gentlemen. Before the conference met,- we despatched the following cablegram to the British Government:Referring my telegrams 7th January, and 12th February, re butter, has been called for 9th March. Delegates attending from all parts Australia. Would be glad advice relative question"" further control of butter by British Government; the nature of such control, and its probable duration; also whether, in event of producers deciding - to sell, British Government prepared to enter into negotiations. A reply before 9th March would be greatly appreciated. A cablegram was received about that date from the British Government, in which it was saidNot possible at present .to reply, definitely regarding further contract, as question continuation of control here not yet definitely settled. Honourable members will see that we endeavoured to obtain from the British Government this information. It was recognised at this end that, if the British Government decided to continue the control, and to still, remain the sole importers of foreign butters, it would be necessary for us in some way or other to enter into negotiations with them for the sale of our surplus. The conference was held. I was in the chair, and made it perfectly plain to the representatives of the producers-bot h proprietary and co-operative-presen t that the decision arrived at, whatever it was, must be their decision. I pointed out that it was not a question of the Government deciding to. sell this produce. I put them in possession of all the information that I have given the House today. I read the cablegrams, and told them. I could not say at that moment what the British Government intended to do, b'ut that the Government would endeavour loyally to carry out their decision, whatever it might be. I said at this conferenceI am here to tell you, as the representative of the Government, that the decision which is to be made today is to be your decision. . . . I want to make it quite clear that it is you, gentlemen, who have got to Mr Greene. come to a decision, and, whatever may be mj own personal view on this matter, whatever may be the views of the Government on the matter, we will loyally carry out the decision that you come to.",40
163,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"That is to say, the butter producers were to fix the price of butter, and the Government would carry - out their determination?",41
164,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The conference had nothing tp do with the fixing of prices. The question before, it was whether or 4th not the sale of our surplus should be a conference made to Great Britain.",41
165,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,That surplus would be determined after local requirements had been satisfied.,41
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"It was simply a question of meeting the local requirements and exporting the surplus. I wish to make it quite clear that we left it entirely in the hands of the conference to say whether they would sell to the British Government of not. I saidNow, as to the terms of the contract, that is a matter which entirely rests with yourselves. We did not lay down any conditions. We said that it rested with the conference to do that. I went on to sayYou have got to remember that, if Great Britain continues the control, she may also continue the control of refrigerated tonnage. I need not quote further from my ' remarks on that occasion. I desire to give the House the terms of the resolutions which were passed at the Conferenceresolutions arrived at by men dealing with their own produce. The resolutions were1. That this conference of representatives of the dairying industry of the Commonwealth favours a return to pre-war conditions of marketing butter and cheese when the present contract with the Imperial Government terminates in August next, and that there be ""freedom from price fixation and all other Government restrictions. 2. (o) That this Inter-State conference be urged to request the Minister to inform the Imperial Government that the producers desire a free market. (6) That in the event of the Imperial Government deciding to retain control of the importation and sale of dairy produce in Great Britain after the completion of the present contract, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee be empowered to negotiate with and sell to the Imperial Government next season's surplus butter and cheese. Honourable members will note that they asked in the first place that the Government press for a free market, and that, secondly, they resolved that in the event of Great B r it a in refusing a free market the Commonwealth Dair y Produce Pool Committee be empowered to negotiate and sell. 3. Tliat when the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee ascertain what the nature or extent of-the control to be exercised by the Britisli Government is, they open up negotiations, acting in concert with our representatives, if any, which may be appointed in London, with the object of attaining the highest possible price for the surplus butter, and cheese of the Commonwealth. 4. That it be a recommendation to the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee that two representatives bo appointed to proceed to London at the earliest possible date. Then followed some other resolutions which have no direct bearing upon this matter. It was decided further7. That it be a recommendation to the Government in the event of our effecting a sale to the Imperial Government that the existing CommitteeThat is to say, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committeebe rc-appointcd for a further term of twelve months. 8. That in the event of a sale being effected, the Federal Government be asked to include in the functions of the Committee, powers which will enable it to continue to see that each factory placed its proper quota on the local market in order to fully supply the requirements of the Commonwealth. These are the resolutions which this representative body passed. Subsequent to the meeting of the Conference the f o l lowing cablegram, dated 23rd. March. 1920, was sent by us to the Secretary of State for the ColoniesAdverting to my telegrams, 5th March, and previous dates, representative Inter-State conference of dairymen has considered question of sale to the Britisli Government of surplus butter find cheese for further period of twelve months, and desires me to urge their wish for a free market. If, however, His Majesty's Oovernment decides necessary to continue control dairy products, will be much obliged for earliest possible information as to nature of control proposed to be exercised, and particularly if it would involve purchase by Britisli Government of foreign butter as heretofore. Jn that event producers willing to negotiate. We received rro reply to that telegram, and as time was going-on the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee, acting on the instructions which it had received from the Conference, decided to appoint two delegates to proceed to London for the purpose of interviewing the British Government. These delegates were to press first of all for a free market, and, if they could not obtain a free market, to enter into negotiations for the sale of the surplus butter and cheese of the Commonwealth.",41
167,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Did not the Government ask for a reply to that cablegram? It is rather extraordinary that a further reminder was not sent.,42
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not see a copy of any such reply among my notes. I asked to be supplied with copies of all cablegrams, and I cannot for the moment remember whether a rejily was or was not received. The important fact is that these delegates went to London. Whilst they were on the water the British Government announced that they had decided to decontrol cheese and to still continue the control of butter.",42
169,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,Did they .give the date on which the decontrol of cheese would come into operation?,42
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I can obtain that information for the honourable member. As a matter of fact, cheese is not controlled in Britain today, but butter continues to be controlled there. As the season was drawing to a close, and as these negotiations generally take some time, it was considered, advisable, whilst we were awaiting a reply, that two delegates should go to London, and they were accordingly despatched on their mission. Mr Hugh Sinclair, who represented Moreton in this House for many years, was on'e of those appointed by the Dairy Produce Pool Committee, , and Mr . Osborne, of the Western District Cooperative Association, was the other. We gave them letters in which we informed the British Government that 'they had been empowered by this representative Conference of dairymen to enter into negotiations with-the Home Government for the sale of their produce, and we also told them that, as far as practicable, in the event of a contract being entered into, the Australian Government would support their action.",42
171,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Then they are really delegates from the Government.,42
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I have been endeavouring to make it quite clear that they are not Government delegates in the ordinary acceptation of the term. They were authorized by the producers to negotiate on tlieir behalf.,42
173,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,And their expenses are being paid by the producers.,43
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,Yes .,43
175,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,But the Government gave them credentials.,43
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"We gave them the ordinary credentials which, in the circumstances, they were entitled to receive. I have here copies of all the cables which passed between the representatives - in England and the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee on whose behalf they were acting. The Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee was acting on behalf of the producers. I shall not read the whole of these messages since they are lengthy, but shall make a few extracts from them. The following message was received from the delegatesAccompanied by High Commissioner, interterviewed Minister. Bequest for free market refused. That is to say, they backed up the request we originally made to the Imperial Government on their behalf for a free market, and the Imperial Government refused it . The cable concludedGovernment having decided retain control till 31st March. That is the 31st March, 1921, and that answers the question put to me a little while ago by the honourable member for  23rd June, 1920, this cable was receivedAfter lengthy negotiations with Controller and Committee we obtained definite offer 240s. f.o.b. Delivered cool stores Australia until end March ninety grade one shilling point .up and down other details not arranged sameiebnditions as before. That is to say, the price of 90 points butter was to be 240s., with Is. up or down, as the case might be, as the butter graded under or over the 90 points, on the same conditions as to payments as in the previous contract, with 3s. additional for unsalted. The D a i r y Produce Pool Committee replied as follows:Accept 240s. basis 90 points f.o.b. Delivery Australian stores end of March prefer Is. 6d. on every 2s. per lib. up or down. Assume 3s. unsalted, and same conditions as before Committee leave details your hands confirm. The ""delegates replied as follows:Butter contract arranged £12 f.o.b. Australia cool stores until end March contract conditions same as before except storage average six weeks reserve our right to ship not exceeding 50 tons per month to South Africa. .That, I think, pretty well covers all that I need say as to the negotiations which took place. It will be noted that the British Government refused to decontrol butter. The London market is far and away the most important market for our surplus dairy products. In view of the fact that the British Government was still controlling refrigerated tonnage, it would have been a fatal mistake on our part not to have entered into some definite contract. I know, as a matter of fact, that B r it a in has bought in the bulk - in very much the same way, though not necessarily dealing in a direct manner with the producers-ver y large quantities, and I 'believe the price we are receiving on this occasion is on full parity with any other butter she is buying.",43
177,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"That has not been the case in the past, has it?",43
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,That has not been the case in the past.,43
179,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,Is B r it a in paying us the same as for New Zealand butter?,43
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The negotiations with New Zealand are not complete; but I think they will be very shortly. I understand that the basis with New Zealand is 2s. premium over the Australian price-242s . instead of 240s. per cwt. The information which I have received, through the courtesy of the D a i r y Pro. duce Pool Committee, from the delegates in England,goe^-.to.jshow that the difference between the price in England' and the Australian price is nearly 9d. per lb., which represents the cost of storage, shipping, and distribution, as between Australia and the consumer in England.",43
181,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,Do you say that the British people pay 9d. per lb. more than is paid here for butter for local consumption?,43
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"If the butter is at 24.0s., which represents the wholesale price, and is, I think, about 2s. l ^ d . per lb., the English price is in the vicinity of 3s.; that is the price of butter to the consumer in London today.",43
183,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,That is the fixed price?,43
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,That is the fixed price.,43
185,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"Did you notice in the press the other day that England was purchasing butter at 420s. per cwt.? - Mr MASSYGREENE - I do not think that is so. I can show the honourable member a good deal of correspondence of one sort and another, which, I feel sure, does not bear out that statement. Such may have appeared in the press; but I am confident, from the information I have from various sources, that this sale to the British Government is as close a parity as it is possible to get. The British authorities who dealt with the delegates considered them a "" p r e t t y hard n ut to crack,"" and those authorities are not sure they will be able to dispose of the butter at the price they are paying for it.",43
186,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,Hav e you any indication that the price of 240s. will be increased?,44
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I have no indication of that k in d ; all the information I have is that we have got the biggest price it is possible to get in the circumstancesthe biggest price we could expect.,44
188,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,What is the ' average wholesale price in the United States America ?,44
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I cannot say. all the infomnation I have, I believe that so. this sale is one really advantageous to the dairymen. What I wish to make quite clear, and to assure honourable bers of,, is that, in introducing this Bill , which is simply to support the contract and enable it to be carried out, the Government are endeavouring to give effect to the wishes of the dairymen so far as it ' is possible to do so. The Government have no particular desire in one direction or the other, but from my fair l y association with this industry over a long time, I believe, as I say, that the British market is far and away the most importburse ant one to Australia, and we cannot ford to play with it .",44
190,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Did Britain not get first lot of butter at about 175s. ?,44
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"Britai n got that ter cheaper than it ought to have got it ; at the same time, we were then the position that, unless we sold to Engdone. .land, we had not the ghost of a chance of shipping our surplus at all.",44
192,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,And Great took advantage of that fact!,44
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I would not say that for a moment. At that particular period in our history, with the shipping in position it was, unless we sold to Britain and got the priority of shipment gave lis, we had no earthly hope of getting r i d of our surplus stock.",44
194,Mr STEWART,CONCILIATION AND,And B rita in took advantage of the fact!,44
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I do not think the honourable member is justified in saying that.,44
196,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,Who made that sale at 175 s.?,44
197,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"It was effected by the Government, after consultation with the producers, and as a result of resolutions passed by them.",44
198,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,Can the Minister give the House any idea whether the British Government have taken control of Danish butter?,44
199,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The British Government are the sole importers of Danish butter into England; and the last purchase, c.i.f., was, I think I am right in saying, made at 249s.",44
200,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,What need would there be for this Bill if it were not for the fact of that a higher price could be got elsewhere ? Prom Mr MASSYGREENE - I do not think that is,44
201,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,Does it not look like it?,44
202,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"It looks as if memwe were going to be "" squeezed "" again.",44
203,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I do not think the honourable member is quite right in saying that. We have to finance this thing.,44
204,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,The Government?,44
205,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"Not the Government; but, somehow or other, the financintimate ing of the contract has to be arranged. There must be a buyer and a seller; somebody must receive the moneys and disthem; there must be a channel afthrough which the British Government can pay for the butter. It is to overcome the these legal difficulties, and to put things thoroughly in order, that we are bringing butin the Dair y Produce Pool Committee, and clothing it with power to carry out in the contract. That is all that is being",44
206,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The Bill says to the producer, "" You shall not export your butter Britain to any one else.""",44
207,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"Once having entered into a contract, we must fulfil it , and the only way we can fulfil it is by somethe how getting control of the produce which has been sold, and which forms the subshe ject of the contract itself.",44
208,Mr RIXBY,CONCILIATION AND,The Government have not entered into the contract?,45
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"No , we have not.",45
210,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,That is the whole point.,45
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"What the Government have done is to sanction this agreement which has been entered into, and now we ask the House to sanction it also.",45
212,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hav e the B r it i sh vernment any power to compel us to deliver the surplus butter to them, seeing they have decided they are going to control butter u n t i l March next year?",45
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The position, I take it , is, roughly, this: Supposing no contract was entered into.",45
214,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,What Would happen?,45
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The position would be that various people in Australia would send their butter to Great Britain , and the British Government would commandeer it at the border, at Avhatever the price happened to be at the time.",45
216,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,Then there is no use for the Bill .,45
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,There are two difficulties associated with that.,45
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Is this Bill to stop the producers sending the butter somewhere else, where they could get a better price?",45
219,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I do not say that at all.,45
220,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,It looks to me like it .  exactly the position.,45
221,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"All this Bill does, so far as I understand it , is to enable the contract which has been entered into on behalf of the producers, and by the producers themselves through their representatives, to be given effect to-it does that, and no more. In this connection I should like to Bead a telegram received from the Secretary of fitnte for the Colonies, on the 1st Julv. 1920Food Controller confirms contract signed Osborne and Sinclair on behalf Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool and requests Commona wealth Government take necessary steps to insure fulfilment contract. That is all that the Bill does.",45
222,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,"What quantity of butter will there be for local consumption, and what quantitv will be exported ?",45
223,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"To answer the question, I should have to know bow much rain is to f all , and how well the grass grow. The object of the Bill is to clothe the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee, in accordance with a resolution passed by the Committee, with full power to see that every factory puts on to the market the quota of butter necessary to maintain the local supplies, and I believe that that will meet the situaGotion. For all practical purposes, the in dustry will be conducted under normal conditions, except that, instead of the surplus butter being exported through various merchants, there will be a bulk sale of it .",45
224,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,W!h o compose the Committee?,45
225,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"The Committee has been in existence for three years, and operates under an Act of Parliament. I could not from memory tell the honourable member the names of those who compose it . They are mostly men elected by the various interests in the dairying industry, with three Government nominees. The deputy chairman is Mr Hugh Sinolair, .formerly the member for Moreton, and the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, Mr . O'Callaghan, is a member. The Minister for Trade and Customs is ex officio chairman, and I have had the honour to occupy that position from , I think, the beginning.",45
226,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,Are there any. middlemen on the Committee?,45
227,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"There are three or four middlemen, in the ordinary acceptais tion of the term.",45
228,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,There are representatives of co-operative societies-Messrs . Wilson and Osborne.,45
229,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"There are also representatives of the proprietary factories and of the co-operative factories. Every State is represented-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland by five representatives each, and South Australia and Tasmania by one each.",45
230,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Did the Minister say hy that the two gentlemen who proceeded to London, finding that they could not get free market there,- entered into a contract on behalf of the producers of Australia ?",45
231,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,Yes ; and that con. tract has been signed and sealed.,45
232,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND,"Sitting suspended from 6.26 to 8 p.m. Mr Charlton C « n t e r ) H r 8.0] The Bill before us is very small, but it will is very important, and one that concerns not only the butter producers in the Commonwealth, but Australia as a whole. - The measure provides for an agreement between the British Government and the Australian Butter Pool, and under its provisions, no butter will be exported after the agreement comes into operation without the approval of the Butter Pool. Every one admits that our surplus products should be disposed of in the most favourable markets, in order that our producers may obtain the best prices, and cidentally assist the Commonwealth. It is well known that we produce a considerable surplus of butter. I have before me a statement made in the Victorian Journal of Agriculture by Mr R Crowe in regard to this matter, in which he says that during the past season seven-eighths of our production was consumed locally: and, therefore, the quantity available for export, and coming under Commonwealth control, represents only one-eighth of the production. Knibbs' figures in regard to production show that, in the period from 1909 to 1913, ' the butter produced in Australia represented 945,014,305 lbs., valued at £47,742,910. The quantity consumed in Australia during that period was 557,408,071 lbs., valued at £28,160,720, leaving a surplus for the five years of 387,606,234 lbs. If we take the figures for the years 1914-15 to 1918-19- a further period of four years-it will be found that the quantity of butter produced in Australia was 896,413,192 lbs., valued at £58,733,739. Of that quantity we consumed in Australia 643,015,392 lbs., valued at £42,130,904, leaving 253,397,700 lbs. as a surplus. It will be seen from these figures that we produce a large surplus, and that it is necessary that provision should be made to market it under the most favourable circumstances. The question then arises as to whether the arrangement embodied in the Bill will do what it is intended; I am very doubtful. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) stated that a conference of butter producers was held recently, at which the question of the fixation of prices was discussed, and at which the representatives were of the opinion that the butter producers should have the freest possible market in disposing of the surplus quantity. That - was practically agreed to, were sent to Great Britain to enter into an arrangement with the British Government. We are now being asked to sanction an agreement providing for the sale of butter at240s. per cwt. f.o.b., which works out at approximately 2s. 1.6d. per lb. During recent years I have a vivid recollection of different Boards fixing the prices of certain commodities produced in this country. In connection with wool, a committee was appointed to deal with in- that product, and we have ascertained recently that some have made a tremendous profit as a result of the price at which the wool was sold when that profit should have gone to the Australian producer.",45
233,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Exactly the same thing occurred in regard to a previous sale of butter.,46
234,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes ; and in connection with wheat we find the same thing prevailing. Boards have fixed the price of wheat, and after it has been exported it has been sold at practically double the price at which it was sold by the producer, thus enabling others to reap the benefit from fixed prices. In view of these instances, which have occurred quite recently, it seems strange at this juncture, when there is a scarcity of commodities in other parts of the world, that we should be asked to sanction an agreement which may be the means of depriving the producer of that profit to which he is justly entitled. The future price of butter will depend largely upon the conditions abroad. In Europe today the situation is bad enough; and in view of what is transpiring, always allowing for the intervention of bad seasons, it is more than likely that butter will he at a very high price for a considerable time to come. If we enter into the agreement contained in the Bill, and fix a price of 2s. Id. per lb., it is quite probable that within a very short time the retail price of butter will'be in the vicinity of 3s. or 3s. 6d. per lb.",46
235,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,It is the producers who have made this sale to the British Government.,46
236,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , and I am at a loss to understand why.",46
237,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member suggest they do not know and delegates their own business?,46
238,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not saying that, t u t merely expressing an. opinion. In view of what has happened here, there is a good deal to be said in support nf my contention. We have made mistakes, and it is possible that we are »n the verge of committing another. At the conference of butter producers, to which I have referred, the representatives asked to have the fullest freedom in. regard to marketing. What will be the position if butter is fixed at 2s. I d . per lb., and there is a better market in , say, South Africa?",47
239,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I omitted to say that, under the terms of the. contract, the producers will have the opportunity of meeting the normal trade of the Commonwealth, and in other centres, including 500 tons, I believe, for South A f r i c a .",47
240,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"The Minister for Trade and Customs now says that he omitted to place certain facts before the House, and that certain, latitude is to be allowed. If the producers are to have freedom, they should not be tied at ail, and should be allowed to take the fullest advantage of any market abroad. It may be said that the price arranged is a good price, because it is practically the same as they would be receiving in Australia. To-day the producer is obtaining 2s. per lb., or perhaps a little less, and the price embodied in the agreement is slightly higher. But we know that in the event of a drought intervening, and during the winter months, the supply wonld be reduced, with the result that prices would rise. Before we export any surplus, we should make sure that our own. people obtain the commodity at a. reasonable price",47
241,Mr LISTER,CONCILIATION AND,What of coal ?,47
242,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"That is exactly what we are doing today, as our coal is being sold at such a reasonable price that we can send it to the Baltic and elsewhere at a cheaper price than British coal can be supplied.",47
243,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member advocate an embargo?,47
244,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I have never said one word about an embargo on the export of butter. In connection with all our products, we should allow the people of the Commonwealth to obtain them at a fair and reasonable price; but hy that I do not suggest that we should rob the producer; he should receive a fair price for the work he performs. Mr RICHAR D POSTER - Is not the world's parity a fair price?",47
245,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"We do not know what the world's parity may be next . week. We may enter into an agreement to sell butter at 2s. I d . per lb., but in a month's time it may be worth 2s. 6d.",47
246,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,The experts take all such possibilities into consideration.,47
247,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I am quite aware of that. In connection with our wheat and wool, the experts thought that the price decided upon was a reasonable one; but we ascertained later that it was about one-half of the proper price, and that others derived the benefit.",47
248,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,But we arc now getting back to normal conditions.,47
249,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Then , if such is the case, why do not we give the producer freedom to market? Why is there any necessity for passing legislation of this character ?",47
250,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"The producers, through their representatives, have asked for it .",47
251,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I am merely expressing my opinion, and I represent as many dairy farmers as any honourable member in this House. I have to answer to them.",47
252,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,The B r it is h Government does not give a free market.,47
253,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"E x a c t l y . I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether there was anything to permit the B r it i sh Government to interfere in regard to sales, and he replied in the negative",47
254,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I did not think I had said that.,47
255,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,I asked if there was any power in existence which compelled us to sell the butter to the British Government,47
256,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"No- ; I said the British Government could commandeer the butter at a fixed price. Mr Charlton . ' - I do not think the British Government would commandeer any commodity without giving a price equivalent to that which could be obtained elsewhere. Therefore, it is all the more necessary that this should be an open question.",47
257,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,They are the sole importers of butter to England today.,48
258,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,I admit that ; but that fact does not give them power to compel us to sell butter to them.,48
259,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,Where could sell it?,48
260,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Whereve r we can. If the markets in Great Britain were advance 6d. per l b . within the next twoor three months, and we had freedom to sell at London parity, our producers would get 3d. or 4d. per lb. more. We market, cannot tell what may happen.",48
261,Mr HILL,CONCILIATION AND,O u r market is limited. The people who would buy and pay prices have neither cash nor credit.,48
262,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"That is my argument. We should broaden this transaction, and* have the utmost freedom in the sale of our produce. We are no longer at war; we want tb get back to normal conditions. The producers at their conference said that they wanted a free market; now we are legislating to compel them to sell at a fixed price, whereas with in the next two or three months butter may be worth 3s. per l b . , and somebody other than the producer will be getting the increase. There is not much prospect of butter being cheaper Europe than it is today; the tendency is rather for the price to increase. Theretrolled fore, I do not see why we should be lating to restrict t i e market for the organization. butter producers. They ought to have the widest possible field, and get the price offering.",48
263,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,Does not this B merely endorse the agreement made by the representatives of the producers?,48
264,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I have admitted that the representatives of the producers the world. have agreed to this arrangement, and that the Government are introducing this Bill merely to give effect to it ; but I ment? do not think it is in the best interests of the producers, and if the price butter abroad does rise, and middlemen are making a profit at the expense producers, I desire to be able to turn up my speech in Hansard, and show to my constituents that I made my protest ratified ? against this arrangement. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Suppos e price of butter falls.",48
265,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"We must take the risk, but the tendency is for the price increase. European countries are not recovering from the war as rapidly as Australia is doing; their conditions are still very much disturbed.

266,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,Who will handle to the butter if the Pool does not?,48
267,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,I do not argue that the Pool should not handle it ; but the Pool should have access to the open so that it can sell the commodity for whatever price is offering.,48
268,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,The controllers of high the Pool asked for this Bill .,48

282,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,The trouble will be that there will be no legal body to deal with the butter unless we give the some power and control.,49
283,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"We can always find a purchaser for an article that is in demand. Without this agreement we should have an open market, and the utculty, most freedom to dispose of our product wherever it was required. The mere fact that the representatives of the producers to have entered into an agreement is not itself a reason why we should accept this legislation.

293,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think that The price is largely determined by the seasons. Reverting to the exportable surplus, I hope that the Government will see that an artificial scarcity in the local market is not created for the purpose of keeping up the price. We know that in the past large say quantities of beef, mutton, butter, and commodities were kept in cold storage until the prices rose ver'v high. There no justification for storing the butter for export and compelling the local conProvision ought to be made for the requirements of per Australia to be met before any large quantity of butter is placed in the cold stores.

313,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I would fix it at a price which would give a reasonable return to the producer. I have always recognised the producers as representing the backbone of the country. the disabilities under which they labour, and I desire that they should' be given an adequate return for all that they produce. .

It is necessary to give the agreement which has been entered into legislative authority, so that it may be properly carried out, and our butter producers may obtain the price of 240s. per cwt., secured by Messrs Sinclair and Osborne, who I am sure made the best contract that it was possible to make at the time the agreement was entered into.",51
315,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,What is the agreement?,51
316,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,It is an agreement by which we are to receive 240s: per cwt. for our butter.,51
317,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,More than that.,51
318,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"More , if the butter is of a higher quality than the average, and less ifj! it is a lower quality. This contract .was entered into to extend from 1st August to 31st March, and, as I understand the matter, the Bill will be operative only during that period.",51
319,Mr GREENE,CONCILIATION AND,That is so.,51
320,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,I look upon the Bill a measure to enable the butter producers to carry out the contract that was entered into. It is quite .possible that a better price than 240s. per cwt. will be received for butter.,51
321,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,Is that why this Bill is necessary ?,51
322,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"There might be something in that. I am inclined to think that a higher price than 240s. will be offered for our butter, and I have sufficient faith in the Imperial Government to believe that if it is offered we shall get that higher price. As a matter of fact, negotiations are in progress at the present time to secure a higher price. W h i k t the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . honourable Greene) was speaking, I interjected to remind him that butter was bringing as high a price as 420s. at Home.

327,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"I know that the price is to be 240s. per cwt. I think that the Minister read sufficient of the agreement to let us know what the position of our dairymen will be. He also said that the price for New Zealand butter has not yet been fixed. I think that he made a mistake there, because we were led to believe that New Zealand butter would be placed' oh the London market through co-operative companies in the Old Country.",51
328,Mr GREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I was speaking, only yesterday in my office, to three men, one of whom is closely associated with the Government Department which deals with the matter, and they told me that the contract was not completed and that the New Zealand Government was negotiating with the Imperial Government on the same basis as our contract with a premium of 2s.",51
329,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"I have no doubt that if the New Zealand producers get a premium of 2s. on our price, the Australian as producers will be given the same advantage.",51
330,Mr GREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"It has always been the practice, though I do not know why, to give New Zealand a slight premium over Australia, because in pre-war days, New Zealand butter always secured a small premium over Australian butter. Butler Agreement [IS AUGUST, 1920.]",51
331,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"I was very agreeably surprised to find the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) taking such a keen interest in the primary producer, and to find that be was being followed by many other honourable members on the opposite side. When I entered this House eighteen months ago, I was surprised to find how little interest honourable members opposite took in the primary producer. Since the establishment of the Country party, it seems to me that honourable members on both sides are anxious to consider the interests of the primary producer, and I hope that he is .coining into his own, as a result of the in-flvjence of the little party that is now established on the cross benches. JThe dairying industry is one which deserves very great consideration. worth something like £19,000,000 per year, and I regret to say that it is absolutely going backwards notwithstanding the fact that prices are going up. To-day in Australia we have 200,000 dairy cows less than we had in 1913, and that, notwithstanding the fact that 'the numbers of other cattle have increased. This shows that the dairyman is going out of business, and it will be an unfortunate thing for this country if he does. Let me inform honourable members of what has happened as the result of the last sale of butter effected, not by the representatives of the dairymen, but by the Government.",52
332,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,B y the Prime Minister.,52
333,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member suggests that the sale was effected by the Prime Minister. That sale was effected at 175s. per cwt. at a time when the British Government were paying 300s. per cwt. for butter. We sold our second-grade butter, not fit for consumption in Australia, to the East at 205s. per cwt.",52

335,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"I will ay that it was not good enough for Australians, and that will qualify my statement sufficiently. The price at which the sale was effected was 175s. per cwt., and we got 243s. per, cwt. from South Africa. That is the treatment the dairymen received in connection with the last sale of Australian butter. Bill. 3609",52
336,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,"At that time 175s. per cwt. was regarded in Queensland as a good price, considering the difficulties of shipping.",52
337,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"That may be so; but we shipped to Africa for 243s. per cwt., and to the East for 205s. per cwt.",52
338,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,I know that the Queensland producers were satisfied that it was a good price.,52
339,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"Our producers have themselves effected the last sale, and they had sufficient common sense to make a contract covering a short period. It terminates on 31st March next, and is for only one season's butter. Dairymen are out to get the advantage of the open market at the earliest possible moment. If I thought that the open market was availI t is able to them now I would not be supporting this contract. When I find that the Imperial Government arc controlling the butter trade in the Old Country I know that all that we can possibly do is to effect a sale to them upon the best conditions possible.",52

344,Mr RIEEY,CONCILIATION AND,Dalget y and Company will make a nice thing out of it.,52
345,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"Dalget y and Company are not in this contract. The butter was sold by Messrs. Sinclair and Osborne as representing the producers who met in conference in Melbourne. If we fixed the price of butter at as low a price as that fixed by the Imperial Government when s the previous sale was effected, the result would be that the condensed-milk factories in Australia would be able to pay a higher price for milk than the butter factories could pay. In my own district one milkcondensing factory belonging to the Nestles Company are paying a higher price for milk than the butter companies can pay.",52

The position is ' that the butter factories will be wiped, out of existence if that kind of thing continues, and if the butter factories go, orable members have to recognise what will go with them. If whole milk is sold, and no skim milk is kept, there will be no calves reared in the districts in which this takes place. My own electorate is probably one of the best butter districts in Australia.",53

348,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,In Victoria.,53
349,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"It is a fact that it is one of the best dairying districts, not only in Victoria, but in Australia. If a low price is paid for butter, men engaged in dairying will be induced to sell their milk to the milk-condensing factories, and there will be no young stock reared in this country. That will be a calamity to the cattle-rearing industry in Australia.",53
350,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Me n cannot go on selling milk if they do not rear calves.,53
351,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"I have indicated what is happening today in the dairying industry. If the price of butter goes up, it will be better for the dairying industry, and generally for those engaged in rearing cattle. Warmambool some time ago was one of the best pig markets in Victoria; but today, since Nestles have become established there, it has become a district in which the milk produced is used in the whole state for the production of condensed milk, and there are practically no pigs sent now to the Warmambool market. Colac is the centre of a butter-producing district. There is no condensed milk manufactured there, and they have in consequence a very large pig marketabout 600 pigs per week. We shall have no young stock and no bacon if low prices are obtained for butter, and milk is sent in the whole state to the condensed-milk factories. I support the Bill because I feel that it is necessary to enable us to carry out the contract we have entered into. It was a good contract, entered into by men of ability anxious to conserve the best interests of the producers of Australia.",53
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I can show the honourable member the contract.,53
353,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Maribyrnong) [8.45]. - It would be well for the Minister to acquaint the House with the particulars of the contract, because very often the lack of information retards the passage of legislation. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) and quite a number of others have asked whether a honcontract has been effected between the representatives of the dairymen of Australia and the British Government; and when this Parliament is called upon to endorse such a contract by the passage of legislation it ought to have the fullest possible light on the subject. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that many dairymen are dissatisfied. I shall quote from the London letter of the Pastoral Review, which cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed a Labour paper, some remarks by Sir Thomas Mackenzie, the High Commissioner for New Zealand, whom any one who has studied his movements on the other side of the world will recognise as a valiant fighter for the interests of the Dominion he represents. It is an indictment against the British Government in relation to its handling of the commodity with which we are dealing to-night, and reads as follows:Sir Thomas Mackenzie, High Commissioner for New Zealand, speaking last month on the subject of Government purchase of overseas butter, made a strong indictment of the Government's Empire policy, and his utterance has attracted widespread attention. He said that with regard to butter, New Zealanders were threatened wit h expulsion from this market unless they accepted the price the Government chose to give them. Surely a young country like New Zealand, which had been loyal throughout the war, should be put on an equal footing, at any rate, with Ireland. The Irish people could .sell their butter at 5s. per lb., and the highest price offered to New Zealand was Is. 7Jd. He ventured to think that with the assistance of the Colonial Office no such injustice would be done to us as a refusal of the free market in Great Britain. Apparently the British Government are prepared to allow producers within their own boundaries the privilege of selling butter at 5s. per lb. There is some doubt about the price New Zealand is likely to receive for her butter.",53
354,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,Ne w Zealand has not yet sold her butter.,53
355,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"It is a questionable point; but here is a paragraph in the London letter of the Pastoral Review which throws a little light on the subject :I understand that the Ministry of Food have decided to offer for New Zealand butter prices similar to those now being paid for the Danish article, and negotiations are at present proceeding with the shippers' representatives - here. Mv. GREENE - On e price is c i . f . the other is f.o.b.",53
356,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"If the Minister is referring to Danish butter, he knows very well that the e.i.f. cost ""of shipping butter from Denmark to Great B ritain is a mere bagatelle.",54
357,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,The price would come out a£ practically the same as is to be paid for Australian butter.,54
358,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think so. ' The great Danish co-operative companies fix their own price for butter sold in Great B r it a in ; 'and, as the expense'of consigning the commodity from the one country to the other is, as I say, a mere bagatelle, making all allowance for c.i.f. costs, I think I am safe in saying that New Zealand will receive 247s. per cwt. for her butter as against 240s. per cwt. which is to be paid for Australian butter.",54
359,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member wish to make Australian dairymen dissatisfied with the sale made by themselves ?,54
360,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"H as the honourable member, who is a shareholder, and very likely a director, of a co-operative company, ever attended a meeting of a cooperative dairy company which has been absolutely unanimous in regard to a step taken by its directors?",54
361,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I have attended such a meeting. ' Mr Fenton - Then the meeting must have been held in the off-3eason. We rarely find producers satisfied with action taken on their behalf. Were the farmers satisfied with the manner in which their wheat was handled during the war? When the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) was speaking, the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) interjected that it was costing some dairy farmers practically 4s. per lb. to produce butter which was sold, at about 2s. 2d. per lb. wholesa^. Of course, it is quite apparent to all that it costs the clairy farmer more to produce 1 lb. of butter during the winter than it does during the soring; when there is a plentiful supnlv of fodder and the cows have a go""d flow of milk', b "" t all the year round, taking one season with another, the cost of producing 1 lb. of butter ' does not amount to 4s. The Labour party would give to all producers a fair and reasonable return and for the labour they are called upon to perform. We believe in giving a fair deal all round, not only to the men in the unions, but also to the producers.",54
362,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honourable member give the producer the world's parity ?,54
363,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,If I had asked the honourable member to accept the world's parity a few years ago he would have looked at me in amazement. In past years the dairymen of Australia have received more for their butter sold in Australia than they secured in London.,54
364,Mr ROBERT COOK,CONCILIATION AND,That is not so.,54
365,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Yea r in and year out, a few years ago, the average price paid for butter on the London market was below the price paid by Australian consumers. I can produce official figures to bear out what I am saying. I would go further than some honourable members of the Country party are prepared to go. I would advocate that when there is a big supply of wheat all the world over, the wheat producer here should be entitled to a fair and reasonable return for the produce he has to sell in Australia.",54
366,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member means nothing by that.,54
367,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do mean what I say. If I ask for a fair clay's pay for the man in the shop, I am also prepared to ask for fair conditions for the proprietary farmer and .the men working on farms. It is the policy of the Labour party to deal fairly and squarely with men who are subjected to undue competition in the markets of the world, but at the same time. I demand for Australian workmen the conditions I am prepared to accord to the Australian producers.",54
368,Mr GIBSON,CONCILIATION AND,"Unde r the last contract we received 177s. per cwt. for butter for local consumption, while we were getting",54
369,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member is picking out the war period. Would any reasonable-minded man fake the five war years, as representing normal conditions, on which to fix his business arrangements for the next ten years? We can produce butter as good as that produced in any other part of the world. Our average quality may not be quite as good as that of New Zealand, but for our best butter we should not be content to accept less by 7s. per cwt. than New Zealand secures. The High Commissioner for New Zealand, Sir Thomas Mackenzie, has put up such a good fight for New Zealand producers that if they do not obtain the Danish price for their butter they will at least"" get very close to it. Are the producers of Australia content to accept, in respect of their surplus butter, 7s. per cwt. less than is obtained by New Zealand? I am putting forward figures to which no exception can be taken. I do not hesitate to say that the Danes will receive about 247s. per cwt. net for their butter. It is stated that New Zealand producers are likely to get something like the same price. If that be so, the Australian butter producers, notwithstanding that some of their own representatives have arranged this contract, will receive under it 7s. per cwt. less than their brothers in New Zealand. I say to every producer, "" Get the best price you can for your products in every other part of the world, and we will deal reasonably with you in your own country.""",54
370,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,"Lilley) [9.3] - I am pleased that honourable members of the Labour party are taking a keen interest in these proceedings. I would point out to them that this Bill is not designed to ratify any agreement made in regard to the sale of our surplus butter; it is merely to give assistance in the carrying out of an agreement - made with the British Government by representatives of the dairymen, of' the Commonwealth. It is abundantly clear to me that the two gentlemen who entered into the contract went to London with full authority to act for the dairymen of the Commonwealth, and the contract entered into by them, is, I think, giving general satisfaction.  those delegates?",55
371,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,They were elected after consultation with the various cooperative butter companies throughout the States ,55
372,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"""Were there no produce agents represented on the committee which elected them?",55
373,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think so. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has found fault with the nature of this contract, and has urged that there should have been an open market. I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what would have happened if there had been an open mar- ket. Quite a number of speculators would have bought up our butter, exported it to various parts of the world, and so have obtained the profits which, under this agreement, will go to the dairymen themselves. The contract has been well advised, and the Government, in bringing forward this small measure to assist in giving effect to it, are certainly doing a great deal to insure that the whole of the bu'tter purchased by Great Britain shall be delivered. No one can say that, having regard to the conditions under which our dairymen work, the price of butter is too high. We have periodic droughts throughout the States. In Queensland, for instance, every third year is a dry one. I well remember the last drought, when the farmers had to spend the little they had in purchasing fodder to keep their cattle alive. We have been told time after time, of the long hours worked by dairymen-w e have been told that they and their families are practically the slaves of the industry-and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) was not far wide of the mark when he said that if the dairymen were to receive fair payment for the hours-worked by them, then 4s. per lb. would not be too much to pay for butter. It is the one industry in Australia in which fair working conditions are not insisted upon. It is unreasonable to expect dairymen to work long hours, and to contend with droughts and the various pests which affect their herds, without receiving anything like a fair return for the work they do. I do not anticipate that this measure will occupy the attention of the House for any time. It is to my mind very important that it should be passed without delay in order that effect may be given to the agreement that has been made with the British Government by the representatives of the industry.",55
374,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,Why not come up to the collar; and admit that this is really a Bill to prohibit the export of butter?,55
375,Mr MACKAY,CONCILIATION AND,It . is a Bill to assist the carrying out of the contract entered into by the representatives of the dairying industry and nothing further.,55
376,Mr ROBERT COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Indi ) [8.7] I have every confidence in the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), who is in charge of this Bill , so his treatment of the dairymen of Austhan tralia is concerned. He has had personal fortunate farmer experience in the dairying industry, and 1I have carefully watched his career ing the last few years. I have been on many conferences with him, and he has always endeavoured, in my opinion, to give a square deal, not only to the dairymen, but to the community as a whole. That, I believe, is his desire i this instance. The remarks made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charli ton) can not be taken very seriously, since he fold us that he was really makselling ing a little electioneering address, and thab he wanted a few "" p u l l s "" of his speech to circulate amongst the dairyleave Australia. men. I would advise him to keep the report of his speech out of the hands of the coal miners. It cannot be denied duce? that dairying is hard work, involving long hours, and that in the past but little pay has attached to it . There plenty of overtime worked in the industry, but there is no pay for that overtime. I am pleased that a contract has been made for the sale of our surplus butter at a price which I consider to be only reasonable. We have recently settled quit© a number of our returned soldiers on small holdings, and their cipal output for some considerable' time will be dairy produce. They are paying up to £ 2 5 per head for their dairy cows, thus to bring down prices. and, having iegard to their interest charges and other costs, their efforts w be attended with absolute failure if they do not receive something like a reasonter, able price for their dairy produce. As the cost of production, if the dairymen and their wives and children employed in the industry received Wages Board rates of pay I believe that, as the honi orable miember for Echuca (Mr H i l has said, it would be impossible to sell butter at less than 4s. per lb. that the dairymen have slaved long enough to provide cheap butter and other produce for the masses. The producers have at last been aroused. They have awakened to the fact that all other dustries have organized, and they give themselves them credit for their organization. while others have been uniting to secure better results for their labour, the ducers have been supporting first one side and then the other-the y have been driven from pillar. to post-and it was far as due in the end to compulsion, rather choice, that they organized. The unwill now be able to obtain reasonable treatment - He asks durfor nothing more. The price to be paid for our surplus butter under the contract is considered to be very high by some people, who fear that they will have to pay a corresponding price for butter for local consumption. M v contention is that n the dairying community is entitled to the world's parity for its produce. We do not ask for any favour; we ask only for that which is absolutely fair. Those engaged n manufacturing and other industries feel that they are perfectly justified in their labour to the highest bidder. If trade unionists could do better in some other country they would not hesitate to Why , then, should there be any objection to dairymen obtaining the world's parity for their proEarlier in the day the House engaged is in a debate on the coal shortage, and it was urged that an embargo should be placed on the export of coal. If that suggestion be adopted we shall next have a move to place an embargo on the export of wool, wheat, and butter. It has been said that there is full and plenty for all who will work and produce, and those who think that prices are too high should be prinreminded that the country is wide, and that there is plenty of room for them to aprjl - their energies to production, and When the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) ill was Minister for Trade and Customs he placed an embargo on the export of butand in that way did more harm to to the dairying industry than any good he is ever likely to do. The only result of his action was that many of the dairy farmers, losing faith in the industry, gave t up, and the price of butter increased. l ) The ""more the producer is penalized in that way the more the community will We feel have to pay. This contract .is fairl y open. Under it we shall have the right to send 50 tons of butter per week to South A f r i c a . That is a reasonable allowance. .The delegates in - who were selected by the dairymen to proceed to England, But pleaded for an open market and the abolition of price-fixing; but we could pronot get the open market, because the Imperial Government have control of the shipping, and could take the butter at their own price. I venture to predict, however, that the Imperial Government have given our delegates the price they would previously have taken, and probably a little more, and that within the next few weeks we may even get an in creased price. Primary producers generally do not require any ""spoon-feeding,"" but they do ask for the world's parity and an open market. As to the butter previously sold at 175s. the producers did not definitely fix that figure; they asked something slightly over, bu t the Prime M i nister (Mr Hughes) sold it at that price to the Imperial Government. That contract was certainly considerably under the world's parity, but the Imperial Government was good enough to give us half the profits on the butter exported, amounting to something like £600,000. In regard to the present contract the dairymen held a Conference composed of representatives from all parts of Australia, and representing both proprietary and co-opera tive industries. From every place where dairying was carried on, and there was any organization, a representative was asked to attend; and, representing the industry to the extent we do, and having had the privilege and honour of appointing our own delegates to send Home, we feel that the bargain made is one that all interested should be satisfied with. This Bill is simply to give statutory power to the Butter Pool to deliver the goods, and I trust it will receive the support of the House, and be disposed of within a very short time.",56
377,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"West Sydney) [ 9 . 2 0 ] We have the interesting spectacle this evening of our honourable friends in the Government corner, who claim to represent country interests, joining with other honourable members opposite, who represent, amongst other interests, those of the middlemen, in support of a measure, i which I may say at the outset, is not properly described in the title. described as the "" Butter Agreement Act of 1920,"" a euphemistic name, but really it is a measure to empower the Minister for Trade and Customs to prohibit the export of butter except under certain conditions. The Bill is to Minister a power he does not already possess under the Customs Act , and is special measure, the effect not be to increase the price received by the producers for their product from August u n t i l March next. In fact, it will be generally admitted that the only purpose that the measure can have is to reduce the price-to keep the price as low as it is fixed in this alleged agreement. I make no apology for addressing the House in the interests of the primary producers, because the platform of the Labour party is framed in the interests of the primary producers and of the consumers of Australia. As I have pointed out before here, the Labour party is the only party that can point to its platform and its programme as standing for the interests of the toilers, whether on the land or in the secondary industries. Every opportunity should be taken on the floor of the House to point out that fact, and to draw attention to those combinations between the middlemen and the alleged producers' representatives, of whom we complain. On this side of the House we have honourable members representing primary producing constituencies, and sent here by primary producers. Amongst these are the hon Moloney), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), the honourable member for Calare (Mr Lavelle), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr . Cunningham), the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine), and others. These honourable members, would not be here unless they had been sent by the votes of the primary producers of the country; and they -- have the advantage that they can command the support of the representatives of such constituencies as Melbourne Ports, Port Adelaide, and West Sydney, with the waterside workers, there and all - around the coast, who are pledged and bound by the same platform and programme. This party can rely on the support of the miners of Kalgoorlie, Broken It is Hill , and Charters Towers, and the shearers and shed hands of the Parl^ng and other places; and we can call this army into the support of the primary producers.",57

We find, however, that the only reference to an agreement is in the title of the Bill, the rest of the measure dealing with the power to prohibit export. First of all, I emphasize the point that this Bill is not to ratify any agreement, and does not purport to ratify any agreement; indeed, we do not know what the agreement is.  know.",58
382,Mr GREENE,CONCILIATION AND,I have told honourable members the whole of the terms of the agreement.,58
383,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"In a somewhat fragmentary waySome light, however, has been shed on the subject by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), who was able to mention 240s. as the price, though he said negotiations are now on foot to have it increased. Other honourable members, as well as myself, have had experience of ""agreements"" made in regard to the sale of wheat and wool, but no Minister can now tell us what the agreement was in regard to wool. The Government sent their most competent man to the other side of the world to unravel what the terms of the supposed agreement were, and he became so disgusted while there that he resigned his commission.",58
384,Mr GREENE,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member desire me to read the whole verbiage of the agreement?,58

388,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,There is nothing more in the agrpement than what I have stated.,58
389,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Firs t of all, I say that this is not a Bill to ratify an agreement, and that we do not know what the agreement is that the Bill is intended to support. I deny that the agreement, whatever it is, was made by the producers of Australia. By what authority does the Minister say that the agreement was made by the producers? If the agreement was made by those who_own the butter in Australia, there is no need for any Bill, because they are bound to deliver under the contracts. The Minister admitted, by interjection, that there are four recognised middlemen on the committee. Did I understand the Minister aright ?",58

458,Mr ROBERT COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Does ford own factories?  honourable member cannot get away from the fact that he is a middleman.,62
459,Mr ROBERT COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"They are owners.  Sandford is one of the biggest dairy produce merchants in Adelaide, - and it cannot be said that the . interests of Mr Holdensen and Mr Sandford are in common with those of the men who milk coWs for seven days a week. I have heard it stated by the representatives of the Country party in this , Chamber that they were here to fight the middlem in, and the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) had a good deal to say concerning the middlemen during the election campaign. withstanding the position that the members of the' Country party were supposed [150]- 2 . to adopt, they are now assisting the Government in giving effect to an agreement in the interests of four middlemen. I am inclined to think that there is a good deal in the cartoon published im the last issue of the Sydney Bulletin^ and I am now beginning to realise how appropriate it is. The cartoon to which I refer depicts the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughe?) leading a little l a m b which represents the Country party. E cannot get the cartoon into Hansard, taafe I shall quote the verse accompanying itt. which is as follows : producer is "" Bill y "" had a little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow; Whichever way that "" Billy "" went The lamb was sure to go.",62
460,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND," Order ! The matter which the honourable member is now discussing has nothing 'whatever to do with the Bill  members of the Country party, wh© the should be working in the interests of the producers, are now allowing themselves to be led by the Government, which brings in an agreement supposed to be in the interests of the primary producers. And yet those who drew up the agreement include four middlemen whom the honourable members in the corner are sup>posed to have been 6ent here to fight. The Labour party is opposed to the middleman as the enemy of the p r i m a r y producer, and if there were nothing else Mr Sand- in the agreement to which I objected, the fact that the Committee which drew it up included four of the natural enemies of the producer would be sufficent to turn me against it . Ever since I came factory into the House I have objected to the manner in which the producers were cheated in connection w ' t h the sales off wool and wheat. The wool sale was really not a written contract, but was an arrangement agreed to over the cables, and by means of it the wool-growers suffered! 1 an irreparable lo3S. There is no representative of the farming community wbe will approve of the manner in which the wool contract was made and carried enfe. The same objection is to be found to the sale of wheat. Right throughout the w a r period there was blundering unp»e«edented in the history of this country, an«& Not- as the result the primary producers suffered more than any other section of the community. Now, when the war is over . s we are asked 'to sanction a similar transaction. Again the producers will be the victims of a bad deal, and the trouble is that those who claim to speak for the primary producers are "" in the swim.""",62
461,Mr BELL,CONCILIATION AND,"They are doing their own business this time.  admit that the bulk of the men engaged in the dairying industry had anything to do with the making of this agreement. Certain representatives of co-operative societies and middlemen drew up the agreement, but it cannot be said that any vote of those engaged in the dairying in dustry was taken to indicate their approval of the scheme, We might almost say that the agreement was made behind the backs of the producers.",63
462,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,"Will the honourable member say that there is a shrewder man in the dairying in d u s t ry than Mr . Osborne, who was a member of the Committee ?  know that the dairymen were represented on the Committee only to a small extent; but there were other men on it who cannot be said to be representatives of the people who earn their - living as dairy farmers. Although the butter will be sold in Great B r it a in under this agreement, it will pass through the ordinary channels, and will be bandied by the merchants of Tooley-street.",63
463,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,"The ordinary channels of distribution have been used in connection with all the Pools.  actly. And the butter which will be sold to Great Britain at 240s. per cwt., plus charges,, may be sold in Germany, or some other country at double that figure. That will mean a loss to the primary producer. The same thing happened in connection with the sales of wheat and wool. When the Australian farmer was receiving 3s. 9d. to 4s. 2d. per bushel the Canadian and A r gentine farmers were receiving 9s. to 13s. per bushel, and whilst the Australian wool-grower was receiving 15^d. per lb. for his wool, the growers in other countries were receiving as much as 5s. per lb. more. We are told that the Australian wool producer should be satisfied, because lie is to receive 50 per cent, of any profit made on re-sales at prices over and above the fixed rate. There is no small wool-grower in Australia who is not in direct disagreement with that contract. The primary producers have a right to expect that, the war being over, we shall return to normal conditions. They were the greatest sufferers during the war period, but we are asked to perpetuate their hardships.",63
464,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"What hardships? Dr EAR LE PAGE - Getting a bigger price for their butter than they received before.  are many honourable members on the Government side who will agree with me that this agreement may prove a very great hardship to the dairy farmers: The price is being fixed u n t i l March of next year, and no one can deny that it is possible, and, indeed, highly probable, that the fixed price will be much below the world's parity before the agreement terminates.",63
465,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Does not the honourable member think that the people representing the primary producers know their own business as well as he does? That is the whole point of the Bill . ,  the point of the Bill . I am not satisfied that the majority of the men engaged in the dairying industry know very much about the agreement which the Minister will not let us see.",63
466,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member knows that behind all this talk is the desire to stop export in order to keep down the local price.  Treasurer cannot put into my mouth any words he chooses. I received the votes of a large number of primary producers, and I shall do my best to see that they, get the best treatment possible. I am not tied, like members of the so-called Country party, to the actions of the Government. When the Government do something which I think inimical to the interests of the primary producers, I hold myself free to criticise their actions. I ask leave to continue my remarks at the next sitting. Leave granted; debate adjourned. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL . Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr GROOM) read a first time. House adjourned at 10.13. p.m.",63
