But I think it is also significant to we will probably find that those growers who per cent of wool production. The significant focus on wool growing have taken the trouble future is. I would suggest-although I do those who have not voted probably see wool part of their farming output and therefore do have a primary focus on growing wool. I am saying that those who are vitally interested in trouble to register their interest. What is important when we look at what we is setting about implementing changes for major change in moving to the privatisation and the change from Wool International to some real benefits. Not only will it allow having carried that stockpile for so long remember that growers have had a very big stockpile-but also we are seeing the development WoolStock Australia which will be developed that the stockpile, once sold, will be gone, necessarily be lost to the industry.

While it is true those who are developing those skills will not the first point-that the government has taken this up the wool taskforce and now going through the that we remember what the focus of this is the taskforce-and I believe the report they only word that could be used for it-pointed out, a simple mission statement, and that is ‘to NA Wednesday, 8 March 2000 commission wool innovation and to commercialise members or shareholders, however it is finally structured'. This is a primary focus. I think it shows of the former body through the International confusion often led to a lot of wastage-and The other points I think we want to look report. The report puts things in perspective dealing with the difficulties facing wool growers messiahs'. I think too often governments and pretend they have solutions It also goes on to point out the need for a wool growers, which I believe is already catalyst for this, so that we talk about wool about ‘the wool industry'. One of the great industry', it has been too easy for growers to been assuming themselves, and I think It is also important, as the report highlights, lament the fact that there is a range of wools wine industry, there is a range of products much, maybe.

Wool growers are what dollars are spent have to be focused on of the amount of money that has been spent last 50 years, it is horrifying to think that not that significant.

If you look that it makes the point-and we must never forget a blockage to more effective communication very important point which we should never lose people in that type of body, particularly as it NA 14250 was structured in the past, have a temptation must ensure that that is not allowed to occur. One other point made in the main report is the costs involved in transport, handling pointed out that there is something like an 83c and cotton. As the report points out: The transport, handling and marketing system or shipped for export has been exhaustively analysed scrutiny seems inversely proportional I think this might sum up some of the problems The report also goes on to talk about the cost will be aware of.
