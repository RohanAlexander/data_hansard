2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) will be absent from question time today and tomorrow. He is in Melbourne on government business. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will answer questions on his behalf. NA Exchange Rate,13
3,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen this morning's statement by the Deputy Prime Minister saying that the dollar, at its current rate, is adversely affecting exporters and is out of line with interest rate fundamentals and suggesting that it has been pushed up by screen jockey hot trading? How does that compare with the Prime Minister's statement last night that a strong dollar brings benefits for inflation and would help create very sound business bases? Who is right about the exchange rate-the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister?",13
4,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I had not seen all of the comments which were attributed to the Deputy Prime Minister, although I did see the one about screen jockeys.",13
5,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It reminds you of someone.,13
6,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it did remind me of somebody, actually.",13
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Some jock from Citibank.,13
8,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. It was probably the last person who made a pretence of understanding economic policy for the Labor Party. He was a very bad Treasurer, but he would be embarrassed by the performance that the Labor Party is showing these days. The fact is that a rising currency has different With all of these things, there are mixed effects. I have said myself on previous occasions that, in those areas of the Australian economy where there is strong import competition, a rising dollar makes it harder. I think you would not have to go far in mixing with manufacturers in Australia to hear that. On the other hand, of course, a rising currency will contribute to keeping inflation low. We have a low inflation rate in Australia at the moment, and a rising currency will make a contribution to lowering inflation as well. When I am asked about the level of the currency, I make it clear on behalf of the government, as is the government's position, that we are not targeting a particular value for the dollar. What we are targeting in relation to our monetary policy is clear and transparent: we are targeting an underlying inflation rate. What we are targeting in relation to wages is clear and transparent: we are targeting outcomes. Of course, what we are targeting in relation to fiscal policy is also clear. We have laid down in the budget a program to restore Australia's fortunes. That is what we are targeting: a program to restore Australia's fortunes. A strong Australia with sustainable growth and low inflation and wages consistent with that is the kind of outcome that the coalition loves. There is only one minority sector of the Australian public that does not like low interest rates, and it is the Australian Labor Party. They are the masters of the high interest rate. They are the people who got them up to 21 and 22 per cent in 1989 and 1990. They are the people who have still not recovered from the success of this government in lowering interest rates. They have still not recovered. We unashamedly like low interest rates. They give opportunity to business and they give opportunity to home buyers. It shows what an increasingly irrelevant and frustrated minority the Australian Labor Party happens to be.",13
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, I want to add to the Treasurer's answer. I understand that under the rules I am entitled to do so. I effects. wanted to add to",13
10,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left.,14
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that I did say roughly what was attributed to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night. But I also said, as the Treasurer has said, that there were minuses in the level of the dollar. The point I simply make is that, if you were half honest, you would have acknowledged that in your question.",14
13,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Will the Treasurer, in stating all those targets that he did, add an unemployment target to the list? Will he also explain why he wrote out unemployment as a proper objective of monetary policy in what he just stated?",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will allow the supplementary question. I invite the Treasurer to enhance his answer.,14
15,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have already told the House, the reason why the Labor Party set a target and set it in the year 2000 is that, first, in the year 2000, they thought they would never be in government and never be accountable for it, in relation to which you were right. Second, by setting the target, it gave you the opportunity to try to rework the forecasts, in which matter you were unquestionably wrong. That is why the Labor Party set that particular target. Having a target for sustainable growth and inflation, having a target in relation to savings and having a budget outcome are what good policy is all about. It is almost impossible to have an economic debate in this place. If you have an opposition with not one wit of an economic idea, how can you debate it? How can you debate it, when all you see is this vicious attempt to run around and popularise every inconsistent position that they can? What was the position that was announced hy the opposition after the budget? It was announced by the member for Holt the day after the budget, on 21 August. When he was asked what Labor policy was, he said: The budget deficits were getting too big again. They had to be brought back. But that was a medium-term task that we believed could have been accomplished with infinitely less pain over a threedirectly year period. One, two, three! What did the budget do? Balance over a three-year period! One, two, three. You can't say this was ignorance before you had caught up with economic theory-it was the day after the budget. It was the morning after when you went out of there and you said that your plan was in fact our plan. Everything you have done since has been to try to pull that apart. It is a worry to see the Socialist Left now in complete control of the Australian Labor Party. All four factions of the Socialist Left are in complete control of the Australian Labor Party. It is the task of the right wing of the Australian Labor Party to try to keep some economic sanity around the place, and in that they are failing. Cambodia",14
16,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister confirm there have been threats to Australian embassy officials in Phnom Penh? What is the nature of those threats, and what is the Australian government's response?",14
17,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. This is a very serious issue. I would have thought even members of the Labor Party would be concerned about a story on the front page of the Age suggesting that the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh had been subjected to threats. Mr Griffin interjecting,14
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bruce.,14
19,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not actually happen to think it is a matter that lends itself to cheap interjections from the Labor Party. As I said, this was reported on the front page of the Age newspaper today, and just to say that substantially the article in the Age was accurate. The American ambassador to Cambodia passed to our ambassador in Phnom Penh on the night of 1 December a warning from the Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, of possible action by unspecified hardliners against several embassies in Phnom Penh, including the Australian embassy. Our embassy has not yet received a threat, but it is taking all appropriate security precautions, and the embassy has alerted the Australian community living in Cambodia. The current situation in Cambodia is tense. Events over the last few months have led to increased strain in relations between the main political parties in Cambodia. There is also the possibility of further terrorist attacks remaining hardcore elements of the Khmer Rouge. Later this afternoon I will be meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, who is also responsible for police and the judicial system, and I will make representations to him at this meeting to ensure that the Cambodian government does everything it can to protect Australian citizens, including obviously those who work at the Australian embassy. I also will take the opportunity yet again to seek assurances from the Cambodian government that those responsible for the deaths of Australians in Cambodia will not be given an amnesty and that continued efforts will be made to bring those people to justice. The Australian government's position on this is absolutely clear, and on many occasions we have made these representations. In September, I discussed this matter with the Cambodian foreign minister, Ung Huot, who is known to members of the House, and received assurances from him that the Cambodian government would do all it could to bring these people to justice. I again wrote to Ung Huot in late November in response to suggestions in the media that General Noun Paet, who is one of the murderers implicated in the death of David Wilson, might seek an amnesty. I underlined our position that we did not wish him to be granted an amnesty and that the Cambodian government should fulfil its obligations to bring a murderer to justice. We are continually making representations on this matter. Let me say we have continually been given assurances by the Cambodian government that they will bring anybody responsible for the abduction or murder of an Australian citizen to justice. We look forward eventually, in particular, to General Noun Paet being brought to justice, as he should be. Nursing Homes",14
20,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Yesterday the minister revealed that older Australians would have new choice and flexibility in gaining access to nursing homes. Now, as well as the option of selling their homes, they will have by the choice of paying a monthly fee. Can the minister confirm that this fee will be about $15 a day? Does this mean that older Australians will have to pay $79 a week more than they actually receive in pension payments? Can the minister explain to older Australians where they are supposed to find this extra $79 a week that they would be required to pay? Isn't it a fact that the minister is making up changes to this program on a day by day basis?",15
21,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I saw articles in this morning's Herald Sun about a surcharge of $15 a day. I want to say that that article was particularly ill informed. Let me say that the shadow minister's hypocrisy is absolutely amazing in this particular instanceabsolutely amazing! The member for Jagajaga, who just asked that question, was the senior social policy adviser to the former Labor government that implemented the system of entry contributions to hostels. The shadow minister did nothing to change that. Indeed, she supported that system when it came in. She was also part of a government which did nothing-absolutely nothingabout the deplorable state of nursing homes in this country. But let us make it absolutely clear about what that system is doing. She, as a senior adviser, did nothing about the deplorable state of nursing homes in this country. Let us be clear about what this government is doing. We have extended Labor's systemyes, Labor's system-that they put in in 1988, but we will make great improvements to that system. We will put into place protections and limitations necessary to give people assurance when they enter the system.",15
22,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you just answer the question?,15
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kingsford-Smith should be listening to the answer.,15
24,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will get access based on their need for care-not on their capacity to pay-just as they do now. Unlike Labor, who never thought of it, we will protect couples, we will protect children with disabilities and we will protect the vulnerable groups in the community which Labor claims to represent yet did nothing to protect in the hostel system with entry contributions. Ms Macklin-I rise on a point of order, on relevance, Mr Speaker. You might recall that I asked the minister to explain where the extra $79 per week will come from.",16
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is using a wide range of examples to address the question. I am sure the minister will cover that in her response.,16
26,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already indicated that the article that put that proposal was ill informed, but let me please continue. Let us also be clear that, unlike Labor, we will place sanctions in the system and we will not allow unscrupulous operators to remain in this industry. Of course, a fact which seems to have escaped the shadow minister is that the government is not forcing anyone to sell their home to enter a nursing home. Unlike Labor, in extending Labor's system, we will give people choices. Not everyone will pay an entry contribution fee but, if you do negotiate an entry contribution fee, as you may currently do in the hostel system, you will have the choices on how you decide to pay for that entry contribution. We believe it is appropriate to ask people who can afford to do so to make a contribution to their care. We are not asking people who clearly cannot afford to make a contribution to do so. We are only asking those who have the capacity to make a small contribution to their care. We believe it is appropriate policy. The shadow minister should go back and review her own party's policy when they were in government. She has, I have to say, taken hypocrisy to new levels in this place. Mr Crean-I ask that the document from which the minister was reading be tabled.",16
27,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are confidential notes.,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are confidential documents. Small Business,16
29,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the results of consultation concerning the government's commitment announced in the 1996-97 budget to allow capital gains tax rollover relief for small business? Can the Treasurer explain how the implementation of this measure will benefit small business?,16
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the proudest matters that the government was able to deliver on in the 1996-97 budget was capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. We delivered on capital gains tax rollover relief for small business because we thought the taxation system should not penalise small businesses that were trying to grow bigger and small businesses that were trying to create more jobs. After we announced that measure, the government engaged if.} an intensive round of consultation with small business organisations. On budget night we had said that rollover relief would apply only where a small business rolled over the proceeds from selling one asset into a like asset. After consultation with small business, today I can announce, on behalf of the government, new measures to enhance capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. After listening to small business, the government has decided that the like-kind requirement for qualifying for rollover relief be dropped, that is, small business will now be able to roll over from one asset to another asset without any stipulation that it be a likekind asset. This will give new improvements and new capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. This is the government which consulted with small business, this is the government which listened and this is the government which can now deliver in a new way. Further, as a result of that consultation, we have heard the request from small business that the period for reinvestment of the proceeds from the disposal of an asset be extended to 12 months before disposal and 24 months after disposal. This gives small business people who are selling from one business and trading into another an extension of time in which to roll over their capital sum to grow or go into a new business. The cost of removing the like-kind asset in 1998-99 would be of the order of $50 million. This will be another boost to small business, another delivery on the coalition mandate, another encouragement to small business to grow bigger, and new opportunities for jobs in new, growing Australian businesses. This government takes its commitment to small business seriously and this is a government which intends to deliver. Royal Australian Air Force: Pilots",16
31,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Defence concerned about the resignation rate of trained RAAF pilots? Are financial incentives being contemplated to reverse the losses? Will he consider a quantum leap in authorised flying hours to improve the pilot retention rate?,17
32,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Curtin for his question. There is no doubt that we have had problems with pilot retention rates, and those problems have been increasing for some years. A number of measures have been put in place over time, but they have not solved the problem. The problem is of the magnitude now that we have lost a large number of pilots who have been trained at the cost of $6Y2 million to $7 million per pilot. Obviously, they go off to greater rewards. Those rewards are now being offered by airlines all around the world, as you know. To the extent that we have tried to deal with it-I have to say that there has been some attempt at this by previous governments and obviously they have failed-the return to service arrangements were extended from six years to eight years, and now we have extended them out to 10 years. The time it takes for that to come into effect is far too long and there is a gap in the fully trained tion. I say to the honourable member for Curtin that I think not enough planning has gone into this matter in the past. We are looking at the rewards to all sorts of people in the Defence Force because this is not the only area in which we are going to lose highly trained people. Competition is the problem. Competitive structures, commercial business and the expertise with which we train our people have provided this problem. I say to the Labor Party: you saw this thing coming for a long time and you did not do enough about it. We are now faced with the shortage that we inherited from you. The answer to the matter",17
33,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you took up the Glenn report, you'd be okay.",17
34,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are wrong about that because of the time lapse between the two, and you know that that is true. We will be dealing with the matter. We have recruited 60 new personnel of late, five of these being pilots from overseas, and we have increased the intake rate from 45 to 58 graduates per year. Parliament House: Demonstration",17
35,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question on a most distressing issue is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen reports that union activists deliberately targeted female police officers in the 19 August riot outside Parliament House? What light does this cast on the ACTU leadership's continued failure to accept any responsibility for the riot?,17
36,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I must say that my attention has been drawn to the article. It is an article in the journal of the Australian Federal Police Association of October 1996. The article is quite extensive and is written by Jason Bums, the secretary of the ACT police branch of the association. He describes the attack on Constable Alison Castles in the following words. He says: Standing under the Great Verandah, Castles was dragged into the crowd and thrown on the ground by one protester who allegedly said words to the effect ""Sorry but I have to do it"". Castles was then pilot situarepeatedly kicked and punched. The article, after describing the events, then concluded: One lesson that all Australian police organisations should learn from this riot ... is the way the mob deliberately targeted police women. Female members were attacked and pulled into the crowd in an effort to break up the police line. This troubling development, and along with the use of acid, blunt weapons, beer bottles and paint, cates the levels of planning and organisation by protesters not really seen before in Canberra ... Any objective reading of this article, I think, would sicken most Australians-the developments which occurred in that riot and the seemingly premeditated nature of the conduct of some of those people associated with that riot. There has been a public debate about responsibility for this matter. In the Canberra Times on 27 October 1996 was an article which gave us details of a letter written by Bill Mansfield, a senior official in the ACTU, which included the following words: The ACTU accepts part responsibility for the events in Canberra due to them occurring in association with our rally. I understand that that letter, and in particular that admission by Mr Mansfield, was the subject of discussions at the ACTU council in Lome. The ACTU council rejected the Mansfield admission, publicly repudiated the Mansfield position and refused to take any responsibility whatsoever for the occurrence in that riot on 19 August. I do not see how it is that people like Jennie George, Wendy Caird and Sharon Burrow can, in one breath, be attacking the provisions of our legislation as it impacts on women and yet seem silent in the face of this evidence. Women members of the police force, some of whom would be unionists, carrying out their duties are, as we now know, targeted for a vicious personal assault in a premeditated way because they are women. Our response to these events, I think, has been measured at all times. Obviously these matters are essentially for the criminal process, but I do not think the parliament can ignore the revelation in this article in the Australian Federal Police Association journal. In fact, the Daily Telegraph, in its editorial today, picks up these revelations and says: Investigating police in Canberra have now established the rioters had come to the capital with a pre-arranged set of tactics designed to create the maximum mayhem and cause maximum damage. Among their well-laid plans was a cowardly is a agreement that front line rioters would target women officers in the police cordon in the belief indi- they would yield first. The rioters were also convinced that if women police were attacked, male officers would come to their assistance, creating weak points elsewhere in the line. The editorial concluded with these words: While unions continue in the backward and misguided belief that the way to solve problems is by resorting to violence, by attacking the symbols of the democratic system and by endangering the lives of those whose job it is to protect us and our property, that is unlikely. Increasing numbers of workers are already convinced unions are no longer relevant in their lives. The premeditated violence of August 19 will draw others to the same conclusion. I conclude by saying that we restate the government's call that the ACTU leadership does have some part responsibility in these events. They ought to publicly state that and apologise for that part responsibility. Given the close association between the political and industrial wings of the Labor movement, it is also a fact that the parliamentary Labor Party has some responsibility in this public debate to set proper standards. I call on the Leader of the Opposition, I call on the shadow minister, I call on the member for Fremantle, who has talked much about women's rights",17

44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! This looks like being a reasonably robust question time. It reflects the robust nature of the debates in this chamber.

65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right! Mr Downer-What did you say to them?,20
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not helping.,20
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the second point I am making. The point of order is this: that was clearly not a statement of fact, as the honourable member alleges. It was an opinion that was offensive. You sought withdrawal of that offensive opinion from him and those were the words you used. In those circumstances, I would have thought of all people the Leader of the House would be wanting to keep order in this place.",20
68,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have just two further points. Under standing orders the position is quite clear. Standing order 78 states: When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used. he or she shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly. That is not a determination you have made. Mr Beddall-He asked you to withdraw.",20
69,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he did not ask me to withdraw. On that basis, from a tactical point of view, there is no basis upon which the point of order should be considered further. The second point I want to make, Mr Speaker, is to make clear to the Leader of the Opposition what I said: that is, we in this parliament have a public responsibility to set standards. The standard which I believe that you ought to set is to say to the ACTU that it is time they owned up to their public responsibility. What is so offensive about that, Mr Speaker? Why do you find that so difficult?",20
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not going to debate the issue.,20
71,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order and it goes to the point you have just made. This one has run a bit foul for you, hasn't it?",20
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will not debate the points of order.,20
73,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order is this: you quite clearly said, and a check of the record after these considerations here will reveal, that you required not just reflection on his part but withdrawal. It is, as the standing order says, up to you to determine whether a withdrawal is required on any particular set of words. The tradition in this place is that if a member finds himself personally offended then there is a withdrawal. In these circumstances where the words that you used clearly required a withdrawal, I ask you to get him to withdraw. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, on the series of points of order that have been raised, I draw your attention to standing order 76. which states: . . . all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. Further, standing order 78 states: When the attention of the Speaker is drawn to words used. he or she shall determine whether or not they are offensive or disorderly. I believe absolutely that, when you consider the form of the words that have been used and the extent to which I have taken personal exception to what I consider to be a very serious slur against me and my colleagues, you will consider them to be offensive and disorderly. I assert absolutely that, in terms of standing order 76, I take that as a personal reflection on me and my colleagues. I also note that the member for Prospect, who is a decent person, who respects the forms of the House, withdrew and apologised when you asked her to do so. I hope that the Minister for Industrial Relations will show the same degree of decency and the same respect for the forms of the House which he has responsibility, together with you, for upholding, and withdraw and apologise in a decent way. Mr Howard interjecting Mr Beazley interjecting",20
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition are not helping matter.,20
75,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. In referring you again to the standing orders which relate to offensive words and commence with standing order 75, it is clear in reading those through to standing order 78 that there is no entitlement of a member to claim to be offended unless they first identify the words that are offensive. We have had some great generalisations from the member for Charlton, but it might not be a bad idea that, in allowing you to determine the matter understanding order 78, he might tell you what those words were. They seem to be extremely sensitive on this issue, and with good reason, because it is by default that they stand accused. They have done nothing, notwithstanding that they continually demand of this side of the House that we take positions on practically everything. On this issue-attacks on women-they have been notably silent. If the member believes he has been offended by some particular words, let him say what they are.",20
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the member for O'Connor has made his point. The key words in this whole series of points of order revolve around the words 'disorderly' and 'offensive'. I am not prepared to rule that they were disorderly words, but the member for Charlton found the words offensive.",21
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,21
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order! I ask the minister to withdraw the words that were deemed by the member for Charlton to be offensive.,21
79,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask you, Mr Speaker, to advise me what words were so offensive. Exactly what words? I say to you in a bona fide way that I chose my words carefully. The fact is that there is a political debate here to the responsibilities which the opposition has in this matter. I have stated what I believe to be their responsibilities. I say to you genuinely, Mr Speaker, that I am completely at a loss to understand which words are said to be offensive. If those words could be recounted to me, I would obviously reflect on them, as you have asked me to. But, given the fact that there is no statement whatsoever of offensive words, and given the fact that otherwise I believe the point I have made is a fair and reasonable one, it is not reasonable to ask me to withdraw until those words are stated.",21
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I would like to speak to the point of order. My recollection of the remarks that were made by the minister was to the following substance: because of the well-known and publicly understood association between the Labor Party and the ACTU-an association that nobody in the Labor Party would deny-and the very close links, there was an expectation on our part that the Labor Party, particularly the leadership, would more vigorously dissociate itself. In furtherance of my point of order, I would remind the House that on the day of the riot the Leader of the Opposition used the most inflammatory language imaginable. He was the most inflammatory culprit. He used the most inflammatory language. I also remind the House and the Leader of the Opposition that, when it was demonstrated that the Leader of the Opposition, as the then Leader of the House, had falsely accused the Treasurer of making derogatory remarks about women, despite the admonition of the then Speaker to withdraw, he was allowed not to withdraw those palpably offensive remarks. I, like the Leader of the House, am at a complete loss to understand how you could conclude that his remarks were offensive.",21
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I think I can assist the procedures of the House to that point of order. The job of all members of parliament is to assist you, Mr Speaker. Therefore, in those circumstances, we withdraw our request at this stage of the proceedings in order to allow question time to proceed. Quite clearly, the Prime Minister has as got out of hand, and so has the Leader of the House. We would ask you this, Mr Speaker, could you review the words that you used in regard to the Leader of the House's remarks in response to the questions raised by the member for Charlton and come back into the House at a stage when tempers are less inflamed and make some sorts of comments in that regard as to how standing orders might proceed? As you allowed the Prime Minister indulgence on that point in the remarks he made, may I say that as I recollect the request to me of the now Treasurer then person, it was that I should withdraw and apologise. As I recollect that time, I withdrew but did not apologise.",21
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you did not!",22
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I did not apologise,22
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You never withdrew!,22
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and a constant request was made for me to apologise. But you will note from standing orders that no such situation is required. However, I set that to one side. Mr Speaker, in these circumstances, in order that question time can sensibly proceed, we withdraw our objection.",22
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no doubt that many of us reflect quite vividly on those quite emotional and distressing events on the day the parliament was attacked. Indeed, if it had not been for the tremendously effective work of the parliamentary security personnel, the Australian Federal Police and the ACT police, we would have had the most distressing headlines and images of parliamentary democracy in Australia vividly displayed to the world. As we have a number of other challenges to our democratic way of life in this country at the moment, in terms of a very substantial debate on racial issues, I do not want to see the House become any more emotive or emotional than it is already. I will take the suggestions of the Leader of the Opposition. We will reflect very substantially on the words that were deemed by the member by Charlton to be offensive. I will listen to and reflect carefully on the points of order, and I will rule later this day.",22
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I would like to know, through you, from the member for Charlton precisely what words he regarded as offensive. I would like to know.",22
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is speaking on indulgence.,22
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I repeat that, having been in this place for 22 years, I would like to know precisely those words. In making that request, as many people in this House will know, I have something of a personal regard for the member for Charlton, despite our political divergence. I would genuinely like to know what words used by the minister he found to be offensivebecause I am really at a loss to know, Bob.",22
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I share the Prime Minister's regard for the member for Charlton. I have ruled. I will reflect on the matter, its substance, and advise the House later this day about the outcome. The member for Charlton can resume his seat. Mr Robert Brown- Mr SPEAKER ",22
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat; I have ruled. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, I am not taking a point of order. I am seeking indulgence: I am concurring.",22
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Charlton, on indulgence. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, I am simply concurring, with some reservations, with the decision which my leader has quite correctly come to. I would appreciate it as well if you would examine the comments that were made, the accusations which were contained within them as well as the imputations which were contained within those statements, to decide whether or not the Minister for Industrial Relations should withdraw them. But, Mr Speaker, I just add that I have made, quite genuinely, the claim that I was personally grievously and seriously offended by the implications of the minister's comments.",22
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have ruled. I take no further advice from the member for Charlton. I call the next question. Mr MCGauran-No, the minister has not finished. He is in conclusion.",22
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister in conclusion.,22
96,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, I refer the House to the words of Bill Mansfield. They are that he accepted publicly that the ACTU should accept part responsibility for the events of that riot. I simply say that, regardless of your political persuasion, it is reasonable for members of this place to say to the ACTU leadership that they should now finally do what Bill Mansfield told the AFP Association they would do, and which the ACTU council later repudiated on 3 September. It is time that we put this matter behind us, and it can only be behind us when those responsible on the day accept responsibility for the organisation of the rally and, as a consequence, part responsibility for the shameful events which occurred at the very front doors of this parliament. Nursing Homes",22
97,Ms ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer to a report that the minister has conceded that nursing home entry fees of up to $80,000 could be charged to elderly Australians. Has the minister received advice from the Department of Health and Family Services that it believes that no special arrangements to prevent excessive fee rises are necessary? Does the minister intend to implement the departmental advice that the fate of older Australians needing nursing home care should be left to market forces? Is it the case that the $80,000 entry fee will become the average fee? If not, what will the average fee be?",23
98,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is not imposing any level of fee as an entry contribution to nursing homes. That will be something, as it is in the present system, to be negotiated between the nursing home proprietor and the resident. Market forces-as I hear the shadow minister saying-are exactly what they outlined in their policy when they brought in the hostel policy; they allowed a completely deregulated system. The system that we put in place will have greater assurances, greater protections, particularly for couples, particularly for children who have disabilities who need to remain in the family home, and particularly for the vulnerable. But I have to point out very strongly that the system the former government put into place for hostels was completely deregulated; there were no safeguards at all in that system. I would like to highlight once again the comments of a former minister in the Labor government, Mr Gary Johns. In a letter to the editor of the Australian on 19 September this year, 'A fair deal on nursing home payment', he had this to say, in part: The fact is that the system already applies to hostels, so why not extend it to nursing homes. He also went on to say in an interview on PM that evening: So in fact the Liberal coalition government has really introduced something which should have been a policy applauded by the Labor Party. And he went on further to say: The policy is correct. We'd already done it for hostels. I think it would only be a matter of time if we remained in government that we would have imposed it for nursing homes as well. It's logical, it's fair, it's reasonable. They are not my words but the words of a former Labor minister. What these people want to do is relegate nursing home residents to a system that is in a state of grave disrepair, in a parlous state. It is a shame on them that they took no action to fix that system while they were in government for 13 years. Interest Rates",23
99,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to recent calls for more cuts in interest rates? What is the government's reaction to such claims?,23
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My attention has been drawn to calls as recently, I think, as this morning by the Leader of the Opposition for a further",23
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hear, hear!",23
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, 'Hear, hear.' I am right-:-a further half a per cent in interest rates. The call for further reductions in interest rates by the Leader of the Opposition sits rather poorly with his attempts to sabotage the government's budget. When he was asked on AM on 29 November of this year a question as to whether the blocking of $3 billion worth of budget saving would have any effect on interest rates, the Leader of the Opposition replied, 'No, I don't believe it will at all.' I will repeat that: 'No, I don't believe it will at all.' That sits very poorly and very oddly with the statement he made on 21 June 1995. That is only a little more than a year ago. This is what he had to say: Obviously, one of the things that will impact upon interest rates is the extent to which the government pursues a policy of fiscal tightening. I will repeat that: 'the extent to which the government pursues a policy of fiscal tightening.' And it got even better. He went on to say, 'The budget surplus is absolutely critical in that regard.' The budget surplus is absolutely critical in that regard-not only in the short term but also in the long run. Not only does the Leader of the Opposition want it both ways; he really wants it three ways. He wants to be able",23
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: is it relevant to mention the statement without saying why I was saying that? Perhaps the Prime Minister might let us all in on that.",24
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,24
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that, once again, the Leader of the Opposition, desperately trying to get a headline, desperately trying to make a point, has been caught foursquare not only contradicting economic logic but also contradicting his past statement. The reality is that your very actions are designed to slow down the reduction in interest rates. If you were really interested in lower interest rates for Australian home buyers, you would have let the budget through weeks ago. Nursing Homes",24
106,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer the minister to her admission yesterday that the government was considering a new monthly fee for people who enter nursing homes. Will this new monthly fee be an addition to the social security means test of 50c in the dollar, income tax and your new means test on nursing home benefits at 25c in the dollar? Minister, isn't it a fact that for part-pensioners who do pay the up-front fee their effective marginal tax rate will be between 91 per cent and 104 per cent? With the addition of the new monthly fee, how much higher will the effective marginal tax rates be for pensioners who do not pay the up-front fee?",24
107,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, I have to say that these comments are coming both from an article that was in the paper this morning and also from a draft report. It is a draft report. I am awaiting the final report from my task force. It talksMr Lee- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was quite specific: isn't it a fact that the effective marginal tax rate will be between 91 per cent and 104 per cent? Answer the question.",24
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order.,24
109,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that it has been dubbed by some in the media and by some on the other side of the House as a surcharge. This government has never, never talked about a surcharge. That is not an option that we will take. I will await the final report from my working party who are deliberating on a number of implementation matters. Let me say that the former minister sitting on the other side of the House presided over a hostel system where they allowed proprietors to take 100 per cent of the earnings over the pension and the free area. They did not even allow or put in protections in that respect. So don't let them sit there and carp and whinge about a system that was clearly in disrepair and that they did nothing about for 13 years. Inflation",24
110,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer and follows the question from the member for Forde to the Prime Minister. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the prospects for inflation and employment and the likely effect of current industrial claims?,24
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian economy is now at a stage where we have inflation back at levels which we have not seen since 1974. We have interest rates consequently coming down and, as a result of low inflation of around two per cent, there is now no need for wages to chase prices. It was a point, I thought, very sensibly made recently by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 28 November, when he said that safety net adjustments as proposed by the government were sensible. But he said: ... if the interventions are more wide-ranging, the outcome will be slower employment growth-either because individual employers respond to the price/wage squeeze facing them, or because the Bank is forced to respond to emerging inflationary pressures by raising interest rates. The ACTU living wage claim is a recipe to destroy jobs in this country. That is what it is. It is a recipe-as our submission to the Industrial Relations Commission will showto shave off 400,000 jobs. So what have we got now? We have a Labor Party which is trying to undo the budget and put pressure on interest rates. We have the Labor Party supporting a living wage claim which will destroy 400,000 jobs. What we have is a political party, still in a fit of pique from losing an election, which is now setting out on a course to try to destroy everything that is good about the Australian economy. The Minister for Industrial Relations was asking whether the Labor Party can distinguish itself from the ACTU. Can it on the living wage claim; can it stand up and say what a sensible policy would be? The ALP cannot distinguish itself from the ACTU because it is the ACTU. ACTU presidents in suits-they are called Labor frontbenchers. The member for Hotham, the member for Batman--everybody in the ACTU knows that one way you can guarantee your Labor Party preselection is to become an ACTU president. You might not be able to kick a football but they will make you the member for Batman. Then, as the Prime Minister said, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes out and calls for interest rate cuts because the economy is flat, and the Leader of the Opposition goes out and calls for interest rate cuts because the economy is strong. On 2GB news today, he was calling for a cut in interest rates. He said, 'We've got a basically strong economy.'",24
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Read the rest of it.,25
113,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Read the rest of it? He went on to say, 'There was a need for the reserve to give a bit of a punch along last time and I think one per cent was necessary. We've got a basically strong economy.' That was from the Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition reckons the economy is as flat as the Nullarbor Plain. The Leader of the Opposition thinks the economy is strong. It is the 'Bill and Ben' show over there. Who would you believe-the guy who gets every indicator upside down or a finance minister who calls a $10,000 million deficit a balance? It is a hard choice. As I keep saying: it is the task of the right wing of the Labor Party to rein in the Socialist Left faction. If you cannot do that and if you cannot get them to support sensible savings measures, you have got to confront it. You have got to confront the Socialist Left faction in the ALP and try to put together a credible strategy, and if need be confront all four subfactions of the Socialist Left of the ALP to try to get some kind of credible position in place. We see an opposition trying to destroy the budget. We see an opposition which is supporting the ACTU living wage claim, trying to rub out jobs. We see an opposition that cannot put together a credible strategy. As I have said before, only one minority sector of the Australian public is worried about lower interest rates-the Australian Labor Party. Nursing Homes",25
114,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Is it the case that if an elderly person needs to move from one nursing home to another they may in fact be required to pay two entry contributions? Is it not the case that one fee of $26,000 will be enough; why two? Mr Reith-You'll be still asking these questions when you're going into them.",25
115,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are absolutely right about that, yes. It is certainly true that in some circumstances residents may indeed transfer between facilities because their needs change. In fact, I have to point out to the House and to those listening that one of the features of our reform package is that, where you have couples who have entered a hostel and one becomes increasingly frail, and they would normally under the present or the former system have to move one person into a nursing home to receive the high level of care, our system will allow that couple to stay together. The subsidy we will pay will follow the degree of mental or physical frailty of the resident. It is not about which facility they in. So there is a very great benefit there. I read an article in the West Australian recently that the new Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia was claiming that he was going to fix this system. He was up there beating his chest about it, saying he would not allow the separation of elder couples in hostel and nursing home facilities. But the fact is he has no authority and no capacity to change the system. We do have, we are changing it, and we will not put elderly couples through that separation. Let me finish my answer to the member's question. These changes that are often made outside those circumstances are the choice of residents. The average total length of stay of the small number of residents who currently move from a hostel to a nursing home is less than five years. Very few residents will need to consider the payment of a second entry contribution. Let us keep in mind the fact that any unused portion of the entry deposit is transferable back to the owner or back to the resident and is not kept by the establishment. In the case of where they leave entirely or they transfer over, the balance will be paid back to them, or to their estate as the case may be. The fact is that the owner of any establishment can draw down only $2,600 per annum out of that entry deposit fee that is paid. The balance remains the property of the person who has made the entry contribution fee. Residents who cannot afford to pay an entry contribution will not have to pay in any circumstances, and the government will pay an additional subsidy to help those individuals in their access of care. I want to make it clear that only those with the capacity to pay will be paying an entry contribution fee, that access will be based on the care needs of the resident, not on their capacity to pay, and that the government will pay an additional fee for those who cannot afford to pay an entry contribution fee. Waterfront",25
116,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional are Development. Is the minister aware of media reports that despite falling productivity MUA employees are earning up to $140,000 per annum? Is the minister also aware of claims by the Maritime Union of Australia on the ABC that 'industrial action was completely missing' from the waterfront under Labor over the last 13 years? How do these claims impact on Australia's international competitiveness?",26
117,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Yes, I am aware of reports of waterside workers being paid amounts up to $140,000. I have even heard reports of amounts in excess of that being paid to waterside workers around the Australian waterfront. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to substantiate those claims made on ABC TV. Those claims were made in an ABC news broadcast last week in the context of excessive overtime payments being made to waterside workers working at the port of Melbourne. This, in anybody's book, would be described as outrageously high levels of pay for the type of work that is performed on the Australian waterfront--outrageous, too, when you compare. the level of productivity that our Australian waterside workers produce on the Australian waterfront. If you look at our productivity level on the Australian waterfront, it is around half that of those countries that we have to compete against. If you go to Europe, you can find container movements per hour in the order of 50 container movements per hour. Here in Australia, our average movements come out at around 20 container movements per hour. You can go to the United States and find 40 containers being moved per hour as the norm in the United States. You can go to Malaysia where 30 container movements per hour is the norm compared with 20 container movements per hour here in Australia. These excessive rates of pay for those people who produce so little would be, by anybody's description, deemed to be outrageous. But this is even more outrageous in light of claims made by people in the Maritime Union of Australia that they did all of this without industrial disputes over the last 13 years of a Labor government. I directly quote the joint national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australian, Mr John Coombs, who said on ABC radio, with the passing of the workplace relations bill: There will be an increase in industrial action, something that was missing completely from the waterfront over the last 13 years. That claim that there has been no industrial dispute on the Australian waterfront over the last 13 years is completely and utterly dishonest. The truth is that, from 1986 to the end of 1995, days lost per employee on the Australian waterfront actually increased, not decreased. They did not go down to zero but increased. What you can see is that their low productivity, their increase in industrial action over the last 13 years and their enormous pay levels are causing enormous damage to the Australian economy. These are the people who prospered well under a Labor government. These people on the Australian waterfront are Labor's battlers-Labor's battlers earning these amounts of money. Those battlers that Labor has represented-and who have so prospered during Labor's 13 years of government-are costing their fellow Australians lots of job opportunities. These job opportunities that are lost are highlighted in the paper of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce released today on the waterfront and its performance. Their press release states: Australia rates last in an international comparison of 18 ports. Waterfront charges, port charges, crane rates, ship working rates and delays all show Australian ports still performing poorly. Delays alone add up to 7.5 per cent to the cost of freight and this costs business around $1 billion a year. These costs of $1 billion a year and more to business hurt the real battlers in Australiathose people without a job. These are the people that our industrial relations reform, through the workplace relations bill, is designed to benefit, not the sorts of six-figure sultans that the Labor Party supported on the waterfront during their 13 years of government-those who prospered so well at the expense of ordinary Australians. Mr Tanner-I ask the minister to table the document so that we can see whether there is any truth in some of the accusations he is making.",26

120,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I note that the Treasurer wants to talk about football today. Is the Prime Minister aware that Chris Carberry, the former Australian Rugby Union prop, and one of the most vigorous chairs of the area consultative committee network established under Working Nation, has been sacked as the chair of the Logan City Area Consultative Committee? Why has the government taken this action if it is true that tomorrow the Prime Minister will announce an area consultative committee backflip--the revival of Working Nation without the Working Nation cash? Does this decision to now embrace area consultative committees show that the Prime Minister is leading a government without any original ideas about how to revive regional economies?",27
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Immigration,27
122,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. What is the combined effect of the opposition parties' actions of amending the two-year migrant waiting period legislation and disallowing migration regulations relating to assurances of support? Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 72: No Member may allude to any debate or proceedings of the current session in the Senate ... I suggest to you that the question is out of order. Mr Reith-On the point of order: the question does not refer to particular bills. It refers to certain policy issues and they are clearly in order.",27
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,28
124,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The combined effect of He the opposition's approach on these policy questions of the two-year waiting period and the disallowing of migration regulations relating to assurance of support is to ensure that most family sponsored migrants are not covered by either the waiting period or any assurance of support scheme. That is the net outcome. It has been the fact that over a long period of time, when a person migrates to Australia in the family migration area, there has been an expectation that there would be an assurance of support and there be an obligation assumed by the family that obtains the benefit of having their family member able to enjoin them in Australia in preference to other migration applicants. In relation to those who come through the business and skills program, there is also an expectation that those who Paper. come with those skills ought to have the resources to be able to maintain themselves after they arrive in Australia. There is nothing remarkable about these propositions. Since the time of Federation one form or another sponsors have been expected to give assurances of support, bonds the House. or guarantees to ensure that such obligations are met. It was only under Labor that the system of assurance of support came into disrepute. They did not take it seriously. They failed to expand it to the full range security payments, so there would be some payments that would be covered and if you could get on that one you could get on another. Despite overwhelming evidence that a bond is more effective as a means of enforceI ment, they applied the bond only to a very limited number of migrant categories and they failed to index the bond over that period time. The government has sought to ensure the obligations that newly arrived migrants create are met by either of two ways: first, preclusion period or, if that was not able to operate, by the assurance of support scheme being able to be more effectively used. have we had? We have had the shadow minister on the Hinch program the other week saying, 'If there is a villain in the piece, it's sponsors and we want to make sponsors pay those obligations.' That is his own statement. wants to hold out that he expects sponsors to meet those obligations, but when it comes to the measures that will ensure that people are not able to access benefits or that the people who benefit from having their relatives here give assurances, meaningful assurances, that can be enforced, they want to deny us the opportunity of ensuring that not only one but both measures cannot operate. So we are in a situation now where we have no system in place that is able to ensure that people who come through the family reunion program are able to be assured that the commitments that they impose on taxpayers are met by the families who benefit from being able to be here.",28

In the past the Prime Minister has sought to give us answers that afternoon when he takes the question on notice. To the best of my knowledge no answer has yet appeared 24 hours later, and I wonder whether you could either write to or make inquiries with the Prime Minister to find out when an answer might be forthcoming.",29

142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"This took a bit longer and I had to go to Sydney. I do not totally organise my life to accommodate the member for Dobell, much and all as I might try! Do you want an answer?",29
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The member for Dobell, the Prime Minister is alluding to your question.",29
144,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It was a question concerning premium increases by MBF. My answer is as follows: I do stand by the minister for health's statement. The inference in the honourable member's question that health insurers are seeking and obtaining premium increases under the current government that are either excessive or not linked to the issue of prudent financial management is simply not backed up by the facts. Over the period 1984-95, private health insurance premiums across all tables increased by an average of almost 12 per cent a year. In the two-year period between 1986 and 1988, when the Labor government was in power, premiums increased by a massive 40 per cent in only two years. The previous Labor government received nearly 200 applications from the major private health insurance funds for premium increases and to my knowledge did not seek to alter one of those 200 applications. For 13 years the Labor government neglected and disparaged private health insurance as a core element of a balanced health care system. The difference between the attitude of the previous government and the coalition, which has lived up to its election commitment to provide rebates to assist low income Australians to retain or take out private health insurance, could not be more stark. Mr Lee-I have a supplementary question to the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker.",30

152,Mr CAMPBELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, in the Sunday Telegraph of 3 November, which has just been drawn to my notice, a journalist called John Laws wrote an article extolling the virtues of one Senator Bill O'Chee when he said that Bill O'Chee had said that I had told him to go home when sitting on a plane next to him. Anyone who knows me knows that I would not have said that. John Laws made no attempt to check and I think that inaccuracy is more a measure of John Laws than anything else. NA Hansard Report",30
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have two brief statements to make arising from business over the last week or so. During the previous sitting week, I was asked questions by the Minister for Defence and the honourable member for Werriwa concerning an interjection which appeared at page 6349 of the Proof Hansard of Tuesday, 5 November 1996. I have now had the opportunity to thoroughly and most carefully evaluate all the material that has been made available to assist me in my deliberations on this matter. Unfortunately, neither the audio nor the video tape of the proceedings in the chamber at the time the interjection was made are of any assistance in resolving the issue as the interjection in the question is inaudible on both. Having fully considered all aspects of the matter, I have decided that, under the circumstances, the interjection as originally recorded in the Proof Hansard should stand. I have informed both the Minister for Defence and the member for Werriwa of my reasons for this decision. I have further advised the member for Werriwa that he may seek leave to make a further personal explanation in regard to the matter should he so desire. However, I will not tolerate any further debate on this issue. I would also like to take this opportunity to remind honourable members that the exacting task faced by Hansard staff of accurately reporting proceedings in the chamber is made even more demanding and difficult when debate becomes noisy andlor heated, as was the case in this instance. I suggest that honourable members should bear this mind. It is yet another good reason for maintaining a reasonable and acceptable standard of conduct in his House at all times. I will call the member for Werriwa in a moment. Member for Hotham Member for Paterson",30
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On Thursday, 21 November, I was asked questions by both the honourable member for Hotham and the honourable member for Hunter in relation to incidents which were said to have occurred earlier that week and which involved, in the case of the member for Hotham, alleged deliberate obstruction by the Treasurer when the member for Hotham was attempting to move to the dispatch box and, in the case of the member for Hunter, alleged restriction by the member for Paterson of the member for Hunter's movement from one side of the chamber to another during a division. As I remarked when the member for Hotham asked his question, I am surprised that the matter was not brought to my attention when it allegedly occurred. Had this been the case, any appropriate action that may have been required could have been taken at that time. I remind honourable members that, as stated in House of Representatives Practice on page 225: ... a point of order must be raised immediately and ... It is not acceptable concerning proceedings earlier in the day or concerning proceedings of a previous day. In regard to the question asked by the member for Hotham, I have decided that no useful purpose would be served by introducing a parliamentary version of trial by video so long after the event, particularly when the Treasurer is on record as deeply regretting any offence or pain and suffering that may have been caused to the member for Hotham. In regard to the matter raised by the member for Hunter, I am confident that the member for Paterson will endeavour to give him a wider berth during divisions. Again, I remind honourable members of their duty to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner in this chamber. I hope that it will not be necessary for the House to be diverted by, or as a consequence of, matters of this nature in the future. NA",31

158,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,31
159,Mr LA THAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Your statement, Mr Speaker, misrepresents the text of my interjection in debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill on 5 November. I first raised this matter with Hansard on 6 November when, upon reading the Proof Hansard, I noticed an error in my recorded interjection. Following a  November publishing this error, I contacted the Chief Hansard Reporter, Mr Harris, on 12 November to ask him to check and confirm the accuracy of my correction of the Hansard record. Mr Harris then wrote to me on 15 November as follows: I confirm my oral advice to your office that the interjection has been recorded incorrectly. The Proof copy records you as saying: It's not our role to speak to the Aboriginal people. The correct interjection was: It's not your role to speak for the Aboriginal to raise points of order people. I have instructed that the Official Hansard report be changed to reflect the correct interjection. In telephone conversations, Mr Harris informed me that both the audio and video tape did not record my voice interjecting on the member for Barker. I have listened to the tape myself, and the only interjection it records is the member for Banks, although not in the words attributed to me. Mr Harris also explained to me that the shorthand Hansard reporter, recording the member for Barker's words, did not hear my interjection. I repeat: that person did not hear my interjection. The shorthand reporter reconstructed the words I might have said on the basis of how the member for Barker then responded to them in his speech. Mr Harris informed me that the only Hansard recordand I understand that it is taken as the preeminent written Hansard record-was from the logbook reporter who records interjections in the House. The logbook records my words as follows: It's not your role to speak for the Aboriginal people. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, who was in the chamber at the time, has told me that his best recollection is that the member for Barker responded to something which I did not say. I have been misrepresented, because you have now asked Hansard to record my words as follows: It's not our role to speak to the Aboriginal pleeven though these words were not heard by either the logbook or shorthand reporter or by the Deputy Speaker and are not recorded on either the audio or video tape. I did not say those words. Accordingly, I seek leave to move as follows: That the House agrees that the Hansard debate should record, as per the Hansard logbook and advice of the Chief Hansard Reporter, that the correct interjection of the member for Werriwa in debate on 5 November 1996 at page 6349 was: It's not your role to speak for the Aboriginal people. Leave not granted.",31

163,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It might be for you, but not yet for me, thank God, Leo.

182,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I ask you, Mr Speaker, to indicate whether it is your intention to respond to another point that I took up with you as a result of last week's proceedings, which was the movement of the Deputy Speaker from one side to the other. This was a point of order raised at the time as well as followed up by question. Clearly, this is an important response. If the tape, as we believe, shows Deputy Speaker did move, the Votes and Proceedings, which records the activities of this House, may need to be altered.",33

184,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I start the statement by informing the House that Australia has won the second test, with the West Indies being dismissed for 215. Warne got four wickets and MCGRATH three. I wish to report to the House on my recent visit from 22 to 26 November to the Philippines for the APEC leaders meeting. This meeting marked the start of the hard work of turning APEC's free trade rhetoric into reality. It began to turn vision into action. I believe that the meeting was very successful, both as a forum for leaders to exchange views and in making progress on APEC's trade agenda. In Manila, each APEC member economy tabled an individual action plan which set out steps each would take towards the Bogor commitment of free and open trade and investment for developing economies by the year 2020 and developed economies by the year 2010. These plans were reviewed and recommended by APEC trade and foreign ministers at their meeting just before the leaders meeting. I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for their contribution during the year to producing such a successful outcome in Manila. While for the most part the plans contain steps to which economies were already committed under the Uruguay Round or unilaterally, they provide proof that APEC economies remain committed to removing tariff and nonthe tariff barriers to trade and to freeing up investment. They thus set an example we hope non-APEC members will take note of. I wish neither to exaggerate the achievements of the plans nor to undervalue them. They were a good beginning. They contain some new commitments of direct and early benefit for Australian business which in turn will create jobs for Australians. That is why we will continue to press for greater liberalisation of trade. For example, in the mining sector, the Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal. Thailand will liberalise its natural gas market. In agriculture, Hong Kong will relax import restrictions on rice by the year 2000 and controls on the stockpiling of frozen meat and poultry. Japan will introduce new quarantine measures expected to expedite Australian exports of fruit and flowers. There will be other new opportunities for Australian business in banking and investment where access has been improved. China, for example, has agreed to increase the number of licences for foreign banking, insurance and securities organisations. Thailand will increase the number of joint ventures in the insurance sector. Singapore will gradually open up the domestic banking sector to greater participation by international financial institutions. And the Philippines will review foreign investment restrictions on investment institutions. There are also promising new commitments with regard to opportunities for Australian professional services. Singapore will remove commercial presence restrictions on engineers and architects. Japan is to review laws relating to foreign lawyers operating in Japan. Korea will review restrictions on the commercial presence for foreign accounting firms and improve market access for foreign lawyers. The plans provide for each economy a consolidated picture of liberalisation, in the case of some APEC economies for the first time, thereby giving a higher degree of certainty and transparency for business. The plans also lay down a baseline for the future. In a rolling process, the plans will be continually reviewed, updated and improved over the next 25 years. The government will now do all it can to encourage the production of better plans over the next year or two. APEC leaders committed themselves in their declaration to improve them by the time they next meet in Vancouver next year. APEC trade ministers will review them next year, and in doing so will take into account the views of the business community. The government welcomes the increasing involvement of the business community in APEC as insurance that APEC will focus on business's needs. The government sees a major role for the APEC Business Advisory Committee in monitoring the improvement of the action plans of the member economies. The business community has long asked governments to facilitate travel among member economies. I was pleased, therefore, to announce during the APEC meetings agreement with Korea and the Philippines to trial Australia's proposal of an APEC business travel card which will provide business people with easier and faster access, including streamlined arrival arrangements. The government hopes that, once the trial has proved the worth of the scheme, other APEC members will join in. Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. But our position is a positive one, based on the assessment that liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the economy. Australia's own action plan demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to trade liberalisation. This commitment is not a matter of ideology, but a consequence of the government's conviction that liberalisation within the region will help sustain the region's economic growth, will open up increasing market opportunities for Australian exporters, will help promote Australia's own economic growth, and will create jobs and improve living standards in Australia. APEC can help ease the costs of economic adjustment caused by liberalisation and globalisation through maximising the opportunities those same forces provide to increase our exports. As I said in my first intervention during the leaders meeting, globalisation is the most potent economic force in the world today. It is important, in order to ensure public support for the economic and social adjustments that have to be made and to ensure that we can take advantage of the opportunities globalisation offers, that governments explain to their electorates the overall benefits of liberalisation. A recent survey of Austrade's exporter clients showed that nearly 60 per cent either had increased employment or expected to do so as a result of exporting. Sixty-four per cent said that they expected improved profitability as a result of exporting. Likewise, a survey of the growth and performance of small and medium sized enterprises released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in September shows that a higher proportion of exporting businesses increased employment than nonexporting businesses. APEC's ambitions will be realised only if all participating economies continue to liberalise. Not every economy will move at the same pace in the same area. APEC does not require mathematically precise reciprocity, for APEC to work there has to be continual movement across all sectors and all econothe mies have to see the benefits for is, in APEC language, the principles of comprehensiveness and comparability are strands important to the success of APEC's trade liberalisation process. In that respect, I found the APEC leaders meeting encouraging. My impression was of a strong commitment to APEC and to the goal of free trade as the centrepiece of APEC. was particularly heartened to hear the Presiic dent of the United States repeat his support for maintaining the momentum of liberalisation, as expressed during his recent visit Australia. APEC is an important element in the government's efforts to improve market leaders access, growth and employment, but only one element. Externally, APEC is only one strand of our trade policy, which focuses also gaining access at the bilateral and multilateral levels. APEC can be of assistance by providing opportunities for bilateral discussions action plans and in imparting greater dynammaintaining ism to the World Trade Organisation. The call by APEC leaders for the World Trade Organidelivering sation to conclude an information technology agreement is one such example. In turn, the government's trade policy only one element in its overall strategy to growth. Living cheek by jowl with the fast growing Asian economies does not of itself assure success. We not only need the market access but also need to be competitive. government's budget deficit reduction stratPresident egy, its reforms of the labour market and reduction of red tape are, likewise, important components of the government's program to lift economic growth, employment and living standards. All of these are key ingredients the government's approach to industry policy. In Manila and at the leaders meeting itself, I took the opportunity to underline government's commitment to engagement with our region and to APEC as a core feature of that engagement. I reiterated that our participation would be wholehearted achieving the trade and investment liberalKorea. isation goals laid down at Bogor. I emphasbut ised my personal commitment to continuing the work of my predecessors on both sides of House who established APEC and sugthem-that gested the leaders meeting. APEC reflects the integration of the various in the government's regional policies. It demonstrates the mutually reinforcing roles played by our alliance with the United States and our partnerships with major Asian friends. It creates a sense of community among a very diverse group of economies by building on I their common interests in promoting economgrowth. It thus makes a very material contribution to the stability of our region. The leaders meeting, in particular, is a most to valuable institution for Australia and the Asia Pacific region. It provides an unparalleled opportunity for face-to-face contact between in the region. It helps underline shared interests in growth and stability. It has a special character which can be maintained on only if there continues to be a personal commitment on the part of all leaders. The authority and expectations that leaders on bring to the APEC process are essential to the momentum of APEC's core trade and investment liberalisation agenda and the results our business sector and communities at large look for. One of the great strengths of the annual is APEC meeting is the opportunity for the lift Australian Prime Minister to meet, in a very short period, a range of other leaders from our key regional partners. I had a very useful and productive meeting with President Jiang The Zemin of China. I was able to assure the that the government saw close cooperation with China as important, both politically and economically. As very different societies, we will not always see eye to eye on everything, but a strong relationship is in mutually beneficial, given the substantial interests we have in common. I look forward to giving practical expression to this when I my visit China next year. The government sees China's full participation in regional and global structures as a force for stability. I had a valuable first in meeting with President Kim Young Sam of Korea is now our second largest export market and the ties between our two countries, including at a people-to-people level, are growing strongly. My meeting with Dr Mahathir built on my discussions with him earlier this year and enabled me to underline the strengths and value of the bilateral relationship with sia. I hope to be able to pursue this further when I visit Malaysia in 1997. I had good discussions also with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong, and I plan to visit his country also next year. My meeting with Mr Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada, enabled me to reaffirm our commitment to the traditionally close relationship between Australia and Canada. I look forward to attending the next leaders meeting under his chairmanship in Vancouver in 1997. His positive view of APEC's dynamism and capacity to produce results was encouraging. I was able to renew my acquaintance with a number of other leaders, including the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and President Soeharto of IndonesIa. Finally, I would like to thank President Ramos and the people of the Philippines for the generous hospitality they extended to me and to the members of my travelling party. President Ramos's strong and successful chairmanship of APEC during such a demanding year is a tribute to him, to his government and to the people of the Philippines. The holding of the APEC meeting in the Philippines gave me the opportunity to restate the value the government places on Australia's relations with the Philippines. I note in the press this morning some remarks of the finance minister of the Philippines drawing very strong attention to the closeness of the bilateral relationship between Australia and that country. I particularly note the rapid economic growth the Philippines is now enjoying under the leadership of President Ramos. I was pleased, while in Manila, to be able to speak at a reception held by the Australia-New Zealand Chamber of Commerce and to meet many Australian business men and women who are seizing many growing economic opportunities in the Philippines. I assure them, and all other business people operating in the APEC economies, of the government's interest in their success and the priority the government gives to doing all it can to support them. Might I also take the opportunity to thank my three representatives Malay- on the APEC business committee: Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, of Adelaide, Mrs Imelda Roche and Mr Michael Crouch. All of them very ably represented the Australian business interests at the gathering, and I think the interaction between the business representatives of the various APEC economies is a very valuable and important adjunct to the whole APEC process. Could I apologise in advance to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for the necessity I have, because of another commitment, to leave before he will have finished his speech. In normal circumstances I would not do that, but I hope he will understand the exigencies of the situation. I present the following paper: APEC Leaders Meeting-Ministerial Statement, 3 December 1996.",33
185,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Firstly, I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in congratulating the Australian cricket team for a second terrific victory and note the emergence on the scene of another genuinely quick bowler in the shape of Jason Gillespie, whom I had the dubious pleasure of seeing operate on a very fast Western Australian pitch. He absolutely obliterated the Western Australian side. If he is selected for the Perth test, I expect it to be a short one indeed. It is good to see our cricketers performing well, despite the odd criticism that is made of the team from time to time. I also join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the performance of the business people who attended the APEC conference in the Philippines along with the Prime Minister. That growing involvement of the Australian business community has been one of the very good features of APEC. I think we have seen over the last few months how truly international an outlook our business community has developed, as shown by the very strong stands they have been taking on issues related to an outward looking, competitive Australia which takes export markets seriously. There has been a total change in the culture of Australian business over the last 13 or 14 years. The particular business men and women named by the Prime Minister have played no small role in that. They are to be congratulated in that regard on the leadership they have shown. By the time the Labor government left office at the beginning of the year, APEC had progressed from the initiative that Bob Hawke and Gareth Evans put in place, strongly expanded by the subsequent Prime Minister Paul Keating under his leadership, to the preeminent grouping for regional economic cooperation in our region. I think it is terribly important to note the role prime ministers and foreign ministers can play in regional affairs. Nothing is static in international relations. There are moments which you can take-to use a cliche-at the tlood, to achieve things which, if you leave them on a backburner, if you do not deal with them at the time, cease to be opportunities in the future, and a great chance is lost for a real advance in international relationships in any particular area. This was a decision taken by Bob Hawke, Gareth Evans and Paul Keating at the tlood. I think it is virtually impossible now to imagine that we could have gotten the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong into one regional organisation for an initiative at any time in the last year or so, or perhaps gotten a postNAFrA United States into such an organisation. Just to retlect upon a whole range of other activities which have occurred since the late 1980s in the region, though many of them are very hopeful some of them are not so and there is a bit of orneriness and crankiness which might well have produced a totally different set of outcomes if that initiative had not been there. The thing about people like Paul Keating, Gareth Evans and Bob Hawke is that they punched above their weight, the weight of this nation, in international affairs and did a very effective job of it indeed. The problem with international politics is always that if you are not there doing that sort of thing, if you are not there providing the leadership, your country, particularly if it is a middle power like Australia, misses out. Nothing is static. As I said, you always have to have new initiatives. If I have one major disappointment with the remarks the Prime Minister has just made to us, it is that neither in his presentation at APEC nor in his presentation here today is there the slightest evidence of anything other than an almost traditional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting approachgood chaps chatting about good issues in an important way and making unexceptional statements. At the end of the day, you need to do a bit more than that if you are an Australian leader. We have to bat very clever indeed. Apart from that initiative on business travel, which is effectively setting up a pilot project with Korea, there is very little you can discern from this that seems to provide a new approach to affairs in this region as far as Australia is concerned. I think this government really does have to sort out its attitude to multilateralism and bilateralism. The one criticism they made of our foreign policy was insufficient aggressiveness in bilateral trading relations. Aggressiveness in bilateral trading relations these days is not an unknown factor in the international political system. There is a great deal of it. What aggressive bilateral relations generally constitutes these days is picking up a multilateral agreement, like that associated with the WTO, and getting into international legal circles or into bilateral relationships and punching somebody's head off. That is basically the sort of thing that has happened to us since we have pursued aggressive bilateralism. It is multilateralism, in fact, which is more the order of the day for what dominates regional affairs in a cooperative fashion. The bilateral role, in so far as there is a bilateral role-it is not unimportant-constitutes the softer approaches in international relationships of pursuing trade missions, of putting forward exhibitions of your country, of raising very specific matters that relate to affairs between two nations. That bilateral forum is not one in which you can resolve major trade issues unless you go super aggressive. As the government well knows, having had to handle it, we have been a victim of some very considerable aggression on this so-called aggressive bilateral basis. If you are punching above your weight, it has to be said that aggressive bilateralism will find you out very quickly. I think we have been found out in one or two areas of this very quickly. If you are going to do things bilaterally in the softer areas, as I mentioned, you need to do them fulsomely because the opportunities are there. Another disappointment I have with the Prime Minister in this regard is that he did not appear in India when he could have-he left it to his Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and his Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I went to the presentations there. I congratulate the foreign affairs department on their effort. It was a good exposition. There was the odd glitch. Nevertheless, it was a very useful performance. Mr Downer-We facilitated your making a speech.",36
186,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You facilitated my making a speech. I thank you for that. I had to speak on IT matters to the IT section of the business conference but I was pleased to do so. I was pleased to be able to do that. I take the opportunities as they come and I take them humbly, Alexander. I well recognise that from time to time it is necessary to do that. However, I also took the opportunity to be somewhat more discursive in discussions with a number of think-tanks in India and make a more detailed assessment of the direction of Australian foreign policy and of bilateral relationships between Australia and India. The Prime Minister's failure to put a day or two into that was a tragedy. There was a real opportunity there for a Prime Minister wanting to initiate things in international affairs make his mark because there is a degree of vacant space as far as that relationship we have with India is concerned. That vacant space was not filled. The Prime Minister missed a very useful opportunity to fill it. The APEC leaders forum, as the Prime Minister has said, does provide an opportunity for leaders to meet. It is now starting to perform quite a critical function. Leaders will not simply sit around and talk about trade matters; they will want to talk more discursively about regional affairs. We are beginning to develop in the Asia-Pacific region something that resembles the sort of security community that people are used to in other regional areas of the globe be it in the Middle East, central Europe or western Europe. What that involves is a number of nations sorting out diplomatically for the first time in the experience of most of them the types of regional arrangements that guarantee security. These leaders meetings are critical in that regard. They are not just critical for being an opportunity to get to know each other. If that is all they are then they are useful but not crucial. If APEC is going to continue to have the meaning that it ought to have, if the leadership meetings associated with APEC are to continue and still be reflective of a willingness of all leaders to attend, then that is the part of APEC which is most at risk. That requirement on leaders to attend, because they are all busy people and they do not go just to meet good chaps, is totally incumbent upon those of us who really believe in the organisation to actually put forward initiatives and sometimes those initiatives will need to be outside the trade area. I think there were a number of areas we could have advanced a little further at APEC than we did. I would like to have seen more of an effort on bringing in observer status to a number of nations which are on the borders of the APEC region. I would also like to have seen more opportunity taken to utilise APEC as a forum for establishing further a Chinese role in global affairs. It is a very difficult task we have to pursue-the appropriate integrato tion of China into the international political system. The ASEAN regional forum is doing a very good job on that. APEC is another forum where those issues can be pursued. It is a broader regional base than the ASEAN regional forum. I think there is a deal of evidence now that, at least in the ASEAN regional forum, there is an element of cleverness in the engagement of China which is beginning to work. You can make an argument about that but, nevertheless, that is the case. Though there is a much higher focus on trade matters at APEC, you will not simply get leaders coming out year after year or every couple of years to APEC functions unless those leadership meetings can supply that broader based capacity for diplomatic initiatives, coming from countries like Australia. I mentioned China. China is an area where the Prime Minister has a deal of fixing to do. I am very glad to see that he is going to take a trip to China during the course of next year. The problems that he has with China are largely problems of foreign policy inexperience of this government. That is simply the fact of the matter. When we were in office we could pursue a whole range of sensitive issues with China, be they issues of democratisation, be they issues of development and maintenance of democracy in Hong Kong, be they issues of cultural rights of the Tibetan people, or be they other human rights issues. We could pursue those actively with the Chinese without giving them cause to take offence. We have a record of being able to do that. Why could we do that? We could do that for a variety of reasons. One reason is that the Chinese government of the day basically accepted us as people of honour. Mr Downer-What did Keating say to Lee Kuan Yew?",38
187,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am being heckled by the foreign minister in this regard. One of the problems that we have is that the foreign minister, as head of the department of foreign affairs, decapitated our sense of honour with the position that he pursued on the DIFF projects-a position which would have got him into a deal more hot water in a government that took questions of honour seriously in this place. If that were the case he would now find himself an ambassador or in some other appropriate position elsewhere instead of the position he now holds. The simple fact of the matter is this: our contemporary problems with China started with that. They were then pursued by the inexperience of the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) and the overclaiming of what was indeed a good outcome in our ministerial discussions with the United States-an overclaiming on our part, not on the part of the United States, as to what all that meant in terms of regional affairs. When that was combined with stupid statements from the Minister for Defence, the Chinese naturally assumed that it was the first stage of putting in place some sort of containment strategy. I do not think much of the subtleties of what President Clinton had to say here was missed by the Australian population and the media, but one of the subtleties was missed, and that was his firm declaration of what the nature of the Australian-American bilateral relationship was in connection with our relationship with China and the US relationship with China. He felt the need to set that very firmly on the record. He had to set it very firmly on the record because of the Chinese reaction to the position which had been put deliberately, but with great inexperience, by the government at the time of those discussions with the Americans. When impressions once created on so many fronts-be they in our attitudes to questions of racial harmony in this nation, be they our attitudes to approaches to the region, be they our views on defence-match a particular stereotype that may have been there in the past, a redoubled effort is required to fix them. The Prime Minister has a redoubled task; a task greater than he should have had when he goes to see the leadership in China on his visit next year. The Prime Minister also made one serious error, I believe, in the time he was overseas. Mr Griffin-Only one?",39
188,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Only one serious error. This is an error of commission as opposed to omission, and therefore more serious. The ones that I have been talking about thus far have been errors of omission; this is one of commission, when he decided to reorder the relationship that has been established and sustained since they were in office in relation to our major partners in international affairs. Where we have accorded an equal weight to our relationship with Japan, our relationship with Indonesia and our relationship with the United States, the Prime Minister managed to relegate the Indonesian relationship. The problem with the Prime Minister is that he will never admit a mistake. He will never retreat from a bad position. He will never admit it. It does not matter even if it happens to be about whether he has appropriate mechanisms for establishing the probity of his ministers. He sets up a set of standards for the probity of his ministers and finds that his ministers cannot conform with them, particularly when any minister is capable of putting the weights on him. So the problem is not the administration of it but the policy. The policy has to be changed to fit the circumstances of what the Prime Minister is proposed to bear. I asked the Prime Minister a question yesterday that gave him a chance to correct the position that he put forward. He seemed to understand that he made a bit of an error. He got up and said, 'I should not have said what I said on that particular occasion, but I have decided on a new approach to that now. I will not correct that in relation to the Indominister. nesians. They are important to us, but I will never again establish a hierarchy in our relationships around us.' So we are supposed to believe from this point on that the relationship we have with Antigua is the same as the one that we have with the United States, that the relationship we have with Belize is as significant to us as the one that we have with Japan and so on. It is obviously the case that some relationships are going to be more important to countries than others. You would not say, for example, that the relationship with a nation of the size of Papua New Guinea would necessarily be very important to Australia, but it is important for the simple reason of its geographic proximity. Likewise with Canada. Canada to the United States would simply be your average middle power but for the fact that the US shares a border and a long history with the Canadian people. So therefore they have a completely different attitude to them. We have an attitude to the United States because we have been defended by them. That is why they are substantially important to us. We have a relationship with Japan that is enormously significant to us because of the development of patterns of trade and investment in association with Japan. We have a relationship with Indonesia which is critical to us because of geographic proximity and the fact that we live forever together in this region and we simply have to get on. It is entirely appropriate to establish a hierarchy of relationships in international affairs. Simply because you are embarrassed about it is no reason to walk away from it. So the Prime Minister does not get himself off the hook for that very substantial error of omission in the remarks that he made in answer to the position that I put forward. Next year the Prime Minister has a very substantial task to perform. He has to overcome an impression in the region around usand I do not believe this visit helped more than a little in this regard-that we have lost our way in policy towards the region. The reason why that perception is abroad is that of the errors I have already referred to, essentially errors committed by his foreign But they are also errors of his own. I referred to one just a moment ago. The other was the extraordinary speeches the Prime Minister made in Indonesia, which when you dovetail it with his relegation of them in the hierarchical order must still have President Soeharto scratching his head as to what they were all up to. The simple fact is that he repeatedly erected this straw man. 'Australia is not part of Asia,' he said. There was a repeat of this something like 16 times in official statements. Not that anybody had ever said this before but, when you repeat something for the 16th time and nobody is used to hearing it before, you are entitled to think that the person who makes it for the 16th time is trying to make a point that you had better work out-is this gentleman trying to offend us or what, having made this point so frequently? A second remark that he made was that we were not a bridge to Asia, when successive Australian governments have been arguing in the international business community that we are precisely that economically, and sought to take advantage of it. Indeed, all those businessmen so honourably referred to at Subic Bay were people who had been living on the notion of us being a bridge to Asia for a very substantial period of time. This is an area which he must correct and he must correct very substantially. I had an opportunity before the Prime Minister went to APEC to go to both India and Indonesia. I was delighted to be accompanied by our foreign affairs spokesman, Laurie Brereton. I will tell you one of the things that really impressed me about the Indonesians. They seemed to believe that they had a job to do. That job was that there was a relationship with Australia that had to be sustained and they ought to sustain it. It was a very interesting thing to be on the receiving end of somebody else's initiatives and to see our ministers on the receiving end of somebody else's initiatives. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other ministers who were up there indeed had a good set of ministerial consultations between the Indonesians and themselves at the time. They were good because the Indonesians took control of the agenda and dealt with it. Indeed, the one great initiative out of that-and it was a really terrific initiative-whereby we now jointly go into partnership dealing with development issues in eastern Indonesia was an initiative of theirs, not of ours. That was the most substantial thing to emerge from it. That is no bad thing in one sense. It is no bad thing that we should be the object of somebody else's bilateral initiative. Indeed it is good. It shows the essential underlying health of a relationship created by the previous government. But that we had nothing therefore to say to them of very much moment at the time is a disappointment on our side. And a great deal of work will have to continue to be done by them to sustain the relationship which we have managed to build up over the years. The Prime Minister these days does not seem to be capable of making a statement without having some sort of ambiguous element included within it. So today, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) got up and asked him a question, the Prime Minister got up and said, 'Well, yes, what you said in characterising my remarks was right, but I'd also said the opposite in the set of the same speeches.' We find that many features of this speech he has just delivered here to us represent two bob each way. He said: Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. But our position is a positive one based on the assessment that liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the economy. On the one hand, we will talk liberalisation; on the other hand, we will only liberalise when somebody else gets into the show and does it as we would want them to. So we get the old two-handed approach again. He continued: APEC's ambitions will be realised only if all participating economies continue to liberalise. Not every economy will move at the same pace in the same area. One thought. He continued: And APEC does not require mathematically precise reciprocity. The other thought comes in. Again, it is the old two-handed policy coming forward from the Prime Minister on this. Indeed, APEC is making some very considerable progress, and we ought to be glad of it. It is sometimes said that the other nations in APEC are not doing as much as we are or not doing enough. I think it is true to say that they probably have not done as much as we have. But are they on their glide paths, so to speak, to the objectives that were set for 2010 and 2020? Yes, many of them are. There is a very interesting study, which I would commend to all honourable members. It is a paper produced by the Australia-Japan Research Centre at the ANU. It shows the trade liberalisation timetables of each APEC economy compared with a glide path which takes their general tariff rates from 1993 out to complete liberalisation by 2010-2020, consistent with the Bogor declaration. It shows most countries well on track-and that includes, in particular, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. The US is slightly above its glide path, and Japan is well above its glide path. So, quite clearly, there are things that have to be considered by those two nations. But it is not a bad outcome to see that those other countries are basically in the business of conforming to what it is that they have committed themselves to-and that very major objective is one of them. One thing I compliment the government on and agree with them on is that they have determined that there should be a selling job done on APEC in the Australian community. There is much to sell as far as APEC is concerned. The massive expansion that has taken place in Australian trade in manufactured goods and services in the region around us is a product of our liberalisation and their liberalisation. That means thousands of jobs in this country. Then you can go into the area where President Clinton is taking initiative in-and I would commend the Prime Minister to give consideration to his words on free trade in information technology. This is an area of vast opportunity for Australia over the course of the next decade or two. We are, outside of Japan, the most sophisticated IT market in the region and the second biggest. Some of our commentators sometimes like to sit around in armchairs and criticise the performance of Australian business and Australian governments from time to time on these sorts of issues and generally lend weight to a view that Australia is an pant in the international economy. If you want to establish that that is baloney, you can do it on many fronts. But you can do it on no better front than the area of information technology, where we massively outweigh-in the performance of our capacity to absorb it and our economy and export services related to it-all the Asian tigers, bar Japan, by a country mile. I am not talking here in relative terms; I am talking here in absolute terms. The rate of increase in employment in this sector in this country is about 20 per cent per annum, which is a very heavy rate of increase in employment. Mr Crean-Under the computer bountyhut they cut that.",39
189,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"But it also has to be said-and I am grateful for our opposition spokesman on industry getting in before I could make the point-that, as you go through every single one of the areas in which we have improved our performance in elaborately transformed manufactured goods exports, you find somewhere standing in there an initiative in industry policy of the previous government, be it in the car plan, be it in the steel plan, be it in the R&D tax concessions, be it in the bounties associated with shipbuilding, which were massive, and of course with computers-and be it, above all, I have to say, in the sorts of partnership agreements that we have in the electronics industry, feeding off the very substantial purchases in the Australian economy of Telstra. The improved export performance largely in this region has been exponential-from $50 million in value in 1983 when we came into office to over $1 billion now and reputedly $1 Y2 billion by the end of this century. But you rip Telstra out from those underpinnings and from that, essentially, gentleman's agreement which nobody could ever legislate and the performance will become very shonky indeed. Companies which were once 100 per cent dependent on their sales to Telstra now total only 50 per cent50 per cent is still your bread and butter-and if you remove that 50 per cent then the rest of the performance goes altogether. We have a terrific story to tell on APEC, as indeed this inferior particigovernment can tell. Unfortunately, as it tells its story, it is going to have to qualify that by the realities of the impact of the changes in industry policy that it has put in place and those wonderful statistics that you can point to. That trade liberalisation in the region-feeding, however, off industry policy here-may well start to change. It will take a few years, but it may well start to change, and that will be to the detriment of our ability to selI this to the Australian community in the way in which it ought to be sold. But, above alI, apart from any political selling job, the reality will be that it wilI be to the detriment of employment opportunity here. So I would encourage the Prime Minister to actually keep going abroad, but I would encourage him to take an attitude other than that of good chaps meeting together and coming back with something other than simply commentaries on it. I hope that when he goes abroad in the future he will go abroad with initiatives. I just hope he will not let down people in the way in which he let down the Indians. I hope that when his own government have made a few errors they will at least admit mistakes to themselves, if they will not admit them to anyone else, and put in place the essential corrective to restore the honour that we need restored if we are going to continue to play the sort of role that the previous government enabled us to play in Asia when we punched, as I said before, so magnificently above our weight.",42

192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to develop a vision or policy for Australian industry, thereby jeopardising job opportunities, higher growth and improved Act--Council of the net exports. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",43
193,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Never has a new government so quickly betrayed its constituencies. This was a government elected on a promise to help Australian industry. It promised to keep the computer bounty established by Labor. It promised to keep Labor's 150 per cent tax concession. It promised to ensure 10 per cent of government purchases went to small business. It promised not to Labor's export assistance schemes. And, most importantly, it promised to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the tum of the century. But the government have delivered on none of these. The reason is that we have an industry minister who cannot deliver for industry. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) delivers compliantly only for Treasury. It is worth looking at what he has delivered for Treasury to the detriment of Australian industry. In his first year he delivered a $4 billion cut to industry assistance. Well done, Minister! A 27 per cent cut to support for industrial research and developing ment, with more to come as the cuts bite in the out years. He allowed the 150 per cent tax concession to be traded to Tim Fischer's leadership via the diesel fuel rebate. His only defence, as he told the Financial Review, was that it could have been worse. 'Treasury actually wanted to cut further,' he said, 'and pip, pip, haven't I done well!' Not only has he broken a promise but it could have been worse, and he expects industry to cop that. He allowed himself to be mugged by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in abolishing research and development syndication. So thin was the justification for the decision that he put four examples into his press release. He called them 'actual examples' and yet, as his department admitted in the Senate, not one of them was an actual syndicate. Wc have now got the Wright family moved into research and development syndication. But, unlike Minister Vanstone, who had the decency to tum up in the Senate, admit a mistake and apologise, there was no apology from this man-no apology for the fact that he has misled the House. He also got mugged over the Howe Leather affair, allowing himself to be given the job of finding an adequate compensation package-something we have not yet seen come forward. He is still working on it no doubt because he knows that he has to come up with some form of compensation. We also have to realise that he delivered on the abolition of bounties not only for the cut computer industry but for the Australian book industry, the machine tools and robotics industry and, of course, the shipbuilding industry. We know his own backbenchers have some serious concerns now about the shipbuilding bounty. His Western Australian colleagues are lobbying him to reverse this decision-as well they should, because Labor argued from the very beginning that they should reverse on this. We have seen a huge growth in the shipbuilding industry in this country because of the bounty scheme. Regional centres all around the country from Fremantle to Hobart to Darwin to Brisbane are all in the shipbuildindustry because they got support. But this government has cut that assistance from them. You have got the backbench of the Liberal Party wanting to know why the minister is prepared to look at a compensation package for Howe Leather but not for the shipbuilding industry in Western Australia. The minister has attended that state on two occasions and has not taken up the request of the shipbuilding industry to meet with them. We have the Premier of Western Australia supporting Labor in its call for the retention of this ship bounty. But it all falls on the deaf ears of the minister. We have suggestions of the Western Australian senators crossing the floor on the shipbuilding industry issue. We will be interested to see how they vote, to see whether they do vote for Australian jobs and for jobs in Western Australia or whether they, like the minister, are prepared to continue to be mugged. He has also been rolled by the Treasurer on a submission that sought to implement government election promises on government purchasing. This was his latest defeat. He had briefed all the journalists about how his first major initiative on industry policy was going to be the utilisation of government purchasing. It is another promise that the government said it was going to honour but which is now completely in tatters because the minister has been rolled by the Treasurer again. This is a person who does not get rolled just by the Treasurer in this government; he happens to be so ineffective he gets rolled by committee secretaries as well. We have Senator Tierney refusing the minister's request to set up a bipartisan parliamentary committee to look at ways of ensuring the future of the Australian steel industry. What could be more important to the regional centres of Why alia and Newcastle and Port Hedland in the Pilbara? But the minister will not embrace the bipartisan approach, because his committee secretary will not allow him to. But even on arguably the most important promise-to deliver 200,000 new manufacturing jobs-he has also failed, because he has participated in decisions which will significantly reduce the number of manufacturing jobs. He has not even asked his department to tell him how he can achieve the 200,000 target. But if you thought that was enough, wait, there is more! The other day he called for a further review of the programs of his department. The minister said he hopes the review will not be used as an excuse for further cuts to industry assistance. He hopes! Under him industry has got no hope. How much faith can Australian industry have in a minister who has been so ineffective in such a short space of time-particularly in light of the fact that the review is to bring down an interim report by March, in plenty of time for the Treasurer to use it to pull more money out of what he calls business welfare? Industry, Minister, does not want any further cuts. It wants a government with a vision for Australian industry. It wants a statement of industry policy by this government and a commitment to programs which will support Australian industry in its development, in jobs growth, in net export growth and in correcting the current account as well as the deficit. It is for those reasons that, as an important response, the Labor Party is opposing in the Senate the measures that have been proposed by this government to cut industry assistance. Funding for research and development and for bounties are not costs in the budget; they are investments in the future of the nation. They lead to higher growth, they lead to increased jobs, they lead to regional economic development and they lead to net exports-all of the things that you say you aspire for this nation but for which you are prepared to put nothing in place to help achieve. So complete has been the betrayal of Australian industties and so concerned are they about the direction this government has so quickly moved to that there has been a litany of calls from business groups in the community for this government to articulate some sort of vision of industry policy. You can go through the headlines: 'Industry calls for a complete industry policy'; 'Industry looks in vain for policy'; 'Industry policy has no vision, say chiefs'; 'More flack flies over Canberra's industry policy'; 'ACCI' - the greatest supporter of this government-'sights on industry policy'; and 'Industry calls for a vision'. This is a damning indictment of industry policy under this government, and from the people who were looking to you for the sort of support they expected to get out of the place. We have to acknowledge that people on this side of the House happen to like this man. He is a nice man. He can actually be very pleasant company. But the fact is that as a minister he is a dud. He is totally ineffective. He could not represent anything. There are rumours that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is looking for fresh fields-Foreign Affairs-because of the debacle that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has created. But if Mr Reith really wants to test his leadership credentials against the Treasurer-and we know how keen he is in that regard-what better place to do it than in the industry portfolio? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should reflect on this as he thinks through his first major reshuffle. Labor's approach to industry policy draws a clear contrast with that of the coalition. It recognises that there is a role for government in industry policy, that there is not a level playing field in the international marketplace. The policy focuses on securing jobs in existing industries and making the most of the potential for jobs growth in new ones. It is about identifying the opportunities for this country and realising the potential. It is a more active approach. It is explicitly interventionist and it recognises the limits of the free market philosophy. It also actively encourages and supports manufacturing industry as well as the new high-growth, high-skill service industries. Whilst such a policy approach signals a more interventionist approach, it does not mean a return to the old, inward-looking protectionist approach. Indeed, that is an approach that the National Party wants to pursue. That is the division that is going on in the debate. It is a free market approach in the Liberal Party and a protectionist and Black Jack MCEwen approach in the National Party. These must be great debates. No wonder industry has given up on getting a vision out of this government. Neither is our policy one that involves a 'dead hand of government' approach. It is not about propping up poor performers. Rather, our approach involves working with industry and regions to develop and support industries and firms that embrace best practice and that are internationally competitive. We do support the continued opening of international markets. We as a government invested too heavily in the Cairns Group, in the GATT outcome and in the APEC approach-as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has just spent some time going through-to let that go. So we argue that the approach we are pursuing has to be in the context of aggressively pursuing more open international markets. But, because our approach involves a much greater degree of industry input rather than being simply government driven, the interven"" lion or assistance that we advocate may vary from industry to industry, from region to regIon. It may mean, for example, better addressing market access issues. It means more aggressively pursuing the bilateral focus but against the backdrop of the multilateral framework that Labor put in place and Labor established because it was prepared to address important issues of industry reform. We went to the GATT negotiations for the first time in the history of this country with a policy that said, 'Do as we say and as we are prepared to do.' The National Party used to front, as representatives of this nation, for decades and say, 'Open up your markets to our agricultural produce.' When those markets said, 'Yes, but what about you opening up yours to our manufactures?' they were dumbstruck because they had no response. They did not go with clean hands; they did not go with integrity; they did not go with consistency. Labor introduced that for the first time. That is why we now have the framework. We are not going to let that go. But in pursuing it aggressively, in pursuing the continued opening up, we are not going to be the only ones leading in the field. The other forms of assistance that could come by way of this interventionist approach are: to encourage innovation across industry sectors through support for skill formation, research and development and commercialisation; to better use the leverage of government purchasing-something the minister has again failed on; better access to capital through instruments such as pooled development funds; Commonwealth leadership and leverage to ensure the development of major infrastructure projects; tailored assistance through, for example, the bounties and factor F scheme; and a focus on industry plans such as the steel plan and the car plan. This country needs an industry policy. In this parliament, it is only the Labor Party that is committed to developing one.",44
194,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was not much of an effort. For most of it, I was reading Australia Reconstructed, which reminded me of all sorts of things. It has a magnificent photograph of some of the former presidents of the ACTO. Over the last nine months, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been peddling the line that the government has no industry policy. For reasons I will outline in a moment, the member is wrong-dead wrong. It is interesting to ask, however, why the member is peddling this line. It is quite clear that he has decided that this is the issue on which he will campaign for the leadership of the Labor Party. We all know on this side of the House that the member for Hotham has been moving around business in Melbourne trying to sell a line; we all know that Bill Kelty has been running around Melbourne peddling the same line. We also know about the struggle on the left of the Labor Party involving the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and their role in the debate on the future economic policy of the Labor Party and what role they are playing in the struggle. In short, that the member for Hotham is trying to use industry policy to build an unholy alliance between the Right and the Left of the party to deliver himself the leadership. I wish him luck because the Crean-KeltyFerguson line, the accord line, the Australia Reconstructed line, this wonderful recycled line-and it is a bit battered, Simon; you may have to get a new cover, but it is a remake, a re-run, so it is no wonder it is looking pretty ordinary-has been responsible for the economic mess that we inherited and for the shambles of an industry policy we inherited when we came to office. At the heart of this debate is the fundamental difference between the government and the opposition about the key foundations of industry policy. The Labor Party's 13 years of office were characterised by a small number of sectoral policies covering a small number of industries while ignoring the general economy and the rest of industry-in other words, the old game of trying to pick a winner. The government believes that it is critically important for all industry in Australia, and for us, to get the economic fundamentals right first, to clean up Labor's mess, to provide a stable, growing economic base before we introduce changes to the direction of industry policy. What did 13 years of Labor government, 13 years of the accord, 13 years of the KeltyCrean-Ferguson industry recipe deliver to Australian business? It delivered nothing but regression and a bleak future. The Labor Party, the party that pitches itself as the workers' party, abandoned Australian business. Under Labor, Australia had the second highest interest rates among developed nations and the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression; the manufacturing sector was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs and has shown no net growth in employment in the last 12 years; business investment declined to its lowest level on record; Australia's average productivity improvement was just 0.9 per cent-half the world's average for this century; foreign debt increased by 800 per cent; and real household incomes fell by nine per it is clear cent. A dreadful record! The critical point is that Labor's industry policy over the last 13 years, despite all the hype and despite the attempt by the member for Hotham to put the best gloss on it, was not an industry policy which worked for all Australian industry or for all Australian workers. The simple fact is that Labor's industry policy failed Australian industry. Labor took their eye off the single most important part of the industry policy ball-the state of the general economy. I welcome this debate today because it allows me to directly rebut the attempt by the member for Hotham to suggest that there is no government industry policy. The government's industry policy is quite clear. It is understood and supported by industry generally. Our policy is in two parts. The first step is the short term-to get the basic economic parameters right. Most businesses receive no direct assistance from the federal government. The most important thing the government can do for industry is to get the economy right. In fact, as a responsible government, we have no choice. For this, we make no apology. Our first obligation on coming to office has been to set the budget and to begin to rebuild the economy. We are now seeing the results. Interest rates have come down. All businesses and all industry have benefited from this. I make no apology for it being the first key step in our industry policy. The key part of getting our economic foundations right has been the passage of the government's industrial relations legislation. The simple fact is that no single piece of legislation has been more welcomed by industry in this country for many years than the government's industrial relations legislation. It is time the Labor Party acknowledged this fact. It is time the Labor Party clearly stated that they will not change the legislation in the unlikely event that they will return to office. The first element of the government's economic and industrial policy is bearing fruit. The fall in interest rates alone will help all Australian businesses, as has the passage of the industrial relations legislation. The second step in our industry policy is the longer term, and it involves three priorities. They are designed to ensure that Australian industry fully prepares for the competitive environment that we will face by the year 2010 as a result of our APEC obligations. Few businesses fully understand the challenges they will face by the year 2010. However, the government is aware of the significance of the challenge and has built the key elements of its industry policy around the need to ensure that Australian industry is fully prepared for the opportunities which will come to our industry by that year. The first of our priorities is therefore to adopt a clear investment strategy for Australia. Competition for investment is becoming more intense around the world. Investment growth is vital for our national future as it is the basis on which secure jobs are built. Attracting investment will be a priority for the government. We will not be offering outlandish incentives, but we will ensure that Australia is a welcoming and competitive environment for investment and that businesses are able to deal quickly and efficiently with the federal government. Reducing red tape and the delays and complexity involved in dealing with the government when investing in Australia is an absolute priority for the new government. We will not be reducing standards, but we will ensure that Australian government processing does not discourage investment. Research and development is the second of our three priorities. I do not accept the criticism made by the member for Hotham of our recent changes to R&D arrangements. In fact, I find the criticisms of the opposition rather ridiculous. Their track record is hardly one of distinction. Under Labor-under their so called 'clever country' policies-Australian business expenditure on R&D slipped to 18th out of 24 OECD nations, despite billions of dollars spent on incentive programs. That is an appalling record. Australian business expenditure on R&D as a share of GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average. That is quite some record. In 1995 alone Australia bought $20 billion worth of technology developed by other countries, despite Labor's promises to make Australia the clever country. Further, the syndication arrangements we inherited from the last government were out of kilter. There was a disproportionate emphasis on the financial structures of the syndicates rather than on genuine R&D. The eight attempts by the last government to amend the system underline this. Our new R&D package, with a 125 per cent deduction and the START program, has corrected this imbalance. Taken as a whole, our R&D package is very competitive by world standards. If the opposition was serious about supporting genuine R&D, they would support the passage of these changes through the Senate. I am particularly concerned to ensure that as a nation we get the 'D' part of R&D right. We must encourage a much closer relationship between those doing so much good research in Australia and business. We must do more to ensure that Australia's research is turned into commercial reality right here in Australia. It is critical if we are to have growth in secure jobs. The third priority involves ensuring that Australian companies gain fair access to world markets. As I have said, our commitment to our obligations for 201 0 under APEC is strong and not negotiable. But I believe that, in making the concessions that have been made so far, the former government did not push strongly enough for full and fair access for Australian companies to world markets. We must make sure that non-trade barriers do not subvert the move to free trade. This will be the basis of our future APEC negotiations. In addition to these three priorities, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has also announced the establishment of the employment subcommittee of cabinet. Through the work of that committee, the government is developing policies to further assist Australian try. Unlike the previous government, we are concerned about issues such as the availability of capital, particularly for small business; ensuring our work force is trained to meet the needs of industry; maximising the benefits of strategic advantages; and ensuring that government interference in industry is eliminated. As a result of our industry policy, Australia will have a much stronger and more favourable climate for business. The changes have begun and will provide benefits for all Australians. We have already seen a fall in interest rates. We want business investment in Australia and we are determined to encourage it. We are a business and investment friendly government. We believe this is essential to secure jobs in the future. In the course of the member for Hotham's tour de force this afternoon around the RollsRoyces of Flemington, as he does on most occasionsMr Crean-I don't go to the races, John.",46
195,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Back-seat passengers in Rolls-Royces are one of your fortes-and you know what I am talking about! You are well known around Melbourne for back seats in Rolls-Royces. Mr Martin Ferguson-That was Wilson Tuckey, John.",49

197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,And so is the member for Hotham.,49
198,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There were a couple of points raised by the member for Hotham in his wide-ranging and rambling speech. I do not think it got him any votes this afternoon, but it is worth referring to the question of government purchasing. No final decision has been made on that, and it will be coming back for consideration. The future of the steel industry, which was raised by the honourable member for Hotham, was another of these great attempts by the member. You will indus- remember the afternoon when you were playing around and got turfed out. So you rushed outside and said that you would form another committee. That made committee No. 5-the state government, your committee and all the other committees around the place. We have offered you a joint committee to investigate",49
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,49
200,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have offered to the Labor Party a joint approach in relation to the developments in the steel industry . We will be responding in relation to those matters and, as the company itself has pointed out, they do not wish the steel industry development of Australia to become a political football but rather a commercial development. As such, we will not be embarking upon a complete farce in that area. The government has a clear and vigorous industry policy. More importantly, it is an industry policy which is working. This is shown clearly by the reduction in interest rates since the election. Just as importantly, it is an industry policy based on supporting all of Australian industry, not just a few privileged groups. It is designed to encourage Australian industry to become internationally competitive, forward looking, and fully prepared for the year 2010. (Time expired)",49
201,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is indeed a timely debate because there is a crisis of confidence which has emerged in the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and in this government as far as the direction of industry policy is concerned. I listened very carefully to what the minister had to say in his speech. I think I am a fair person, but there was nothing in this speech that gave any indication to me, firstly, that minister had any grasp of his portfolio and, secondly, that anything he said would inspire confidence in Australian industry. As I listened to the minister's speech, I think we heard the root of the problem as far as the industry policy of this government is concerned, because the industry minister mentioned that he had to clean up an economic mess. He had to get the economy right. He had to rebuild the economy. Mr Bruce Scott-Yep.",49
202,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is that so? You halfwit! There is a four per cent growth rate, two per cent inflation, a declining unemployment rate, interest rates on the decline, industrial relations figures that are the lowest for 30 years-and you categorise that as an economic mess, something you have got to put right and something you have to rebuild.",50
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Corio will address his remarks through the chair, and then we will get the 'yous' straight.",50
204,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I certainly will. Under intense provocation from the economic imbeciles on the other side, I was forced to respond. Following the ministerial sackings in the wake of the government's recent code of conduct scandal, there have been persistent rumours about the political future of the industry minister. Indeed, I have even seen it mentioned that he is going to be reshuffled in his portfolio and that he might be seeking an overseas post. If I can use the football analogy, the rumours are that he is being moved from a key forward position to the back pocket. Those of us who have played footy know that, when you get to the back pocket, you've got one leg over the fence anyway. We on this side of the House would be very unhappy about this situation. We want him moved off the field. We want him dropped from the side and we want him removed from the portfolio and from industry. And it needs to be done quickly for the sake of Australian industry and for the sake of the Australian economy. In many ways, Australian industry, particuthe larly manufacturing industry, is at the crossroads. The Australian economy has come through an intensive period of restructuring that has seen dramatic changes in the way Australia's management and labour perform their work. The previous Labor government guided that process and established a macroeconomic environment in which industry could draw confidence and indeed could grow, and I mentioned the fruits of that labour previously. We engineered a steady growth rate of four per cent, reduced the inflation rate from double digits to between two and three per cent, we left this government with a declining unemployment rate and, of course, interest rates were lowering as well. The previous Labor government also set in place a range of industry assistance arrangements designed to specifically stimulate growth, create jobs and lift exports. Above all, Australian industry had industry ministers with energy and vision and they had a government that they could trust and have confidence in. What Australian industry needs now, as it develops beyond the year 2000, is a minister with a vision and a government with the will and capacity to lead industry development in this country. Unfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker, in this government and minister it has neither. There is a crisis of confidence in Australian industry at this point in time, and it stems from a number of factors. There are doubts about the capacity of the key economic spokespersons in the government to really get on top of the economic task. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has an economic record of failure. We have a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who categorises four years of growth as five minutes of sunshine. We have a failed New South Wales Premier in the finance portfolio and, of course, we have the industry minister, that industrial fairy who flits from factory to factory sprinkling moon dust. He says much, but he does very little. Mr Martin Ferguson-It could have been worse.",50
205,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It could have been worse indeed. The second factor which has led to this crisis of confidence is that all these key economic spokespersons in the government have persistently talked down the economy in the budget preparations. I have just alluded to the fact that we left the Liberal and National parties an economy growing at four per cent, inflation at two per cent and unemployment on the way down. Yet the key economic spokespersons can roam this country, in preparation for the budget, and talk down the Australian economy. Is there any wonder that there is a crisis of confidence in the government and their major spokespersons? Of course, there is another factor as to why there is a crisis of confidence in this minister. He lost the budget battle, and we have seen the withdrawal of key industry policy measures that have delivered support and encouragement to Australian industry over the past 13 years. In very simple terms, this industry minister is a cream puff. He would blow away in a breeze. He got rolled in the budget deliberations. Australian industry wanted an industry minister with some hobnailed boots on who would go in and defend, in the face of the onslaught by Treasury, the programs that have served them so well. What did they get? They got a dilettante who wears a smoking-jacket. He smokes a pipe, sips a martini and wears pink slippers. Mr Martin Ferguson-Does he wear stockings?",50
206,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suppose we could be thankful for the fact that he does not wear black fish-net stockings. You can be grateful for small mercies. The lack of personal confidence in this minister, who is responsible for the industry policy of this country, stems primarily from the lack of professional, political integrity that he has displayed in this place. I refer to the flagrant violation of the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct by the member for Ryan. We have all heard the recent debates in this place about this matter. These were codes of conduct that successive Labor industry ministers lived by with distinction. The code of conduct is very simple. Ministers are allowed to own shares. However, where there is a direct or apparent conflict of interest with the minister's portfolio responsibilities, the minister must divest. He must not trade in the shares that he owns. We all know the political reasons why the Prime Minister did not sack the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. What is more disturbing is the fact that the minister seemed oblivious to the gravity of his political situation. He stumbled on in question time with a lame duck defence that no-one believed, not even he or his Prime Minister, certainly not the opposition and not the industry community in this country. What signal did this send to Australian industry? It said that Australian industry had a minister who was prepared to violate a ministerial code of conduct for the sake of a share killing on the Stock Exchange. It demonstrated that the industry portfolio was in the hands of a man with no sense of ministerial propriety. It demonstrated clearly that they had a weak Prime Minister incapable of enforcing even basic ministerial standards. Let us go through the range of industry policies that were cut in this budget. They demonstrate very clearly the ineffectiveness of this minister. We have seen budget cuts to Austrade and Auslndustry and to the NIES program, where funds have been cut by 17 per cent. This was a program that had a success rate of 83 per cent. We have seen reductions in taxation concessions for research and development. The Industry Commission found that concessions contributed to net benefits to the Australian economy. We have seen the scrapping of the bounties that were alluded to by the shadow minister for industry, science and technology. Those bounties in ship building, books, computers and machine tools had all stimulated economic activity and the exports of this nation. Yet this is the minister who allowed the other economic ministers to roll him in the context of debate within the cabinet. These bounties are to be scrapped. We have seen the government abolish the DIFF scheme and severely curtail the export market development grants scheme. The regional implications of these cuts are substantial, and they are not understood by this minister. The endorsement of Labor's industry policy is contained in the words of the Victorian Liberal Premier in referring to Labor's $36 million-(Time expired)",51
207,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. It is quite ironic that the opposition declares a matter of public importance in the three areas of jobs, growth and exports. These are three areas in which the previous government let this country down badly. They are three areas in which the opposition brought despair to many Australian families and sent businesses to the wall. Mr Crean-What about 41/2 per cent growth?",52
208,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Hotham can shout and complain as much as he likes, but when it comes to jobs, the opposition has no legs to stand on. He is full of hot air today. We can all see that he is on a very good mission of self-promotion today. Mr O'Connor-I will stand on those legs.",52
209,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Corio is an equally impressive man-especially in his understanding of economics, which is indeed very limited. Let me help him out. The fruits of Labor were indeed very sour fruits. When the opposition was in government it brought this country to its knees. It was the Labor government which gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. Remember that? It was the Labor Party which put Australia into a situation of uncontrollable debt. It was the Labor government which believed in high interest rates. The opposition betrayed young people across this country. It put people through the turnstile of endless labour market programs which failed to bring real jobs. The end result was devastating for thousands of Australians, particularly young people. It led to poor esteem, an unworkable system and a poor outcome in the end. This government brings to economic and industry reform a holistic approachsomething that the Labor government never understood. It is an approach which is far more broadbanded, focused and directed than anything that the previous government could deliver. The opposition could not get away from sectoral boundaries. You were interested in sectoral boundaries and nothing else. You lacked the ability to tackle record current account deficits and high unemployment. Tell us about those. Mr Crean-Tell us about your policy. That's the debate.",52
210,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am telling you, and here I go. In 1994-95, the deficit was equal to six per cent of GDP. It was the worse in the OECD. This government came to power with an economy reeling from the burden of 13 years of compounding problems and a lack of confidence. Mr O'Connor interjecting",52
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Corio has had his go.,52
212,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'Tell us about productivity,' the member for Corio says. Perhaps I can refresh your memory here. Productivity was down, savings were down and investment was down. Do you remember those days? So much for your industry policy. Unemployment became the previous government's legacy for bringing real reform and growth to the industry. The previous government may have liked talking about the so-called 'big picture' approach. Remember the big picture approach? They were very good at talking about that. But, unfortunately, they never even got close. You never even got close to the big picture, did you? Instead, business and industry were left with a narrow-minded approach to problem solving. In reality, the Labor Party's industry policy was based on two important features: high interest rates and the unfair dismissal laws of the member for selfKingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). We have two high profile features here. The unfair dismissal laws in particular brought headaches for many businesses and Australian families. In my own electorate of Petrie-I speak to small business people; obviously you do not-small business owners are steering away from employing full-time people. They employ casual staff when they are required. The federal government has made a commitment to get the fundamentals right when it comes to industry policy-something that you never did. In fact, the most important thing that this government can do for industry is to get the economy right. A key step has already been taken with the reduction of interest rates. Let's talk about interest rates-a power mechanism-which were kept very high for too long. They were like a noose around the neck of business and industry. But this government is not going to stop there. We have a clear investment strategy, which is what is needed. We need to attract investment opportunities and encourage growth. That is important for rebuilding the Australian economy. Similarly, the government recognises that, to increase competitiveness, the removal of red tape is necessary, as is removing the delay and complexity that can be involved in dealing with government. The opposition let small business down. It allowed them to drown in a sea of paperwork-a bureaucratic nightmare which not only was a detriment to business but also had consequences for families and personal lives. Energies were diverted from making businesses viable and providing young people with real job opportunities. The situation was that we had red tape on doing business, red tape on how to do business and, in some cases, red tape upon red tape. You are very good with red tape. The government established the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The task force has reported and provided recommendations for consideration-recommendations which, I might add, have taken the interest of many people in the Petrie electorate. The Micro-business Consultative Group has already been established-you know thatand it has had a great impact on the establishment and growth of micro business. Have you ever heard of that? Eighty-two per cent of Australia's businesses are micro businesses. They employ fewer than five people. .·: This government is putting in place a platform that will mean more jobs, particularly for young people, lower interest rates and I greater productivity. In addition, the new workplace reforms to come into force on 1 )< { January 1997 will result in a better industrial relations system for the whole of Australia. Businesses will have certainty in hiring staff. Labour market reforms will help businesses to employ more staff. This is a government which listens to small business; a government which was prepared to make decisions which are necessary for capital reform to allow small business and industry to grow and prosper. This is a government which takes its commitment to business and industry very seriously. It has already commenced providing the platform and foundation for the creation of jobs and the growth and stability of business. As a small business operator in the service industry and also in the personnel industry, I know what it is like to run a small business. This government understands how hard it is to run a small business. I know what it is like at the month's end to look at the figures and know whether you are going to make it or not. We have already introduced a number of budgetary measures to recognise small business and their impact on the economy. In the budget we have introduced a number of economic settings that will support growth and investment. The theme of our budget was fiscal consolidation. Does the Labor Party know what this is? This is a very interesting matter of public importance. In the MPI there is mention of sustainable growth and job opportunity. If the opposition understood fiscal consolidation, it would understand that this is what fiscal consolidation is all about. The government has three central objectives here: to increase national savings, to reduce the pressure on the current account deficit-you do not talk about that very much-and to help sustain economic growth over the medium term. We are looking at it over the long haul. We have at the moment the best climate that we have ever had. We have a low interest rate and a low inflation environment for the first time in years. Under Labor we had the highest interest rates ever. The Labor government crippled small business with its boombust policies. This government has promised not to introduce any new taxes. Today we heard the Treasurer (Mr Costello) reiterate that, from 1 July, capital gains tax will be changed so that rollover relief will be available where assets of a small business are sold and proceeds are reinvested in the same or a like business within 12 months. This will help investment. Small business owners can claim capital gains tax relief of up to $500,000 if that money is put into a superannuation scheme to fund retirement or if it is invested in a like business. This is a very welcome move for business across Australia. Another area that I would like to talk about is the area of subcontracting. The government has announced that it is not going ahead with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) that the former government was going to introduce. That bill would have been devastating to subcontractors in the building industry-absolutely devastating-so they are very grateful to us for not even bringing it in in the first place. Another initiative is the modern apprenticeship training scheme which will helpMr Crean-That's just revamped Nettforce.",52
213,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Your labour market reforms never provided any jobs for anyone. At least our traineeship schemes will provide employment.

214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this discussion has now expired. NA NA BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(I) Clause I, page I (line 7), after ""Funding"", insert ""Laws"".

215,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (5.17 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments now before the House are amendments which were put to the legislation by the government in the Senate and they relate to one specific matter. The objective of these amendments is to enable the expansion of the board of the Australian National Training Authority by two additional members. Members will recall that the review of the Australian National Training Authority recommended an expansion of the board by two. That review also recommended the nature of these two amendments. The government does not accept the recommendation of the review in relation to the character of the parties who should fill these additional two positions, but the government does believe that it is desirable to expand the membership of the board. The reason for this is that we see the need within the community to increase and extend the support for the national training arrangements within the business community. The Australian National Training Authority is fortunate to have a very committed board and a board with a diversity of experience in both larger and smaller enterprises. However, it is also the case that the business community in Australia is very large and very diverse. bill, We know there are some 700,000 to 800,000 small and medium sized enterprises in this country and that they playa very significant role in providing employment and training. Indeed, much of the traditional training through the apprenticeship system has taken place within the small business sector. One of the great difficulties in the representation of such a diverse group of enterprises is to ensure that there are people on the board who are recognised not only as having experience in that area-and the board does already contain several members who have that experience and are widely respected through the small business sector-but people who also have links into wider business networks. It was recognised by the former government that appointments to the ANTA board should be on the basis of personal merit. That is a principle which the government certainly continues to support and regards as being very important. We should not have members of the board who are purely representatives of organisations. I am pleased to acknowledge the fact that Mr Bill Mansfield-a member of the ACTU who has been a member of the board-has been a highly significant contributor to the deliberations of the Australian National Training Authority. One of the things that has enabled him to be a contributor has been his links with the ACTU because they have given him access to a wide network of representatives. He is, of course, perhaps limited in his capacity to represent employees by the fact that a diminishingly small proportion of total employees is now represented through the ACTU but, taking that into account, we nevertheless acknowledge the fact that that membership has been valuable. He was not appointed by the ACTU, or nominated by them as a representative, but appointed in his individual capacity. It is our intention to make appointments to these additional two positions to the board of people who are fully justified as members by the quality of the contribution that they would be able to make to the deliberations of the Australian National Training Authority. We also intend to take into account, in making these appointments, the access of these members to the wider networks to which they belong. I know that the opposition has some reservations about this. I simply make the point that the national training framework, represented through the National Training Authority, was an initiative of the previous government which we believed was worthwhile and needed to be built upon. We are making significant reforms to this national training framework, but we would particularly like to enhance the support and understanding of this activity throughout the business community and that will be our intention. (Time expired)",54
216,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"In speaking to this Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1996 this afternoon, I would specifically like to refer to the report of the review of the ANTA agreement. In some ways I find myself in a difficult situation, and it relates to the fact that in many ways the opposition supports a suggestion that the board of ANTA ought to be expanded. Our difficulties relate to the appointments, and I will refer to what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) just said. He suggested that the people who ought to be appointed are people who have links with the broader business community. I suggest that is code for the minister to appoint, on the basis of patronage, people who have links to the government. If anything, I suggest that might be akin to the appointments recently made, as announced in this House yesterday, to the Centenary of Federation Council. I believe the issue of vocational education and training ought to be above petty politics. That is why the ANTA board has been highly successful, despite the fact that many in the government opposed, in its original sense, the establishment of the board of ANTA and its objectives. How can you take this government on trust? For example, take the government's appointments to the Centenary of Federation Council. Dick Smith is to chair the council. That is the type of person whom this government identifies with. Why? Because he was one of the biggest donors. He was the one who orchestrated a campaign in support of the election of the Howard government. Then we go on. This is the quality of the people the government likes to appoint. Professor Blainey was appointed, and he is another political cohort of the minister for schools. Then we have Phoebe Fraser, who is the daughter of a former Liberal Party Prime Minister. So I suggest that it all goes to a question of trust. Our real problem is that we do not trust this government with respect to the nature of appointments it might make to what we regard as one of the most important boards that exist, not just at the federal level of government but at all levels of government. It is not just a federal initiative. It goes to making sure that, at a state and federal level in all regions of Australia, we have in place a comprehensive policy for vocational education and training. In that context, I would like to refer to the fact that ANT A was established by the Commonwealth-after much debate and with the support of states-in December of 1992, coming into operation in 1993. In accordance with the establishment of the board, it was required by the heads of government agreement that a review of the operations of the board commence. The former government put that review in place in August 1995. It is interesting to note that the review was very much supported by all sections of Australian industry. Submissions were made by a range of business organisations, individual employers, government representatives and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The minister likes to make reference to the question of membership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and its affiliates. I will tell you what. We will put up our record against that of ACCI any day you want because, when you talk about broadly representative employer organisations, I do not suggest that ACCI is a broadly representative employer organisation in Australia. As for the BCA, we all know who they represent-the big end of town. If anything, they have very aggressive policies against the best interests of small business in Australia. My view is that the government ought to take up the recommendations of the report of the review of the ANTA agreement. With respect to ANTA, I will tell you why it is important that we make sure we do not politicise the board of ANTA. I agree with the minister. The original appointments were on the basis of merit. People were required to enter into meetings of the board of ANTA on the basis that they left their political baggage at the door. Every person who has participated in the operation of the board of ANTA has risen above their business links, union links or government links. That is why this government has now decided that the establishment of ANTA was the right thing and that we ought to go on to strengthen and improve its operations, as suggested in the report of the review of the ANTA agreement. Where I believe the government is falling short of embracing the intent of that review is that it is now politicising the appointments. (Time expired)",55
217,Mr HOLLIS,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"On this side of the House we agree that the board of ANTA should be expanded. Indeed, it was the Labor Party that commissioned the report of the review of ANTA, and it was recommended that the board be expanded by two. Two additional members were recommended, but the government disregarded the recommendation about who should be appointed, about where the appointments to the expanded board should come from. What the government is going to do is appoint a couple of its mates from big business-people who are acceptable to the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This government in power now is ideologically committed to business domination of training rather than adequate public input. This is just another example of this government's determination to show that there is a new game in town, and the game is to disperse patronage to the coalition's big business mates. So what do you need to have to be a government appointment? The first thing you need these days is to be a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. I suppose you would get by if you were a member of the National Party, but it is so much better if you are a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) pointed out the appointment that has been made this week. Have a look. It was Dick Smith. How did the Prime Minister justify this? He justified this by saying that Dick Smith had given all this money. He gave-what was it?-a million bucks to the Liberal Party campaign. So, obviously, not only do you have to be a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party but you have to make a significant contribution to the coffers of the Liberal Party. It is like Britain in the old days. At the turn of the century if you wanted to buy a peerage in Britain you made a contribution to the Conservative Party. Today if you want a government appointment to a board in Australia you make a big buck contribution. Mr Martin Ferguson-All they have to do is sell them.",56
218,Mr HOLLIS,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"That is what they will do next, sell appointments to government boards. You have to be in a position to make a significant contribution, a big buck contribution, to Liberal Party coffers. In that way you will be appointed to government boards. The one thing that should not be happening is that boards like ANTA should not be politicised. We should be putting people on boards who have some experience, some knowledge, some ability to make a contribution. The only ability to make a contribution you need today is the ability to contribute to the Liberal Party election funds. If you put a couple of thousand dollars or a couple of million dollars into the election fund, then sure enough when the appointments are made, whether it is to the committee on the centenary, whether it is to the ANTA board or whatever it is, up comes your name. Bingo! You have hit the jackpot. Depending on how much you contribute, the more likely you are to be appointed. If you make a big, big contribution you become the chair. We agree that the board should be expanded. There is no argument about that. Our disagreement is with the way these appointments are going to be made. We do not think it does Australia any credit at all, especially - ot in the training field, if you buy your way mto government appointments. That is what this government is doing. It is a disgrace. I thought we had gone past buying patronage, but this is yet another retrograde step of this government. You pay your bucks and you get the appointment.",57
219,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (5.31 p.m.)-It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry when one hears the speeches from the other side. This is the quality of the opposition that Australia now has. It is pretty obvious when you listen to this debate why the Labor Party was so devastated at the last federal election and why-when the battlers of this country had a chance to give their views about the Labor Party after having observed them in opposition-in the Lindsay by-election we got an enhanced swing there. I utterly reject the assertions of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). They really are beneath contempt. This is the pathetic character of the contributions to this debate. The opposition was approached by the government before this amendment was moved. The government's reasoning was fully explained. Even one of the possible appointees was canvassed-a person to whom I believe the Labor Party has absolutely no objection. There is no suggestion whatever that the appointees the government will be making to the ANTA board will be anyone other than people who are distinguished in the training area, who are recognised around Australia as people who have a major contribution to make to this country. Not only that but we are actually seeking to make these appointments to expand the support amongst the business community for an initiative put in place by the Labor Party. They were never able to make it work. They were never able to get that level of support. The business community, during the last election campaign and before, came to us on many occasions and said, 'We feel that this training system the Labor Party has put in place is so bureaucratic, so complex, that we just cannot participate in it.' That is why we have undertaken the very major reforms that we are putting in place, to simplify this system, to simplify access to it, so that young Australians can get opportunities to undertake apprenticeships and traineeships in a way they were never able to do under the previous government. We have acknowledged the quality of the representation that people like Mr Bill Mansfield have offered to the ANTA board. Indeed, we have gone out of our way to ensure that people within the trade union movement who have expertise will be fully listened to. I was personally delighted when Julius Rowe was approached to be a member of the reference committee which we set up for the introduction of the new Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, and he accepted that appointment. He was acknowledged within the trade union movement as being a real expert in this area. We appointed him because we felt he could make a contribution. The government is prepared to acknowledge, in a purely frank and objective way, the quality of people. But what have we heard in this debate? We have heard the most utter nonsense from the member for Throsby, the fantasy land that he indulges in. We have heard from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), an ex-President of the ACTU and now presumably someone to whom the Labor Party listens, inveighing against the big end of town, against the business community, throwing accusations against the representatives of the major business organisations and imagining in some way that, with its own shrinking membership in the ACTU, he is in some way advancing the political interests of the Labor Party. That is why I say that it is hard to know whether to laugh or cry because you have an opposition here which not only shot itself in the foot before the election but is continuing to shoot itself in the foot in the course of debate. It is no wonder that when the member for Batman was President of the ACTU 600,000 members of the union movement walked out on him. It was the biggest loss of membership to the trade union movement probably in its entire history over the last century, and he is the man responsible for it. It is easy to see why because he cannot come up with a common sense case on behalf of the Labor Party which rises above petty partisan politics and recognises the national interest.",57
220,Mr MOSSFIELD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Greenway) (5.36 p.m.}--One rises with some concern that there is a perception here that we are entering into a political exercise rather than really looking at the serious issues concerning vocational training. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is not free of political input to this debate. He had to mention Lindsay. We all know the situation there. He also had to mention trade union membership. But what we are really about on this side of the House is a balanced ANTA board. If you look at the board at the moment, you will see that it is certainly not balanced. Although I do not know any of the names that I have in front of me, I certainly know the companies from which they come. Dr Kemp-They're your appointees, for heaven's sake.",58
221,Mr MOSSFIELD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"We are not arguing about that; we are arguing about balance. At the moment it appears to be five to one against working people. I would argue that the trade union movement represents all working people, whether they are members of trade unions or not. If there are another two people from business added to the board, the balance is seven to one against working people. There is a serious perception that, if that is the case, working people will not get a fair go as far as the ANTA board is concerned. Prior to the election, the coalition were critical of the then government, suggesting that there were appointments of trade union people to various boards. Yet now they are doing exactly the same thing. As previous speakers have said, we are not opposing the expansion of the board; we are seeking a this balance. What this amendment does is implement what was recommended by the report of the review of the Australian National Training Authority agreement: that is, to increase the national board by two. That is where it stops, because the minister has said that he will not fill these two positions with those recommended by the review report-that is, experts from the field such as the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, a senior state and territory official, and the chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council. These are the people that it is recommended should be added to the board. I would suggest that they are in a far better position to make a contribution than the two people who will be appointed from the two business organisations. But this government, which holds itself up as a decent and credible government, has said that it wilI place on the board two persons specificalIy acceptable to the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. What terrible people we are to dare to suggest that it is not only jobs for the boys but also jobs for the boys from a specific part of the community sympathetic to the government! I do not profess to argue that the government should not appoint people it knows and respects to important positions, but in this case any appointment as is forecast will be totally at odds with the very expensive review that recommended that the jobs go to particular experts in the training field. This government says, 'No, we will appoint two people who have got the numbers from their own particular business organisations. Who cares if they have the qualifications or not?' The issue of training for industry is too important to be trifled with by these ideologues as indicated by the minister. As a former trade union official, I put many thousands of voluntary hours into the pursuit of a proper, recognised and qualified training program for Australian industry. I, like many others, worked closely with our opposites in the employer ranks. We were all bipartisan enough that we frequently ensured appointments of specifically qualified people to advisory groups or other leadership areas of training. In all the areas of industry that I have been involved in, the area with the most cooperation has been the area of training. From time to time, no matter what organisation you are involved in or what committee you are on, you have a bipartisan committee. You have people representing the government, people representing employer organisations and people representing the trade union movement. Unfortunately, this is not the case in this particular ANTA board. I would suggest that we did not play politics. The report recommended a particular road to travel, and I support that proposal. (Time expired)",58
222,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I very much agree with the appointment by the minister of Mr Julius Rowe, but I point out that Mr Julius Rowe was appointed on the basis of merit, of his commitment, understanding and involvement in the question of training. He was not appointed because he was a representative of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, an affiliate of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That goes to the crux of the problem. The minister approached me to consider this issue last week. The problem was that, in discussing the issue with me, he did not talk about appointing people on the basis of merit or their understanding, commitment or involvement in the area of training. He referred in passing to the report of the review of the ANTA agreement, which recommended that additional people be appointed to the ANTA board. He then talked about the need to appoint two additional people related to their association with specific organisations-the BCA and ACC!. That is what he put to me. I take the view that ANTA is a success because we have gone out of our way as a nation to ensure that people who serve on the board of ANTA and are involved in its associated activities serve on the basis that they are there to do something about improving our skiIls base and making our system of training the best possible system in the world. That is why it is a success. They do not go there as the representative of the ACTU, the BCA, the Commonwealth government, ACCI, the government of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or whatever. They go there on the basis of the expertise they take into the workings of that board for the purposes of trying to ensure that we compete as a nation, not on the basis of lower wages and conditions of employment, as would be the policy adopted by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) if he were the Prime Minister of Australia. They are there on the basis of ensuring that we compete internationally with respect to the skilling of the Australian work force. That is why we are concerned, because it was the minister himself who raised the possibility of the two additional people being direct representatives of ACCI and the BCA. I did not put those words into the minister's mouth; he referred to those people who are related to the operations of the BCA and ACCI in his discussion with me. For example, he did not specifically refer to the recommendations which are set out in the review of ANTA's activities. The review proposes that the appointments to the board be the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training; a senior state or territory official; and, desirably, the Chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council-and I acknowledge that the Standards and Curriculum Council has been abolished. However, the real issue comes back to the minister's credibility. Obviously, while we stand in opposition, the government will win the day. It is then a question of whether this government is prepared to adopt the policy approach of the previous government to ensure that the appointments made are not made on the basis of taking the baggage from where they come into the operations of ANTA. In speaking today, I challenge the minister, when selecting the additional people, to go out of his way to ensure that they are not there to sing the song of the BCA or ACC!. I would also say in passing that I believe that would be in accordance with the thrust of the policy position adopted by state governments, especially Liberal state governments, when ANTA was first established in 1992. That was the policy position accepted by the Commonwealth government after comprehensive discussion with state governments, especially Liberal state governments. They wanted to ensure that, if we were prepared to try and test a new approach to vocational education and training, it rose above politics. My fear is that, because of the nature of appointments that have been made by this government in a range of areas since the election of 2 March, we might take vocational education and training back to the murky days which existed previously on the vocational education and training front.",59
223,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (5.46 p.m.)-I feel compelled to re-enter this debate, given the unusual intervention by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which has just occurred. He is a new member in the chamber, and he sees fit not only to refer to a private conversation that we had but, indeed, to misrepresent it. I will certainly take that into account in future discussions, or the absence of such discussions, with him on these and other matters relating to legislation. At no stage did I say that particular people would have to be appointed as representatives of the two organisations he has mentioned. I instanced those two organisations, and I mentioned the name of a particular personwhom so far he has refrained from mentioning-as being the kind of person whom we might appoint. I had expected him to understand quite clearly what was being said. But I gathered, as the conversation went on, that he really was quite out of his depth in this area, because he said, 'Well, I'm not sure about all of that; I'll have to talk to Kim about it.' I had always thought the President of the ACro was the expert in all these matters. But the shadow minister for employment and training had to take it up with the leader, apparently, before he could understand what was being said by me-and that related, of course, to an initiative of the former government. It just beggars the imagination to think that the Labor Party would be at all concerned that a government of the day might appoint people who were closely linked to it, when one considers the incredible number of appointments made by the Labor Party of members and officers of the ACTU. Indeed, so overboard did they go in appointing their union mates to bodies-from the National Training Authority, to the industry training advisory bodies, right down through the training system-and so keen were they to promote their friends who, of course, contributed enormous sums of money to the Labor Party for its election campaigns that of course I understand why they might think others might possibly behave in the way their party behaved. But I can assure you that we do not behave in that way. Because of this extraordinary behaviour in relation to the training initiatives of the former Labor government, business was naturally very suspicious. That is one of the reasons why for 10 years the Labor Party failed to get up public support for the traineeship concept. Back in 1985, figures of 75,000 trainees a year were used; by the end of the Labor period in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. One of the reasons for that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and Shadow Minister across the table, is that so many small businesses who did not have unionised workshops were terrified that, if they took on a trainee, that trainee would bring in his or her wake the union supervisor. They placed the training system under such intense union supervision that they frightened off the very people who might hire the trainees and apprentices. That is why for 10 years they were unable to make the system work. It was not that they did not have some good ideas; they did have some good ideas. It was not that there were not clever people thinking through the system. It was just that they could never make it work because their whole approach was one of constant promotion of their mates in the union movement of whom they are the political voices, the constant promotion of the major contributors to Labor Party funds. They put their own narrow partisan interests ahead of the interests of young Australians and the national interest, just as they are doing in this debate. That is why we are seeing the absurd contributions from the other side the House on an amendment with which they actually agree-and it does them no credit whatever.",60
224,Mr WILTON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the sentiments of the speakers who preceded me, in particular of a man whom I hold in high esteem-as I am sure you do too-and I speak of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). He spoke at some length on the government having seen fit",61
225,Mr WILTON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It was all set up-to turn the vitally important area of education and training into a source of patronage for its mates. Adding cherished members to the ANTA board is fine, as long as the appointment of those members is in accordance with the broader strategy of balance and as long as those members have the appropriate mix of skills, experience and, of course, representation. But this is not in any way what the government is seeking to achieve. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has made it quite clear that the two extra appointees will be from the business community and the business community only-specifically, appointees acceptable to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia-which is a far cry from the recommendations contained in the ANTA review. The ANTA review stated in this regard: ... that the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, a senior State or Territory official and, desirably, the Chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council be added to the Board. Clearly, that is not what has occurred. The government is nothing more than ideologically committed to business domination of training rather than adequate public input. As a former member of the council of the Casey College of T AFE, one of the largest TAFE facilities within my electorate of Isaacs, I know that imperative to the operation of these organisations is balance. On that particular council, of which I was an active member, there were representatives from trade unions, from business organisations, from small business and from academia. We interacted and exchanged information, and that of course was to the long-term benefit of the Casey College of T AFE. The fact that we had that diversity of backgrounds was an integral component of the business plans that we developed for it. I might remind Minister Kemp, the underling of Minister Vanstone, of what Minister Vanstone said in the estimates committee about what industry domination of these bodies meant to this government. The minister said that she meant specificaIIy excluding workers' representatives from the vocational education and training sector. She understood business to mean the owners of business, the owners of capital, not the person or persons who made capital productive-that is, the workers in industry. She quite consciously and quite deliberately set forth the government's position that was founded on this very premise. In fact, I refer Minister Kemp to his superior's comments before that estimates committee. The opposition is opposed to this proposition. The major policy reversal that the government is pursuing through this bill contradicts its push to put more employer representatives on ANTA and contradicts the various points that it made prior to its election about broader consultation in the area of education and training. That is apparent at every level. The operating budget cut of some 25 per cent to ANT A head office will see the removal of many and varied positions. The level of service will have to fall. The abolition of pre-vocational programs, or at least their reduced funding for access, will have a detrimental impact on training schemes in my state of Victoria. There will be a requirement that labour market programs themselves will decline as a result of this budget measure which will have, as I say, a particularly detrimental impact in Victoria. For example, labour market programs in that state will decline to the tune of some $80 million per annum. I make reference to the funding of TAFE institutes in Victoria. There will be a significant reduction in residual labour market funds to support training for a number of apprentices as part of the new MAATS scheme. There will be new tendering arrangements for labour market programs which will also impact on the provision of services within Victoria and TAPE institutions such as that which I am already involved with, the Casey College of TAFE. (Time expired)  pleased to make a small contribution to this debate on the Senate amendment to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill. Firstly, I would like to sincerely thank the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). Of aII the ministers in the new coalition government, I heard Dr Kemp in this parliament for the first time mention the ACTU in a favourable context. That was of course in relation to Bill Mansfield'sMr Martin-You'd better read Hansard and check it again!  point, but I want to thank the minister for making such a significant breakthrough in being able to recognise a positive contribution by the ACTU, because I think they do contribute positively. I happen to know Bill Mansfield very well and Bill serves the committee he is on particularly well. I would like to thank the minister for acknowledging Bill's contribution to ANTA. By the way, I was impressed by the contribution of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) as weII, if I could have that noted in the Hansard. This is reaIIy quite unusual. We are dealing with a Senate amendment. It is not about wanting to restore revenue to the government. It is not about wanting to save expenditure. It is not really about some huge new clause that is going to affect, disadvantage or rescue a whole broad section of the community. We are discussing two issues. One is the expansion of the ANTA board by two. Every speaker who has made a contribution-even when they have made a couple of contributions-has agreed with that. What we are really objecting to is a recommendation arising out of a review that not only should the board be increased by two but also we should appoint either the secretary to DEET or a senior state or territory official-and, of course, someone from a board that has been subsequently axed. The minister says that he believes that business networking is very important to the success of the organisation. I do not think that I would disagree with that. But what really is interesting about this recommendation of the review is that the access to the Public Service, both state and Commonwealth, that this would provide by the selection of these people is to be denied. I find that particularly amazing. I want to thank the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) because he really got on to the major point about the whole issue, and that is that this is all about skilling Australians. It is all about how well we will be positioned into the year 2000. It is an issue which I would think the Australian people would want us to be taking as much as is possible a bipartisan view on. The member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) has already commented that, in his experience, the one issue on which you get agreement between trade union officials and business representatives is in this area of training. You can get agreement about a lot of other things but you really get them working very closely together in that area. The minister talks about small business failing to take up training opportunities. I agree with him. I have an example. In my own area, West Jobs was developed and was highly successful. I acknowledge the contribution of all those people who served on that committee, including the people with a trade union background. They did it in a bipartisan way, working for the good of the region, for the good of the area. When we talk about the change that has occurred in the last 13 years and the change that needs to occur in the next 13 years, what we need to be is inclusive of everyone. Everyone has got a contribution to make, whether it is big business-the big end of town-small business, a trade union or a worker. We all have a role to play in making sure that we are indeed a country that has a significant advantage over our neighbours and a significant advantage over the rest of the world in the way in which we are skilled, the way in which we can do our jobs and the way in which we can bring our intellect and our skills to making products better, more effective and more efficient. These are the issues that we really should be debating. It is staggering to think that the minister is so intent on appointing two business representatives that we have an amendment in the Senate and we are debating this in the House. (Time expired)",61
226,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, I might say in passing that I think you are doing a good job, too. I want to reject the suggestion by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) that I have misrepresented the nature of the discussion that was held between the minister and me. I also want to clearly say that yes, I did indicate that I would seek advice from the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I will tell you why: he was the minister responsible for the development of ANT A. Unlike the minister, I do not profess to be a know-all. I operate on the basis that I am willing to talk to others because I value their experiences. The minister might be a knowall, but I am pleased that I consulted the Leader of the Opposition, the minister who previously had responsibility for the development of ANTA. I will tell you why I am pleased. The Leader of the Opposition correctly advised me of the history of the development of ANTA. That is why we are expressing our concerns in such a rigorous way today-because of the nature of the conversation I had with the minister. In the course of the conversation, he suggested that we are returning to the days of people basically being appointed on the basis of their association with particular organisations, be it the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia or ACCI. I would also say in passing that our opposition is not related to concerns with the operation of the business community in Australia today. If anyone is in difficulties with the business community today, it is the current government. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Premier of Victoria. He is bagging this government up hill and down dale at the moment because of its lack of industry policy. It is in all the media today. He is vitally concerned not just with the performance of this economy but with the fact that this government does not have any real understanding of the needs of industry and is not prepared to go out there, roll up its sleeves and try to get involved to assist industry. That aside, I agree with the current government that ANTA is a worthwhile organisation and it ought to be continued. It has made substantial progress in improving vocational education and training in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition-as I said, unlike the minister I am willing to learn from the experiences of those who previously had responsibility for this area-drew to my attention that, when the ANTA board was first constituted, it was generally agreed, including by coalition state governments, that members should be there for their expertise, commitment and the contribution they would make rather than as representatives of particular interest groups. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and it alerted me to some difficulties with the suggestion by the minister. The minister was the one who raised in the conversation with me the fact that he was looking to appoint people who had links with ACCI and the Business Council of Australia. Those people should not be the types of people appointed to the board of ANTA. The types of people who should be appointed to the board are representatives of the business community who are vitally concerned on a day-today basis with implementing decent and forward-looking vocational education and training initiatives. They should not be people who are there as representatives of particular organisations, be it the ACTU, the MTIA, the MBA, ACCI or the BCA. That was the basis of the establishment of ANTA and that is why it is now a success. That is why the current government has changed its approach to ANTA, and that is why the current government has finally decided, despite its original vigorous opposition to the establishment of ANTA, to support its continued operation. So the test for the minister is really whether or not, in considering the additional appointments, he is prepared-unlike other ministers of this current government-to rise above politics and ensure that the people appointed are appointed on the basis of merit. It is exceptionally important that that be case. It is interesting to note that, since the election of this government, unemployment has blown out. The real problem is that the budget strategy of this government is a jobless budget. That is clearly now coming through from the problems industry is experiencing. I noticed that a key representative of the Murdoch enterprises in Australia also recently expressed concern about the performance of the government-(Time expired)",63
227,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (6.06 p.m.)-I will not take up the time of the House for long. Let me make it clear on the part of the government that it is certainly our intention to appoint people to the ANTA board on the basis of merit. That has always been our position. That is the position I made clear to the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). I also made it clear that no organisation had a lien on these matters. I instanced certain organisations as being possible sources of such people, but unless people of quality can be found we will be looking elsewhere. Our aim is to get the best possible people in Australia onto this organisation. It is an organisation which has enormous potential. It has been well led. It has a board of people of quality on it already. It needs to be strengthened. Support for it needs to be built up further amongst the business community so that young Australians can get training opportunities. We are in heated agreement on all these matters. I think it is probably time that the debate be drawn to a close and that we make our decision on this legislation.",64
228,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"We will take the final comments of the government on board. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) and I are in violent agreement about the importance of ANTA. It was the minister who raised particular organisations in his discussion with me. I raised with him the need to ensure that, in making these appointments, there are not people there to merely carry out the agenda established by the BCA and ACCI-that they are required to perform in a manner akin to the performance of other representatives from all sections of the Austhe tralian community. That is to ensure that they make a contribution based on ensuring that we further improve the vocational education and training system in Australia. My fear is that this government, unlike the previous government, will allow those business organisations to Jean on the government with respect to its appointments. The previous government, despite pressure from the BCA and ACCI, refused to make appointments of people who would be there merely to carry out the instructions of the committees of management of the BCA and ACC!. I can assure you of this, as a former President of the ACTU: never did such a situation occur with respect to the initial appointment of Bill Mansfield, an assistant secretary of the ACTU, nor did such consideration ever occur with respect to the position he might have adopted in the workings of the ANTA board. That is the issue I raise-to ensure that, with respect to BCA and ACCI, the people appointed might be members of those organisations but are there as free agents, there operating in the best interests of the Australian community, not taking into the board of ANTA the baggage of the BCA and ACC!. I will tell you why: we need to make further progress on this front. Unemployment, as the minister and I know, is the major problem confronting Australia. It has worsened since the ejection. We are now experiencing some particular difficulties with respect to the availability of skilled tradespeople. It is the responsibility of this government, in association with state governments and the board of ANTA, to continue the great progress that has been made. Major reforms are reflected in the fact that the new government are prepared to now support our initiatives-and not just with respect to ANT A-for I also note that tomorrow they will be announcing the continuation of the highly successful Working Nation area consultative committees. I will tell you why: they were making progress on the employment front. I am pleased that this government is prepared to face up to the fact that it was wrong in the initial assessment of those important policy initiatives of the previous government. ANTA has now been ticked off by the government. Area consultative committees are to be ticked off again by this government because of the manner in which it went out to involve representatives of the Australian community-business, union, local government or state government and c.hurch groups-to ensure that we made further progress with respect to training and employment opportunities. That is the challenge. The real issue is whether the minister, unlike other ministers he sits with, can rise above political patronage. I'll tell you what: we all know that they have not only delivered many appointments to their mates but will also deliver to the biggest donors, the banks. We will watch with interest the workings of the Wallis inquiry because we also note that they are in the process of delivering to the banks access to superannuation funds. Can he rise above it or not? Others have failed. That is his challenge. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1996 Cognate bills: MIGRATION (VISA APPLICATION) CHARGE BILL 1996 IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 December, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",64
229,Mr KERR,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was speaking about the circumstances of those Australians who will be unable to exercise the right that most of us would take for grantedthat is, to marry a person of their choice and to live in this country with that partner of their choice-as a consequence of this government's determination in this migration legislation to establish the power to set limits to the numbers of husbands and wives that can be allowed to enter the country in any one year. Similarly, the right to meet our responsibility for caring for elderly parents is one which, until now, we have quite rightly accepted and regarded as an important element of any immigration program. But this bill provides a power in the minister to also limit and cap the number of such parents that will come to this country. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) wants to be able to say to some Australians-citizens or permanent residents alike-if their parents happen to live overseas, 'Even if you meet all the restrictive visa qualifications, even if you meet the tests that are set down in the regulations, you will not necessarily be able to come.' Those who do miss out will not necessarily be able to go in some form of queue. They will simply be asked to try again next year. They could miss out again and again because there is no necessity in this legislation to give any priority to those who have waited for an extended period. Meanwhile, the elderly parent, for whom the person living in this country would have a sense of responsibility, is asked to wait patiently, to go on hold for another year and not be anxious about the lottery that is being played with their lives. As a personal reflection, I regard the responsibility of caring for one's elderly parents as nothing particularly out of the ordinary. My own family undertook that responsibility in the case of my grandfather, who came from Scotland to live in Australia with us in a small flat associated with our home. I would have thought that that sense of responsibility would be one which would commend itself to a party that holds itself out as being committed to the rights of Australian families. But this legislation actualYet ly intrudes into these very fundamental areas. What the bill seeks to do in the case of dependent children is equally unthinkable. Many scenarios would arise year after year where a parent in Australia would be unable to have their dependent child or children in their care. If this legislation is passed, cases could exist, for example, involving broken marriages and cases where the child may be the subject of abuse with one parent overseas and one parent in Australia unable to bring that child to this country to care for their child simply because the minister has set a maximum number of dependent childrenfrom infants to those who are nearing the end of their school days-who can be sponsored and because the magic number that the minister has set has been reached. These scenarios are not hypothetical. The case of baby Samuel that I referred to earlier is just a foreshadow of what is likely to occur, repeated hundreds of times over. In that instance there was an infant child and the woman's fiance was living in England. She could bring the baby under the existing rules but not the baby's father. So the family was being tom apart. These regulations take that further. They make it worse. She will not even be able to bring the baby-an infant child-to this country if the minister sets a cap and imposes that cap as permitted in this legislation. Are these proposals acceptable? I need to quote no person other than the present Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give support to my profound objection to these aspects of the bill. In June 1989, when the current provisions in the bill were inserted, which allow capping of most elements of the immigration program but not those immediate family elements, the then opposition spokesperson, Mr Ruddock, now the minister, said: I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. in his second reading speech on this bill, the minister, referring to the issue of capping, said: This is crucial to restoring public confidence in the immigration program, which had been greatly eroded under Labor. He also said that Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control. It is utterly deceitful and irresponsible for the minister to say this. By saying this, he helps to fuel an anti-immigration sentiment in the community. He knows that what he is saying is not true. He knows that measures are now in place to allow scrutiny of the veracity and the legitimacy of relationships. Today this opposition has agreed with processes which will proceed in the Senate to have a two-year probationary visa for any new marriages. So if there is any insincerity or any sham in relation to a marriage, that can be dealt with effectively. This bill moves beyond any legitimate application of government power into the direct family area and acts in a way to hold husband and wife apart, husband and child apart and mother and child apart and not to allow families to give any care or responsibility to their elderly parents. This is an unthinkable measure. As the minister said in opposition, 'I regard it as absolutely unconscionable.' Where is the now minister's conscience? The truth is that these are not the minister's proposals. The truth is that the minister would now reject measures of this nature were he given personal licence to do so. But he has become a cipher. He has become the Philip Demidenko of the Australian political system. He is simply the hand that signs the paper, putting forward proposals that have come down as edicts from a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who is running a sham and a phoney campaign, playing to the basest sentiments of some in the community and using as his cat's paw a man who once had a reputation for honour and integrity in this area. Philip 'Demidenko' Ruddock is the Australian minister for immigration, the hand that signs the paper, the cat's paw for the Prime Minister, the person who is talking code in order to take base political advantage, where he himself has a conscience which I am certain is offended mightily by what is being done. The measures that have come forward are not necessary at all to ensure a lower immigration program. In fact, two of the last three years of the Keating Labor government saw programs substantially lower than that which is now being put forward by the current government. In 1992-93 the total program was 67,900, in 1993-94 the total program was 62,800 and the planning level for this year is 74,000. It is not necessary to attack family rights in order to bring lower immigration. There is a complete capacity in the hands of this government to bring in an immigration program not only at the target level that they set but some 15,000 lower than the target they set without the slightest need to introduce draconian measures of this nature. This is irresponsible and socially destructi ve policy making. Another point I would make, and it is important, is that any loss of confidence in the migration program has far more to do with irresponsible perpetuation of myths than with the program having gone out of control. Myths that are being perpetuated by this government suggest that new arrivals somehow leech on the back of Australian taxpayers. There are suggestions that measures of this nature are necessary because of sham marriages and that the opposition is somehow resisting control measures about sham marriages. The myths that are being perpetuated and fed to the community are doing that damage and doing it daily. We need to speak up in a factual and balanced way, not to implement policies of this nature which are destructive socially to the fabric of this country. If I happen to be travelling overseas on a working holiday and meet a Dutch, Italian, Greek, Japanese or English girl and form an affection for her and wish to marry, what part is it of my government to say that I cannot bring my partner to this country and form my family here? More so, if I have had a child by that person, what part is it of this Australian government to say that my child cannot come to my country and be part of my family? How irresponsible it is to have a government that is saying that at a fixed point, at anyone period in a year, there will be no more such applications. If there is any area that should have absolute priority, it is the right of Australians to have with them their husbands and wives and their dependent children. The cruelty of any counter-proposition should be self-evident. And it was to the then opposition spokesperson. It certainly is to me now. And it certainly is to this opposition. Another unacceptable change in this bill is that it seeks to implement a legislative exemption of the Sex Discrimination Act to the Migration Act of 1958. That is to allow the minister to prescribe a two-year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependent or same sex relationships. We see it as deplorable that the government seeks to implement such legislative amendment in order to mete out especially harsh treatment to de facto spouses and interdependent couples. This amounts to imposing by legislation moral values which ignore contemporary views and restrict freedom of choice to a degree which will virtually end the utility of these visa categories. I might say, in the spirit of some cooperation with the government, that I have indicated to the minister that, were he to come back to us with some proposal for a shorter period, we may well be disposed to look at that. But thus far, there has been no approach. There is a determination to press ahead with a twoyear cohabitation period before you can consider a person under this program. The opposition sees no reason for treating these relatively small numbers of applicants with less trust than spouse applicants. We believe that a stricter pre-screening process, which we have given the tick to, and a twoyear provisional visa, as would apply to spouse applications, would be a proper check. We have supported the government's measures to toughen up compliance. I also make the point that, at least with respect to some of the interdependent visa categories, there are circumstances in some societies which are actively intolerant where physical cohabitation between two persons under the interdependency category is not going to be established without possible physical and serious risk to those persons. These are measures which do have serious implications. One other measure that we oppose is the introduction of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill. In itself, it is relatively innocuous. It seeks to roll all of the existing migration charges into one-the visa application fee, which the government is increasing by over 200 per cent; the English education charge, which is going up nearly 250 per cent; and the health services charge, which is to be applied to the whole of the preferential family category without any rationale to support widening its application. We have accepted the government's increase in most of those charges, but not to the English education charge. The reason is that learning English is very much part of the settlement process. It is vital for arrivals who have been granted the right to make this country their home, under the claim of a nondiscriminatory policy, to learn English. It was called 'the glue of a cohesive nation' in the coalition's own policy statement. To raise the charge to $5,500 per person will make it un affordable to many. This would plainly be discriminatory against nonEnglish speaking applicants and not, in the code language of the minister, 'selective'. It is in the national interest that new arrivals learn English. They are more likely to become productive members of this society. The coalition is ill advised to have taken that measure. Whilst the rolling into one charge of all these measures is not in itself an objectionable matter, because it incorporates an objectionable measure we will not support the schedule to the bill which allows for that to occur. I should indicate that the opposition has accepted the controversial visa application fee rise. As it is not possible to extract the English education charge and oppose it alone in this bill, whilst our objection is only to one-tenth of that measure, the minister has again, in his failure to accept an offer of cooperation, refused to separate the charges. The new charge in this bill is simply expressed as a maximum of $12,500 per year, and it makes no distinction between primary and secondary applicants. In other words, a family of four could face, under this bill, a total fee of $50,000 in order to migrate to Australia. That is a pretty 'selective' measure. With respect to the provisions regarding the stripping of persons of their citizenship for matters that go to their application for entry or citizenship to this country, we accept that the government is addressing a matter about which many Australians may have legitimate concerns. We welcome the supplementary explanatory memorandum that the minister has tabled and brought forward at our request. It clarifies that the government means in action that there must be intent to defraud before an action can be taken. However, we raise a concern that I think will have to be addressed by the minister, which is the question of statelessness. There are conventions in place internationally to avoid persons becoming stateless. Somebody who has, by acceptance of an Australian citizenship, found himself or herself without the citizenship of their former country residence could lose Australian citizenship under these provisions perhaps 20 or 30 years later. These matters plainly need to be looked at. In that circumstance, I certainly ask the minister to come back to the parliament and address this issue when it goes before Senate, because the Senate has established committee to look at the whole of this bill. In conclusion, these measures are not necessary for an orderly migration program. They are also cruel. In the language of then opposition spokesperson and now said, minister, they are unconscionable measures. They are being driven not by his agenda by others. It is unworthy of the government of Australia to have brought them forward.",65
230,Unknown,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.32 p.m. to Debate (on motion by Dr Nelson) adjourned. NA RELATIONS: REMARKS,69
231,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"I have reflected on the have request by the honourable member for Charlgo on with it. ton during question time this afternoon that the Minister for Industrial Relations withdraw remarks which the honourable member found offensive. I have previously ruled that there was nothing disorderly in the comments made by the minister, and a careful analysis of his remarks does not provide any basis on which to rule that they were offensive. Therefore, I conclude that there is no requirement for the minister to withdraw any of his remarks.",69
232,Mr CREAN,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: I ask you, in light of the ruling that you have just made, to reflect upon your comments in the Hansard, where you had effectively concluded that the comits ments were offensive and you had asked the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to withdraw on two occasions. You asked him to withdraw on the first occasion, having required him to reflect on the statement and withdraw. I think at the subsequent stage-I have not got the precise words in front of me-to the extent to which you said that the honourable member for Charlton found them offensi ve, you then repeated the request for withdrawal. I suggest of to you, Mr Speaker, that in that context, because you had accepted that the honourable member for Charlton had found them offensive, that was sufficient for you to accept the offensive nature of the remarks. You specifically required the Leader of the House on the the second occasion to withdraw. I ask you to a again look at the record of what you said in asking him to withdraw and to hold to that view.",69
233,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"I thank the honourable the member for Hotham for his remarks. As I I have had an opportunity to reflect not only on the words used by the Minister for but Industrial Relations and the honourable member for Charlton but also on my own words on this matter. Indeed, out of respect for the honourable member for Charlton, 8 p.m. whose behaviour generally in this House is exemplary, I thought there must have been a nuance within the remarks made by the Minister for Industrial Relations that had escaped me, given the general furore that was going on in the parliament at the time. We alluded to that separately and I will not If any ruling made today was an error of judgment, the principal error is mine. The second one is that of the honourable member for Charlton, whose previous behaviour in this House, as I say, has been exemplary. However, a definitive reading of the remarks made by the minister does not under any circumstances portray to me, in the independent role that I try to maintain in this House, any offence, either disorderly or offensive. I looked at offensiveness in two particular arenas: personal offence to the honourable member for Charlton, and political offence to the honourable member for Charlton. On either ground, I ruled that no offensive remarks were made by the Minister for Industrial Relations. Giving the member for Charlton an opportunity to interject and having taken cognisance of his previous behaviour in this place, I looked at the videotape and the Hansard and interrogated the audio. On reflection, I have absolutely no doubt that, whilst the debate was robust and we were Iinking-'we' being the government-the Australian Labor Party with the ACTU and recognising that there are two former presidents of the ACTU on the front bench of the opposition, there was nothing offensive. I would see that, in normal course of events, as being robust political debate but certainly not offensive debate.",69
234,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I certainly do not dispute the interpretation that made from either listening to the tapes or watching the videos. I also do not question the integrity that you bring to the position Speaker. I would not seek to dispute the ruling you have made. I appreciate the fact that you have aIIowed me by indulgence to make some observations. Very briefly, I have also taken the opportunity to refer again to the comments by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). He was referring to his belief that the ACTU had directed action against women. Mr MCGauran-You're doing it again!",70
235,Unknown,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,Honourable members interjecting,70
236,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,Order! The honourable member for Charlton has the floor. I will not countenance interjections. This is a very serious issue.,70
237,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"It is. Thank you, Mr Speaker. He referred to the relationship between the ACTU and the Labor Party. I am not deliberately misrepresenting his position, but the clear implication to me was that the Labor Party had by omission failed to object to that action by the ACTU and so, to that extent at least, the Labor Party was also guilty. I took exception to that. The implication, to my mind, was that the Labor Party, by failing to oppose that behaviour, had in effect condoned the action being taken against women. Let me assure you and the Minister for Industrial Relations that I found that grossly offensive. I still find it grossly offensive. Quite clearly, while the Minister for Industrial Relations may deny it, it was his intention to establish a connection between the Labor Party, of which I am a proud member, and the ACTU over that question. I believe that the Minister for Industrial Relations realised that he went too far. Government member interjecting",70
238,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"That is not baseless. He realises that he went too far and the was let off the hook-not by you, Mr Speaker; I am not suggesting that for a moment. Through the good grace of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the choice was made not to pursue it. We requested that you have a look at it again and come to your you have decision, which you have done. I say very quickly and in conclusion that there were two standing orders to which I of made reference. I believe the first to which I made reference was the particularly relevant one. But Browning's House of Representatives Practice also, Mr Speaker, as you would know, refers to the fact that, where a coIIective claim is made against a group of people, that claim is also made against each individual member of that group, and each individual member of that group has the right to claim offence and to seek redress. Mr Speaker, of course it was on that that I sought redress from you. I conclude with this comment: I do not question the integrity of your position, I assure you absolutely. But I do question and will continue to question the attempt that was made, in my mind, by the Minister for Industrial Relations to establish a connection between myself and my coIIeagues-Her Majesty's opposition in this national parliament-in condoning, by failing to sufficiently oppose, some type of offence against women. I serve notice on that man and anyone else that if such an attempt is made in future to suggest that I, as a member of any other group, would be guilty of such, I will be much less tolerant.",70
239,Mr REITH,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,"Very briefly, Mr Speaker, on indulgence, obviously in the heat of question time things are said, people believe they hear things, and the like. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) says that in his mind I said certain things. By any fair reading of the Hansard, you can only conclude that what was in the member for Charlton's mind was only in his mind because it was not what I said. It is not what is in the Hansard. Quite frankly, it is entirely a figment of your imagination. On any fair reading of the words, your interpretation can only be said to be simply something which you yourself have concluded, based on your own understanding, and totally unrelated to anything that I said. Obviously the support for that remark-my assertion-comes in the conclusions that the Speaker, quite fairly, has come to on a reading of the Hansard after the event. I went back to my office wondering what it was that you were so offended about. If you read the Hansard, the only other statement that you could refer to that would give you some basis upon which to judge what I said was when I later said, when I was referring to the obligations of the Leader of the Opposition: !he standard which I believe that you ought to set IS to say to the ACTU that it is time they owned up to their public responsibility. What is so offensive about that? The fact is that the member for Charlton, as I am reliably informed, was not even here when I started the response to the question. He thinks he hears something. He gets up and makes a totally baseless allegation. The truth of the matter is that, in his own remarks, he offends against the standing orders. Mr Speaker, I was not going to say anything. My intent was simply to accept what you had to say on the evaluation of the facts as you came to them since question time. I have only responded because, unfortunately, the member for Charlton--even against the clear advice and conclusion that the Hansard and your own remarks bring him to-has decided to reopen the debate.",70
240,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL,The matter is concluded. NA,71
241,The Clerk,COURT OF DISPUTED RETURNS,"I present a letter from the Chief Executive and Principal Registrar of the High Court forwarding, in accordance with section 369 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, a copy of the following order made by the High Court of Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns: Warren Snowdon against Nicholas Manuel Dondas and Electoral Commission. Order dated Tuesday, 3 December 1996. Petition No. S95 of 1996 dismissed. Petitioner to pay respondent's costs of the petition. NA",71
242,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for Monday, 9 December 1996, being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: l. Notices and orders of the day, government business. 2. Questions without notice (at 2 p.m.). 3. Notices and orders of the day, government business. If I may, I will speak very briefly to the motion-and I will be brief so as not to encourage the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) to give us yet another rhetorical display to make his mark as his leadership campaign gathers momentum. The week commencing 9 December is essentially an additional week for the parliament to sit. When we were thinking of the program some weeks ago, we were hoping we would be able to get away with sitting on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the last week to coincide with the final sitting in the Senatealso, of course, on Friday, 13 December. The reason we need to sit until the conclusion of matters in the Senate is that, in the event that there are bills to come back from the Senate, the House of Representatives needs to sit so that those matters can be concluded prior to Christmas. With the very heavy legislative program of the reformist Howard government in its first year, obviously there are potentially a number of matters to be dealt with. Since that first evaluation, it has become clear that in the House of Representatives there will also be a fairly significant workload. We therefore decided to sit on the Monday and Tuesday of the week commencing 9 December as well. So as to give priority to government business, we came to the view that we should sit on that Monday, with sitting hours and routine of business applying as normal from Monday to Thursday, but with the exception that on the Monday there will be government business only with question time at 2 o'clock. This will ensure that we use the time to get through as much government business as possible. Mr Crean interjecting",71
243,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"To respond to the interjection, depending on the volume of business it may be possible to provide time for 90-second statements and a grievance debate later that week. We would, of course, like to be able to do so and, as the program unfolds, we will provide opportunities for private members as the circumstances allow. That is, essentially, the normal practice, as it is also normal practice not to have a question time on the Friday. Mr Crean-Oh, what!",72
244,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I must say that I do enjoy these interjections because, as the opposition complain, I say to myself, 'Is this truly the same Simon Crean who used to sit on the government benches? Is this truly the same Leaping Leo of bicycle fame who used to sit on this side of the House and be responsible for the House not having a question time on a Friday?' Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",72
245,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,When did you arrive? You're a bit of a novice. Who else do we have who has been here a bit longer? Is this the same Dr Lawrence who sat across here as a government minister? ,72
246,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"More rostered days off than you can count. You are complaining about us not having a Friday. You never had a Friday. In fact, half your ministers did not turn up half the week. I daresay we will score 10 out of 10 for hypocrisy from the Manager of Opposition Business, who will try to persuade us why we should have a question time on a Friday, even though Labor never did. Therefore, the Friday will simply be a continuation of government business from the Thursday, as I say, in accordance with normal arrangements. We will also, of course, have the usual valedictories. Let us hope, when we get to the valedictories, that the feral disposition of the opposition might at least be put aside just for a brief moment to say something pleasant about the government and our efficient management of House affairs.",72
247,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Rising to the occasion, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) gets 10 out of 10 for hypocrisy. This was the person who was going to raise the standards. This was the person who was going to give more accountability to parliament and more question time, but here we have another example of where he squibs it. I have two issues that I want to raise. One is the question of a question time on Friday of next week, given that we are sitting. Given his hopeless management of the House, we are sitting all of next week-five days. When I had the discussion with him over the phone and he told me that he was introducingMr Reith-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it is appropriate for the Leader of the House to explain to members the progress of matters during the week as a consequence of the motion, but it would, of course, be irrelevant, and therefore out of order, for the Manager of Opposition Business to refer to processes beyond Monday, 9 December, which, of course, is the very narrow confine of the motion before the House. I appreciate that the member for Hotham wants to give us the ritualistic burst, but he is irrelevant and he should be brought back to the motion.",72
248,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,It is my intention to move an amendment to the motion of the Leader of the House which is relevant to the debate. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-I have not ruled on the point of order. I did note that the Leader of the House for referred to Friday when he was speaking and I had allowed the comments by the member for Hotham to continue on the grounds that it was a reply. Perhaps it would assist if you were to move your amendment and make it part of the debate.,72
249,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The hypocrisy is unbounded in terms of the Leader of the House, but I appreciate your ruling. The amendment that I move is: That the following words be inserted after 'suspended' : "" subject to provision being made for questions without notice to occur also at 2 p.m. on Friday, 13 December 1996, notwithstanding that questions without notice may have concluded earlier before any suspension of the sitting,'. That is the amendment that I propose on behalf of the opposition because not only does it expose the hypocrisy of the government in these matters; it is also in clear breach of a private discussion that the Leader of the House had with me over the phone in proposing that we would have to meet on Monday and Tuesday of next week. What he said to me was that he proposed to meet on Monday and Tuesday essentially to deal, on a priority basis, with government business, that non-government business may be able to be slotted in later in the week-Wednesday and Thursday-as fillers, but we would be around on Friday because we would still be waiting for issues from the Senate. My first question to the Leader of the House was, 'Have we got five question times?' and the answer was, 'Yes, of course.' Mr Reith-No, that is not right.",73
250,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"It is correct. Mr Reith-On a point of order: it is irrelevant, because I didn't say it and I want to put that on the record. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order.",73
251,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"It is totally relevant, because he did say it. When I found out that a letter had been circulated which essentially proposed that the Friday be considered a continuation of the Thursday, I barrelled him. I said to him, 'You told me five question times.' Mr Reith-I'm saying that is not right.",73
252,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,You said you would come back to me on whether they wouldMr Reith-On the Monday.,73
253,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,Not on the Monday. This is a joke. You say anything to anyone and think you can grease and oil your way through any circumstance. The fact of the matter is that this man's word cannot be taken for anything. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I remind the member for Hotham to please direct his comments through the chair. It does assist debate.,73
254,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"It would also assist if he would not interject, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-You do not need to lecture me. Please do as you are asked.",73
255,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"All right, but I am responding to your point. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-You do not have to respond to my point. Continue with your speech.",73
256,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"I am happy to address my remarks through you, Madam Deputy Speaker. But, if you are going to call me to order, do so on the other side as well. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I will.",73
257,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,All right. I will hold you to that. Mr Reith-Stop pointing at the Deputy Speaker.,73
258,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,Who are you pointing to? Mr Reith-I am not pointing at anybody.,73
259,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Not now that you have been caught out, but you were. This is yet another misstatement. This is the problem with you. You say anything. The fact of the matter is that we want to move this amendment because we see this matter as yet again a breach of commitment, as well as unbounded hypocrisy on that side of the House. I remind the Leader of the House of what he was saying when he was on this side of the House. He was arguing that the opportunity be extended when we were in government. Last year he said: There is absolutely no reason--except for political cowardice-why we should not have a question time. He was talking about having a question time on the last sitting Friday. Mr Reith-Have you got the Hansard that for me?",73
260,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"I do not need the Hansard. He said 'except for political cowardice.' Now this is what they are expressing-political But cowardice. He argued there was a precedent certainly for doing so. On at least two of the extended sitting days in 1993 we had question time. people The Leader of the House has said that never happened before. The reality is that it did happen before. It happened in 1993. you cannot claim that it never happened he before. Mr Reith-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders, I believe the Manager of Opposition Business is required to give a full reference for that quote, including the page number Hansard, so I can take out the copy myself and read the apposite quotes.",74
261,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"The quote is correct, as is the refutation of the argument that there never an extended question time under us. It happened. Mr Reith-How many times?",74
262,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,It happened in 1993 on two occasions. Mr Reith-Twice in 13 years.,74
263,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"You have been in only seven months and you have broken every rule in the process. You also made what I consider to a further valid point on the last sitting Friday: that members of the House are basically sitting around, waiting for amendments to come back from the Senate for So why not use up the time by having question time? Why shouldn't we be in there holding you accountable, holding that hopeless front-bench accountable? You have the Minister for Family Services (Ms Moylan), who has never answered a question in her life, and the Minister for Small Business and  answer a question in terms of the conflict of interest matter. No wonder you want to close down the question time. Then I come to this quote, and this is gem. This is what Peter Reith said was in opposition. He went further and he committed the coalition to exactly what we of are now asking for by way of this amendment. This is Peter Reith-the same Peter Reith, the Peter Reith who now accuses others of hypocrisy. This is what he said: I can assure the House that the coalition will institute far better practice when we are returned to government. It says a lot about the contempt and the arrogance with which these treat this parliament that an opportunity for this question time ... goes begging. So An opportunity goes begging on Friday, and will not allow it. It is political cowardice. It is double standards. It is hypocrisy. This is the man who said that they were going to lift the standards. They cannot rely on the argument that we did it when, in fact, we did allow question time. He cannot rely on that, because he said and the government said and of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that they were going to lift the standards. What sheer and utter hypocrisy. The Prime Minister's much vaunted but infrequently was honoured commitment to raise the standards of this parliament has been so often breached that you run out of pages listing these things. I would not be surprised if the government opposes this amendment. What we will be doing is just highlighting to your backbench the hypocrisy and the hopelessness of the way in which this man, the Leader of the House, handles the place. We are in a shambles. He breaks deals, does not honour conventions and be says they are going to be more accountable. He is a person who could not manage a chook raffle. He can manage the special deal on the penthouse, but he cannot manage the affairs consideration. of this parliament. Since coming to government, they have shown nothing but contempt for the standards of this parliament. Just understand this: he imposed a time limit on the consideration of the workplace relations bill. Whenever we wanted to get to the detail of this bill, he imposed a gag. More accountability, but the gag. Mr Reith-Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Not only was there no a restriction on the second reading debate on when he the workplace relations bill",74
264,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"What's the point of order? I'm talking about the committee stage. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Will you please resume your seat and not speak unless you have the call. I am trying to hear what the Leader of the House is saying, and you are not helping. Mr Reith-Madam Deputy Speaker, I do appreciate your consideration on this important matter. My point of order is very simple; that is, that the member for Hotham is now discussing the passage of the workplace relations bill. That matter is irrelevant to the motion before the chair and the amendment to the motion moved by the member for Hotham. Under no possible circumstances could the passage and handling of the workplace relations bill be relevant to the matter currently before the chair. I invite you to rule accordingly. I appreciate that the member for Hotham, desperate for an argument, has ranged very widely in his presentation tonight, but my point of order is that he should be invited to stick to the matters before the chair. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan}-I remind the member for Hotham that earlier he made some objection on a subject of relevance. I do point out that your amendment is very specific. It relates to question time on Friday. I do not think you should revisit the subject of how the debate on the workplace relations bill was conducted. Would you turn to your amendment, please?",74
265,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I indicate to you that I am addressing the question of the amendment that is before the House. The reason we want question time on Friday is that this government is breaching undertakings to us and this is but one of them. The reason we need question time on Friday is that the circumstances that have surrounded the way in which they have gagged other debates require us to hold them accountable through question time. That is the whole point of alluding to these aspects. Mr Reith-We are giving you an extra two days.",75
266,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"He is giving us an extra two days. You are sitting for an extra two days because you cannot manage the affairs of the House. Let us face it: you cannot manage your government program. You cannot manage your legislative program. The only thing .. you have ever been interested in is your deal with Cheryl Kernot on the workplace relations bill, giving debate on the second reading but never on the detail. The devil is in the detail of your bill and that is why you have gagged it. He also removed himself from the proceedings in this place on the tax deductions for cooperatives. This is what the National Party wanted to cross the floor on. He was celebrating the workplace relations bill, gagging the debate through on the cooperatives and he says that he is lifting standards. Mr Reith-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: at the risk of being repetitious, the truth of the matter is that you ruled a moment ago in accordance with the standing orders that the member for Hotham was essentially beyond the subject matter before the chair when he was referring to the debate on workplace relations. He has now gone back to workplace relations in some of his remarks.",75
267,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"You don't like it, do you? Mr Reith-Well, he has gone back to it because they are rather fixated with the arrangements which the government sensibly came to with the Democrats. As a former ACTU President, I suppose he is very disappointed to see the privileges of his union boss mates taken away from some of them. Mrs Crosio-What does this have to do with the point of order? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! This is all very interesting, but I think the Leader of the House had better return to the point of order. Mr Crean interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Resume your seat! Mr Reith-The second leg of the point of order is that the member for Hotham has raised questions of the taxation law in respect of cooperatives. That is a very interesting topic of discussion for the House at some appropriate time but it is totally inappropriate now. Again, it just demonstrates that the member for Hotham has nothing to say on the motion before the chair. Given that he has 10 or 15 seconds left, Madam Deputy Speaker, a ruling from you would be now appropriate. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member's time has expired. But I was going to rule that he was being irrelevant. Is the amendment seconded?",75
268,Mr LEO MCLEAY,BUSINESS,"Watson) (8.23 p.m.)I second the amendment. The reason that the opposition is saying to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) that we should have a question time on Friday is that it is very much in the spirit of what the Leader of the House was saying when he was in opposition. The government started this term in the parliament by saying that the government was going to do better than the Labor Party did when they were in government. They were going to raise the standards. The Leader of the House was going to become this shining beacon and he was going to be an example to all members of parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was going to keep him up to it and everything was going to be the way they thought it used to be in the House of Commons. Then we come in here and what do we find? We find that the Leader of the House has unfortunately learnt a whole lot of bad tricks from the New South Wales parliament, the Victorian parliament and every other parliament around this country. The Leader of the House has debased his position in this House and he has debased the word of his leader. Now he is going to gag me. The truth gets a bit too close to the point and he is going to gag me. Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That the member be not further heard. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Crean's) be agreed to. MCArthur, F. S. * The House divided. [8.40 p.m.] (Madam Deputy Speaker- Mrs K.1. SulliAyes Noes Majority ......... NA Adams, D. G. H.

269,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Extension to the main runway Adelaide International Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation, on behalf of the state and federal governments, proposes to construct a runway extension at Adelaide International Airport. This extension has been identified by the South Australian government as a priority infrastructure project. The development is supported by this government. The runway extension will provide the opportunity for direct flights to target Asian destinations. Direct flights are considered necessary for facilitating tourism and the export of produce and products from South Australia and, thus, the economic growth of the state. The estimated outturn cost is $48 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in March 1997 and be completed by November 1998. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee",77
270,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: NOES That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the commitPAIRS tee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO Research Interaction Centre and Biomolecular Research Facilities, Black Mountain, ACT. CSIRO proposes to demolish existing laboratory facilities which are seriously substandard and very much outdated and to redevelop the site to construct a high-quality research laboratory to meet the Division of Plant Industry's requirements for biological research into the 21st century. The proposal will allow the CSIRO to increase its capacity to communicate the results of its research, not only for the benefit Reference of the industries that it serves but also as a service to the Australian community. It is therefore planned to incorporate the Division of the of Plant Industry laboratory into a CSIRO Research Interaction Centre to enhance the organisation's image in the community at large. It is intended that this complex will at bring the concepts and achievements of CSIRO's research to the community and provide programs that will enable special groups and CSIRO stakeholders to share in the excitement of new scientific discoveries. The proposed CSIRO Research Interaction Centre, which is to be integrated with the laboratory wing, will offer interactive exhibits illustrating CSIRO research and its applications in the community. The centre will be substantially self-funding in its operation and it is intended to provide a powerful statement about CSIRO's commitment to inform the public of its research and, in tum, inspire long-term interest in and support for the CSIRO. The CSIRO Black Mountain site is lacking in amenity facilities for the use of its staff. It is proposed to overcome this deficiency with the incorporation of cafeteria, conference and banking facilities in the complex. The Public Works Committee tabled their report on 19 November 1996, recommending the project at an estimated outturn cost of $17.1 million. In Reference their report, the committee recommended the construction of the CSIRO Research Interaction Centre and Biomolecular Research Facilities at Black Mountain, ACT, but suggested that consideration be given to the provision of covered access to the complex from the kerb side to the front entrance. CSIRO has noted the committee's recommendations and will review the design of the main entry area to determine that covered access can be provided from the kerb side within the current project budget. If approved, the project is planned for completion by the end of 1998. I would like to thank the committee for their report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-I remind the member for Sydney that there is a dress standard in this House which is different from during divisions and other times. Would you please withdraw from the House.

271,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I indicate to the House that the government proposes to move that amendments 1 to 9, 19, 29 and 30 be agreed to and that amendments 10 to 18, 20 to 28 and 31 to 36 be disagreed to. May I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments 1 to 9, 19, 29 and 30, and when those amendments have been disposed of to consider amendments 10 to 18,20 to 28 and 31 to 36.",80
272,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I certainly have no objection to dealing with the first group of matters. I understand that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is proposing to move that the House agree with those amendments of the Senate. I had discussions with the minister's office and was given to understand that the minister would be proposing to move the subsequent amendments in four groups. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-If I may just intervene, there is nothing that the minister has proposed that would preclude that. He is proposing that the House consider the amendments that have been referred to together. The proposal is that when those amendments have been disposed of we should consider amendments 10 to 18, 20 to 28 and 31 to 36. All that is being requested at the moment is that they be dealt with as two different groups. How they are dealt with within those groups is up to the House.",80
273,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If we can revisit that issue, I have no problem with simply dealing with the first group. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-That would be the procedure, yes.",81
274,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If I may just raise the issue that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) adverted to, because I do not want it to be thought that there is on my part any duplicity in this issue, a member of my staff did speak to me and I understand to the shadow minister's staff and pointed out that there were four discrete areas in which the amendments could be grouped and that that may facilitate discussion. However, between the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the staff of the DepartProfessor ment of Social Security, the procedures have been developed separately and in another way. In order to move to any other form may require a revisiting of the material and a preparedness to deal with it in the way in which it was discussed. I am simply wanting to indicate that it may suit the convenience the House if the matters were able to be dealt with together, although I would not want that to constrain the debate in order to deal with it now. It would require disaggregation of material that might have been prepared in expectation that it would have been handled in another way. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Before we anticipate that, my understanding, from what the member for Denison said, is that the opposition would agree to the motion that you are about to move that Senate amendments 1 to 9, 19, 29 and 30 be agreed to. I suggest that we dispose of that motion. Would you move that motion, Minister?",81
275,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That Senate amendments 1 to 9, 19, 29 and be agreed to. I will make some brief points on these matters. The amendments were designed to amend the commencement provisions of the bill to take account of the fact that the bill did not receive royal assent prior to specific dates and to make some consequential amendments and other machinery provisions to take account of the fact that the bill did not receive passage earlier. Amendment 4 proposes to insert an application clause into the bill, purportedly to remove any doubt as to whom the waiting period will not apply to. Amendment 5 concerns the effect of the Racial Discrimination Act and proposes to insert a clause into the bill to indicate that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are to prevail over the amending act. The government does not oppose this amendment. However, in doing so it wants to note that it does not consider the amending act ever was or is in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act. To that end, it is noted that the evidence of Ivan Shearer and the Attorney General's Department given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was that the bill does not discriminate on the grounds of race or contravene international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimiof nation. This position was adopted by the majority of that committee. Amendment 6 is a consequential amendment, government instigated, resulting from changes made in amendment No.1. Amendment 7-relating to the day on which a permanent visa is to be taken to have been granted for the purpose of a newly arrived resident's waiting period-provides a newly arrived resident's waiting period for a person who is granted a permanent visa in Australia after having appealed. An initial decision to grant that visa is to commence from the date of the initial decision. The amendment was made to give effect to recommendation 7 of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. Amendment 8 is another government instigated amendment. The government 30 always envisaged the guidelines would be issued to assist delegates in determining who should be treated as a family member for the purposes of this act. The amendment inserts a new subsection that provides that the minister may, by determination in writing, set guidelines for the exercise of the secretary's power and that the guidelines may be revoked and may vary. Amendment 9 relates to the definition of the newly arrived resident's waiting period. Again, it was government instigated. The amendment removes the reference to a jobsearch allowance relating to a newly arrived resident's waiting period as it is no longer necessary given that the jobsearch allowance was abolished. There are some like matters, but they are largely issues that arose out of government amendments giving effect to those matters which it had acceded to as a result of the Senate committee's deliberations and technical and consequential amendments.",81
276,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The opposition supports this group of amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill. They can be conveniently classed in two groups. The first reflect a recognition by the government that it failed to get its legislation before the parliament in sufficient time to bring into effect the legislation on the dates it had intended to bring it in. That is, aside from any question of retrospectivity, the government did not bring the bill into the House nor give it sufficient priority in the Senate so that it could be dealt with before the dates set in the bill acted as commencement dates. So there obviously needed to be changes in the legislation to cover that contingency. What I find particularly ironic about this is the spurious alleged savings that are now said to have been lost to the government by reason of the Senate's decision. Senator Newman claimed $124.9 million would be lost primarily because of a change in the start date from I April 1996 to the date of royal assent, which we can conveniently assume would be intended to be early in the new year now. So the government is blaming the Senate for the coalition's failure, first, to recall the ment before 30 April this year and, second, to introduce the legislation into the Senate before last week. It is an extraordinary proposition that $125 million in alleged lost savings are now being attributed by the minister to actions in the Senate when the bill was not brought before the Senate in time to come into effect on the dates the bill itself said would be the dates of its commencement. We have this extraordinarily phoney campaign that has been run in the community-again, unworthily by this government-on the basis of the government positioning itself to take advantage of a sentiment that it knows to exist in the community and of asserting that the Senate and the non-government parties have acted in an irresponsible manner. But it failed to give priority to this legislation either in this House or in the Senate. The government's own legislation could not have come into effect on the dates that it set out in its legislation because of that fact, so it has to move consequential amendments, which we are now asked to agree to, so that the legislation can come into effect at a time in the future. It claims that lost savings of $125 million will be the consequence of that. I do not think I have heard anything so fanciful in my life. It is a most extraordinary circumstance. When one finds that we have had threats of a double dissolution and suggestions that Australian taxpayers are going to have to foot higher taxes as a result of this action, what one really finds is that it is the government's own failure to bring this legislation before this parliament in a timely way so that the matters could be dealt with. Mr Truss-What about Senate obstruction?",82
277,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"There is no question of Senate obstruction. It did not get before the Senate. How could it be a matter of Senate obstruction? The House of Representatives has an overwhelming majority of government members. It would have passed through this House at any time the government presented it to this House. Had the government prepared its legislation at a more rapid rate and brought it before the Senate, it would have been able to have the vast majority of savings in effect parlianow because we have allowed the vast majority of savings. The vast majority of savings provided for in this bill have been conceded. But the government itself did not get it into the Senate, so it has to come back and change its own legislation and then blames the Senate for that. What an extraordinarily silly proposition. The second point is a wise measure that simply clarifies the consistency of the provisions with the Racial Discrimination Act. I am pleased the minister has seen fit to allow that to stand. It stands in stark contrast to his colleague in the area of Aboriginal affairs where-(Time expired)",82
278,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I do not want to prolong this debate except to say that the argument of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) hangs on the date that the bill went to the Senate-and the bill was in the Senate by 30 May.,83
279,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,You could have brought it on.,83
280,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"You know, as every member of this House knows, that the conduct of the Senate's affairs is in the hands of the Senate. It is not in the hands of the government. The question of what priority will be accorded is determined by the opposition if it can obtain the cooperation of the other parties and minority interests in the Senate, which it was able to do with the passage of some of these amendments in the other place. You can argue till the cows come home, but the fact is that this bill was in the Senate on 30 May. That was the date it was in the Senate. It being in the Senate on 30 May, the Senate had the opportunity",83
281,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,3D May?,83
282,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, 30 May-the day we passed it.",83
283,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"You passed it, but you didn't deal with it.",83
284,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is not a matter of us dealing with it. The matter is in accordance with the Senate standing orders as to when it is prepared to deal with the matter. It is perfectly obvious. If the Senate and those who organise the Senate's business had been in a position, as far as the government is concerned, to organise it any earlier, I am sure that would have happened. But the progress of legislation through the Senate has been painfully slow. This legislation was through this chamber and in a position where the Senate could have dealt with it in time for these measures to be able to operate fully.",83
285,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I might conclude the remarks I was making on the Racial Discrimination Act, which I think is worthy of some comment. I commend the government for being willing to deal with this in an express and clear way. I think it is an area where we were able to find common ground where, unfortunately, too frequently we have been unable to do so. But I contrast that with the area of Aboriginal affairs, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge, where it was said that to take such an action would be an unfortunate and impermissible precedent. I am pleased that, at least in this case, the precedent has been set in a way which, I believe, has been welcomed by both sides of the political spectrum. Obviously, a prolonged debate about the manner in which this bill proceeded through the parliament is hardly likely to be edifying to those who are listening, but I simply make the point that this bill went into the Senate, the Senate set up a committee to look at it and the committee reported and completed that report in September. We suspended any provisions that existed that would not have allowed consideration of this legislation. The fact that the government saw no urgency in this matter and allowed the time to run so it did not come up for debate on a second readingMr Allan Morris-It wasn't urgent.",83
286,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It was not urgent-until the bill's own clause for its operation coming into effect had expired, is entirely a matter for government priority decision making. It is not a matter over which the opposition exercised any influence whatsoever nor did any of the other non-government parties. If the minister's party in the Senate chose not to give this bill any priority, as it chose not to do, it has a hide thicker than a rhinoceros to tum around and blame the failure to achieve the savings in the period between the introduction of the legislation and its passage by the Senate on the Senate. It was not of that nature whatsoever. What we are finding are phoney claims, exaggerated claims and rhetoric of a kind that, when the minister speaks outside this environment, he claims to be irresponsible and conducive to creating the kind of intolerance in the community that he deprecates. Senator Newman used language which, were it expressed by anybody outside this parliament, I am certain would have been condemned by the minister in the strongest of terms, and we find the Treasurer using this to springboard rhetorical attacks on the opposition on a completely phoney basis.",83
287,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"This whole issue has been marked by three things-incompetence, vindictiveness and meanness of spirit. One just has to go back to the election and the now famous comments made in Queanbeyan by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the extension of waiting periods when he said that the twoyear waiting period does not apply to family allowance and other benefits. The impression given by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last week of the Senate changespicked up very accurately by Mr Ramsey in last weekend's Sydney Morning Heraldmakes it very clear how the government has been absolutely misleading and deceptive, attempting to create the view in the community that somehow there was this massive rort where people were getting hundreds of millions of dollars by coming to Australia and simply getting on to social security. Mr Truss-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This debate is about particular amendments. The honourable member is clearly speaking about a matter which will be before the House shortly but is not currently under consideration.",84
288,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Hollis}-As the honourable member for Wide Bay, who occupies this chair frequently, knows, members often use examples to amplify their case. I understand that that is what the honourable member for Newcastle is doing. There is no point of order.",84
289,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is important to lay down some platform, otherwise these issues become impossible to understand in the wider community. The fact is that the government has been incompetent in how this came forward in the first place. It was incompetent in presenting it. It is bringing it back here now and admitting its incompetence by its own amendments. It is now trying to pretend that its amendments were forced on it by the opposition, who clearly had neither the majority here nor anywhere else. Somehow we are now running the country, according to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). This issue is marked by a meanness of spirit because in many cases the minister is targeting people who are most vulnerable. This whole perception of what they are doing and this whole approach is so difficult for Australians to understand. We have had a bipartisan approach. I was looking at one of the minister's speeches on the racial vilification legislation, which he spoke on last year. He talked about bipartisanship and then said that 'you should not ambush us'. Talk about ambush! Ever since the election there has been ambush after ambush. Even tonight, more ambush is coming on. This is a guy who was talking about bipartisanship over and over and the fact that he had all these years of experience and how wonderful he was at getting bipartisanship and he was being ambushed. What kind of hypocrisy, what kind of cant and what kind of meanness of spirit is that? This minister is the same person I sat through an inquiry with for months and months-an inquiry into access and equity for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Go and read the record of that inquiry. Go and read what he said during those inquiries and go and read what he asked witnesses and then read what he has been saying ever since March. This whole area of immigration is now one of massive controversy. Why? They had no intention of this money being in the budget. Once the Senate sent it to a committee, they had determined themselves that they would not be putting that money forward but they would be wiping out those savings and bringing forward their own amendments. They determined that before the budget was brought down, yet they are still in the budget papers and it was still put forward as a possible saving when they knew well and truly that it was never going to be. That is the hypocrisy. This legislation is back here and we will debate it clause by clause, issue by issue, because it must be debated. But do not expect us to fall for the nonsense, the hypocrisy and the deceptiveness that is involved in this debate because it is not simply a debate about savings; it is a debate about the way this group wants to run the country. It is their style, their method and their approach. It is mean, incompetent and vindictive. Ever single oozing pore of those types of comments coming from those opposite reflects those three things. As this government goes on and this parliament goes on, as they get more desperate and more concerned at how that incompetence reflects on them and they are more able to shift the blame, as they have done so incompetently so far, we will see more and more of this. I do not look forward to that. It is not edifying; it is not good. I thought that bipartiorder. sanship was a viable option. We will never agree on all things, but there is a fair degree of potentiality. From the day of the election onwards what we have heard from this minister and this government is not bipartisanship; it is absolute deception. Go back to the Prime Minister's comments in the chamber and in Queanbeyan and the minister's comments ever since and you will see that it is a deception. (Time expired)",84
290,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The perpetuation of this myth that in some way the government is in a position to determine the Senate's program when you have a majority against youMr Allan Morris-You need two votes.,85
291,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is a fact of life. I am not complaining about it, but I am not prepared to accept that the government carries responsibility where it does not have the numbers. I am prepared to be blamed for the things that we actually do. I am prepared to even accept some of the criticism which is directed in a very personal way, I note now, about myself, with the use of some of the language that we hear. I do not bleat about those sorts of things. But I am not prepared to accept as a factual matter the bald assertion that the handling of these matters is in the government's hands when they reach the Senate. It is totally wrong, and any objective observer would understand that that is wrong. The Senate determines the priority that it accords to the legislation, when it is prepared to deal with it and when it will allow the passage of that legislation or otherwise. That is what happened in this matter and, no doubt, is what will happen to a large number of other bills.",85
292,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We really ought not need to speak further on this, but the government determines the order in which it brings forward government business. It has been hiding, for example, on the Telstra legislation. It has been delaying bringing that forward so that it will delay having a vote on it. It is for the government to determine which government measures come forward in which What the government did in this instance was decide that it would not bring this matter forward because it gave preference to other matters. The consequence of those decisions was that this bill was not before the Senate in time to come into operation as it was drafted. It was that which led the government to falsely attribute a failure to achieve $129.9 million in relation to those matters. They are fraudulent, fatuous claims.  surprised to be speaking in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill ahead of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) but, burdened thus, I shall continue. Listening to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), for whom I have some regard, I must say that I tried to reflect on the 13 years we had in government-12 of which I was pleased to be a member of the government-and tried to recall which year it was that we had a majority in the Senate. Mr Brough interjecting assist me by nominating the particular year in which we had a majority in the Senate. I regret to say that I hear some disorderly interjections about the Democrats. It is true that those in this House who enjoy a majority often have to negotiate to get their legislation through the Senate. To the member of the government who is vociferously but disorderly interjecting about the Democrats, yes, it is true that we negotiated with them, just like your Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) did over the industrial relations bill-I must say to our deep regret. I am trying to make the point that it behoves the government, and particularly ministers, if they see a priority in their legislation, if they see a line in their legislation, to negotiate the hurdles of the Senate. I realise how flush they are, how overwhelmed they are, to get into government-I have congratulated them on a number of occasions-but with that comes responsibility. There is a responsibility to get your legislation through the House and there is a responsibility to get your legislation through the Senate. It really is unbelievable for us on this side of the House that you, as a government, start bemoaning and bewailing the fact that you do not have a majority in the Senate. We never did. You did in the Fraser years, but we never did. Mr Allan Morris-They only need two votes.  for Newcastle points out, they are a lot closer than we ever were. Much as I have time for the honourable minister at the table, I am surprised that he would want to use this lack of a majority in the Senate as an argument for his failure to get the legislation through. It comes as a disappointment to me to see immigration figuring so high in the public mind today. After all, we were bringing in about 75,000 under our program and I think the number that the minister is contemplating is about the same. To get the net migration figure, you need to take away about 20,000 to 30,000. So all we are talking about is probably a net figure of 50,000. Since 2 March a perception seems to have been cultivated in the community that newly arriving migrants are somehow responsible for any economic ills that we are suffering. I suppose a subset of that is that Asian migrants in particular are responsible. I find that ironic, given that the most number of migrants to come to Australia are from New Zealand and the second largest number, of course, come from the United Kingdom. I am the son of a migrant and, I must add, the son of a migrant who suffered some degree of bias at the time my mother arrived in 1939. For my part, I think Australia is a much better place as a result of the rich texture of the migrants who have come here time and who have made such a great contribution to this country.",85
293,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not wish to delay the House. I have endeavoured to make my remarks short when I have made them. The substantial difference between the way in which the Senate is now behaving and the way in which the Senate dealt with legislation while you were in government is quite contrary to the position that the Labor opposition is taking. Oppositions when they comprised the coalition rendered a great deal more cooperation. If we are talking about the spirit of bipartisanship, the fact is that the substantial reforms that were achieved by a Labor minister were achieved by Senator Robert Ray, the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for whom I had some regard. He embarked upon a number of difficult decisions in dealing with the same issues that I am having to deal with today, and those are the sorts of issues that are involved in maintaining the integrity of the program. It was Senator Ray who brought in the measures, for instance, that first established that there needed to be a form of balance of family test in relation to constraining the number of people who might be able to come through that part of the program which has been available for aged parents. It was a difficult decision for him to take. It was a difficult decision for the Labor Party to give effect to. It would have been an easy decision for me as the shadow minister at that time to have walked around the country doing the sorts of things that the honourable member for Denison is doing now. Mr Allan Morris-That you're doing now.",86
294,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, the sort of thing that the member for Denison is doing nowparading around and saying that it is very hard to deny people the opportunity to have their parents In Australia. The fact is that the Labor Party was prepared to support a measure which made it hard for those people who did not satisfy a balance of family test. We now need to deal with the same sort of issue. Aged parents comprise more than 10 per cent of the total program. Last year they came in at around 9,000. So out of a program of 74,000Mr Kerr interjecting",87
295,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No. We are talking about aged parents. Aged parents under your program came in at 9,000. If you are talking about a program of 74,000 and if you want to take the further step of adding in the humanitarian entrants, you are talking about 10 per cent of the total numbers, and that imposes a very significant cost on the whole community. We want to bring in a majority of family test. What do you do? You oppose it. I can you take you through many examples of that sort. They go to the integrity of the program. The difference in having a Liberal coalition government in office is that when you had to deal with those sorts of situations in government, we gave you that sort of cooperation. We are now in a situation where you are able to determine in the Senate the order in which these matters are dealt withand you do. You are able to determine the Senate's program in relation to these matters-and you do. You are concerned that we might point out the fact that you have a hand in these matters. If we are going to have a debate of any substance, I do not know how I can accept those sorts of points without pointing out the impact of your role in the decision making. We have raised the question of cost. The  has alluded to the suggestion put about by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) that Labor's sabotage of this measure involved a cost to the budget of only $50 million per year. The fact is that the direct cost of the opposition's amendments was $227 million. If you add to that the cost of providing access to special benefits to those people who would have otherwise been excluded from access to other benefits, it is a further $107 million. Mr Allan Morris-For the four years?",87
296,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Over the four-year period, which is what we are talking about. The latest starting up point involved an additional $78 million. That is where the $400 million cost comes from. That has been speJt out",87
297,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,You are making the same points as Senator Newman.,87
298,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Those figures were provided by Senator Newman. On that basis, you have been endeavouring to suggest that these matters would have a minor impact. In budgetary terms, they will have quite a significant impact. (Time expired)",87
299,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I will be very brief. It is important to put on record that the Senate now operates with a series of committees and it operates with priorities and cut-off dates. The system is that legislation introduced in one session is not finalised until the next session, with that option being overridden if the Senate so chooses. This was designed last year by the current government and the Australian Democrats. They established the system that has been operating since then. It is within this system that they have put forward this legislation as well as all the other legislation. They designed the system that is now operating. When we listen to what the minister is saying, we get the impression that the opposition has more senators than the government. The fact is that the government have something like 10 senators more than the opposition in the Senate, yet they are somehow saying that we dictate in this matter. It is important to realise that the process is in place. There are cut-off periods, and matters are dealt with in the next session unless prioritised and agreed to. The committee structures established are now chaired by particular parts of the Senate. This system was established by the government and the Democrats last year, not by us. It was opposed by us at the time. However, it is their system which they are now criticising. Any attempt to say otherwise is sheer cant, and that is reflected in the rest of what they say. If they get that part wrong and cannot be honest about the Senate processes, what of the honesty of their costings and the rest of the things about which they talk? If they are going to deceive the public at large here tonight about the Senate processes, how can we trust anything they say? How could anybody trust anything that this minister says about any of this legislation if he tries to mislead the community at large over a Senate system that he helped design? The government set it up and boasted far and wide about what a massive and wonderful improvement they had made to the Senate. They are now talking about the improvement they made last year. My, my, how times and positions have changed. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is important the people understand that the Senate we are talking about is the system the government designed.",87
300,Mr TRUSS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"My, my, how things have indeed changed. The same people who have been vigorously defending the Senate tonight made precisely the opposite statements not very long ago. They have very short memories indeed. I can certainly recall almost every Christmas since I have been in this House criticisms from the government about delays in their legislative program caused by the Senate. That is precisely what has happened on this occasion. For some reason or other-my, my, how things have changed-{)n this occasion, delays are being lauded by the Labor Party. They think it is appropriate action for the Senate delay the government's legislative pattern. I acknowledge that the Senate has processes and procedures that take time, delay the processes of government legislation and give detailed scrutiny to matters. That all takes time. However, it is simply a nonsense to suggest that the timetable of the Senate is in the hands of the government. Whilst we certainly have more senators than the Labor Party-I am grateful of that-we do not yet quite have a majority. It is true that one or two defectors are gradually coming our way, but, so far, they have not come the whole way whereby we can count on them. Certainly the legislative processes of the Senate are invariably slow. As the minister rightly pointed out, this legislation has been in the hands of the Senate for something like six months. The government demonstrated what priority it gave to this matter by passing it in the very first sittings of the new parliament. Within days of the election, this government had the legislation before this parliament. It was sent to the Senate before we broke on the first occasion. So there has indeed been a degree of urgency given to this priority issue. This election promise by the coalition government was given priority and sent to the Senate as quickly as possible. It has now taken from the end of May through until early December to return it to this House. Inevitably, this delay has affected the proposed start-up date for the legislation. The minister and the government cannot be blamed for proposing a more ambitious startup date. The' minister could be regarded as having had a reasonable expectation that that date could have been achieved. It could have been achieved had the Senate not proposed to take as long as it did in relation to the matter. I would also like to refer briefly to a comment by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) which left me somewhat amazed. He seemed to deny the claims of the government that the Senate's rejection of these matters would lead to tax increases. Has the Labor Party learnt nothing from its 13 years in government, when it spent money it did not have. Many of these measures would not have even been to necessary if you had not delivered to us a $10.3 billion budget deficit to start with. If the Labor Party had not, in government, spent money that it did not have, if it had not adopted the attitude that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is describing in the House at the moment-that is, increasing expenditure does not result in increasing taxes-maybe we would not have had the $10.3 billion deficit which we have had to address now that we are in government. Every time the government is denied one of its savings measures, it has an impact on both sides of the budget. We have one or two alternatives. We can increase the deficit-that is Labor's solution. We can borrow from somebody else so that we can pay benefits to migrants coming into this country. We can borrow other people's money and continue to live beyond our means. Sadly, the other option-the honourable member for Denison does not seem to appreciate the simple reality of a balance sheet-is that you have to raise more revenue. The clear message that the opposition are sending to the Australian people is that they want higher taxes so that additional benefits can be paid to newly arrived migrants. Let us make it quite clear that that is the message that they are sending to the Australian people tonight. The government seek the early passage of this measure so it can be implemented for the benefit of Australia. I am disappointed that opposition members are wasting the time of this House on this debate. (Time expired)",88
301,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I was not going to speak at this stage on the amendments. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill had been brought forward, and we thought there was agreement to it. I cannot allow the comments made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) to go by without confirming the position with numbers and what we are really talking about in this House. What needs to go in the Hansard record is the fact that, in the Senate today, the coalition has 37 senators. There are 76 senators in total. We know that the Democrats have seven, the Independents two, the Greens two, and Labor 28. And yet we are being accused in this House of controlling the numbers. Let's get facts put into the debate. What we want to have is facts. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you realise, when the original bill left this House, our 49 members did not have a great deal of say in it. When the bill left this House, it went to the Senate. The Senate then referred it to a committee to ensure-for their benefit and ours as well-that it did not, in any shape or form, interfere with the Racial Discrimination Act. After consideration of this bill by that Senate committee, the bill was referred back to this House on 30 September. It took the government-with its 37 senators and a minister directing it-from 30 September to give priority to this bill, as it did last week. There are a number of other amendments that we are going to talk about here tonight. I am certainly going to get involved in those as well. But we have got to have facts when we have debate on procedure. We have got to have the facts as to why certain amendments were made or why a delay has been caused. It is a certainty that, even though the Labor Party would like to direct the Senate, we do not have the numbers to do so. The coalition government have the numbers, with their dealings with a number of other senators. That is how they deal with the bills, and that is how they are brought forward. The truth has got to be reported. I will do it ad nauseam if the member for Wide Bay continues to get up and give us what he has just stated. The truth is that the Senate committee reported back on 30 September. Action was taken, but it was taken last week. There are a number of other amendments that I want to speak to. I will not take any more of the House's time. Let us have facts, not fiction, in this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative.",89
302,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"By indulgence first, if I may, what I will proceed to do to give effect to the arrangement that was discussed between my office and the shadow minister's office is to deal with the amendments in four separate motions. At the conclusion of the consideration of each of those items, I will then seek to establish a committee to draw up reasons for disagreeing with the totality of the amendments. So there will be potentially five votes between now and 10.30.",89
303,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,One division.,89
304,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"One division? That is helpful. I move: That Senate amendments 16 to 18, 22. 25 to 28. 31 to 33 and 36 be disagreed to. As I understand it, these are the amendments that relate to the type of social security payments that are to be covered by the twoyear waiting period. I will not seek to go through and identify the waiting periods in each particular matter, save to set out the philosophy behind the approach that the government has taken on this matter. The fact is that the government did seek and receive a mandate in relation to the changes that are the subject of this legislation. We made it very clear in our policy document Meeting our commitments that we intended to ensure that access to benefits for all but refugees and humanitarian entrants would be the subject of a two-year waiting period, and that, in relation to that particular measure, there would be specific provisions that would make allowance for changed circumstances after arri val. The opposition, as it then was, specifically envisaged that there might well be circumstances where the person who had given assurances of support had died or lost their job. There were a range of other circumstances that the government picked up in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 which were designed to specifically acknowledge that, when changed circumstances arose, they would be able to be taken into account. The government certainly had in mind, in relation to access to benefits, that those people who came through the business migration program or the employer nomination program and independent entrants ought to have sufficient funds to be able to provide for themselves after arrival in Australia. Those who came through the family reunion program ought to be the subject of sponsorship which was intended to be real. These were the people for whom the shadow minister, when he has spoken, has made the point in other circumstances that they could be the villains in the piece, if they want to walk away from their obligations. He committed the opposition to wanting to make those sponsors pay those obligations. They were the sorts of words he used on the Hinch program. The fact is that we know-and we have made this point over and over again-that the assurance of support scheme under the Labor Party was allowed to languish. It had been the subject of very few changes. We know from answers to questions in another place at different times-by Senator Richardson in particular-that the recoveries of moneys that were guaranteed under assurances were not possible. It was for this reason that the government made it clear before the election that it would be moving in this direction. You only have to read the documents that we put out at the time. It was quite clear that it was to be extended to the full range of benefits, except those that were specifically identified and for which we have not sought, in this legislation, such coverage. That was the background to the measure. These were not, in our view, unreasonable measures. If people are given an opportunity to obtain places in Australia in preference to others on the basis of assurances that they will not become a charge upon the general community, it is our view that those assurances ought to be honoured. The way in which you can ensure that they are honoured-when you look at the failure in the past-is to have a preclusion period. My time is almost passed, but, no doubt, in the context of the debate that will ensue, I will have an opportunity to add some further comments.",90
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Hollis)Before calling the next speaker, so that there can be absolutely no disagreement, I am going to read out each of the amendments that we are debating, in respect of which the motion is that they be disagreed to. After that, what I intend to do, while I am in the chair, is just to put the general motion that the amendments moved by the Senate be disagreed to. The motion I put now is that amendments 16 to 18,22,25 to 28,31 to 33 and 36, as moved by the Senate, be disagreed to.",90
306,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"One of the important myths to nail at the outset of this debate is that of mandate. Were it true that the government had a mandate for these changes, then no matter how reprehensible those changes were, I would have a different case to make. Mr Brough-What about Telstra?",90
307,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,We will not have any debate across the chamber. The debate will be through the chair.,91
308,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The case I have to make, however, depends on an analysis of whether or not the government does have a mandate. The fact is that the government very clearly disguised its intention from the Australian people on this matter. In opposition, the government released two major policy documents with respect to migration and related issues. Those two documents addressed, in considerable detail, migration policy and settlement policy. One of those documents was directed towards settlement policy specifically. With respect to settlement policy, what the coalition did was to say that it was very important that new arrivals in Australia be supported and that they have access to the full range of services and benefits that would be available to all other Australians with no discrimination. That was very bluntly there in black and white, in print. There was a major rally at which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke. Consistent with what we have now learnt of the Prime Minister and the way in which he seeks to speak in code, and to speak in different ways to different audiences, that major meeting was organised at night, with the only media that was sought to be invited being the SBS. At that meeting, with a large number of leaders of the ethnic communities, he sought to reassure them that what he had said previously in 1988 about race, and about there being a degree of difficulty within the Australian community about the capacity of the Australian society to absorb too many Asians, was no longer his view. He sought to reassure them that he was committed to an immigration program that was based on multiculturalism and that was consistent with the directions of the current government. That got wide publicity in all the ethnic media: 'Leader of the Opposition reassures Australian ethnic communities about his intention.' Did it get a run in the mainstream, non-ethnic press? No. Because it was not intended to. There was not supposed to be a word or a whisper out there about a commitment of that nature because he was running a subtext-the dog-whistling that we have heard-speaking in one voice to an audience that he was seeking to reassure and putting out a false message to the rest of the Australian community that, in some ways, he was less comfortable with levels of migration than the then government. He gave those express assurances. Then, two weeks before the election itself, the coalition released their policy document Meeting our commitments, which was not a document in any detail but a series of cost saving measures that they proposed. In that cost savings document they outlined savings they intended to make by extending Labor's six-month waiting period to two years. The first lines in Meeting our commitments begin: Achieve savings by requiring new arrivals in Australia to wait two years ... Explanation In January 1993, the Labor Government introduced a six month wait after arrival in Australia for migrants, other than refugee and humanitarian migrants, before they became eligible to receive most welfare benefits. Labor introduced that period. The document says that the coalition will continue to do it. Then it says that access will now be extended to two years. It then goes on and makes some other reassuring noises. It says, of course, that this does not apply to anything like family allowance. It says: Full access to Family Allowance and Medicare will be maintained ... So the framework of Meeting our commitments was this: against a background where a general assurance had been given in their printed policy documents-(Time expired)",91
309,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I want to take up a couple of the points made by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr). How hypocritical to come in here and tell us that, if we had had a mandate in your eyes, you would have no problems in supporting this. Ms Macklin-What about your policy? Mr Allan Morris-Don't tell lies.",91
310,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Wait until I have finished.,92
311,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Hollis)Don't be provocative.,92
312,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Yes. Just sit and listen for a change. The fact is that,92
313,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Newcastle should watch his language. The honourable member for Newcastle must not use such terms. You actually should withdraw that term. Mr Allan Morris interjecting,92
314,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, do not debate it with me. Just withdraw it so we can proceed with the debate. Mr Allan Morris-Can I draw your",92
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not want you to debate it. I want you to withdraw it. Mr Allan Morris-I withdraw. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. My point of order is that the accusation of the member for Longman a moment ago, in reflecting on what the member for Denison has said, has cast an imputation on the member for Denison's honesty and integrity. I draw your attention to that and suggest that it is inappropriate.",92
316,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It is late. We have all had a long day. We will all watch our language.,92
317,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As I pointed out, we did have a mandate, and I do not think anybody in this country argues about that when it comes to Telstra. We did have a mandate, and we spelt out in no uncertain terms the industrial relations policy. Did you allow that to go through unamended? No. Over 300 amendments is what you proposed. Is that your attitude towards a mandate? Let's move on. I do not understand how you can possibly-in the light of what is going on in the race debate, as we have been calling it in recent months-try to drag this debate down to one of racism. Some of the suggestions that you are making are that in some way the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has tried to, by sleight of hand, represent one situation to the ethnic community and then another one to the rest of the community. I see you sitting there bemused, but that does not surprise me at all.",92
318,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not want to interrupt the honourable member. It must not be, 'You, you.' Comments must be directed through the chair.",92
319,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to get down to the facts of this matter. The amendments have been put up by the Senate to have the following all reinstated---<:arers pension, widow allowance, disability wage supplement, newstart allowance, sickness allowance, youth training allowance for partners, mature age allowance, special benefits, partner allowance, parenting allowance, mobility allowance, senior health care card, the health care card and family payments above the minimum rate. So somebody who comes to this country, before having paid any money whatsoever into the tax system and without having contributed one iota to this country, can put their hand out and receive it. I understand that that is the opposition's attitude. I understand that is the way you think things should be. But does this happen anywhere else in the world? I doubt it very much, and I am sure that we will be enlightened to those facts a little later on. The fact is that I am quite glad that you have this attitude, because it just shows that you have not come in touch with realities of what the Australian population wants, what the Australian population expects of its government when administering the money that we are given charge of looking after. The fact is that what we are really saying, what you were saying and what the Senate has said in its amendments is that we should allow people to come into this country. We should, once they get here, let them access every item of our social security safety net, without having once paid anything towards the benefit of this country. That is not what the Australian people want. Mr Allan Morris-Tell the truth.",92
320,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I would suggest that you all-particularly the member for Newcastle, who continues to interject-go back to your own home town and tell the people in your electorate that this is what you stand up for. Tell them that you want people to be able to come in here and access our social security system without having paid their dues. I would like to see what sort of a reaction you would get in downtown Newcastle. The fact is that these are responsible measures. They add to Australia's savings, because we do not have to continue to borrow money overseas, which is really what we are doing. We have migrants in Australia who are unable to support themselves. They get on the gravy train-I am talking about a small percentage of them, but it does happen. It is costing us millions of dollars to support them-money which comes from one of two places: out of further borrowings or out of the pockets of Australian workers. If they are the policies that you support and continue to support, you will continue to sit on that side of the ber for many years to come.",92
321,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I will complete my remarks. When the coalition brought forward its Meeting our commitments document, plainly, people had a discussion about what it meant and how it was consistent with what the coalition had said by way of its more general policy statements. What occurred, of course, was that there were discussions and comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in explaining it. What you have is this situation. The claim for a mandate, the claim that there is some authority flowing from this election, comes down to in the end what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said yesterday in defending her exaggerated claims for lost savings from this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. What she said there is that the reason you knew the government must have intended this is that, if we were to sit down and analyse the figures in Meeting our commitment, we would have started to think about where those extra savings were to be found. So the conclusion is this. This is where the mandate comes from. The wise Australian voter, in considering what the coalition had promised, was intended to do this: he was intended to know that the coalition was going to move beyond unemployment benefits and sickness benefits and the benefits that were subject to the six-month waiting period already, and he was intended to have had the wisdom to know that the written statement in Meeting our commitments, that 'Full access to family allowance will be maintained' must have been a non-core promise. Secondly, they must have had the insight to know that when the now Prime Minister clarified his proposal by saying, 'It of course doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits,' he meant the direct opposite. They must have also had the resources of the finance department to work out that the $616 million savings projected in Meeting our commitments could not have been achieved by extending the six-month waiting period to two cham- years and then must have had the wisdom after that to conclude therefore that the coalition actually had a secret plan for which they would now claim a mandate after the election to introduce a two-year waiting period for all the measures which they had said they had no intention of applying the two-year period to. It is not surprising that no commentator actually reached that conclusion. There was a large debate about whether the costings of these measures were accurate. Peter Costello said publicly that what was being done was simply extending Labor's six months to two years but said that those savings would be achieved. So the basis of the so-called mandate is that you must believe that the Prime Minister was a liar, you must believe that the Treasurer was a liar, you must believe that what they said in their own Meeting our commitments document was false in so far as it said that it would not apply to family allowance, you must believe that they were not intending to apply any consistency with their previously published documents. Now what we have is the real voice of the coalition in government-misleading and deceitful, because where these measures come in are not in terms of income support benefits. Income support benefits have been dealt with as were projected by the coalition. When I went into the shadow ministry I said, 'I don't like this. I think we got the balance right', but the coalition went to the people and said, 'We are extending the six-month period to two years. We thought we had the balance right but we will allow this hurdensome measure to come in so that new migrants cannot get unemployment benefits, cannot get sickness benefits, and cannot get youth training support for those periods of times.' But if you are a working Australian, paying your taxes, with kids to support, then you should get family allowance-the sorts of things the coalition said you would before the election. They are not going to be able to cheat people out of what are normal nondiscriminatory benefits available to every person who has a family and works in this country just because they are targeting you as a migrant, just because they are seeking to play on these crude sensibilities that are run out there in the community. I am very angry that this debate has been so distorted by the coalition. (Time expired)",93
322,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The words used were precise. The words used in the policy document were written with care.,94
323,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Care to deceive.,94
324,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Care to mean exactly what I explained to you earlier. I certainly know because I had to go out into the field and talk to the very people on behalf of whom you say you are now advocating.,94
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)Perhaps you would address your remarks through the chair. I have not said anything.,94
326,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, Mr Deputy Speaker.",94
327,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,But you would have.,94
328,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,And you will not say any more.,94
329,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The fact is that if you read Meeting our commitments it is abundantly clear what we were proposing. Under the heading 'Explanation', we made it clear that the Labor government introduced a six-month waiting period; in other words, to establish that the principle of having a preclusion period was nothing that was unexceptional. That is what it established-that preclusion periods were appropriate in relation to access to benefits for new arrivals. You did it when you were in office in 1993. Quite frankly, you did it with our approval and support because we considered it was not unreasonable. If you go on and read further statements, they make it very clear. It states: The government will continue to grant all refugee and humanitarian entrants eligibility and access to welfare benefits immediately upon arrival in Australia. We made it clear that we intended that this measure would apply to migrants but not to those who were coming through the refugee and humanitarian stream. It went on to say: Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a coalition government. Does that not make it abundantly clear that it applied to all migrants other than refugee and humanitarian entrants? You want to deny the plain words used in the document. If it was not clear that it was meant to apply to family reunion category, you would read on and see the further explanation, which states: It would not have a direct effect on the family reunion category because those people are already subject to assurance of support. What we were saying was that if family members ar- coming through the gate in advantaged positions over other prospective migrants because families say, 'Allow our relative in. We promise we will look after them-' Mr Allan Morris-What about parents?",94
330,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We are not talking about parenting. We will talk about that later. I am going to come to that. In relation to family allowances, the document went on to say that full access to family allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival and that was the reference to what the Prime Minister had to say because he spoke about the family allowance and Medicare. The fact is that the family allowance payment at that time, when this matter was first developed as a policy initiative, was in a form which was a minimum payment. The government is implementing this measure on the basis that the minimum family payment will be exempt but clearly those matters were included in the original finance department costing, which had been submitted in relation to the election held in 1993 and was the basis upon which these calculations were developed. All of the information was before the former government to enable them to come to a decision as to the savings and the savings were calculated on that basis at that time. For alI of the confected reasoning that has been developed by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), people understood the nature of the proposals that we were putting forward. I know because I was at the butt end. I was the one who had to go out there and advocate this position to the people who were directly affected. I did it honestly and in terms of the policy that we have implemented in accordance with this legislation so that people would not be under any misunderstanding. That is the reason we produced a document setting out how we would meet our commitments. That is the reason that it was on the table. If people did not like that measure, they had the opportunity to vote against us. But, if they thought the measure was appropriate and fair, they could support us. You could only take it for granted that, with that having been explained, people thought it was appropriate and fair. (Time expired)",94
331,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I think we have heard enough rhetoric on this particular subject. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was trying to get across what was happeningMr Ruddock-Trying?,95
332,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, not trying; I thought he did very well. He did very well in expressing what was in the commitments. As the minister at the table has commented about what we were supposed to understand, I would like to draw his attention to what the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) said just before the election. He went out and told alI and sundry, 'When we become government, we will stop migrants from flopping on the beach at taxpayers' expense the minute they get into this country.' If that is not enough, apart from the costings of $616 million, there was that wonderful interview on the Sunday program on 18 February 1996 with Laurie Oakes and the now Treasurer of this country (Mr Costello). I think his comments are pertinent to the debate that is now before the chair. Laurie Oakes asked: One of your measures is to save $616 million over 3 years by requiring migrants to wait two years before being eligible for benefits, when the Government imposed a six month waiting period back in 1992 it was worth only $30 million, how can you get 20 times as much by increasing the waiting time by four? Mr Costello, that man of the moment, does not have to justify anything. He just comes out with all the commitments. He responded: . .. let me explain that policy decision quite clearly, at the moment in relation to migrants there is a six month waiting period for some benefits, what we've said is that people who are coming into Australia as migrants aren't coming into Australia to go on 10bsearch Allowance or unemployment benefit, by and large they're coming into Australia to bring their skills and to make a contribution. We think it's fair that in relation to making that contribution that there be a two year waiting period before going onto 10bsearch Allowance. I could have repeated that very slowly for the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) so that he, along with the minister, could understand very clearly that it refers to jobsearch allowance, which is going through in this particular bill. What perhaps should be referred to is the doorstops that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave in the days of the campaign. The member for Denison has referred to them. How well we remember that dreadful one in Sydney at St Gregorys when he was questioned by 'dreadful media' who asked, 'Tell me, Mr Leader of the Opposition, what are you implying? Is this going to apply to family allowances?' Mr Howard replied, 'Of course it won't apply to family allowances or any of those other things that would interfere with the life of the migrant.' He said that it would not apply. We are saying that it should not apply to those amendments that are now being voted against by the government because they have been moved in the Senate to bring the government back to honesty and back to the commitment they gave to the people during the election campaign. I believe a number of people have taken this debate between the sewer and the gutter, and I do not know where. After the amendments were moved in the Senate last week, we heard Senator Newman, a high ranking cabinet minister, say on ABC radio that, after the Senate rejected the bill, migrants in this country would be able to ride on the backs of the battlers from the day they arrived. Is this the type of debate that we want to see going in amendments to a bill such as this? We also had the Treasurer talking about a costing to his budget of $200 million. Then we heard the Minister for Social Security talk about a figure of $400 million. Then, in a matter of four or five hours, the Treasurer said, 'I was saying $200 million, and now you are saying $400 million. I will grab the $400 million.' The minister has now said that those figures were incorrect. I believe that the amendments we are now debating are telling the Australian people that every migrant to this country has a right to enjoy equal rights and be treated with respect regardless of their race, colour, creed or origin. Obviously, neither the coalition in House nor in the Senate, under the direction of Senator Newman, sought to show that common respect. When the Treasurer was describing what would happen to Australia if these amendments were to go through, he referred to our newly arrived migrants as 'these people', as if we virtually have to put up with them. He said that he was going to make it as hard as possible. The problem is that the Senate will not let them. I believe that we in this House have to remind the coalition that it is not in their commitments. (Time expired)",95
333,Mr TRUSS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The opposition stands condemned for attempting to block proposed immigration reforms put forward by this government. The coalition made a clear election commitment to ensure migrants did not become eligible for social security and other welfare benefits for two years after entering the country. Frankly, by every word that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has uttered in relation to this matter he has condemned himself out of his own mouth. The government's capacity to deliver on these election promises has been seriously compromised by the Senate's refusal to approve the measures. In this matter let us not forget the complicity of the Democrats-the people who are there to keep the others honest, they themselves said. They are conspiring with the Labor Party to prevent the government from implementing its clearly stated election commitments. The Senate's decision will add more than $400 million to the budget deficit over the next four years, and it will seriously damage the integrity and public confidence in our immigration program-and that is perhaps the most serious impact of the opposition's amendments in relation to these matters. Few Australians are prepared to pay extra taxes to fund welfare payments for thousands of newly arrived migrants. If members opposite think that I am alone in my comments, I would like to quote a few words from an editorial written by Nancy Bates which appeared in the Fraser Coast Chronicle this week. This is a newspaper, I might add, that is not noted for making kindly this comments about the coalition. The article states: The blocking of the Coalition immigration reform bill in the Senate by Labor, Democrat and Independent senators is nothing short of astonishing. Taking the politicians, ivory-towered bureaucrats and distorted special interest groups out of the equation, there is hardly a red-blooded Australian that does not agree with the thrust of the Coalition bill. When the Coalition was elected by a resounding majority, one of its most popular policies was the promise to trim immigration. There is nothing racist, selfish or xenophobic about that it is just plain common sense heartily endorsed by taxpayers everywhere. Of course we want migrants from all comers of the globe who can bring skills and capital to Australia. We do not want those who would become a burden on the nation or drive more Australians on to the scrapheap. We will see a line of lame excuses coming out justifying the opposition to the bill but the senators should be wary. The Coalition has been handed great ammunition for the next election. I think Nancy Bates in this editorial has clearly summed up public opinion. There is great anger and resentment in the community that this thoroughly supported coalition proposal, this election commitment, has been overturned in the Senate-and now that action is being further defended by members of the Labor Party. This is a matter where the government made a clear election commitment. It is a commitment that is supported overwhelmingly by the Australian people. We recognise that occasionally problems will occur also for migrants; there are special benefits in place for those circumstances. But we want to put an end to the practice where people come to Australia not to contribute to our country but merely to access our social security system. Not very long ago I was speaking to a senior Australian who had been on a disability pension for several years. He had just arranged for the immigration of his second Asian wife and was complaining to me that he was required to sign an assurance of support before his second wife could come into the country. He said that he did so under duress because we would not allow his second wife into the country unless he signed the document. But this was an invalid pensioner; he had absolutely no capacity to honour, or intention of honouring, that assurance of support. That is the kind of administration of this program which brought great discredit upon Labor and, sadly, has also brought great discredit upon the entire immigration program of our country. There was a lack of integrity there. There was no intention ever to honour the rules. The coalition is proposing, through these very sensible amendments, measures to ensure that those who choose to come to this country are aware of the fact that they must make their own way, that they must contribute to this country and not seek to burden our social security system.

334,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"This is a very serious matter that the House is considering tonight. We are talking here about very fundamental principles of social justice. However, the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) in his comments was talking typical redneck nonsense-and you ought to be ashamed of yourself with the kind of talk you put out. You may think it is electorally popular, Sir, but the reality is that all Australian citizens and all Australian",97
335,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Calwell, like other members, will please address his remarks through the chair.",97
336,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes. The honourable member for Longman ought to be ashamed of himself for his comments. If he thinks those sorts of redneck comments are going to win elections for those opposite, then he underestimates the Australian people and their sense of social justice. The fundamental points about the deception in this legislation have already been made by the shadow minister. But I want to ask the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) this: given his long term commitment to principles of social justice, which he had when he was in opposition, how can he justify not allowing a person to have access to a health card; that is, not allowing any person who comes to Australia",97
337,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Pays Medicare.,97
338,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Pays Medicare, pays taxes not to get a health card? What sort of a situation is that? Mr Mossfield-Appalling.",97
339,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"An appalling situation. What about this example? A person comes in. He works and pays taxes for a time, never gets sick-and then he cannot access the relevant benefits. What sort of a sense of justice is that? You might say, 'Oh well, they had a mandate.' But the mandate extended very clearly to those sorts of income benefits that concern unemployment and the like. It did not extend to those features of Australian life which make for civilised society-things to do with health, things to do with special benefits, things to do with carer pensions. What happens if somebody arrives and an unpredictable situation arises within two years and they need to care for somebody? 'Bad luck; you're within the two-year period; you can't get the carer allowance.' What about disability? These proposals are absolutely outrageous when it comes to consideration from the point of view of social justice. Let us not hear any of this nonsense that we have heard from the minister. We know that he is in a desperate situation trying to justify this, given his own philosophical background. But he does not have to agree with the rednecks, like the member for Longman and others in this chamber, one-termers, who are only here in this chamber for a short period-those who manage to just get elected because of their extreme right-wing views. The situation is that these measures are outrageous. They should not be accepted from the point of view of social justice and the government certainly does not have a mandate for them. But one has to wonder about all the threats that have been made as a result of the actions of the Senate. We have heard everything from 'We're going to force a double dissolution' over a measure which, as somebody said, is worth about $70 million a year at the most, in rough terms. It is probably less than that. An election would cost you $90 million. Are you going to force an election over a measure like this? Do you think the Australian people are not going to be able to differentiate between what they have approved in terms of the mandate and these other outrageous attacks on the fundamental services that constitute Australian civilised Iife-considerations such as the family payment, the partner allowance and the special benefit? What about the special benefit? Are you going to allow people to starve? Is that what you are going to do? Are you going to allow people without a special benefitMr Entsch-You're an ideological dinosaur.",97
340,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Here is another redneck talking now, another extreme rightwinger coming up with their Thatcherite ideas. These people want to reduce Australia, and especially the situation of migrants, to the sort of life which Britain has been reduced to, the kind of society with an underclass. If these provisions go through, these migrantsand there are many of them-will be effectively reduced to an underclass and we will have a lot of poverty. (Time expired)",98
341,Dr NELSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not consider myself a redneck. I do not doubt that many of those who have spoken on the other side of the chamber tonight are well meaning. It is obvious that they are well intended and it is obvious that they have a concern for those human beings that are coming to Australia. But I think it is time that they had a reality check. One of my constituents said to me about three weeks ago that he had got into a taxi in Jakarta and in the process of the conversation the taxi driver asked him where he was from. He said, 'I'm from Australia.' The taxi driver replied, 'Oh, that's the place where you get paid to do nothing.' People ought to remember that in 1995-96 Australia had 99,139 new settlers to our shores. Of those, more than 75 per cent came from countries from which, should I have chosen to migrate to them, I would have received no support from the government, neither upon my arrival nor after 20 years of citizenship or permanent residency. Indeed, eight out of the top 10 countries from which Australia accepted migrants last year have no social security system comparable to our own. China, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, Bosnia Herzegovina, the Philippines, South Africa and Iraq-none of these countries is so financially affluent nor, some would say, spendthrift as we are with some of our migrants. Furthermore, the country from which we accepted the greatest number of migrants, New Zealand-and in 1995-96 they numbered 12,265-has imposed a variety of residency requirements which must be fulfilled before benefits will be provided to migrants by the government. A minimum of 12 months residency has to be passed before a migrant is entitled to any form of unemployment or sickness benefit. Widows and domestic purposes benefits are only available should the recipient have been living in New Zealand for a minimum of five years, or three years for both spouses before being widowed. Anything up to 10 years residency is required to obtain the superannuation or invalid benefit. The exception to this in New Zealand, as in Australia, as it will be under this legislation, is for those in the humanitarian and the refugee program. If you then actually look at social assistance in OECD countries from research report No. 47 from the Department of Social Security, and again I refer to New Zealand, all benefits are subject to prior residence requirements of a minimum of 12 months and up to 10 years for superannuation and invalid benefit. In the budget that the government has passed this year, which has understandably been largely well received by the community, there is not one section of the community that has not been affected-from those who are the most affluent in Australia to those who are indeed the most poor. Every person in this country has made a contribution. What you need to understand is that if you want to become a transport vehicle, a transport medium, for the dissemination of Hanson's disease, just go on the way you are. If you want to see, after the next election, more Hansons sitting over there, then go on with this nonsense the way you are at the moment, because unless you",98

What the opposition parties need to do is to consider that there are Australians who have reached the point where they ask themselves, , For whose benefit do we run an immigration program?' Why do they work hard? Why do they make sacrifices for themselves and their families and pay taxes to support those people in Australia that do have neither power nor influence. I and all members of the government, and in particular the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), are particularly concerned to see that people in Australia do get a fair go. But if you want to ask yourselves why you are suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome, read the Hansard tomorrow and reflect on some of the things that you have said this evening. I think that these measures are quite reasonable. They extend to migrants and new settlers, at least some of them, a sacrifice which the rest of the Australian community is already making to seeing that we tum the deficit into surplus and we become a country in which we value our responsibilities as much as our rights.",99
344,Ms ELLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In the very brief time left, there are just a couple of very relevant points that I have to make, particularly to a comment the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) made earlier. The minister talked about assurances given and he talked about the changed circumstances of the sponsor. What he did not mention was the changed circumstance of the person coming into the country. I ask the minister if he would kindly, later in this debate, clarify when he says that there are assurances given-safety nets and so on. He is referring, I gather from the way he spoke here tonight, to the person who is giving the support for the migrant coming into the country. What I am talking about are the changed circumstances of the person coming into the country. I also refer to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) when I say the same thing. That is to say, if the member for Bradfield believes that the Australian, the citizen of the country already here, is already making all of these huge sacrifices, I ask youConsideration interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",99
345,Ms ELLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The point I am making is that if a person comes into this country as a migrant and faces a two-year waiting list for a widow allowance, a two-year waiting list for a carer pension or a two-year waiting list for a disability wage supplement, how on earth can we draw a parallel that they are being put into the same position as that Australian citizen who is already making the sacrifice? I do not wish these people to become widows, I do not wish these people to need carer's pensions, and I do not wish that they need a disability wage allowance. The point is that their circumstances may change. What I am asking the minister, the government and those opposite is this: where on earth is your compassion? You believe that you work and fight for and represent the families of this country and then you wish to see families come into this country and be deprived of the sort of support that is given in dire circumstances, where those supports are required. It absolutely stuns me. You do not talk about but you refer to the that might be out there in our communitypeople coming in and swanning off the back of the rest of the society . You make those references. I first ask: how many people who come to this country as newly arrived migrants actually would access the widow's allowance, the disability wage supplement, the carer's pension, the maternity allowance and special benefits within that two-year period that you are now extending? To what extent do you believe that that sort of exemption is really required? What are you really saying when you are talking about savings here? When you people over there talk about belief in the battler, when you people over there talk about belief in representing families, you are talking only about families that you choose to represent.",99
346,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I would be grateful if the honourable member would direct her remarks through the chair.,100
347,Ms ELLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am very happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. What those people opposite have to realise, and what they have to be honest enough to admit, is that at the moment they are making great hay over that debate on racial terms going on out there at the moment. I have no doubt at all that the member for Longman (Mr Brough) and others opposite are balancing their comments on the fact that they know that at the moment there is a certain bias and a certain fear in the minds of a lot of the community because of the sorts of problems that they are having about employment and their security. The previous government knew that, the previous government understood it, and the previous government brought in a waiting period for the sorts of allowances that we are talking about that the government when it was in opposition said they would extend to a two-year period. They never, ever gave an intention to the community of Australia that they would include widows, the disabled, seniors, mobility allowances and special benefits. They were never, ever spelt out. It is extremely deceitful to stand in this place tonight and allude to the fact that they did. sort of bias They were not spelt out. I say to the government and to the minister: if you wish to put that sort of hardship on people who happen to have some misfortune fall upon them in their two years, then the people who support those migrants into this country have got to give support on the basis that they are not widowed, that they are not in an accident and are disabled, that they do not have a relative who is disabled and therefore require a carer's pension. In other words, they need to support all of those backgrounds before they can honestly give an assurance for a migrant. I personally find it deplorable.",100
348,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) put some questions to me. Let me make it clear: the Meeting our commitments document referred to benefits plural. Benefits change and have always been the subject of changes. It is quite clear that it was the full range of benefits to which we were adverting. If you go through and look at the Meeting our commitments documents, you will find that, where we intended that specific forms of benefits would be exempted, they were named. When we referred to the safety net provisions, we made it clear that it was not the existing special benefit provisions that we foresaw would apply but it would be in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances changed significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control. If you look at the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill as we originally introduced it, there were schedules there that set out the full range of circumstances where we thought that might occur. That included the situation of migrants sponsored by individuals, which you adverted to. If you go on and look at the situation where people are sponsored by a business or an employer, you again will see a special range of exemptions-such as where the job was withdrawn after the person's arrival in Australia, the business went into receivership and the migrant's employment was terminated, the business ceased to operate during the first two years in Australia or the worker was retrenched. As to independent migrants, the fact was accepted that if funds were depleted due to a prolonged illness of one or more of the immediate family members-that includes their partner and dependent child--those special circumstances would be looked at as well. There was a range of factors that were related to events which were occasioned after a person arrived in Australia. But if the person's needs, as they are often characterised, were clear before people came, then the question has to be asked: why were they being sponsored for migration? Was it to bring people here to Australia to take up benefits that were essentially contributed to out of the funds of other taxpayers? Mr Allan Morris-That is a nonsense.",100
349,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, the view has generally been that we ought not be sweeping the world to pick up people to bring them in here and put them on our welfare system. Sponsorship was intended to be real. If your relative was being brought into Australia, you gave a promise, a commitment. If you were not able to meet that commitment, you should not have been proceeding with the sponsorship. Those are the sorts of questions that properlyMr Allan Morris-What is the problem with that? No-one argues with that.",101
350,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Those are the questions,101
351,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,You are having that argument with yourself.,101
352,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, I am simply putting the proposition that is covered by this measure. We made it very clear that refugees and humanitarian entrants were exempted. Other people are the subject of sponsorship and after that you are dealing with independent migrants where you essentially say, 'We think the same proposition ought to apply, but not for certain benefits.' So where a person is not eligible for, say, newstart, for which you would have agreed that an exemption was appropriate, but they could still get access to a special benefit because they were in other circumstances, our view has been that those people who come through the gate in those circumstances properly informed should know that they have to have provision to keep themselves for the two years after their arrival in Australia. Given the questions you have put to me, I will try to deal with any other questions that are put to me during the debate. Obviously I will not try to join issue on every point, but if there are genuine questions seeking information I will try to provide it.  p.m.)-I want to join in this debate when I hear the unctuous words coming from 'His Oiliness' opposite, the member for Bradfield (Mr Nelson). For him to be passing some of the comments",101
353,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are trying to raise standards a little today, and I would assume that those types of comments are unparliamentary.",101
354,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)While 'His Oiliness' may perhaps in some circumstances be regarded as slightly unparliamentary, under the conditions of this debate I am prepared to let it go.  that comes from the member for Bradfield on this issue. Would it not have been wonderful if he had applied the same strictures to the medicos when he was the secretary of the AMA? Would it were the case that he applied those same kinds of disciplines. But I do not want to talk about that. What worries me about this debate is that here we have a government that is a poll driven government. If particularly the newly arrived members of this chamber want to look back at the history of immigration and how immigrants were sought from across the world to come to this countryGovernment members-And they came.  am sorry.",101
355,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Try not to hear them and they will try not to speak.  of some of those interjections are important. That is why I am asking. I grieve when I hear some of the comments coming from those opposite, particularly from the newly arrived members, and compare those comments to the history of immigration to this country, to the hand of friendship that was extended by this nation through the immigration programs and to the growth of this country and its enrichment by immigrants that is envied across the world. I heard something earlier in the debate about the Senate. The now Prime Minister, John Howard, said in 1987: The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. He also said on 19 August 1993: The Senate has a perfect right to determine in which it will process legislation. The Senate will do what the Senate wants to do. It is only doing what the now government exhorted it to do when it was in opposition. What grieves me about the comments that are being made in this debate is that we have a poll driven government that believes that in the short term it can get political capital from kicking immigrants and dividing Australians. That is what this debate is really about. It is about dividing Australians. It is about setting Australians against Australians. Those opposite can laugh and smirk as much as they like, they can have a guffaw all they want about it-and the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) can too-but let me tell you that it will come back to haunt you. You are dividing this country. The mute endorsement that is coming from your Prime Minister and your noisy endorsement on the issue of racism is doing damage to this country that will take years to repair. You think you are clever setting Australian against Australian. You are not clever. You are doing enormous damage to the fabric of this country. Think a bit more about it. Take the short-term political gain while you can. The issue here really is your Prime Minister's mute endorsement of the racial debate that is going on. He thinks from the polls that you are getting that there is gain to be had from that. You might get some shortterm gain. To those of us in this parliament that come from immigrant backgroundsincluding all of you opposite; you are all of immigrant stock-none of us would be here if your ancestors in this country had shared the view that I am putting to the House. If what you now want to apply had been applied to them in dividing this country, you still would not be here. I ask you to take the bigger view. I ask you to take the view the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), used to take when he was in opposition. I think what has happened to the minister is that he has been crucified in the ERe and he is here defending the indefensible.",102
356,Dr NELSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,When did you get up and the way attack the member for Oxley?  here,102
357,Dr NELSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No guts.  that comment to me, my friend. The issue here is how we hold this country together and build this country, not how we tear it apart. That is the real issue driving this government. (Time expired)",102
358,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I feel it necessary to rise again because I have been called all sorts of things tonight, amongst them being a redneck, by a number of those opposite. I just want to put a couple of things in context here. First of all, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) said that I was trying to pick up some sort of mileage on this because of the race debate. We have just heard from the previous speaker, the member  Prime Minister (Mr Howard) somehow condones the race debate. The fact is that I spoke on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill when it first came before this parliament several months before the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her comments and before the issue became the issue that it is today. I stand on that record. I am not a racist. I am not a redneck. I am responsive to the electorate and I listen to the electorate, which is a damn sight more than I can say for those opposite. The fact is that the opposition seems to have missed the fundamental point here. The point is not that these people are going to miss out on some form of social security net, but that any person who is applying to immigrate to Australia is being informed todayand has been since April-that they will not be able to access these measures for the first two years. They come here with that knowledge. Did you hear me? They come with that knowledge. Therefore, if they choose to immigrate to this country-the lucky country as it is-they also must understand that it comes with responsibilities that they have to be able to fend for themselves for two years. Gee, what an unreasonable proposition to put to people! Let us just go to one particular point that you have rejected-the seniors' health care card. If any of you people opposite listened to your electorate for one moment, you would hear them say to you, 'I have worked all my life for this country; I have paid my taxes my life and now I can't get a seniors' health care card.' The reason is because they are self-funded retirees. They see this as being somehow a most unfortunate situation. How much more unfortunate do they see it when they see a person arri ving on our shore and, within a few short months, accessing that very same card? Is that a reasonable thing? Mr Allan Morris-That is just not true.",102
359,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is true. I put out a challenge to you, since you have been making so many comments tonight. I challenge the member for Newcastle to go into the main street of Newcastle on the weekend, set yourself up a little booth and ask the people of Newcastle what their thoughts are on this. They will send you packing, just where you deserve to be. The very facts are that these are reasonable measures. People are given forewarning before they come here. They do not arrive here and suddenly get told, 'We've changed the whole deal, folks. Too bad, you can't access our social security system.' They know before they make the decision to come here. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) said, most of these people come from countries which have no social security safety net. They do not know what it is like. Mr Allan Morris-Have you been to New Zealand?",103
360,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the member points out, if you immigrate to New Zealand, you will be waiting for about 10 years for some of these measures.",103
361,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The minister will observe standing order 57.,103
362,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, we are going to hear these people go on and on about the inequities of this system. The reality of the situation is that I am not a racist, I am not a redneck and I fully support these measures because they are responsible and they put the onus on people to be responsible for themselves. That is also what we are doing with our own social security net. There is no doubt that those measures will be rejected by you in the Senate as well and you will pay all the penalty at the polls for many years to come.",103
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"'They', not 'you'.",103
364,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"My apologies. Finally, let us remember that these people have been told before they get here. They understand what they are in for. They understand that they have two years to wait. It is not unreasonable and it is what the Australian population-they are not racist or rednecks either-expect us to be able to put forward, and we will do so.",103
365,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Before I call the honourable member for Moore, I would like to suggest to him and all subsequent speakers that they abjure the use of the word 'you' and enthusiastically embrace the use of the word 'they'.",104
366,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the motion before the House. If I may, I will just reflect on the immigration and refugee humanitarian program for the benefit of a couple of the new members on the opposition benches who were not in this place when it was brought into disrepute by the previous government. The refugee humanitarian program was brought into disrepute when then Prime Minister Hawke made what was, in effect, a unilateral decision-initially without consulting his own cabinet-to allow the Chinese students to remain in Australia, post the Tiananmen Square massacre. That was a decision that he made unilaterally. His cabinet fell in behind him because of the circumstances. As a consequence, our refugee humanitarian program fell into very serious disrepute. I challenge any of the members on the Labor side to disagree with that proposition. In fact, I know that at the time within the Labor Party itself there was a very strong sentiment amongst a number of the members that this was the wrong decision to have made. I know that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and I actually contrihuted to the debates at the time to alert the House in relation to what was, in essence, the undermining of what had been until then a program to which Australia had contributed as part of its humanitarian effort. It became a political football and, unfortunately, now we rind the situation where, as a consequence of that and as a consequence of the policy decisions made by the previous minister, as outlined hy the current minister in question time on a couple of occasions recently, the immigration program had become skewed in such a way that it also became subject to disrepute. As a consequence, we find ourselves in a situation where this country, which was built on immigration, finds that probably the great majority of its own citizens believe that its immigration and refugee humanitarian programs do not actually work. As a consequence, the government has introduced what are quite reasonable, acceptable changes to the immigration program to ensure that there is equity. I listened very carefully to the contribution of members. I consider the contribution of the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) to be a first-class contribution. I do not always agree with him, and I will disagree with him in relation to the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson). The member for Oxley is a voice from her electorate representing some of the anguish that many of the citizens around the country are expressing in relation to the immigration and refugee humanitarian program. They are expressing this anguish because the previous government brought it into serious disrepute by using it as a political tool. I know that, for instance, the previous member for Petrie, Mr Johns, a Queenslander and a junior minister to the Minister for Industrial Relations, made that observation during the period of the last government. He pointed out that the government had become hostage to minority interests and, as a consequence, had lost its way. He was staring into the abyss that was facing the Labor Party before the last election. He could see what was at the bottom of the abyss. What was in the abyss was, of course, this huge electoral defeat, because the Labor Party had divorced itself very strongly from the sentiments of mainstream Australia. Some now choose to call this racism. Some now choose to decry this as some sort of temporary phenomenon. What they are not recognising, through the amendments in the Senate, is the fact that Australians want the immigration and refugee humanitarian program brought back into some state of affairs where it is fair, where people know exactly how it is going to work and where those in the process know exactly how they are going to be treated. The Senate amendments have perverted this objective. We now find ourselves with the situation where, in order to redress the wrong the Senate has performed, we are faced with supporting the motion in the House today, which I wholeheartedly support.",104
367,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Not only are those opposite suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome but they are indeed suffering from reality deprivation syndrome. One only has to go down the main street of any town to notice that the community is totally opposed to what the opposition is seeking to do. We have more than one million people every year applying to come to this country. We can afford to pick and choose. If you ask people in mainstream Australia whether it is reasonable that migrants should come here and should be able to jump off the boat and onto the dole queue, then clearly they will say that that should not happen. The whip advises me that my time is up, but the point is that the opposition is totally out of order and totally out of step with the Australian community. I urge this place to reject what the opposition is suggesting and to strongly support the approach taken by the minister. The people of Australia have had enough. They have had a gutful of the opposition. They are asking for a fair go. They simply do not believe that it is fair and reasonable and acceptable for people to come here and automatically join the dole queue and be recipients of other social security benefits.",105
368,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"On a point of order, is it appropriate for the Leader of the House and the Chief Government Whip to be standing over members as they are making their contribution to the debate?",105
369,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. I thank the honourable member.,105
370,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I think I should interpose in the middle of this debate-although it is most important that my colleagues have a more extended opportunity to speak-because of the silliness of the last contribution. The suggestion that people can come off 'the boat' and get on the dole queue is, firstly, a throwback to a time ago when people arrived by boats, which is many decades ago, and, secondly, does not address the facts. It was the Labor government which introduced a waiting period for unemployment benefits and the Labor Party has agreed to the government's proposal for a two-year waiting period for unemployment benefits, which will apply to sickness benefits and to the youth training allowance. Those are the measures which the government is completely deceptive about.",105
371,Unknown,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Honourable members interjecting,105
372,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"To my colleagues who are interjecting at this moment, I say that it is not at all enlightening to have comments of that kind made. We actually have a situation where these measures, in the main, go to working Australians who have come here and settled as permanent residents in this country. They are paying their taxes, but they are being held out from that range of benefits which attach to ordinary taxpaying Australians. For example, the parenting allowance is no more than the old dependent spouse rebate. So what is the difference between that and the family tax benefit, for example? The coalition went into the last campaign claiming to be a family friendly party. They said that they would lift the tax threshold and allow low income people to cash out at a DSS as a cash transfer. That is exactly the same thing as the parenting allowance. So you have got this discriminatory policy that says to people who are working and living here as permanent residents that they will be treated in a discriminatory way on ordinary measures that are intrinsically part of the taxation system. That is a fundamentally wrong principle to adopt. To suggest that people come off the boat to get onto things such as the widow's allowance-they come off the boat so that their partner can die-is nonsense. Consider the situation: if you were to marry somebody who happened to come from overseas and had a child, your family would not get the family allowance benefits that every other Australian gets, even if you were in the work force. These are outrageous provisions. They are provisions that the then opposition spokesperson, in talking about these matters, said should not in any way be applied in a discriminatory manner. In fact, the coalition documents before the election expressly said that all these matters should not be the subject of any discriminatory policy. So how is it that we have this fraudulent outrage that people come off the boat in order to get benefits of this nature? What they do is come here to get a job, and 75 per cent of all people who come to this country as migrants never seek income support at all. And those people are being denied the range of ordinary support that working, battling families get. They are paying their taxes, they are paying their Medicare levies. And what are they expected to do? Not get the ordinary transfer payments that exist within the taxation system that other Australians are entitled to.",105
373,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,They are not Australians.,106
374,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"They are permanent residents. You want to treat the partner of somebody who marries into this country in a discriminatThat ing way. If I were to marry somebody other than an Australian and they were to have my child, you would wish that I did not receive the same family support as somebody else in this community. What an outrage! (Time expired)",106
375,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I feel that I have to be very brief. I am very ashamed not only to be a member of this parliament but also to think that this government would stoop as they have and in the direction they have regarding migrants coming to this country. A couple of things need to be said. First, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) got up with great panache, he thought, and explained to the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) that special benefits were going to be changed. He well knows, even when he covered social security, that special benefits are a discretionary payment. They are a payment of last resort that is sought when all other avenues have been explored. That comment also needs to go into Hansard. Those opposite, be it the member for Longman (Mr Brough), the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) or a number of other speakers, have said that the Labor Party does not understand what the electorate is all about. As the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) read from a newspaper, I will just read a few little lines from this one. I will be very quick. An article in the Courier-Mail of 28 August 1996 headlined 'Security net under scrutiny' explains where the government is making some mistakes. It says: The Government has to be very careful, however, that its search for savings does not disturb the equity of the social security system. Unfortunately, that equity is a casualty of the way the Government has singled out migrants for special attention. The decision to exclude them from benefits to which other permanent residents are entitled is not justified. People who are accepted as migrants are normally healthier and better able to get employment than the average Australian because of the way the selection process works. None come to Australia to rort the welfare system. Those who, through no fault of their own, come to need social security support should not be denied it simply because they have not been here for those several years. is an important point to get into this debate, because we on this side of the House have been accused of not understanding or appreciating what the electorate is all about. What we do know is that the electorate is listening, as I said previously in an interjection, to some of the talk-back rubbish on radio, which is promoting and projecting some of the irrational statements of this government. It is outrageous that we should even contemplate statements such as those that have been made in this House today, in the Senate during the debate and in this House when this bill was previously debated. It is appalling, and it is something about which each and everyone of us should be ashamed. We should make sure that we stand up and be counted, regardless of the racism debate. Most particularly, we should never single out those people who come to this country and make a contribution to it. We are treating them as the cause of all the problems that the government perceives. The problems are that the government cannot manage its own business, it has made commitments to the electorate at large and it has lied to the electorate at large. You have stated explicitly that the only benefit to be cut would be extended, and that is the unemployment benefit or, as the member for Fisher wishes to refer to it, the dole queue. We have said that we agree with your extending that from six months to two years. We have agreed with that part of the amendment in the bill. What we have not agreed with-no decent thinking Australian would agree with it-is that those people who come through no fault of their own should be made desperate or destitute because of the callous disregard of the members on the government benches. That is why we on this side of the House completely object to some of the comments being made in this debate.",106
376,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"One could get the impression from hearing this debate tonight that we on this side are seeking to make sure that migrants can obtain all social security benefits when they arrive. The honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) all made it very clear that that was their intention. They compared and contrasted access to those systems in other countries. That was the impression we were given. The fact is that that is false. These amendments are about the other payments. These are the payments referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at St Gregory's when he said that this legislation does not apply to the family allowance and other benefits. What is unfortunate in this debate is the sleight of hand. The fact is that the refugees who are coming will be maligned by this debate because they will still receive all the benefits. The ones who come here off the boat and get a benefit will be the refugees. So all that venom, bile and animosity directed to migrants will now be focused only on refugees. Mr Brough-Go and listen to your electorate.",107
377,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If members of your electorate knew the truth, they would not be supporting you. As papers are in order this evening, I will quote from Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. Alan Ramsey would be one ?f the most respected and least biased of Journalists, because he attacks all of us on a pretty regular basis. This is what he had to say on Saturday: What's happening, effectively, is just another nasty version of the race debate. This is not me, a politician, saying this but a fairly senior journalist, who has expressed concern over some time at what is happening in debates in this chamber and this country. Mr Ramsey said: Understand what the Senate did. It allowed the Government to extend, from six months to two years, the waiting period before any new migrant is eligible for three major welfare benefits: unemployment benefit, or the dole; the youth training allowance; and sickness allowance. It rejected Government attempts to impose a similar two-year waiting period for 11 other benefits, while the Government withdrew two more. Why did it withdraw two more? Was it because it finally thought that $0.3 million over four years for the child disability allowance was a bit rich? Negligible amounts for the double orphan pension, which involves children who lose both parents, were going to be withheld for two years.",107
378,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Really compassionate.,107
379,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"That is really nice. That was withdrawn. Another benefit involving negligible cost was the disability wage supplement. The government kept it on the list, because the message going out was that people were ripping off the system. This is about perception. Mr Ramsay had it right. He goes on to quote the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It is the same mantra. The Treasurer said: The system, according to themthe opposition partiesshould be this: you get off the boat in the morning, you can go onto benefits in the afternoon. This is the Treasurer speaking. He knows that was false; he knows it was wrong. Yet he quoted that just last week-not years ago, last week. He also said: Now, I don't think that's right. And the community doesn't think it's right. The fact is, nor do we. Nor is it happening. This legislation does not do that, and he knows that. He went on to say: We say it's only fair that you make your contributions. Or, if your family brings you out, that they support you for two years before you go on benefits. What he is not saying is: if you pay your taxes, why don't you get what other taxpayers get? The government is differentiating between taxpayers. Mr Ramsay also said: That's the way politics works, too. Now we've got new migrants to bash, along with all the other scapegoats this Government keeps coming up with to justify what's wrong with the economy. His final words are a question-to the government more than to us: Who do we blame next? Who do we blame next? The blacks? The unemployed? The migrants? Who is next? What is this government about? It is about dividing, scapegoating and making excuses. The economy is slumping worse and worse. (Time expired) Ms Ellis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. Could I seek your guidance? I preface this by saying I have not taken a point of order in this place before today, hence my uncertainty. When the member for Prospect was on her feet, I noticed the member for Swan use a very unacceptable-in parliamentary terms and, I think, in other terms as well-gesture of his hand toward the member for Prospect. I found that most offensive. I seek your guidance on the best way to handle the issue.",107
380,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I did not see the gesture. If it were made and had I seen it, I would certainly have requested that the member concerned apologise and withdraw it. I will discuss it with him and report back to you. Ms Ellis-I am unaware whether the cameras in this place show members around the chamber at any time or whether they record other than the Speaker or the speaker on their feet.",108
381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It does vary from time to time. Ms Ellis-If that can be looked at and checked too. Thank you.,108
382,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We are now reaching a point where I think the lines between the two sides in this parliament are very clear. They are very clear because what has occurred in this debate has shown that there is a willingness on one side of this debate to position a party politically in order to seek the support of those within the Australian community who feel uncomfortable with the degree to which the Australian community has changed over time and become a multicultural and diverse society. This is a coded debate which I find most unfortunate. It is most unfortunate because before the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, came to the role that he currently holds, he did have an honourable role in the Australian parliament. When measures of like nature were proposed in earlier times and when his then leader and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sought in 1988 to raise issues of similar contention, he crossed the floor. Mr Ruddock-They were not of the same character. If you are going to have some integrity, you should not raise these issues in this way.",108
383,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)Order! The minister can speak later, if he so desires.",108
384,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"On a range of issues in the past, the minister has taken strong stands which are entirely consistent with positions that are now being taken by the opposition. What has provoked this change? The simple fact is that this change has been provoked because, from opposition, he has now come into government; a government led by a Prime Minister who is prepared to take the low road on these issues, a Prime Minister who has not distinguished himself by leadership in a debate which is current in the Australian community. Far from being a person of courage, he is now the cat's paw of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is leading him to take steps which, I am sure, in his own conscience, he believes are difficult to carry through. It is sometimes true that people deceive themselves and come to believe in what they are articulating. I hope that is the case with the minister, because I would not wish to suggest to him that he is a dishonourable man. But I suspect that, 10 years from now, when the pressure of office is lifted from him, he will come to reflect on these years as being years when he ought to have done more to resist these kinds of measures. Certainly it will be of no benefit to Australia as a coherent and sound society if we come to a point where we develop two classes of persons living in this country, and where there are those who are treated differently because of the fact that they have arrived recently. It has never been the case in Australia before. We have had a strong, effective growing economy-a vibrant and healthy economy. We have gone through a long period post-war when we never needed measures of this draconian nature. It has never been necessary-it is not necessary now. We can have a debate about what levels of immigration are appropriate. That, I know, is an issue upon which different views are legitimately held by many. But to allow this situation to develop to a point where people are being treated differently because of their background and where children who came to this country and are part of Australian families growing up in Australia-working families-are being treated differently from other children in this country because of the nature of their background seems quite improper and completely inconsistent with anything the minister would have stood for previously at any time in his 24 years in parliamentary service. It is one of the ironies of political that he is now the author of this legislation. (Time expired)",108
385,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I will pick up these remarks because they go very much to my own views on issues of principle in relation to,109
386,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,He has attacked your character.,109
387,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"He has attacked it in many ways today. I have noticed all the things he has said and all the snide remarks that have been made. That is part of the man, if he wants to use them. But let us deal with the issue. I have crossed the floor on an issue of principle and there are very few people in this parliament who have done so. I have been held accountable for that and I have stood up on those issues. Let us understand what the issue was-don't rewrite history. The issue was my view on racial discrimination. That is what it was all about. This is not an issue of racial discrimination. To characterise it as one in which you can suggest that I am doing something for somebody else which is unworthy, which is really what you are sayingMrs Crosio-I didn't say that at all.",109
388,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No. The honourable member said it-flies in the face of what the Labor Party has itself done in office over time. Let us understand the principle. The principle of whether or not people are entitled to access benefits is one in which you can have differential provisions. There were differential provisions under legislation that you put in place. The six-month waiting provision was a differential provision. That is exactly what it was. The issue of when you grant people when they come through the door an age pension-we have said 10 years is the period for which there will be a preclusion period-is a differential provision. It has operated. We are not talking about issues of discrimination when we are dealing with this legislation. We are not talking about issues of racial discrimination in this legislation. That point needs to be made carefully, because there is no place for misrepresenting my principled approach to race, upon which I life have been consistent and will remain consistent. Certainly do not sling off about the fact that I happened, on one occasion, to cross the floor on an issue of principle when there have been issues of principle which many of you might have been able to address at a point in time in your parliamentary career but about which, because of the codes that you signed, you have never been prepared to cross the floor. You are quite prepared to sling off at people on this side, but you are never prepared to pick up the courage of your convictions and walk across this chamber from one side to the other with all of the consequences that that can have to your political career. Pay me more credit in future, please.",109
389,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I intend to give the minister credit by saying that I believe that he sincerely believes that the measures that he is putting forward are, in some manner, able to be reconciled with his past conduct, statements and beliefs. I am certain that 10 years from now he will reflect on this period and see that they tent, and I think he will be troubled by what he is doing now. I do believe that he has become simply the cat's paw of another agenda, an agenda which I believe he would, under other circumstances, believe to be unworthy. Whatever the minister's motivations are and whatever motivations he attributes to me, the point is that these measures are not worthy of Australia. Australia is a great country. I have heard in this debate people say, 'If you went to such and such a place, it wouldn't happen that way.' The example is often given of the United States. The truth is that the United States treats its own people very badly when it comes to welfare. It treats its own people appallingly when it comes to medical benefits. It treats its own people very badly when it comes to things like income support and a whole range of things which we in Australia take pride in. We as a nation do ourselves no credit in saying, 'Other countries do not do this; therefore, that is the benchmark for our own conduct.' We are in fact a greater, better and more pleasant place to live in than, I believe, any other country in the world. We will diminish our nation by these measures. If I can mention just one matter about costing, we have heard comment about the costs that are being attributed to the so-called vandalism of the Senate. One of the measures which I have dealt with was the starting-up time of this legislation, a matter which really is properly sheeted home to the government. The other matter, of course, is the attributed cost to special benefit. Senator Newman quoted in the Senate the other day a cost of $65.3 million over four years for having to pay a special benefit to the estimated 30 per cent of new migrants who will be eligible for such a payment due to hardship caused by extending to two years the waiting period for unemployment and sickness benefits. But the coalition, in its own Meeting our commitments document, promised special benefits would be maintained for those who needed to receive them due to changes in circumstances beyond their control. In other words, the minister is blaming the Senate for the cost of keeping a were inconsis- coalition promise. From the outset of this debate the coalition has sought to take some comfort in the most fraudulent interpretation of what it put forward in the Meeting our commitments document. I think anyone who reads from the outset the transcript of these speeches tonight will have no doubt that what the government set about to do was to playa game of deception upon the many voters of non-English speaking backgrounds who might have been concerned about such a measure. When the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was asked about these matters, about his costings, did he come up and say, 'Well, no, the costings are explicable, because they actually include measures that are not in the six-month waiting period that the Labor Party introduced'? No. He referred to unemployment benefits. I believe it was a deliberate and straightforward intention to introduce a waiting period by simply extending the six months to two years. When they came to office they realised their costings were as flawed as we said, and they decided to go a bit deeper. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrote to Senator Newman, referring to Senator Newman's own objections to including the child support cash rebate and other measures, saying, 'Notwithstanding your reservations, we will proceed with these matters.' They included in their first list things such as the double orphan benefit. It was a root and branch exercise in moving from a position where they gave no plausible basis whatsoever for their electors to anticipate these measures. (Time expired)",109
390,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"After an extended debate of this sort, it appears that the shadow minister for immigration seems to want to get the last word on every aspect of this debate. I am not going to pick up on all the comments that he has made. I wish to make it clear by reading from the policy document itself. It was abundantly clear from these words: As well, the Coalition will provide a ""safety net"" in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control. The use of the word 'allowance' was very deliberate. The reason for the use of the word 'allowance' was to make it clear that special benefits in their wider operation ought not be seen as an alternative for those who were excluded from being able to get other forms of benefits. It was to be available in the form of a special allowance in those circumstances which arose after a person's arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their control. It was to distinguish this form of payment from a special benefit. That clearly meant that special benefit was meant to be the subject of a preclusion clause in its wider definition. To quote from Meeting our commitments and to substitute the word 'benefit' for 'allowance' when it was clear that the document itself referred to an 'allowance' and not to 'benefit' is to quite clearly dissemble the meaning of the words. It is to try to say something is white when in fact it is black. The meaning was clear. It is beyond doubt. The shadow minister ought to at least pay us the courtesy of using the words that were contained in the document and not substituting some words of his own.",110
391,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) said earlier that we could ask him questions. I would like to ask him a question. If what he is saying is correct now, we should have had cognate legislation in social security, introducing a special allowance for that very purpose-to start at the very same timeotherwise we would not have had any provisions. The laws would have excluded special benefits if this legislation were passed. There would be no special allowance, as we now know it to be, in existence. There would be no estimate in the budget as to what it would cost. Could the minister please explain the absence of such legislation and the absence in the August budget of what that allowance would actually have cost? When are they going to bring it forward, if they are successful in changing the Senate's mind?",111
392,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In the framework in which this legislation was put in place, the form of benefit that was available was outlined in the comments that I made to the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) earlier. For sponsored migrants by individuals, it would apply in situations where the sponsor becomes unemployed and is receiving jobsearch or newstart allowance.",111
393,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Where are they called 'special benefits'?,111
394,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The document itself has retained the name 'special benefits' on these conditions, which is the very point that I was making.",111
395,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Oh! Thank you! Thank you!,111
396,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No. It was. The point that was being made by you and your colleagues was that special benefits in their wider form were not going to be available. I made it clear. I reiterated that the policy document Meeting our commitments made this statement. It states: As well, the Coalition will provide a ""safety net"" in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control. In the end, the special benefit was recast to meet those conditions. That is the factual statement. Mr Allan Morris-What is the estimate of that cost?",111
397,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not have those precise figures, but if the honourable member would like me to try to get them for him at some stage I will. I am sure it will be possible to find out the costs of providing the form of safety net, and we specifically spelt out in the policy document that they would be put in place. The whole point about these measures is that we have conscientiously set out to ensure that the legislation that is brought before the parliament reflects the words of the policy commitments that we made. We conscientiously set out to ensure that that objective is met. In relation to each of these measures, they were examined by cabinet in the context of ensuring that we did maintain the commitments that we had made. It was not a question of walking away from the policy commitments.",111
398,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,What about full access to special benefits? What about full access to family allowance?,112
399,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Clearly, all benefits were going to be constrained and a special allowance for those whose circumstances changed after arrival for reasons beyond their control was to be provided and was provided.",112
400,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I might take advantage of the willingness of the minister to answer questions by asking two very simple questions. In Meeting our commitments it says, 'Full access to family allowance and Medicare will be maintained.' Can you explain why you did not maintain full access to family allowance and denied people health care cards? Secondly, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that it does not apply to family allowance and other benefits, what other benefits was the Prime Minister referring to that have been maintained?",112
401,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The policy document referred to family allowance and Medicare. Access to Medicare is provided. Health care cards are quite different.,112
402,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,You have knocked back family allowance.,112
403,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,No. I dealt with that earlier in the debate today. Mr Allan Morris-When did you launch your document?,112
404,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"During the election campaign. I made it clear earlier in the debate today that the family allowance was reconstituted. When these matters were first developed for the election in 1993 and the costings, which were later reflected in this document, were checked by Finance it was in the context of family payment, which was in two parts. It was in that context that the supplementary benefits have been denied and the family allowance entitlement has been maintained under the legislation that we are dealing with.",112
405,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"This is quite critical. I have not had a chance to discuss this with the shadow minister, but it seems to me that if the minister is saying that the amendment we are proposing, not to extend special benefits for two years, is redundant because they are intending to allow access to special benefits for cases where circumstances have changed then we both agree. That is what he appears to be saying now. Mr Ruddock-No, not at all.",112
406,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,So there are no provisions for special allowance for families at all. Mr Ruddock-The provisions are there as I have stated.,112
407,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am pleased you answered it. I am no clearer as to what the minister was providing to meet his policy statements about the special allowances. Apparently that is a form of semantics rather than access. I had thought he had said that people would access special benefits if they were successful with their amendments. What he is now saying is that they would not be. If a family lost income or could not provide, there is no contingency that would allow access.",112
408,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I have been very critical in the past of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I must say that I applaud the fact that he has allowed this debate to continue because I think there is some scope for debate. In fact, I am one of those people-you might not know this-who think he would make a very good foreign minister, for instance.",112
409,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,He doesn't have the legs.,112
410,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The member for Moore will address his remarks to the amendments before the chair.,112
411,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In his earlier contribution, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who has played his cards a bit too early considering he has spoken twice since, made some comments on the performance of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). I do not always agree with the minister. I have disagreed with him on a number of occasions. In fact, he and I were on opposite sides in the recent election campaign when he came to campaign for my opponent. Nonetheless, I think the last thing you can accuse him of being is inconsistent. I mentioned earlier about what I considered to be the way in which the previous Labor administrations of both Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating brought the immigration and the refugee humanitarian programs into disrepute. The member for Denison made a comment that this particular bill, without the Senate amendments, treats in a discriminatory way certain categories of people who are within Australia's territory. I might remind him of the behaviour of his government when his government moved to retrospectively withdraw the rights of people on Australian territory and in fact treated a particular class of people in a highly discrimiimmigration natory manner. At the time that was a measure taken in response to what was the then crisis the refugee humanitarian program was in as a consequence of what was in fact a process that allowed enormous latitude for litigation on the part of those who had been refused refugee status after arriving illegally in Australia. What I am trying to point out here is that the Howard government enjoys in this particular instance, in my view, the overwhelming support of the community in endeavouring to try to bring the migration and the refugee humanitarian programs back into a state of repute. Those people who have an interest in immigration and refugee humanitarian programs that actually work, that enjoy the support of the Australian community, would support these measures as being reasonable. Mr Allan Morris-It does not apply to them.",112
412,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am dreadfully sorry. Perhaps you ought to read the amendments, particularly amendment No.4. The member for Newcastle, I know, has made a couple of contributions, but that amendment refers specifically to family members of a refugee humanitarian migrant. What the mInister indicated in recent answers in question time as happened under the previous Labor government is that the immigration program was skewed drastically towards the family reunion category or the family preferential category to the extent that it has come into such disrepute that many people throughout the country now consider the immigration program as being unable to support it. That has happened because the previous Labor administration chose to deal with it like a political football. If these measures are going to work, and they are reasonable measures, then what the Senate has done has set back the cause of a reputable immigration and refugee humanitarian program by a long way. Mr Allan Morris-You are talking nonsense.",113
413,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am not talking nonsense. You were part of the Keating and Hawke administrations that completely stuffed up our and refugee humanitarian programs, and you have to accept responsibility.",113
414,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Moore will address the member for Newcastle by his correct title.,113
415,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The member for Newcastle has to accept responsibility. You cannot come in here and pretend nothing has happened. If it had not been for those periods of the Hawke and Keating stewardship of this country, we would probably still have both cases of programs that enjoyed bipartisan support. (Time expired)",113
416,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I really must respond to those comments of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). The difficulty we have is that the member for Moore is suggesting somehow that this is to do with the refugee program. I know that he is not interested in that program, but the fact is that most of these provisions do not apply to refugees at all. There is a point that comes up which I think is of some significance for this government, as it was for the previous government. If we have a person in a refugee camp in Germany or in Croatia who has family in Australia, do we ask them to sponsor that refugee? If we do, do we give that refugee a preference because of that sponsorship? If we do that, that migrant becomes a sponsored migrant in which case the sponsor is liable for their support. In a sense that can distort the family reunion program because a substantial part of the refugee program is absorbed or picked up by the family reunion program. Most people have thought that is a sensible thing to do because, if there is a refugee in a country with family in Australia, they have a much better chance of being successful migrants than a person who has no family whatsoever. What this provision will do is the opposite of what the member suggests. If the family in Australia realises that they are going to be liable for all those downstream costs and not simply income support, they will not sponsor them. The person will probably still be successful but will be unsponsored, so the taxpayers will pay more. That is what is going to happen. This is the nonsense of this whole debate, because the government is pushing an agenda which is not about the real issues. If every refugee came to Australia as a sponsored refugee, the chances of success are enormously high for successful settlement. If they are all unsponsored, the chances are reduced. We all know that. If one looks at the people on the dole from non-English speaking backgrounds and looks at their status on arrival, they will see that substantial numbers of them were refugees. They are the ones with the most difficulty in adjusting. They are the ones who have the most difficulty with the language. They have had the most traumatic backgrounds. If any of you have dealt with the Bosnian refugees, you would understand that. Many of them missed schooling for years and years of their life. They have come from enormously difficult backgrounds. They need a great deal of help. If they have a family here who will sponsor them, this is much more likely to be successful. The fact is that this legislation will discourage families from putting up their hand to sponsor that relative. One of two things will happen. The person will still come unsponsored, which means that they are totally paid for by taxpayers, which will therefore be of greater cost to the country, or alternatively that family will not sponsor them at all. So I believe that the member for Moore is confused with respect to his obsession with the issue he raised earlier regarding Chinese students. Mr Acting Speaker, you will recall that was an issue that tore the country apart. We all cried over that. Those who have been in Beijing since and have spoken to Chinese who were there understand very well the anguish that we all went through. To belittle that issue demeans the member for Moore. It is unfortunate. He did not need to do that. I do not think anybody here claims to be Solomon. I do not know what I would have done if I had been in the then Prime Minister's position. I do not think anybody else here knows either. We are all very wise after the event, but at the time we were all tom apart. I would like to put an example to the minister to illustrate the point that I was trying to make earlier. An Australian lives in England for five years and then brings his wife and three children back to Australia. We have literally tens of thousands of Australians living overseas with spouses and children born overseas, and in many cases the children are not registered as Australian citizens. People are not aware of that. This person has no other family in Australia. His mum and dad have died. He has an accident and can no longer work. Who looks after the wife and children? Who pays for them? What the government would have us do is to legally forbid every single government official from giving them any help at all for those first two years. That is what you are talking about. In removing access to these benefits and any access at all, what you are talking about is an Australian being able to get benefits for himself. So he is okay. He is below the poverty line, but he is okay because he will receive a benefit.",113
417,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,He gets special benefits.,114
418,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, because it is excluded. I clarified this point with the minister. He made it very clear that it is excluded. There is no benefit available. So you have an Australian citizen who is an invalid, fighting a compensation case for the next five years while his wife and kids are starving. That is what you are talking about. Do not dare tell us that this is a mandate or that you have public support. That measure does not have such support. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.",114
419,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos 20, 23 and 34 be disagreed to. These amendments essentially deal with three forms of payment: sickness benefits, newstart and the youth training allowance. In relation to each of these forms of payment, the amendments seek to exempt certain partners of newly arrived residents from the waiting period. With respect to the newstart allowance, using it as an example, the amendment seeks to maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period that currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been in Australia for at least 26 weeks. In opposing this measure, the government is of the view that, in omitting these provisions that have previously provided a special treatment for partners of news tart allowees, the amendment proposed by the government in the bill as introduced was consistent with the approach that the former government had adopted; that is, the person should qualify a social security payment in their own right. The amendment now proposed is contrary to that approach. The amendment should be opposed on the ground that it would require only that a person's partner had been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks, not 104 weeks. This is not justifiable on policy grounds and will result in complexity of administration. The same argument applies to each of the other separate amendments.",115
420,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"These amendments, I suppose, could conveniently be called the 'Harradine amendments' because they flow from Senator Harradine's particular concern which was directed towards these matters. They are distinctly different in character from the matters that we have been addressing previously. Those were matters which, of course, procured the support of the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Independents and the Greens. But these measures, I think, drew a particular comment from Senator Harradine, so I thought I should address them specifically. Senator Harradine pointed out that, where you have already had one of a married couple who has suffered an exclusion period, it seems perverse to require the second person coming into have an exclusion period of the length that is now being prescribed. What might have been acceptable for a six-month waiting period will have a very different character in terms of its impact on a family and their children if it applies to a circumstance where the waiting period is extended to two years. The preclusion is being maintained at six months for the partner. Therefore, if there has already been a period of preclusion from benefits-unemployment benefits, sickness allowance or a youth training allowance-that has been served and expired, the preclusion period for the new person arriving will only be six months. It seems that to allow families to be bereft of that income support net for, effectively, a period of four years or thereabouts, by reason of these particular amendments, is excessive, notwithstanding the comments that the minister makes about wishing to treat individuals in the social security system on their own individual for merits. Nonetheless, the combined impact of this measure seems so draconian that we think it is important that the amendments made by the Senate stand. Question resolved in the affirmative.",115
421,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos 21, 24 and 35 be disagreed to. Essentially, these are the measures that deal with the issue of retrospcctivity. We are in a situation with this legislation where the particular measures that we are dealing with were the subject of a very clear statement by the government when it was in opposition, which spelt out, if I remember correctly, in Meeting our commitments-I suppose I should go through that document again-that there would be a specific commencing date. The last sentence states: ... this policy will apply to prospective migrants only. It will not be applied retrospectively or to migrants who arrive in Australia before I April 1996. The way in which this legislation has been drafted is, in the government's view, not retrospective. We note that the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee concurred with this view. The majority report noted: ... that the committee notes the concerns about retrospective provisions in the bill and evidence that these may result in hardship for some newly arrived residents. In the committee's view these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign, and information on proposed changes to the policy have been widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The committee notes that the provisions of the bill relating to the special benefits are prospective, therefore new residents who arrive after I April and before the royal assent to this bill will be eligible for special benefits under the current arrangements. In the committee's view, these provisions provide an appropriate transition and will allay concerns about this aspect of the bill.",115
422,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Whilst it is late in the night, I suppose that one can only express the utmost cynicism at a statement that what the government is proposing is not retrospective. The word 'retrospective' means intended to apply to things which have occurred previous to something coming into effect. As the bill was passed by the Senate last week, yet purported to extend many of the penal measures to people who had been in Australia and commenced their residence under the law as it then existed, which had very different provisions, and who would have finished any preclusion period which they might have otherwise had to serve-the six-month period-the government's position on this now is simply ludicrous. It may have made some plausible sense when persons were expected to serve a preclusion period of six months if the bill had been brought in and dealt with so that those people would have had that period extended to 24 months. But the absurdity of the proposition that somehow people who have served a preclusion period under existing law now are entitled to a range of measures which are available to the general community as a whole and then later at some stage go back on a preclusion period is simply absurd. The minister knows it to be absurd. To persist with these particular amendments is simply a device to achieve a double dissolution trigger. It is simply a device for a political motive. There is no rational, plausible or social benefit reason for any of these measures. Indeed, the implausibility of the minister's position is illustrated by the point I made earlier in debate when we were discussing the consented amendments. I made the point that it was in fact the government's delay in bringing forth this legislation with any degree of urgency whatsoever in the Senate that meant that the bill could not be dealt with before retrospectivity had to apply under whatever test you sought to imagine. The minister's argument here is so implausible, so silly, so incapable of any rational basis that one can only really say that the only plausible reason is that they do not want to make any changes that reflect common sense in this measure in order that they can maintain a double dissolution trigger. There is going to be a cost to the community if the government is setting up this as a political stunt in order to hang a sword of Damocles over the Senate with the prospect of a double dissolution. That means that, instead of getting the bits that they could get now and bring into effect the waiting period for unemployment benefits extended from six months to two years, and all the other elements that we agree with, they are going to wait now for at least three months, and probably longer depending on the parliamentary timetable, forgoing those benefits. The cost of that forgoiJlg to the Australian community is going to be in the order of $12.5 million to $25 million, depending on whether you believe the co stings of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman). If it is a three-month period, and the period of delay in the parliamentary process is longer, then the cost to the community goes up. Because the government are being stubborn and not accepting the overwhelming savings that have been conceded by the Senate and playing politics on this, the taxpayers of Australia are going to pay $12.5 million to $25 million. I have to say that that is inconsistent, because what they said in their Meeting our commitments was that the waiting period that was applied by Labor applied to most welfare benefits. What we said covered, in their language, most welfare benefits. You have what you promised. You have it delivered. You have the bulk of your savings. And now I suspect what you are going to do is play a little bit of a political stunt at the cost of the Australian taxpayers. Let us realise who is going to be paying it. The cost of setting up this stunt is in the order of $12.5 milIion to $25 million forgone on your own costings because you will not bring into effect your legislation, because you choose not to accept those elements which we have allowed through. (Extension of time granted) I will not take my full five minutes. I will just complete what I was saying. It is important to realise that the mechanisms that are being played with here, in the constitutional sense, require the government, in order to set up a double dissolution trigger-and I understand that it is the intention of this government to use the bilI to be a first double dissolution trigger-not to pass this bill. So what the government will deliberately do, strategicalIy, is not take the bird in the hand. They will not take the savings that have been offered up. The savings that the Senate has agreed to provide the overwhelming bulk of the savings that the government sought. The importance is that these measures will not be brought in because this governmentjust as it delayed in bringing the measures before the Senate in the first place and therefore wasted the $129 million savings forgone because of the government's own $129 million worth of delay-is now going to add to that cost to Australian taxpayers an extra $12.5 million to $25 million, depending on whether you believe the co stings of the Treasurer or those vastly inflated costings of Senator Newman. The real estimate is at least $12.5 million. They are going to waste that money to set up this political stunt. It is very important to know, when we hear this bleating about the interest of taxpayers, that we have a government that is actually quite prepared to waste money when it suits its political convenience. Question resolved in the affirmative.",116
423,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I conclude by moving: That amendments 10 to 15 be disagreed to. These amendments are consequential and I do not propose to speak to them.,117
424,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I have the good grace to concur with the minister. Question resolved in the affirll!ative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Ruddock) agreed to: That Mr Hockey, Mr Brough and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments 10 to 18, 20 to 28, and 31 to 36 of the Senate.",117
425,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 10 to 18, 20 to 28, and 31 to 36 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate amendments (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) and (15) These amendments are consequential upon other amendments proposed by the Senate to ensure that no newly arrived resident's waiting periods will be introduced for carer pension, widow allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, child disability allowance, double orphan pension, mobility allowance, seniors health card and family payment above the minimum rate. Subject to accepting the recommendations made by both the majority and minority reports of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in its consideration of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 that newly arrived resident's waiting periods should not apply for child disability allowance or double orphan pension, the House of Representatives remains of the view that newly arrived resident's waiting periods should be imposed for the other payments. Accordingly, the House of Representatives opposes the consequential amendments proposed by amendments (10), (II), (12), (13), (14) and (15). Senate amendments (16), (17), (18), (22), (25), (27), (28), (31), (32), (33) and (36) The House of Representatives considers that these amendments-to not introduce newly arrived resident's waiting periods for carer pension, widow allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, parenting allowance, mobility allowance, seniors health card, more than the minimum rate of family payment and health care cards-should not proceed as they would counteract the electoral mandate given to the Government at the 1996 election to introduce its election commitment relating to imposing a two year newly arrived resident's waiting period on most welfare benefits. The House of Representatives notes that access of newly arrived migrants to Australian social security payments compares favourably with other western nations. With respect to carer pension, it is noted that the Government had intended moving amendments in the Senate to take account of recommendation 3 of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that special needs relatives be exempt from the carer pension newly arrived resident's waiting period, as well as exempting refugees, former refugees or a family member of the refugee or former refugee from that waiting period. The House of Representatives is of the view that those amendments should have prevailed. The amendment proposed by the Senate in relation to widow allowance (Senate amendment (17» would result in a disparity in access between widow allowance and news tart allowance despite the eligibility criteria for widow allowance having always essentially been aligned with those applying for newstart allowance. Previously, widow allowance has been subject to a 26 week residence requirement, akin to the 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period for newstart allowance. The House of Representatives considers that the introduction of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for disability wage supplement addresses concerns that in deciding to come to Australia, migrants should be aware of the need to provide adequately for themselves after they arrive in Australia so as not to make undue calls on the Australian taxpayer. The House of Representatives notes, however, that there has been a recognition, as reflected in the legislation, that circumstances sometimes change after a person arrives in Australia and that as a result, the newly arrived resident's waiting period will not apply to a person who first suffered a continuing inability to work in Australia because of an impairment or who becomes permanently blind while in Australia. Therefore, the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment relating to disability wage (26), supplement (Senate amendment (18» is warranted. The House of Representatives believes that any failure to introduce a newly arrived resident's waiting period for special benefit will operate to effectively undermine the newly arrived resident's waiting periods that operate for other income support payments, such as newstart allowance. The Senate amendments relating to special benefit would allow many unemployed people to avoid the two year waiting period provisions, and therefore the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment relating to special benefit is warranted. Although the Government had proposed that a newly arrived resident's waiting period should apply for special benefit, the House of Representatives notes that the Government had and continues to recognise the importance of ensuring that there is an adequate safety net to take care of those persons who suffer substantial changes in their circumstances beyond their control. To that end, the Bill as i'ntroduced and passed by the House of Representatives had provided that such persons would be exempt from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period. Further, it is understood that the Government had indicated to the Senate that it proposed moving a number of concessionary amendments to the special benefit provisions to take on board those recommendations made by the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that impacted on special benefit. With respect to partner allowance, the vast majority of those receiving partner allowance are spouses of recipients of newstart allowance. Prior to July 1995 the unemployed person would have received the partnered rate of unemployment payment and been excluded from this combined payment for 26 weeks. The House of Representatives understands that the amendments proposed by the Government in the Bill as introduced with respect to partner allowance are a further step in a process instigated by the former Government of ensuring that persons qualify for social security payments in their own right. The House of Representatives endorses this position and so opposes Senate amendment (26). The House of Representatives disagrees with Senate amendment (28) relating to parenting allowance. Parenting allowance is an income support payment and as such, has always been aligned with other income support payments such as newstart allowance. It was introduced in July 1995 by the previous Government to make available a payment to those looking after children, to compensate for the abolition of the partnered rate of social security benefits. It is noted that for that reason, newly arrived resident waiting provisions mirroring those applicable to newstart alIowance were inserted into the Social Security Act 1991 when parenting allowance was introduced by the former Government in July 1995. The House of Representatives does not agree that there is a need for Senate amendments (32) or (36) on the basis that the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for the seniors health card or health care cards would cause undue hardship. Persons subject to a newly arrived resident's waiting period would stilI have immediate access to Medicare. These concession cards provide access to Commonwealth and Staterrerritory concessions which newly arrived migrants should not expect to receive immediately upon entry to Australia. Senate amendments (20), (23) and (34) The House of Representatives agrees with the position that had previously been adopted by the former Government that people should qualify for social security payments in their own right and notes that the former Government had introduced a number of initiatives to give effect to that Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not agree with amendments (20), (23) and (34) that would seek for newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance, respectively, to maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period that currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks. In any event, the House of Representatives considers that it would be inappropriate, in the light the newly arrived resident's waiting period being extended to 104 weeks, to continue to require only that a newly arrived migrant's partner who has been an Australian resident for 26 weeks before the - ewly arrived migrant could claim an exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period. Such a disparity would not be justifiable on policy grounds, in view of the individual entitlement to social security payments and will result in complexity in administration. Senate amendments (21), (24) and (35) The House of Representatives notes that these amendments would result in a 104 week newly arrived resident's waiting period for newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance only applying to persons who either enter Australia or are granted a permanent visa after Royal Assent has been given to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. The 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period would apply to those persons who had entered Australia and been granted a permanent visa before that day. The House of Representatives further notes that the amendments are being proposed in response to suggestions that the legislation is retrospective. The House of Representatives does not agree that the legislation is retrospective. The House of Representatives accepts that there was wide coverage in Australia of the Government's policy announcement relating to newly arrived resident's waiting periods, both during the 1996 election campaign and about the date from which it was proposed that the extended waiting period should apply, that is, 1 April 1996. Further, the House of Representatives understands that information foreshadowing the Government's new policy was provided to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by the Department of Social Security. This was distributed to overseas posts on 19 March 1996 to provide to all visa applicants and to successful visa applicants when a visa is issued; to migration applicants who had already received a visa but had not arrived in policy. Australia on 21 March 1996; and on 27 March 1996 to all assurers of support of applicants who had not yet arrived in Australia. Since 1 April 1996, this information has been provided to all onshore migration applicants and any nominators or assurers. The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee did not consider that the legislation was retrospective. The majority report noted: ""The Committee notes concerns about the retrospective provisions in the Bill and evidence that of these may result in hardship for some newly arrived residents. In the Committee's view these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign and information on proposed changes to the policy have been widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Committee notes that the provisions in the Bill relating to special benefits are prospective. Therefore new residents who arrive after I April 1996 and before the Royal Assent of the Bill will be eligible for special benefits under current arrangements. In the Committee's view, these provisions provide an appropriate transition and will allay concerns about this aspect of the Bill."". The House of Representatives also notes that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made no adverse finding on any retrospective aspect of the provisions relating to newly arrived resident's waiting periods. Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the committee's reasons be adopted. ' Wednesday, 4 December 1996",117
426,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I simply commend the committee for its capacity to work under pressure. The remarkably little time between the time this motion was introduced and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) moving the composition of the committee demonstrates to me a capacity for efficiency and diligence that we ought to commend to other members of this parliament. I could suggest that it is possible that the minister had already drafted these reasons and has not had a substantial consultation with members of the committee, but it would be churlish of me to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Financial Assistance to Employer and Other Organisations (Question No. 306) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Did the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approve or make available grants or other forms of financial assistance in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 and (c) 1995-96 to (i) employer organisations or (ii) individual companies; if so, in each case, (A) what was the name and address of the recipient, (B) what sum was involved, (C) what was the purpose of the grant or payment, (D) under what program was it made, (E) who approved the payment, (F) what acquittal requirements applied to the grant or payment and (G) is acquittal outstanding. (2) Has the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approved or made available, or will it make available, grants or other forms of financial assistance in 1996-97 to (a) employer organisations or (b) individual companies; if so, in each case, (i) what is the name and address of the recipient or prospective recipient, (ii) what sum is involved, (iii) what is the purpose of the grant or payment, (iv) under what program is it being made, (v) who approved it and (vi) what acquittal requirements apply. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided a list of grants. Because of its bulk, a copy of the list has been provided separately to the honourable member. [The list is too lengthy to be published in Hansard. A copy is available at the House of Representatives Table Office.] SkillShare Programs (Question No. 421) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, NA Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June 1996: What level of Commonwealth funding was allocated for (a) Bonnyrigg, (b) Cabramatta, (c) Mission Employment-Wetherill Park, (d) Canley Vale, (e) Effect Employment-Fairfield and (f) Mission Employment-Fairfield SkillS hare in 199596. Will the SkillS hare programs referred to in part (1) be subject to a 30 per cent reduction in Commonwealth funding; if so, what will be the reduction in the funding for each program in the period between I July and 30 September 1996 based on the funding level referred to in part (1). Dr Kemp-The Minister has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question: The following funding was provided to the above mentioned organisations through the SkillShare Program in 1995/96: (a) Bonnyrigg: $488,744 (b) Cabramatta: $488,560 (c) Mission Employment-Wetherill Park: $333,000 (d) Canley Vale: $347,810 (e) Effect Employment-Fairfield: $713,286 (f) Mission Employment-Fairfield: $448,000 All of the six SkillS hare sponsors were offered contract extensions from I July to 30 September 1996. The funding allocation for the 3 month extension was based on 1/6'h of the total funding made available under their 1995/96 contract which equates to a 33% reduction in funding. Additional funding was, however, made available to all SkillS hare sponsors under the Jobsearch Assistance Activities in proportion to their SkillShare contract extension funding. This effectively brought the overall reduction in funding to around 20% of 1995/96 levels. The reductions in SkillShare funding for the period between 1 July and 30 September 1996 were: (a) Bonnyrigg: $24,079 (b) Cabramatta: $24,063 (c) Mission Employment-Wetherill Park: $16,000 (d) Canley Vale: $17,285 (e) Effect Employment-Fairfield: $35,091 (t) Mission Employment-Fairfield: $22,333 Commonwealth Criminal Law Review Committee: Advice (Question No. 643) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: Has the Government accepted the advice of the Commonwealth Criminal Law Review Committee that legislation be enacted on the lines of the UK Genocide Act 1989 to implement fully Australia's obligations under the Genocide Convention (Paris, 9 December 1948). Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide does not require the creation of a specific offence of genocide provided other laws of the State party adequately give effect to the provisions of the Convention. While the Government is advised that the common law and criminal codes of the States and Territories provide adequate punishment for some acts prohibited by the Convention, the Government is currently considering this issue to determine whether further legislation is necessary. Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 746) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any Ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited.",120
427,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aborigi·· nal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: No. Treaties: Withdrawal Provisions (Question No. 769) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: (I) Further to the answer to question No 2285 (Hansard, 22 August 1995, page 121) concerning procedures for withdrawing from treaties which contain no provision for withdrawal, what procedures exist for withdrawing from treaties which contain no specific withdrawal provision and it is not established that (a) the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal or (b) a right of denunciation may be implied by the nature of the treaty. (2) Is it a fact that where a treaty may not include a specific withdrawal provision or it is not established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal or where a right of denunciation may not be implied by the nature of the treaty it is not possible to withdraw from the treaty without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The first question relates to withdrawal of consent to be bound by the terms of a treaty at international law. In respect of treaties between parties to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 ('Vienna Convention') that are entered into after the Vienna Convention's entry into force (27 January 1980), that Convention sets out the international legal regime governing those treaties. Australia is a party to the Vienna Convention and would observe its terms. The Vienna Convention sets out the body of rules regulating denunciation of treaties falling within this category. In accordance with those rules, treaties containing no provision for denunciation could be denounced either with the consent of the parties (Article 54) or pursuant to the terms of Article 56, the terms of which the honourable member has reproduced in his first question. The Vienna Convention also sets out certain circumstances in which a party may withdraw from or denounce a treaty outside of the terms of Articles 54 and 56. These are addressed in response to the second question. In addition, there is some debate in the textbooks as to whether Article 56 of the Vienna Convention reflects the position at customary international law. The terms of the Vienna Convention are in many respects largely declaratory of customary international law. In relation to those treaties that are not governed by the provisions of the Vienna Convention the body of customary international law relating to treaties would govern such issues as denunciation. (2) The majority of treaties contain provision for denunciation and could be denounced according to those terms. Of those treaties which do not contain such a provision, a large number would fall within the terms of Article 56, which are rather broad. The types of treaties that are usually given as examples of treaties not subject to unilateral denunciation are peace treaties, treaties establishing boundaries, and important law-making treaties. In practice, there would be very few treaties that could not be denounced. There are detailed provisions in the Vienna Convention that set out other circumstances where under international law it would be possible to withdraw from or denounce a treaty without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. Articles 60-64 of the Vienna Convention set out these rights in some detail, and Section 4 of the Vienna Convention sets out the procedures that would be followed by a party invoking those rights. These provisions address such issues as denunciation because of a material breach of the treaty by the other (or another) party, supervening impossibility of performance, fundamental change of circumstances, severance of diplomatic or consular relations, or the emergence of a new peremptory norm of general international law. There are also issues that may arise under customary international law, such as desuetude and obsolescence, that could be relevant to withdrawal from a treaty. There is a large body of international legal jurisprudence regarding withdrawal from treaties that may be referred to in this regard, should the honourable member require further elucidation.

429,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that the Western Australian Education Department is establishing a crosssectoral schools drug education task force to support school drug education across all schools in Western Australia. This will be a three year project starting in 1997. (2) Drug education does play an important role in reducing drug related harm among young people. Social marketing campaigns integrating marketing and educational strategies have been effective in producing changes in youth attitudes toward alcohol and amphetamine use, and decreasing adolescent's use of alcohol. For example, the ""How will you feel tomorrow?"" adolescent alcohol campaign activity over the period 1988 to 1995 resulted in increased awareness of the adverse effects of excessive alcohol consumption, attitudinal change in line with campaign objectives and a decreasing trend in prevalence of teenage alcohol consumption and binge drinking. The ""Speed Catches Up With You"" anti-amphetamine campaign was very effective in reaching the target group of 15 to 25 year olds and produced increases in negative attitudes toward amphetamine use and increased knowledge of negative effects of amphetamine use. (3) A nationwide program is already in place and the National Initiatives in Drug Education (NIDE) project has been one major initiative designed to improve the quality of drug education provided in the States and Territories. NIDE has been developed in partnership with State and Territory health departments, police and education authorities and the catholic and independent school sectors. Initially focussing on drug education competencies within schools, NIDE is also planning to focus on competencies at the community level addressing the needs of young people not in school.

Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. Current support arrangements for under 18 year olds reflect that primary responsibility for the support of young people rests with their parents. The Government provides tax free income and assets tested assistance to families caring for dependent children in the form of family payment. This will be supplemented by the new Family Tax Initiative from January 1997. Income support is available for young people who are unemployed and seeking work or full-time students, whether they are living with parents or not. Payments are subject to parental means testing, unless the young person is considered to be independent. Young people living independently are paid more than young people living at home in recognition that their income support needs are greater than those who have parental support. This higher rate of income support is available to children who can not live at home due to exceptional circumstances, for example, extreme family breakdown or sexual or physical abuse, and whose parents are not providing support. The higher rate is also available to young people who have no parents to support them, are a member of a couple, have a dependent child or have established their independence through a substantial history of employment and are not living with or being supported by their parents. Soft Air Firearms (Question No. 827) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (I) Is it a fact that the recent Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations Amendments prohibits the importation of soft air firearms. (2) Are soft air firearms weapons that fire a plastic pellet, using air pressure to propel the projectile. (3) Did this legislation prohibit import of firearms which fire plastic pellets using a spring; if not, why not. (4) Do firearms which fire plastic pellets using a spring look the same as soft air firearms and fire projectiles at the same velocity; if so, when will their importation be prohibited.  senator's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Soft air firearms fall within item 12 of Part 2 of Schedule 6 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Firearms falling within this item may only be imported if the importation complies with the official purposes test or the specified purposes test. (2) I am advised by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board and the Australian Federal Police that soft air firearms are weapons that fire a plastic pellet, using air pressure to propel the projectile and, as such fall within the definition of firearm contained in Regulation 4F of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. (3-4) I am also advised by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board and the Australian Federal Police that firearms which discharge plastic pellets using a spring generally resemble in appearance those that use air and therefore also fall within the definition of firearm and item 12 and may only be imported if the importation complies with the official purposes test or the specified purposes test. Private Child-care Centres (Question No. 829) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (1) How many private child day care centres are there in the electoral division of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. (2) What is the name and address of these centres. (3) How many children are enrolled in these centres. (4) What charges are applied by each centre. (5) What sums under each category of funding has been provided to (a) the parents and children at each centre and (b) each centre for each year the centre has been open.

Maryborough Public Housing Assistance (Question No. 845) Mr Filing asked the minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) Is it a fact that the Government is reducing funding for housing assistance; if so, on what basis does the Minister expect benefits from cuts in capital funding and increased reliance on cash payments for housing assistance. (2) What research has been undertaken in determining the level of cuts in capital funding and the capacity of the States and the private sector to displace traditional public housing assistance. (3) What market research was done to determine the type and level of service that will be provided through State public housing and private sources. (4) What increases in costs will be passed on to consumers in the various categories of public housing assistance. (5) What indirect financial costs to the States or Commonwealth, and social costs to the community, including increased rental in privately sourced Operational Childcare Total Subsidy Assistance $'000 $'000 $'000 48.4 229.6 278.0 44.8 182.0 226.8 36.1 156.5 192.6 Operational Childcare Total Subsidy Assistance $'000 $'000 $'000 45.7 219.6 265.3 68.3 235.5 303.8 52.3 207.8 260.1 56.1 214.0 270.1 41.5 167.3 208.8 Operational Childcare Total Subsidy Assistance $'000 $'000 $'000 41.5 139.3 180.8 39.9 187.1 227.0 accommodation and the inability of disadvantaged groups to access affordable housing, have been identified and accounted for to balance funding cuts. (6) What community consultation has there been with those closely involved in the delivery of public housing assistance services to (a) develop the Government's new direction, (b) identify potential flaws in the Government's approach or (c) ensure that implementation of this policy will not fail community needs. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Government is not reducing funding for housing assistance. (2) and (3) The major research and analysis effort behind the current direction of housing reform was the 1993 report of the Industry Commission, entitled Public Housing. The Industry Commission's report called for a major reform of housing assistance, including clarification of Commonwealth and State responsibilities; improvements to rental subsidy arrangements to improve equity and client choice of housing; and greater accountability and effectiveness of public housing. The Industry Commission recommended a move away from capital funding of public housing to recurrent funding arrangements. The type and level of service that will be provided through State public housing and private sources will depend on the outcome of current negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States on future housing roles and responsibilities, including rental subsidy delivery. There is potential for the public housing system to play a greater role in assisting people with special housing needs that can be difficult to meet in private rental. Currently, people on low incomes receive housing assistance through two separate programs. The Commonwealth and State govemments provide funds for the provision of public housing, and the Commonwealth provides separate Rent Assistance payments for private renters. Under the proposed reforms, the Commonwealth would provide rental subsidies for both private and public tenants. The States would continue to manage and deliver public housing, along with their related responsibilities for welfare, disability and health services. Depending on the outcome of subsidy reform negotiations with the States, a more equitable rental subsidy system could make private housing more affordable, and so ease the pressure on public waiting lists. This would help people who may need prompt access to public housing, including people with medical conditions and disabilities and those facing discrimination or homeless ness, who may have difficulty meeting their housing needs in the private rental market. Subsidy reform could also better enable people without special housing needs to find suitable housing in the private rental market. (4) The Commonwealth is working with State and Territory governments to develop options for housing reform, including rental subsidy design. In these negotiations the Commonwealth will support the following principles relating to costs for consumers: existing public tenants are protected and not financially disadvantaged; and new public housing tenants do not pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent. (5) The Government is not reducing funding for housing assistance. The potential financial costs to the Commonwealth and the States under the reforms will depend on the final allocation of housing roles and responsibilities. If the Commonwealth were to become responsible for housing affordability in public and private rental for people on low incomes, for example, this shift in responsibility would need to be accompanied by a commensurate adjustment in Commonwealth-State financial resources. There are compelling reasons to believe that social costs would be reduced by housing reform. Greater equity in rental subsidy delivery could improve housing affordability for many people on low incomes and assist the achievement of greater independence. Improved affordability would deliver the financial and social benefits of better enabling people to choose housing which suits their employment or education goals, or their need to be close to family or other support networks or services. The potential to provide better access to public housing for people with special housing needs (explained in (3) above) would similarly reduce social costs which may arise if special needs were otherwise met at a lesser level in the private rental market. (6) There has been much consultation throughout the development of housing reform, including consultation associated with the report of the Industry Commission; subsequent consultation with housing providers and their representatives; consultation with tenants' associations and continuing dialogue with National Shelter and ACOSS. No decisions have been made on the final model of housing reform, and the Commonwealth has proposed to State and Territory Governments that there be wide consultations on this matter. The Commonwealth will continue to consult key community representatives as housing reform proceeds. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Question No. 863) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 October 1996: (I) Is the Government considering changing the basis of Australia's diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav RepUblic of Macedonia to resident accreditation; if so, is there a timetable for implementation of the change. (2) Will he, or his department, meet the representative of the Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to discuss the establishment of an embassy of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Australia. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the time Australia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia established nonresident diplomatic relations in October 1995, it was agreed that the question of resident representation would be kept under review. At the direct request of the Government in Skopje, Australia is now re-examining this issue, but no final decision has been taken. (2) The Australian Ambassador to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, resident in Belgrade, visits Skopje on a regular basis to discuss bilateral issues, which have included the establishment of an embassy of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Australia. I recently had talks with a senior FYROM Foreign Ministry official in Canberra in which the embassy issue was discussed. It is a matter of some importance to the Government in Skopje and to the Macedonian community in Australia. 'A New Era in Customer Service' (Question No. 864) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 28 October 1996: (I) What was the cost to the Minister's Department of the design and printing of the pamphlet entitled ""A new era in customer service"" detailing the operations of the proposed service delivery agency. (2) To whom were the pamphlets distributed and by what means and at what cost was the distribution carried out. (3) How many pamphlets were printed. (4) What is the purpose of the pamphlet and to whom is it targeted. (5) Was any contribution to the cost of the pamphlet made by other Departments. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In order to advise the public of the proposed service delivery agency the Department produced two products, a pamphlet (PR545) and a leaflet (PR546) both entitled ""A new era in customer service"". (I) The cost to the Department for the design and printing of these two products was $29,296. (2) A copy of the pamphlet and leaflet were distributed, via mail, with the Department's Budget Kit, to all relevant community organisations listed on the Department's national mailing list. The cost of distribution of the products was therefore absorbed into the Budget Kit distribution costs. Further copies of both products are available through Regional Offices. (3) 90,000 of both products were printed. (4) The pamphlet (PR545) targeted community organisations and advised them of the creation and purpose of the new agency giving more detail than the PR546 which targeted departmental customers. This product also aimed to reassure customers that there would be no interruptions to current payments with the transfer to the new agency. (5) No. Australian Customs Service Officers: Relocation (Question No. 869) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 29 October 1996: WiIl officers of the Australian Customs Service be re-Iocated from the Charles Ulm Building at Pamphlet Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: if so, (a) to where will they be relocated, (b) when and (c) what will be the cost of the new accommodation arrangements.  member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation has advised the Australian Customs Service that the accommodation within the Charles Ulm Building will be available until at least 2003. Customs is currently examining the viability of upgrading the fitout standard within the Charles Ulm Building and has no expectation, at this stage, of vacating the building before 2003. War Veterans: Additional Earnings (Question No. 882) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: Will the Government increase the sum that war veterans may earn without impacting upon their pensions; if not, what means are available to veterans to assist themselves financially.",124
431,Mr SCOTT,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The maximum amount of income a single service pensioner or service pensioner couple can earn before their pensions are reduced, known as the 'income free area', is increased each 1uly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the income free area was increased in luly 1996 from $94 to $98 per fortnight for a single pensioner, and from $164 to $172 per fortnight combined for members of a pensioner couple. This means that, at the present time, a single service pensioner can earn up to $98 per fortnight and can also receive a pension of $346.40 per fortnight, making a total of $444.40 per fortnight. Similarly, a service pensioner couple can earn up to $172 (combined) per fortnight and can also receive their combined pension of $577.80 per fortnight, making a total of $749.80. The above income free areas are the same which apply to pensions paid by the Department of Social Security. Vietnam: Human Rights (Question No. 896) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: Will he intercede with the Government of Vietnam to seek (a) the release of (i) its citizens who have been detained without trial and (ii) imprisoned for peaceful opposition to the government and (b) its compliance with human rights. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Australia remains concerned about the imprisonment of individuals for the non-violent expression of political or other views at variance with those of the Vietnamese Government and will continue to press the Vietnamese authorities for the release of all those imprisoned for the peaceful expression of political opposition. During my visit to Vietnam in July I sought information on a number of cases raised by the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation during their visit to Vietnam in April 1995 and by the Embassy since. The Australian Government, including through its Embassy in Hanoi will continue to make representations on behalf of citizens detained for the non-violent expression of their political beliefs. I also urged Vietnam to adhere to international human rights norms, particularly freedom of speech, religion and the right to express dissenting political views. (b) Australia established the foundations for a dialogue on human rights with the successful visit to Vietnam in 1995 of the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation of which I was Deputy Leader. As both Australia and Vietnam are parties to major human rights instruments, there is a solid basis for dialogue on human rights issues. We continue to maintain a constructive dialogue with Vietnam on human rights and register our concerns with the Vietnamese Government about specific human rights cases. Australian Hearing Services: Age Limits (Question No. 901) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 4 November 1996: (I) Has the age at which deaf persons cease being eligible to access support from Australian Hearing Services (AHS) been reduced from 21 years to 18 years. (2) Is it a fact that deaf persons (a) have unrealistic expectations placed upon them by education institutions, (b) bear additional costs by having to be supported by note takers in those institutions, (c) lack adequate access to scholarships and (d) are discriminated against by employers. (3) Did his Parliamentary Secretary issue a media release on 28 May 1996 stating that special arrangements should be made to cater for special needs groups. (4) Will he restore the age limit for access to AHS support to 21 years.",132
432,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) It was announced in the Budget that the eligibility age will be reduced with effect from March 1997. (2) I am informed by Senator Vanstone that: (a) and (b) Higher education students who may have a hearing impairment are not direct clients of her Department. Therefore the answers to (a) and (b) are not known to Departmental officers. (c) As members of an equity target group, students with a disability, including those with a hearing impairment, are eligible for the new HECSexemption merit-based equity scholarships which were announced as part of the 1996-97 Federal Budget. (d) No information is available on the level of discrimination against the hearing impaired by employers. Such discrimination would be contrary to the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act and any person suffering such discrimination would be able to seek redress through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. (3) In his press release of 28 May the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he would consider the recommendation of the Centre for International Economics in its report ""Review of the Delivery of the Hearing Services Program"" that special provision be made for special needs groups. Under reforms announced in the Budget, rural and remote clients (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients), children and profoundly Reductions deaf/complex clients will continue to receive services from the Australian Hearing Service as a Community Service Obligation.
