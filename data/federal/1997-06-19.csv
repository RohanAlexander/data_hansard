1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 December 1996, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Albanese-I move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Grayndler moving forthwith that private members' business order of the day No.1, Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, be brought on for immediate debate. That suspension will be seconded by the honourable member for Watson.",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,Order! The order of the day has been called on. This is not relevant to that particular item and therefore you are out of order. It can only be brought on between items of business. Resume your seat.,13
3,Mr MELHAM,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The sad part in relation to the House of Represengovernment tatives debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill is that this government in its incompetence does not know how to set down a legislative program. The House of Representatives is now going to debate the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is due to report on the bill next week to the Senate. So we in the House of Representatives have to debate this bill before we see the recommendations of the Senate committee, before we see how the Senate committee is going to respond to submissions by not only the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but also a number of other organisations. This government has now been in office for some 15 to 16 months. One would have thought that they could have got their act together. So the opposition are left with a situation where our final position on the has not yet been determined because we want to have a look at what the Senate committee report will recommend. In our period in office, we managed to coordinate legislation. If there were Senate inquiries, we managed to delay legislation. In the last parliament there were amendments to the procedures of this chamber whereby committees of this House were given power to inquire into legislation. In the last parliament, I was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. We had arrangements with the other house whereby we did not duplicate inquiries. The Senate committee did certain inquiries and the House of Representatives committee did certain inquiries. So I am a little bit disappointed in the way that this government has introduced this legislation for debate now before we on this side have had an opportunity to see what the Senate committee report does reveal. I would ask the government that, in future, they pay courtesy to members of this House in allowing them to get together all the information and all the reports. Normally I am not a great advocate for the Senate or the Senate committees, but I do acknowledge that their reports in the past have proved valuable. What I do urge is that it is about time this got some of the House of Representatives committees to do inquiries into this legislation. I thought we set a good precedent in the last parliament when the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquired into the child sex tourism bill and the war crimes bill. As chair of that committee I made sure that those committees did not take a partisan view. If anything, I found myself in conflict with the executive of the day. I remember that at the end of the first day's hearing into the child sex tourism bill, our committee copped a press release signed by three ministers of the Crown attacking the committee, thinking that the committee was going to derail the legislation. But, in the end, the government picked up 35V2 of the 38 recommendations that the House of Representatives committee made, and we had an improved bill. We had a bill that was picked bill up by other countries. So that shows that House of Representatives committees can work. I was hoping that that precedent would be picked up by this parliament. This House of Representatives might have a situation where the government has an overwhelming majority, but there are members of parliament on both sides of the House that do have an interest in these affairs, and this House should be given the courtesy of being able to look at these matters. I noticed in the debate yesterday, for instance, that on an item to do with telephone intercepts we did not even have a government speaker. The government was bringing forward into this place legislation that was going to impact. It was going to allow non-judicial officers to issue warrants for telephone intercepts. Yet there was no government speaker other than the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). Here we have some wide reaching proposals that are suggested to the human rights legislation. This is what the Disability Discrimination Law Advocacy Service, which is a specialist community legal centre funded by the federal government, had to say in its submission to the Senate committee: We provide legal advice and assistance to people wanting to lodge a complaint under the Disability Discrimination Act and community education to people affected by the Act. Given the short notice in which to write a submission and our desire to consult with the disability community the Disability Discrimination Law Advocacy Service is only able, at this time, to make a few points and will lodge a much fuller submission as soon as po-sible. Some of our concerns include: Court fees-The fees are prohibitive to the majority of people with disabilities who are in receipt of government benefits or who have high living costs because of their disability. The application of filing and hearing fees in the proposed human rights jurisdiction will create an uneven playing field, with respondents making the most of the opportunity provided to allow a matter to continue to hearing, knowing that complainants will not be able to afford to go to hearing. A blanket exemption for people on a pension or benefit will not be adequate to ensure that people with disabilities can access the Federal Court. There are many people with disabilities who earn an i-come, but who because of their disability, reqUired to spend that income on adjustments. Filing and hearing fees will significantly disadvantage this group. Costs Orders Another disincentive for people to pursue their rights is the possibility of costs being awarded against them. We would urge that costs orders are not awarded in discrimination cases. Rules of Evidence Applying rules of evidence is a major change from the practice of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If the new human rights jurisdiction were to enforce the rules of evidence, then the resulting technical legal arguments would preclude self advocacy by respondents. Formality We would like the Committee to take into consideration the informality that is strived for in Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission hearings compared to the formality that may be imposed at the Federal Court. This, if not changed, will be a further disincentive for many people with a disability. In our experience, complainants in discrimination cases are already disadvantaged. Given the unlikelihood of obtaining legal aid for civil cases, it seems likely that any extra formality and cost associated with fighting discrimination will add a significant burden on the complainant which in many cases will make access to justice unlikely or impossible to achieve. Representative Proceedings-Much of the discrimination suffered by people with a disability is of a systemic nature, affecting large numbers of people. Often it will be necessary and in the public interest to address systemic discrimination in a public hearing. Under the bill, a person who is not affected, but makes a complaint on behalf of others is only able to seek conciliation. This change disadvantages many people with a disability who may be best represented by an organisation. (For instance, people reliant on services provided by the alleged discriminator, fearful of retaliation, people who do not want their disability disclosed because of the stigma attached to it, people with little or no means of communication.) We cannot keep using this House as a rubber stamp. I know that there are newer members on the other side of the House. I have an enormous respect for this House. When I was chair of the committee in the last parliament I believed an important role of committees was to consult with the community, to bring in professionals. I am getting sick and tired of are this House being taken for granted by the executive government and the arrogance of this government when it campaigned on raising the standards of this House. We are now in a position as an opposition where we will not be moving substantive amendments in the House of Representatives; we will be waiting until the matter comes to the Senate so that we can see what the government's response is going to be to the Senate committee report. The repository of all wisdom does not lie in the Senate; it does not just lie in the executive government. There are members of this House that bring with them experience. I know that at times it is pretty hard to the executive around because it is the prisoner of the bureaucracy, but I raise this as an example. There has been a reasonable relationship in this portfolio. I am not directing the criticism at a personal level on this Attorney-General. This Attorney-General is doing the work of three or four ministers with half the staff. It is an absolute disgrace. The secretariats of this parliament have had to combine. That is not professionalism. If there were more ministers like this Attorney General the government would be better placed. But the problem is that their workload does not allow proper scrutiny from him or his department or his officers or members of this parliament. This criticism is not directed at this minister, whom I have a lot of time for. That does not mean to say he is right on every issue. He gets locked into cabinet solidarity and he has to run the party line when he is in cabinet. This government treats the law with contempt. It does not have the Attorney General as part of cabinet. He is in the outer ministry. What sort of symbolism does that send? Why? Because we have a lawless cabinet. This government's first cabinet decision in relation to a special auditor for ATSIC was thrown out by the Federal Court three to nil. We have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) running around in relation to Wik. We were supposed to see the legislation by now. We will not see it till August. And they want the legislation through the parliament by Christmas. I give the government notice now: you have Buckley's chance. We will be scrutinising that particular piece of legislation line by line because we do not trust you. You say one thing and do another. I think the Attorney-General is honourable, so I am prepared to give him trust. But the trouble is that he is a prisoner of this government and it is the government I do not trust. That is why we will scrutinise this legislation when it comes to the parliament. I know that there are members of this government who are in the same predicament that some of us were in in the previous government. They get locked in as well, but that is why committees tum of this House present an opportunity for us to give input from the House of Representatives. That is where you develop relationships. If this legislation is so crash hot and necessary, then let the bureaucrats be subjected to examination by members of the House of Representatives. Let them be tested. If the legislation is so crash hot, then let us not treat this House with contempt and have a debate before we even have a Senate report. If there is a proper ordering of business we may have an arrangement with the other place so that there is not duplication. I am not saying that we have to do a report on every piece of legislation that comes before this House. There is a proper management of affairs. We do not want to do a report and have the Senate do another report. But it is contemptible of this place to be debating this legislation without the benefit of that Senate report. There are other submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. One was from a Dr Imtiaz Omar, who is from the School of Law of the University of New England. In the body of his report he talks about the diminution of the role of HREOC. That is what is happening herethey are gutting HREOC. This government says it does one thing, but look at the detail-look at what they are doing. Recently we had a disgraceful performance by this government and the minders of this government because even before the report on the stolen children was tabled in the Parliament you had the spin doctors and the character assassins working the corridors of the press gallery doing a job on Sir Ron Wilson and on Mick Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner. What utter contempt on the part of the executive and members of the executive for this organisation. We had the leaks coming out before the report was even tabled. With the tabling of the report, community opinion has changed. You have just had the New South Wales Parliament giving an unequivocal apology. You have had Henry Burmester, Chief General Counsel, properly examined in a Senate committee conceding that he gave advice late in the piece on what he was asked-but he was only asked specific questions-and that an unqualified apology can be given to the indigenous people of this nation without rendering us liable. I use that as an example because I remember the history of the attitude of members this government to HREOC and the original Fightback package and the modification. Originally you were going to take HREOC out of the action. Then you backed off. Now it is going to be death by a thousand cuts. You impose budget cuts on them to the order of 25 or 30 per cent, so they will be mouthpieces. You do not replace certain commissioners. You have the Attorney-General saying to the Privacy Commissioner: 'I want you to stay on so that we can look at privacy matters' and going and getting permission from the Prime Minister's office for the extension of his term. Then when he gets to cabinet with a recommendation, you have the mean-spirited people in cabinet rolling him. So the Privacy Commissioner's term is not extended. Why? Because you have a certain cabinet minister who remembers that the Privacy Commissioner worked for a former Labor Attorney-General in Victoria. This is a meanof spirited, vindictive government. We will look at sections of this legislation to make sure that you are not gutting HREOC. What we need, especially with a government with the majority that it has, is a vibrant HREOC as the guardian of the public-because that guarding is not coming from the executive. We have Yes, Minister personified 100 times over. It does not hurt if you have competent ministers, but with competent ministers you gut their resources, you give them a workload that is impossible to manage, and you sideline them. That is not democracy; that is an abuse of democracy by the executive. In the seven and a bit years I have been in this place-and this applies to both sides of the House-it has been debased by the executive. I am not saying that this legislation has been introduced one week and debated the next; it has not. But there has not been a proper coordination or tabling of the program. So I am probably using this debate to vent my spleen in relation to a few other things that have happened under this government. I don't trust this government, not one iota. Frankly, the performances of some ministers leave a lot to be desired. I think there is a repository of wisdom in the back bench: the of member for Kooyong, the member for North Sydney-honourable members of this place, members who can make a contribution. The problem is that we no longer have a Liberal Party. It ain't a small '1' Liberal party; it is a conservative party with a capital 'C'. You have a kitchen cabinet that locks in the cabinet, the outer ministry and the executive, and we get snuffled. Some of these things are important. The attitude of this government is: 'If Labor did it, we are going to change it. If it was done by the Labor government, it must have been bad so we automatically have to change it.' That is what is happening here, and there is a bit of payback. What I say to you is: justify it-justify some of these changes. The tragedy is that I am not standing here in the parliament today on a detailed basis trying to shred this legislation. Why? Because I have not had the benefit of the expert advice by practitioners in the field as to the impact this legislation, as to the restructuring. I am not going to get up here now and argue a case that I am not fully across, because that is not fair to this parliament. So I am left as the spokesman for the Labor Party in this House not being able to argue definitively on the detail of this legislation basically because I do not have the benefit of the Senate report to see what they made of the material that was put in front of them. That is a situation that cannot be allowed to happen again. This is an important piece of legislation. There is no doubt there are aspects of this legislation that deserve cross-party support, but there is no way that this should happen again. This House should not be left in a situation in where we are arguing in a vacuum. We have to take our job seriously. There is cynicism out there in the community in terms of the parliament and in terms of us as parliamentarians. We have a Prime Minister who today on AM justifies his trip overseas because he is allowed to like cricket. We all like cricket, but he sought the office of Prime Minister he hung around for 22 years as a member of parliament to get it. I think there is an onus and a duty on the Prime Minister to be here when parliament is sitting. He can go to the third or fourth test. That is the message that is going out. We have a Prime Minister who will have a five-minute cup of tea with Blair and then see his soul mates Thatcher and Major. Then he will go to the Lords test. What message does that send? What message does this piece of legislation being debated in the House of Representatives send to the community when members of the House of Representatives do not have the benefit of a Senate inquiry into this piece legislation? It shows an arrogance of and contempt for this executive that will come back and bite them. People out there in the community are starting to twig. The comfortable and relaxed nature of government that we were told we would have if we had a change of government is not happening. In many debates when I sat on the other side of the House I did not get up and defend what we were doing in the procedures of this House, because I did not agree with them. I sat in silence because I believe in party solidarity. But I heard the unctuous lectures from the then opposition about improving standards. I have not seen an improvement of standards. I have seen a debasement of standards in this House. I have seen professional officers in this House have further resources taken away from them. I have seen professional officers who have served this House for 20 and 30 years still not knowing their fate as a result of restructuring. That is arrogance and contempt by the executive. I do not blame the parliamentary officers; I blame the executive. It is about time that we, as members of parliament on both sides of the House, strike back. When you get elected to parliament, you think it is a great honour, that it is an opportunity to make a contribution-and it is. But in the end we can have no respect for ourselves if we continue to allow this to happen. That is why I get angry in a lot of these debates. My record speaks for itself. When I was in government, I took on the executive and on these issues time and again in the caucus room and in this parliament. There is not one report that I tabled in this parliament where it can be said I was stood over or ran the government line. We tested the legislation, and we brought in recommendations when we knew the ministers did not like them. I will tell you the test of how successful the committee was in the last parliament. In the end we could not get references from the executive. In the end the references were quietly slipped to a Senate committee. Why? Because we exerted our independence. Who was on that committee? The current Attorney-General; the right of honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair; a former Attorney-General, the then member for Holt, Mr Duffy; the former  Wendy Fatin; and the member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding. It was a committee that laid down the standard that this parliament could have pride in because it did not play party politics. It took its job seriously. It said on important pieces of legislation, 'We want the House of Representatives to have a role in scrutinising legislation. We take committee work seriously and our reports speak for themselves.' They were more of an embarrassment to the government than anyone else. What do we have here? We have a situation where we copped it all from the other side. They have the opportunity and the ball has been fumbled. That is why I am angry. ",13
4,Mr MELHAM,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I would like to be able to get up in this chamber to debate this legislation clause by clause. But I am not the expert in the field. That is why I have to rely on the practitioners in the field. I know the honour mugged by his party. He is one of the outstanding members on the other side of the House, but he has no future under this government because he has independent thought. Do not let them get to you. You are better than that. This is your opportunity. I do not accept automatically explanatory memorandums that are written by members of the bureaucracy. I am not saying they do it deliberately. They have instructions. They are professional public servants who have to provide material in accordance with the instructions and directions they are given. I know at a personal level, because their body language says it all, that they are not necessarily happy with the brief that they as professional public servants have to champion, but that is their job because they are servants of the executive. We as members of parliament have to take our job seriously. I say to the members of the government: you will have an easy passage on this bill in the House of Representatives. We will not move a second reading amendment, and we will not move amendments to the bill in this place. We are going to reserve our position for when this matter comes before the Senate. Unfortunately, what you now lose as a government is an opportunity to examine our amendments in detail before they go to the Senate, because that is the benefit of this House being able to move some of those amendments. At the end of the debate in relation to the Constitutional Convention we tabled a series of amendments in the House of Representatives so they were on the public record, so that the government knew our position, so that there was a proper debate when it got to the Senate. We are not going to have that opportunity. I am not saying we are going to be able to do that in every instance. We do not have the resources. You know that. But you will be judged. The more arrogant, the more contemptuous you are of the processes, the more that message will filter out. You cannot have the alibis anymore that, 'That is what you did; 13 years of Labor government.' I do not stand here and defend everything we did; I do not agree with everything we did, but what we did was not all bad. There were many achievements of the Labor government, and one of them was in this area. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is something we were proud ofprofessional, independent officers representing the vulnerable in the community, properly resourced. In our modern society, with the bureaucracies, it is not the executive that is the protector; it is organisations such as thisthe Auditor-General, the Privacy Commissioner, the Social Justice Commissioner. What do they get from the executive government? They get gutted and whacked around the ears if they speak out, which is what their job is. Let us argue these things on their merits because on most things, on 95 or 98 per cent of things, we can probably agree. How can I convince you without the opportunity to have material? I have gone through the Hansards. In the old days, you used to debate bills clause by clause. I can remember ministers accepting amendments from the opposition at the table during debate. How long has it been since that has happened? What does that tell you? This is a rubber stamp, not a fair dinkum process. (Time expired)",17
5,Mr GEORGIOU,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 represents an important development in the Commonwealth's ongoing commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in Australia. It provides for the establishment of administrative mechanisms which will enable complaints made under Australia's anti-discrimination lawsincluding the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992-to be efficiently determined and for these determinations to be effectively enforced. The bill is, in essence, a response to the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. In that case, the court determined that the provisions within the Racial Discrimination Act, allowing determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be enforced through registration in the Federal Court, represented an exercise of judicial power which could only be exercised by a court and was thus unconstitutional. As the same provisions which were held constitutionally invalid in the Brandy case also exist in the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act, the outcome of Brandy was to render Australia's anti-discrimination laws effectively unenforceable. The former government initiated a twostage response to the Brandy decision, commencing with a temporary restoration of the pre-1992 arrangements, under which the Human Rights and Equal Opportuni ty Commission could inquire into a matter and make a determination. But, if this was not acted upon by the parties themselves, it had to be enforced by a de novo hearing in the Federal Court. The second stage of the response was to refer consideration of a permanent solution to a review committee consisting of representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was already investigating the structure and operation of the commission. The former Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, announced the government's response to this review on 28 January 1996-the day after the calling of the federal election. I should say response to the honourable member that there were quite a number of decisions made after the election was called, but they were never implemented. The coalition's response is outlined in this bill, which provides for complaints made under Australia's anti-discrimination laws and complaints of breaches of human rights under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 to be investigated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. But cases which cannot be resolved through the commission's conciliation process will be finally determined in the Federal Court. This involves an extension of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. In generating this outcome, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill also provides for a number of important access and equity reforms, as the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) pointed out in his second reading speech. The court will be able to adopt informal procedures, as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. The court will be able to make rules of court which delegate any of its powers, apart from the power of granting injunctions to judicial registrars. Where there is hardship, either party will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for assistance for the proceedings. There will be a requirement that the commission assist complainants in completing the necessary forms to commence proceedings in the Federal Court, and the president of the commission will be able to prepare a report for the court on the complaint. These reforms are part of Australia's ongoing and fundamental commitment to human rights: to safeguarding human integrity, freedom and equality, to opposing racism, to providing protection from discrimination, to tolerance and diversity, and to justice and equity for all Australians. Today, these basic tenets on which our human rights legislation rest are given heightened significance by the situation created by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Mr Speaker, I am 49 years old, almost 50. I was born in Greece, but I have been an Australian for longer than the majority of the in Australian population has been alive. I have always been overwhelmingly confident in, and committed to, Australia. Most of my mature life has been spent at the hard end of politics fighting the Labor Party, starting off on Malcolm Fraser's staff in June 1975. My experience has perhaps led me to emphasise political effectiveness, rather than making ringing declarations. Because my commitment to multiculturalism is well known and my opposition to the member for Oxley's stance is manifest, until now I have simply pointed out that many of the things she says are wrong and can damage Australia. But now that the member for Oxley is no longer a lone Independent but has become a leader of a political party, common decency and a concern for Australia and a concern for human rights demand that more be said. I believe it is important that we get the facts about Hansonism right. The first is that a number of people are superficially attracted to some what the member for Oxley says. The second fact is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is right when says of those attracted to her that 'a few, no doubt [are bigoted, narrow-minded and racist. Most, however, are not'. The third fact is that, if any of the member for Oxley's opponents think she is not a real politician but a simple fish and chip shop lady, they are quite simply wrong. The member for Oxley is not just a real politician; indeed, she is a political manipulator and a disseminator of division of the kind we have rarely seen in Australia. Hansonism is two faced. One face tries to entice Australians who are neither racist nor bigoted by presenting the member for Oxley as an ordinary Australian, a woman who has had her share of hard knocks and who is just speaking her mind. The second face of Hansonism is the ugly face-the face that attracts the racists and the bigots. It attracts them because it reflects their prejudices, their resentments and their hatreds. This is the authentic face of Hansonism-the one she tries to constantly hide because it is unacceptable to the ordinary, decent Australians she is trying to enmesh in her movement. This needs to be exposed, not with rhetoric but with the member for Oxley's own words-and her own words do expose her. The member for Oxley has said again and again, 'I am not a racist by any definition of that word. ' Yet in her very own words she has said: My fear is that if we keep on going the way we are going ... the yellow race will rule the world ... Again in her own now notorious words, she said: I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians .. , They have their own culture and religion, form ghettoes and do not assimilate. The member for Oxley has said: I want my critics to listen carefully, I read my lips! I am not saying that I want all Asian immigration to cease. But it is from her very own lips that the following statements were issued: Maybe I do come in like a Sherman tank, how else am I going to say that I want a halt on Asians coming into the country. You tell me. How would you say it? Let us tum to the member for Oxley's attitude towards Aboriginals. The member for Oxley says she is not anti-Aboriginal. She has said: I've never denigrated the Aboriginal person, I'm saying the system is not right. Just listen to her denigrations: What Aboriginals have to learn is you don't go spending your welfare money on grog and you're getting round the place and you can't feed your kids. Just listen to her assertion that she is fighting for 'the white community, the immigrants, Italians, Greeks, whoever-it does not matter-anyone apart from the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders'. Just hear her demand that the reconciliation process should be abolished because of what she says is a historical background of-and I quote her'the massacre of blacks by blacks', 'the virtual genocide of one Aboriginal tribe by another' and 'Aboriginal cannibalism'. The member for Oxley has recently said: I have been accused of saying Aboriginals are not disadvantaged. That is clearly nonsense. Anyone who says that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged is clearly speaking nonsense. But this is the nonsense that the member for Oxley does speak. She said: People are saying they are a disadvantaged race ... what way, I would like someone to tell me are they disadvantaged. I quote her again: I ... challenge anyone to tell me how Aboriginals are disadvantaged when they can obtain three and five per cent housing loans denied to nonAboriginals. I could go on with a litany of such distortions and deceptions, but I will take two more cases. At the launch of her One Nation party, the member for Oxley said-and she was want them to shown on television saying this: Do you want race riots, religious fanaticism, gang and drug wars? Do you want civil war? On 60 minutes, the member for Oxley was asked whether she really thought we were going to have civil war. She replied: No. And I didn't say those words either ... let's clarify that 'civil war'. That was an editor's headline. Finally, let us look at why the member for Oxley detests Australia's multiculturalism. She says: A truly multicultural society can never be strong and united. United States President Bill Clinton pointed out when he was in Australia that the world is littered with the bodies of people killed in failed and tragic attempts at multiculturalism. Nothing could more totally, utterly and transparently misrepresent President Clinton's views. President Clinton did speak of ethnic, racial and religious conflicts, but he concluded by saying-and I quote the president's words because they are important: There is a lot of evidence that we can all do better than that. And when the world comes to Sydney they will see that. So think about that. Think about how every day in every way when you bring in people who are those, like the, who trace their roots to England or Ireland or Scotland, to various Asian countries or South Asia or Latin America or the Middle East, every day you do that when the world is looking at you, you offer a rebuke to all those who would take away the lives and the futures and the fortunes of the children of this world, because they are different from them. And I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community than Sydney, Australia. Mr Hardgrave-Terrific words.",18
6,Mr GEORGIOU,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"They were terrific words and they were delivered much more effectively than I could. The member for Oxley's record raises two questions. The first question is: why is she doing this? The answer is straightforward: she is a manipulative politician who thinks she was elected because of her race appeals and who wants to be re-elected and carry more people like herself into the parliament on her coat-tails by continuing to incite racism while extending her base beyond hardcore bigots. The member for Oxley first gained her political reputation by attacking Aboriginals. She soon moved to attacking Asian Australians. This is the way that racists extend their range of scapegoats. They start off by attacking one vulnerable group, then they attack another and soon other groups become vulnerable. All Australians-not just Aboriginal Australians, not just Asian Australians, not just Australians of non-English speaking descent, but all of us-need to ask: who will be next? Which of us is the member for Oxley talking about when she says: There are so many people who do not think of themselves as being Australians. Of whom does she speak when she asks: Where will they stand in any future crisis? Beside us or behind us or will they themselves be the crisis? Whom will she next accuse of 'seeking to create more than one Australia'? Of whom will she ask: Are you a citizen of Australia or a citizen of the world? The second question is: why does the member for Oxley believe that she can get away with her distortions; her denials of what she has said and of what has been published; and what she has built her notoriety on? I believe that the answer is contained in a statement on the back cover of her book Pauline Hanson: the truth. This is the book on which she owns the copyright, on which she receives the royalties and of which she has said again and again: I've put my name to this book and I have backed this book. This is what her book says: We Australians are easily led. We are in more ways than one a nation of friendly and docile sheep. I do not believe that the member for Oxley is going to succeed in her attempts to deceive and divide Australia. I do not believe that the Australian people are docile sheep. I believe that Australians are a clever, confident people and that we can stand on our feet and think for ourselves. I believe that the vast majority of Australians support the multiculturalism that we have created in this nation, and that we support reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I believe that most Australians are coming to understand that the member for Oxley is inciting racism. I believe that those people who are superficially attractMelham) ed to Hansonism and those who say, 'I don't agree with everything Pauline Hanson saysexcellent but,' do need to reflect on what Hansonism really stands for. Hansonism does not stand for them and it does not stand for Australia. Hansonism is about Aboriginal programs that have not fixed real disadvantage. It is not about the rate of tions. immigration. It is not about foreign investment. It is not about tariffs. It is not jobs. Hansonism stands for racism and bigotelectorate ry, and these descriptions are not politically correct catchphrases. They mean that Hansonism stands for dividing Australia, scapegoating vulnerable groups because of their race and ethnicity, for spreading fear resentment and for sowing mistrust and suspicion amongst Australians about one another. Over the last 50 years, Australia has come a home and a nation for five million immigrants from over 130 countries. Out of the mass migration of the last half century, we Australians have created an admirable, decent and harmonious nation. Together have created a society fundamentally based fairness, on the appreciation of cultural diversity, on tolerance and mutual respect and a commitment to reconciliation. In a world of racial, ethnic and religious conflict and violence, we have shown the way and impressed other nations. But that is less important than the fact that we have got right. Hansonism rejects all this. If we want to be a decent, tolerant and united Australia, Hansonism needs to be rejected. I commend beginning. the bill to the House.",21
7,Mr MELHAM,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"On indulgence, I congratulate the member for Kooyong on his excellent speech. I wish to be associated with everything that he has said and I endorse everything he has said. There should be more of it. I know that that is shared on this side of the House, and on the other side of the House. We all want to associate ourselves with what he has said. It was an excellent speech, and he is to be congratulated on it.",22
8,Ms MACKLIN,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (10.20 a.m.)Along with the member for Banks (Mr and relatively cheap. I would like to congratulate the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) on his contribution to this debate today. His remarks do reflect the very strong feelings of the vast majority of people in this House. It is something that we do need to see a lot not more of-that we all come out and say the sorts of things that he has said. CongratulaIf I could change the orientation of the about debate, I want to use a case in my own to discuss the Human Rights Legislation Amendment bill 1996 and some of the problems that still exist with the Human for Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. As a result of the problems with the legislaand tion that we are discussing today, we still have unfairness and injustice in existing arrangements for people who are taking action through the Human Rights and Equal Opporbetunity Commission. There are necessary changes to be made to the legislation that we are debating. I want to draw attention to a particular constituent. She lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against her employer we with the commission. The commission found on in her favour and awarded her $17,000 in racial and damages and loss of wages. However, although the commISSIOn is empowered under the Sex Discrimination Act to make determinations and declarations, these are currently unenforceable. As a result, my constituent has been unable to obtain the sum it awarded to her and will be unable to do so unless she takes the case to the Federal Court where it will have to be re-heard from the The costs of her appearance before the commission were met by Legal Aid on the understanding that she would repay the costs if the verdict were in her favour. The verdict was in her favour but she has received no money. At the same time, of course, she has by everyone incurred significant costs. This is a highly regrettable situation and has had the opposite effect of that intended by the spirit of the anti-discrimination regime, which is to afford equitable and accessible justice to people subject to discrimination through a process which is speedy, relatively informal One intention of this bill that we are debating today is to address the complex way in which anti-discrimination complaints currently proceed. The bill repeals the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry and determination functions and implements a scheme by which complaints not resolved through conciliation may be continued by way of application in the Federal Court in order to obtain an enforceable determination. The position has not always been so complex. Legislative changes in 1992 allowed the commission to register its decisions with the Federal Court. The changes gave these decisions the authority of an order of the court and prevented the duplication which now exists between the commission and the Federal Court. The duplication has arisen because of the decision of the High Court in the Brandy case. The High Court found that the power in anti-discrimination legislation which allowed determinations of the commission to be enforced through regulations in the Federal Court was unconstitutional, because it breached the separation of powers. The ultimate effect of this decision has been very harmful to some complainants before the commission. My constituent is a case in point. It is for this reason that I support the intention of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. It will assist complainants like my constituent who are required to seek help from the Federal Court in resolving antidiscrimination matters which the commission has been unable to conciliate. But the detailed provisions are flawed. No steps have been taken in the bill to address the fundamental issue of systemic discrimination. I understand that amendments to overcome these weaknesses have been suggested by the Senate committee examining the bill. Following the comments of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) earlier, there will be amendments moved by the opposition in the Senate to address these issues. It is also timely, particularly following the contribution of the member for Kooyong, to look at the proposed cuts by this government to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that occurred in the recent budget. The government is actually proposing a cut of eight per cent to the human rights commission's budget in this financial year and a cut of 35 per cent in the following year. These very significant cuts have been justified on the grounds that the human rights commission's funding over the last decade has been disproportionate to that in other areas of government. There has been a significant need to increase the funding to make up for there not being any significant machinery to deal with discrimination in the past. This justification is one of the most hollow I have heard, because it ignores the facts that the commission has now acquired significant, additional responsibilities such as those that have occurred with the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and the Racial Hatred Act in 1995. The government has also argued that the amendments we are now considering will significantly reduce the human rights commission's role by abolishing its inquiry and determination functions. But according to the commission, these functions account for only about four per cent of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget. These changes may in fact help my constituent. She will not have to put her case twice. She will not have to go to the human rights commission and put her case; and then, because it is not enforceable, go to the Federal Court and put her case again. Unfortunately, what she will have to do, because she is going to want an enforceable decision, is take her case to the Federal Court. That is going to be a much more expensive path. Lawyers will be required, and the cost of taking her case to the Federal Court has been significantly increased. These so-called justifications are also a very thinly-veiled attack on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is going to see its staff reduced by one-third60 out of 180 people are to go-with some of its most significant functions abolished or undermined. This would be disquieting at any time but, in a period when racial discrimination and racial vilification complaints are increasing and when there is a general community concern about the level of intolerance that is being displayed in some quarters, this is inexcusable. This is the time when we need a strong, articulate and well resourced organisation to speak out for tolerance of racial and other minority groups and against discrimination. It is alarming that the government has seen fit to weaken the commission at a time when our country really needs the strongest advocate possible. As it stands, this bill will do nothing to strengthen the commission. I urge the House therefore to consider both the Labor Party amendments to the bill when they come into the Senate and the serious consequences of proceeding with the planned cuts to the commission.",22
9,Mr TONY SMITH,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"This bill implements the first part of the process of reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. The bill is directed at several acts that will be various25Z(1) ly referred to here as the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. The bill not only amends the Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation so as to reform the functions and structure of the commission, but also specifically responds to the High Court decision in the Brandy case. The facts of the Brandy case bear looking into in relation to the background to this legislation. The plaintiff in that case and the third defendant had been officers of the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, as at March 1995, had become officers of ATSIC. On 13 March 1990, the third defendant lodged a complaint against A TSIC with the commission alleging breaches of sections 9 and 15 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The third defendant alleged verbal abuse and threatening behaviour on the part of Brandy, the plaintiff, while both were officers of the department. The third defendant, Bell, also alleged that ATSIC and its chief executive officer had not responded adequately to the complaint. On 22 November 1993, the commission found in favour of Bell and declared that the plaintiff apologise to Bell; pay $2,500 by way of damages for pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal dignity suffered by him; that A TSIC take disciplinary action against the plaintiff; that A TSIC apologise to Bell and that ATSIC pay $10,000 to Bell. On 23 December 1993, the commission lodged the determination with the Federal Court. On 20 January 1994, the plaintiff applied to the Federal Court for a review of the determination. The case went to the Federal Court. In looking at the particular law on the subject, one should note that sections 9 and 15, making certain conduct unlawful, are contained in part II 'Prohibition of Racial Discrimination' of the Racial Discrimination Act. The law also provides that a written complaint, alleging a breach of part II, may be lodged with the commission. The commission then notifies the commissioner, who is required to commence an inquiry. Following the inquiry, the commission may make a final determination under section dismissing the complaint or, if finding the complaint substantiated, make certain determinations, including that the respondent has acted unlawfully and should not continue such conduct; that the respondent compensate the plaintiff; and that the respondent employ or fe-employ the plaintiff. Section 25Z(2) provides that a determination made under 25Z(1) is not binding or conclusive between any of the parties. However, the commission must register the determination with the Federal Court at which time it takes effect as if it were an order of the court, and as a result is enforceable. In the argument that proceeded before the High Court, the plaintiff argued that the relevant provisions were invalid because they provided for an exercise of judicial power otherwise than in conformity with chapter III of the constitution. It was further argued that the commission was not a court established pursuant to section 71 of the constitution or constituted in accordance with section 72. The plaintiff also argued that this was so even though the Federal Court could review those determinations-and that is an important point: that the argument was still maintained, even though the Federal Court could review those determinations, The High Court accepted the argument put by the plaintiff and the court considered that it was difficult to formulate a comprehensive definition of judicial power. It is as well to look quickly at a couple of passages in the High Court's judgment. Firstly, I refer to page 9 of volume 127 of Australian Law Reports, and the section in the judgment of the Chief Justice, Chief Justice Mason, Justices Brennan and Toohey, where their honours said: Thus, it has always been accepted that the punishment of criminal offences and the trial of actions for breach of contract and for wrongs are inalienable exercises of judicial power. The validity of that proposition rests not only on history and precedent but also on the principle that the process of the trial results in a binding and authoritative judicial determination which ascertains the rights of the parties. So, when A alleges that he or she has suffered loss or damage as a result of B' s unlawful conduct and a court determines that B is to pay a sum of money to A by way of compensation, there is an exercise of judicial power. The determination involves an exercise of such power not simply because it is made by a court but because the determination is made by reference to the application of principles and standards ""supposed already to exist"". And the determination is binding and authoritative in the sense that there is what has been described as an immediately enforceable liability of B to pay A the sum in question. Consequently, even if the determination in such a case were to be made by an administrative tribunal and not by a court, the determination would constitute an exercise of judicial power, although not one in conformity with Ch III of the Constitution. I quote, furthermore, some of the remarks of the balance of the court-Justices Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and MCHugh-included at page 16 of the report: Difficulty arises in attempting to formulate a comprehensive definition of judicial power not so much because it consists of a number of factors as because the combination is not always the same. It is hard to point to any essential or constant characteristic. Moreover, there are functions which, when performed by a court, constitute the exercise of judicial power but, when performed by some other body, do not. It goes on to cite another case and then goes on to make this remark at page 17: One is tempted to say that, in the end, judicial power is the power exercised by courts and can only be defined by reference to what courts do and the way in which they do it, rather than by recourse to any other classification of functions. I should add the qualification: But that would be to place reliance upon the elements of history and policy which, whilst they are legitimate considerations, cannot be conclusive. Given that extensive lists of references it can be seen what a difficult question this issue poses. In my view-with respect-the High Court got it right. It is important, in my view, that the High Court determined that the commission was simply that-a commission, a tribunal, a non-judicial body-and as such was not empowered to make final determinations. As I said, that is eminently correct and I welcomed the decision when it came out. Section 71 of the constitution states: The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction. It is as well to note the significance of the word 'court' and that section 71 contains no reference to 'commission' or 'tribunal'. Such terms are creatures of the legislature and were never intended to exercise final power in determination of disputes. The decision in Brandy reinforces again the role of superior courts. In any democracy a properly constituted court metes out justice according to rules of procedure and evidence which are the products of centuries of experience. Evidence is adduced with a body of rules and is then assessed according to objective criteria, not according to the whim and fancy of the presiding officer, not according to any particular bent, slant or angle on life or ideology that that person may have. It is unfortunate, as has been revealed in a number of examples in recent times, that ideology seems to come to the fore sometimes in some of the decisions we see from tribunals. It is not real justice, though. Only a court can mete out justice. We often hear complaints about the courts as well, but the courts have been with us for many hundreds of years. They are the best thing that can be designed to determine the rights of individuals because in every case there is one argument on one side and an argument on the other side. One can never say that hearing one side of the case determines the matter, because it never does. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for quasijudicial bodies, commissions and so forth to be enraptured in one side of the argument. As anyone who has practised in the courts, particularly the criminal courts, will know, when you hear the opening of the prosecution case and the evidence-in-chief of the main complainant in the case, it is not a good feeling as defence counsel, because it seems at the outset that the odds are loaded against you-until the cross-examination commences and the story begins to be whittled away. There is not one case I have ever been involved in where the story against you, no matter how strong, has not been whittled away at least to some extent-in some cases, to the whole extent--on proper cross-examination. That is the importance of the court process. It does that and ultimately comes to the right decision in the circumstances. It does not always reach the right decision and it is never right for the party who has lost, but in 13 years of practice in criminal and civil courts, particularly the criminal courts, I can think of only two decisions which I think were wrong-speaking as a subjective observer because I was defending. Of course, that is two too many, but it is not bad out of hundreds, perhaps oyer 1,000, of cases in which I have been involved. It is not a bad record, really. It is important to bear that in mind in considering what we seem to be going through now, that is, an agony of trying to find some other means or route of meting out justice that is cheaper and that somehow gets around the rules of evidence and reaches a result that pleases everybody. It cannot be done. You cannot do it. The sooner society realises that, the sooner we will devise ways of ensuring that there is access to justice for all who need to get justice. One of the problems that is denying access to justice, in my view, is that, in trying to set up so many alternative means of getting justice, we are in the process potentially denying justice, because there are many people who cannot get legal aid in the courts and who do not approach the court. Once upon a time junior counsel would be able to do summary trials on legal aid because legal aid was available. Now legal aid is not available for summary trials, almost without exception-in Queensland anyway-and, 10 and behold, everyone seems to be pleading guilty. Is that because they are guilty, or is it because, as many a defendant has said to me, 'We just want to get it over and done with'? I cringe when I hear that. But it happens all the time. It is something we cannot sit in this parliament and ignore. We cannot go round and round in circles and think, 'We will devise a commission or a tribunal or something else that weakens the rules of evidence.' Ultimately we destroy the system which is the best system, that is, the court system. Sure, there are areas in the courts that need reform. Mediation and so forth has been an important element of that. But we must not forget that easy justice is cheap justice sometimes and not real justice. Why couldn't the Brandy case have been dealt with in the magistrate's court? It could have been dealt with simply and summarily and disposed of once and for all. Instead, we had an exhaustive process that took it through the Federal Court and the High Court, and an enormous amount of money was spent. In the process literally the system is open to ridicule. I think it is necessary to examine all of these matters. It should be noted that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget of $19 million was cut by $1.5 million. I can assure the House that half of that $19 million would go a long way in the legal aid process. There are many people who are singing out for justice. I have some reservations about the plethora of commissions and tribunals to which we seem to be attracted. I do not mean to say that I have any fundamental ideological opposition to it. I am trying to say to the House that we need better access to justice across the board in many areas. I refer, for example, to medical negligence. If you try to get legal aid for a medical negligence case, you would not have a hope on this earth. Yet I know of a case in which a woman lost her husband, and the circumstances were such that I advised that it would be a very difficult case on which to succeed. Legal Aid had asked me to give the advice free of charge. I said, 'I won't do the advice free; it will take me three weeks to do it. It's a difficult matter but I'll give you some advice off the top of my head.' I was told, 'Thanks very much, we won't give legal aid, anyway.' That is the process. A person who, in my view, has got a case which should at least be inquired into should be given the opportunity to have the case looked at by competent counsel and that counsel should be paid a reasonable fee for doing so. The process is such that that was denied. This whole matter needs to be looked at. I support the bill; do not get me wrong. I think it is important that the courts review these sorts of matters. But let us also look at the potential dangers that may arise when human rights commissions and so forth embark on these inquiries and the damage they can do. In the short time remaining to me I want to refer to one particular case, that of a small business in Queensland which sold pumps and seals for various pumps. A customer tried to purchase a seal. He asked if the seal was available. The business said they were not in stock and informed the customer to that effect. The customer became upset, raised his voice, shouted and became abusive to the persons who were there. He used obscene language. There was absolutely no justification for doing so because the seal was not available. At one stage the customer said that a pump that was on display should be dismantled so that he could purchase the seal. He raised his voice; he was asked to leave. The customer remained un the premises, became more abusive and used obscene language in front of a number of women. He was finally persuaded to leave and did so in the company of an employee. Whilst on the footpath, the customer spat on the employee, an elderly man. He then drove away. After that, the business received a call from the human rights commission. It has been dragged into a dispute with this person, who has alleged racial discrimination over this matter. It has already cost the small business $1,600 in legal fees and an enormous amount of worry and concern over what is, on the face of it, a totally unjustifiable complaint. It is important that these sorts of matters be referred to local tribunals. I welcome any suggestion regarding the creation of a federal magistracy to deal with these sorts of issues so that they do not clog up the superior courts. In all, I support the legislation. This House should constantly be reminded of the need t ) upgrade legal aid facilities. (Time expired)  myself in an unusual position in that my party will be supporting the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill but I have very grave reservations about it. I think it is a very important piece of legislation. It revolves around the Brandy decision-a decision about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in which a penalty was imposed and Brandy took the commission to the High Court. Why is it a very important decision? One of the most fundamental issues of human rights is that we all have, under human rights, the opportunity to be equal in the eyes of the law. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), highlighted another aspect of that problem-that is, it is all very well to be equal in the eyes of the law but you need to be able to appear, and you need to be able, if you are in a court, to have equality of representation. I do not believe that we can talk about the majesty and beauty of Australian law when people are not able to exercise their rights under the law. In fact, to me, this is a very grave, serious issue of human rights. Why then is Brandy important? I need to take issue with the learned judges of the High Court. If at each and every opportunity they are going to make an interpretation of judicial power that prices ordinary people out of the law, then I think they ought be very uncomfortable about that; I think they need to review it. I could say, cynically, that this is the best bit of judicial industry policy that I have seen. I say again, with great respect to the learned justices of the High Court, that most professions, most organisations in our modern society have gone through some form of reorganisation for greater productivity and greater efficiency. I do not believe that judicial processes or the courts should be exempt from that; indeed, I do not think they can be. I do believe that we need to hold on to fundamental principles of the law, but that does not mean that somehow the judiciary or the courts are a static, unchanging factor in our society. How does that affect ordinary citizens? The best way of contrasting that is to look at the states where the states, under their constitutions and the interpretation of the High Court judges, allow a number of tribunals to be created. However, I have to say, with great respect, that I find difficulty in distinguishing the decisions made by these tribunals from decisions made by the courts-but that is maintained. For example, there is the small claims tribunal. Citizens can bring forward to that tribunal disputes involving money of up to a certain limit. A tribunal that has a lot of activity in my electorate is the tenancy tribunal, where there are disputes between landlords and tenants. We do not rush off to a magistrate; we do not rush off to a superior court; we do not even rush off to our local solicitors and engage them. We are able to take the matter, as a tenant or a landlord, before the tribunal, outline the circumstances of the case and have a decision reached. Perhaps not many citizens are taking advantage of this. There is, however, one area that screams out in the federal jurisdiction for a tribunal of this nature, and that is family law. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) made a very important speech in October last year where, consistent with his views, he said that he wanted to look at taking out of the Family Court all the non-court functions. I have no difficulty with courts looking and acting like courts. I happen to support his view. The attorney wanted to establish those functions within the Attorney-General's Department. This, perhaps, is where I take issue with the Attorney-General because I believe that we need to have a tribunal for family law matters in which there are parties who wish to appear before the Family Court but who do not have the financial wherewithal to engage solicitors, barristers and QCs. I know that the Family Court always justifies its success by saying, 'Look, only five per cent of our cases actually go to litigation.' But there has never been an exhaustive study to determine why more cases do not go. I think this is because of two factors: exhaustion, and financial exhaustion. In other words, they run out of money. Having spoken to many people about family law matters, I know that they not only spend their available cash on hiring solicitors but then get into debt to hire them and they reach a point of financial no return. But we are not giving people any other options. I support the concept, if you like, of alternate dispute resolution. I know that my own constituents, in fact, want decisions in their matters arbitrated rather than mediated. It would be ideal to have a family tribunal where you could take these matters in the first instance. There are rights of appeal with these tribunals, but I do not believe that there should be a de novo right to take such matters to a superior court. I think they should be taken to court on matters of law-there is no argument about that-but not in de novo hearings, because really you just exhaust yourself in front of one tribunal and then repeat the exercise with your solicitors' and barristers' guns drawn. So I do not really support a de novo hearing. I just want to make another point about mediators and arbitrators. I think one of the most fundamental principles of the law is that, certainly, the practitioners should have qualifications; in other words, there has to be some learning involved in that role. But there needs to be consistency of decision making. That is why you have appeals. Also, there needs to be a degree of predictability, so that you can actually approach someone and say, 'Given these circumstances, what is the likely outcome?' I know that can be a bit of a lottery, but I think you need these elements. The trouble comes when you are involved with mediators and arbitrators. You need to ask then: what are their qualifications? How do we learn of their decisions'? Is there some reportability in their decisions, so that we can ensure there is consistency? And, of course, there is that issue of predictability. So, whilst as parliamentarians we ought to encourage alternate dispute resolution per se, we ought to be aware that there are some pitfalls, and there ought to be some safeguards in that-and it is not going to be the total answer. I say that, at the federal level, we are very much handicapped because of this Brandy decision by the High Court; that we are not able to introduce the same element. We are not able to have that change in the legal system by having these tribunals in which the states have been involved. I would be very grateful if the Attorney General's Department or even the Attorney General-perhaps the parliamentary secretary at the table-might be able to give me a definitive explanation about the difference between the exercise of judicial and administrative power. It is true, for example, that in the Brandy case an amount of money was awarded against one of the parties, and it involved two citizens bringing the case before the human rights commission. But please do not tell me that similar decisions are not made by some of the other tribunals that we have. We have, for example, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That makes decisions about people's eligibility for benefits from the Commonwealth and their decisions involve money-either the applicant paying the department or the department paying the applicant. The Immigration Review Tribunal makes decisions about whether people are allowed to become permanent residents of Australia. Although there is not an absolute market in that, it is certainly of considerable value to the individuals. In fact, if I wanted to be a little cynical I could say, 'Go to Moscow and you will get the going rate for a short-term visa, long-term visa and permanent residency application.' It certainly has a value there. These decisions affect citizens, affect their rights. All I am trying to say-not as someone who is learned in these matters but as a layman-is that I find it very difficult that the High Court pronounces very stridently that Brandy is the exercise of judicial power but the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is not or the Immigration Review Tribunal is not. I think that they make judicial type decisions, to be frank. But, as I say, it is easy to make the distinction that these are matters between the people and the Commonwealth and involve Commonwealth instrumentalities or departments. I am saying very seriously that I certainly hope that the High Court will have an opportunity to revisit the Brandy decision. In terms of the development of administrative law, this is a very crippling decision, a bad decision. It entrenches the current situation whereby ordinary citizens who have rights in this country actually cannot afford to exercise them. Yes, if we want to look at the specifics of Brandy, people are going to be able to go to the human rights commission; they are going to get a conciliated decision. But if they actually want to get a decision that cannot be conciliated, they have got to go to court. The government does not have the money to fund all citizens to go to court. We do not have the money for legal aid to do it. If I could return to the family law situation, I notice that the shadow minister at the table is Mr Martyn Evans. He chaired a very important inquiry into the funding of administration of the Family Court. He, more than anyone, would know that in terms of judicial processes we are spending over $100 million a year on the Family Court. I believe that the legal aid the Commonwealth spends is in the order of about $125 million per annumnearly a quarter of a billion dollars in total. The majority of that legal aid, of course, goes to family law. It is patently obvious that, if we were able to get a tribunal operating in the family law area, there would be significant savings of money to be made. But I do not want honourable members to think that I am obsessed about savings. What it really means is that people are going to be able to go to the tribunal to put their case. You cannot argue in this country that everyone who wants to mount a case can mount a case, because they just do not have the money. The Brandy decision really makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to set up a tribunal. I regret to say that this legislation is not doing anything to increase the access of ordinary people. I am not talking about the rich and powerful, the wealthy, the influential; they have always had access to the law, they have always had access to solicitors, barristers and QCs. I have got no problem with that. I am talking about ordinary citizens; that is, people in jobs, middle-class people and the poor. They do not have the wherewithal to exercise their rights. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) said that maybe these tribunals are an inferior form of justice. That may be the case, but I have to say that I think that an inferior form of justice is preferable to no justice at all. An inferior form of hearing is preferable to no hearing at all. Until the High Court comes to grips with the implications of Brandy and what it means for tribunals and for the Commonwealth and until the parliament comes to grips with it, I cannot see much progress at all. I will conclude my remarks by referring to the issue in family law that is probably the most difficult. That concerns contact. At the moment, it is true that there is a presumption in the decisions of the Family Court and its registrars that the best interests of children with their mothers. Overwhelmingly, residency orders go that way, and I have no quibble with that; I think that is the nature of our society. But when the court also makes contact orders and those orders are not fulfilled, you need to make a case. To get that residency order overturned, you really need to mount a number of cases, and people just do not have the money. I can understand why the Family Court does not imprison people, particularly women, for breaching the contact orders, but we need to have a solution. I guess the ultimate penalty is reversing which parent the child stays with. The only way you can really allow people the opportunity to make a number of applications which, in the first instance, may be reversed but, ultimately, would be seriously considered is to have a tribunal, because they just do not have the money. They do not have the financial resources. Why when people separate and divorce should so much of the available cash go to the legal profession? Why should it go to the legal profession in legal aid? If you had a tribunal, presumably those responsible for allocating legal aid would insist in the first instance that matters be heard by a tribunal unless there were exceptional circumstances of stalking or domestic violence or something like that. Those cases should go straight to the Family Court. I have no argument about that. But, in all other cases, why would you not in the first instance have the matter heard in a tribunal and, in fact, save that legal aid for the more serious cases? As the member for Dickson pointed out, we are failing to fund many genuine cases in many areas of the law. People are being denied their access to the law. I conclude by saying that I really believe that the Brandy decision was, with great respect, a bad decision by the court. They have locked themselves into preventing a plethora of tribunals developing in the federal arena. I sincerely hope that the court will review its decision in the future. (Time expired)  are morning I was privileged to be in the House during the contribution of the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), who spoke about the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill and used it as an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Asian and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens in our community being impinged over a period by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The member for Kooyong gave a very powerful speech. I, like the member for Banks (Mr MeIham), who spoke on indulgence soon after his speech, wish to be associated with his remarks. It marks a shift in the debate about Hansonism, as it has come to be known, where her own words are being used to condemn the sorts of statements that she has been making. It has been clearly put on the table that what she has been saying has been racist and bigoted and that it has not been done out of ignorance but out of a purely crass, manipulative political motive. It is now 20 years or more since the Commonwealth began to officially recognise the barbarism of discrimination. We drew a line in the sand and defined the difference between right and wrong by instituting certain laws such as the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, the Human Rights Commission Act in 1981, the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992. These laws were enacted to provide for equality and access to employment and housing for aJl Australians regardless of colour, creed, gender or physical make-up. While it is impossible to legislate people's attitudes, the growing awareness in the community that the elementary Australian principle of a fair go should be extended to everyone has seen a greater and wider tolerance and acceptance of all our fellow human beings. While there are no doubt prejudices still left over from a bygone era, in the main they remain below the surface, but not always. There are times when these prejudices spill over the top, where the intolerance of one can adversely affect the standing of another in any number of ways. If it is necessary to have a law, then it is equally necessary to provide suitable means to enforce it and to ensure justice for the aggrieved party. At the same time, we must ensure that the cost to the person or persons wronged of such injustice in terms of both finance and stress is kept to a minimum. But of themselves, these laws do not provide for the delivery of justice. There has long been a recognition that the current system, with its inconsistencies and variations between the anti-discrimination laws, is not the cure-all it was intended to be and that it needed revision. The conciliation process adopted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has proven successful in many cases, but there have been problems associated with resolution of those cases in which conciliation has proven unproductive. This bill allows for major changes in two areas. It streamlines complaint investigations and conciliation procedures by bringing the various areas of discrimination dispute under the jurisdiction of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and it enables applications to the Federal Court for settlement of disputes where conciliation fails. I think it is fair to say that all of us would favour the process of conciliation over that of litigation in these matters. Certainly, my office has already taken some calls from constituents fearing that the increased role of the Federal Court in these proceedings will discourage claims from people who are less well to do but aggrieved nonetheless. Those people will be pleased to learn that the filing fees in the Federal Court will be waived in certain instances-for those holding Commonwealth health benefits cards; for those in prison; Austudy, Abstudy and legal aid recipients; children; and those who can demonstrate financial hardship. The Attorney General's Department has noted that in excess of 30 per cent of all litigants would be likely to avoid paying the filing fee. As I mentioned earlier, we would like to keep those matters out of court if possible, but a court ruling is by far the most certain method of collecting any compensation that might arise from a dispute. The regime introduced by the previous Labor government was found to be unconstitutional as evidenced by the Brandy case, which a number of the speakers have touched on this morning and no doubt will continue to touch on during this debate. HREOC is a non-judicial body and does not have the constitutional power for dispute determination. While in opposition, the coalition made a vow to change the system and make it more workable. This bill, when passed, will give the system constitutional certainty and provides the most effective and efficient device for conciliation and determination of discrimination complaints. I find it remarkable that members opposite can criticise us for reducing funding to the commission. In all their years in office the only thing they learned about government was how to spend more money each year. They looked at the budget papers and saw an increase in spending on each line and believed that that was good in itself. But they never bothered with the bottom line. It was as if they bought us all a new TV, stereo and VCR and never figured out that we did not really need them, or that we could not afford to pay for them. They unfortunately equated higher spending with greater justice. We know from years of experience in so many areas that greater spending does not mean greater justice. Despite the reduced role, HREOC will retain an important role under these proposed new arrangements. Parties whose complaints reach the court may be assisted by a report prepared by the Human Rights Commissioner, and commissioners will also be able to join proceedings as a friend of the court. While the parliament cannot dictate to the court how it will conduct its own affairs, it is expected that the court will set up a human rights registry to assist clients and the judicial registrars will be appointed to handle the additional caseload that will eventuate from these new arrangements. In all, the new system will serve to bring about more definitive rulings and better procedures for compensation. In addition, I would hope that some of the more frivolous cases never see the light of day under the new regime. I recall recently an elderly woman coming to my office to complain that she had been dragged before the commission on a trumped up charge of sex discrimination. She had denied a tenant permission to make alterations to her building because of doubts about insurance liability. The woman who had been contracted by the tenant to perform the work saw this as enough reason to claim that she had been discriminated against on the grounds of gender. There followed some media coverage of the charge and the owner of the building had her picture on the front page of the Advertiser, causing her some considerable stress. As it came to pass, my constituent was eventually cleared of any discriminatory behaviour, but justice was hardly swift in coming. The proceedings were protracted and her relief at the final outcome was tempered greatly by the financial cost to her of the whole exercise. It is to be hoped, then, that these new arrangements will aid in weeding out the Chicken Littles from the genuine cases of discrimination. I suspect the numbers of people who seek to exploit the system in this way are very few, but it would be to everyone's benefit if every case had at least some real merit to it. While the Australian spirit is one of overall fairness, that attitude, sadly, does not extend to everyone of our people, especially when times are tough. It has been the experience that some will go looking for a scapegoat for their own failure. It has also been the experience that demagogues will seek to exploit that uneasy and uncertain situation to their own ends. After such an extended period of Labor government, many things needed to be righted, and still do. It is a fair and reasonable expectation that Australians should ask a lot of questions about the way things have been and are being done in our country. That is the nature of our democracy, and debate on every aspect of public policy should be encouraged. The more debate, usually the more facts emerge. But it is distressing that some who are posing as nationalists and upholders of the Australian tradition seem intent on providing simplistic solutions to complex problems. The member for Oxley is a major proponent of this dangerous method. She has garnered media attention because she shoots from the hip without delay, thought or clue. She sells newspapers. She is a human headline who has won support in some quarters because some have too easily mistaken 'outrageous' for 'courageous'. While she has changed her staff regularly, her views have undergone no such metamorphosis. It seems to me that that she has come into possession of the Pat Buchanan playbook and is now attempting to appeal to a wider audience. Make no mistake. The member for Oxley is a populist looking for yet more targets as she gallivants around the country with her shadow dwelling disciples preaching her facile mantra, laying blame for national problems at the feet of Australian minorities. Crime? To her we blame Asian migrants. National debt? Let us blame our indigenous people. And on it goes from one issue to the other. I hear her defenders saying that she is saying only what many Australians are thinking. If that is the case, then those Australians are mistaken and we need to communicate better the modem realities and necessities of life in the 1990s. Some of these realities need to be put on the record. Only 3.3 per cent of Department of Social Security welfare payments go to indigenous people. On a per capita basis, mainstream services and benefits are absorbed by indigenous people far less than they are by other Australians. Unemployment amongst indigenous people is about two or three times the national rate and mean income one-third less. The retention rates in schools are appalling. Indigenous health is such that only one-third will live to male pension age. Many communities operate without sewerage, electricity and adequate water supply. We have all heard that line: 'I remember the days when we could leave our doors unlocked when we left the house.' I am sure that many of our indigenous people would be more than happy to lock their doors if they had them. Home ownership is less than half that of the national percentage. The number of occupants per household is nearly double. Let us not fool ourselves that this is a privileged class of people, as the member for Oxley believes, or at least wants us to believe. Nor should we swallow her fantasy about the make-up of our population. It seems to me that she is trying to revive the old fear that we are about to be overrun by what used to be known in the times of the White Australia policy as 'the yellow peril'. I think we have moved on from those days. Certainly I hope so. The fact is that under five per cent of our population is Asian born. That figure will increase to just 7V2 per cent over the next 30 years. I noted with interest this week the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and, in particular, the possibility of prosecution and fines for telling mistruths in election campaigns. It occurred to me that the member for Oxley may well have to increase the cover charge for her One Nation floor show if she does not clean up her act. There are many scars that must be healed if Australia is to move forward and become a power in our region and throughout the world. We have unlimited potential, but we are held back because other nations are looking for excuses to question our integrity, especially on matters such as race relations. Reports from several high-ranking officials from Australia who have returned from Asia confirm that our trade is suffering because of some of the nonsense that is being talked in this nation. The tourism market-the best chance we have to show the world the sort of nation we have and the people we really are-is being similarly affected. These empty-headed cries for a return to the policies of yesterday have reopened these scars and will continue to make our progress difficult. In a world economy, we must be competitive and cooperative. We must be beyond reproach in matters of race relations. Even more important, we must be seen to be beyond reproach. Matters of race and discrimination in our past are very much in the news with the release of the Bringing them home report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the stolen children. This report goes a long way to explain the depth of our feeling over indigenous people and their treatment. It contains a litany of horror, recollections of experiences from those who were taken from their families or had children taken from them. It is part of our history---Dur very recent history at that-and cannot be ignored. It is a long report and its price will sadly prevent many Australians from buying it. Still, these true stories are required reading. I was particularly struck by the reminiscences of Fiona, who remembered all too well her experience of 1936 when she was five years of age. She was accompanied by her mother, two of her siblings and three cousins on a truck from Ernabella to the United Aborigines Mission in Oodnadatta. That night, Fiona saw her mother leave the mission and never had the opportunity to say goodbye. Taken from her natural environment, Fiona adjusted to the ways of life of Europeans, moved to the suburbs of Adelaide and only later in life realised the deprivation of custom, family and language that she had suffered. After 32 years, she met her mother again and had to communicate with her through an interpreter. Still, Fiona concluded that she had to learn to forgive. Her story is one of many that underline the tough plight of our indigenous population since European settlement. The passage of years has changed the attitude of the settlers from one of hostility to one of concern for their indigenous neighbours. As the report proves once again, sadly the road to hell is paved with good intentions. No-one can read these testimonies and fail to cringe at the injustices wrought on our fellow human beings by previous generations of Australians. That these events occurred in an attempt to help our indigenous people makes them no less terrifying or more justifiable. Those involved were robbed of a significant part of their lives. Those who are responsible and still with us today no doubt bear a great deal of shame for their part in these happenings. As an Australian, I feel deep sorrow for these people who have endured so much. As an elected representative, I regret these travesThe ties ever occurring and am more determined than ever to see all Australians achieve our goal of reconciliation. I am saddened that some have taken the release of this report as another opportunity to grandstand in an attempt to win points from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). His personal apology was heartfelt, no less than anyone's in this place, and indigenous people will surely fare better under this government than any previous Labor administration which was strong on promises but pathetic on delivery. The chief responsibility of the Australian people is not so much for the past as it is for the future. While we should never lose sight of what has gone before us, I believe our eyes should be fixed ahead. We should forgive but not forget, and we should get on with the job of finding a way we can all live together and thrive together. While we continue to break down barriers and work towards that goal, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has an important role to play. Its function should be more about educating Australians than punishing them for any indiscretion. It has been shown to be ineffective in enforcing its judgments, and the transfer of jurisdiction to the Federal Court of these matters is welcomed. It is but the first step in the planned reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I commend the bill to the House.",24
10,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"While we support the general idea of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the current context in which we approach this matter is a sad one because of the Howard government's actions in relation to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in which there has been an announcement of a reduction of 40 per cent in its budget. We just heard the previous government speaker, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), waxing lyrical about how the Hanson phenomenon has to be stopped, how racism has to be stamped out and how we have to do more things to improve our international image. But actions speak louder than words. reality is that the government in its action in reducing the budget dramatically of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is sending a very different signal. The different signal is this: notwithstanding the language and the propaganda, when it comes to having the resources to deal with the issues of discrimination and the issues of human rights, this government is cutting those resources in a dramatic way. It ought to be condemned for that. It is a sign of what is happening across the board with respect to this government on the issues of race, multiculturalism and human rights. What is happening across the board is that we have had somewhat reluctant comments from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-and some not so reluctant comments from some other ministers---coming too little too late. At the same time, when you look at the actions, you see that the actions are not in any way consistent with the comments that the Prime Minister has made. It is no good the Prime Minister going overseas and saying, 'Australia has been condemned unfairly on these matters,' when he was responsible in the first instance for not doing enough. It is universally accepted throughout this country that he did not do enough about the Hanson phenomenon. We also have actions by the government which appear to be giving ground to the very positions of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her supporters. One of those is this dramatic cut to the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If one looks at the recent history of Australia, one cannot imagine a time when it was more important to boost the budget and support of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rather than to reduce it. That comes on top of a reduction of 55 per cent, $5.5 million, to the campaign against racism, which has not started yet, although it is one year since the time it was announced. In the first year of its budget, not a penny was spent. Not a penny was spent because of the fact that we have a situation where we have had a lot of talk from this government in recent times-not so much earlier, when it was necessary-about how we need to stamp out the problems created by Pauline Hanson and her supporters, but we do not have sufficient action and we do not have sufficient resources. Those two things together-the cut to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the cut to the campaign against racism--ought to be condemned. They illustrate a certain amount of hypocrisy on the part of the government in relation to these issues. There is no doubt that on the human rights question this government is cutting out resources across the board. This government is not as concerned about these matters as it ought to be. I believe that is a very serious issue. By the way, it does not just go to the question of the role of the commission on matters of race. In the case of the sex discrimination issue, the government, because of its cuts to budgets, decided not to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has a very important role to play in ensuring that there is equality between men and women in relation to a whole range of issues in this nation. What happened is that, instead of replacing that commissioner, they merged that position with the position of the Privacy Commissioner. They have one person doing the two jobs. That is a huge task for the one person. The reason for that was obviously some attempt to save a small amount of money in the context of a situation in which we are facing increasing complaints about discrimination from all levels, especially discrimination against women, discrimination against indigenous people and discrimination against people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds-especially, in recent times, people of Asian background-as a consequence of the Hanson phenomenon. The fact that there has been a dramatic increase in complaints about racial discrimination clearly shows that the Hanson phenomenon has had an impact in our society and cannot be ignored. How can the commission carry out its functions and its role if it is not properly funded and if its resources have been substantially reduced? The government cannot be seen to be serious about the Hanson phenomenon while it is doing things of that kind. We should look at a little bit of history in relation to this question of how to deal with racial issues, because you will recall that in the last year of the Keating government we attempted to pass the racial vilification bill. What happened in relation to that bill was that the conservative parties that had control of the Senate with one of the minor parties decided that they would not support punitive sanctions in that bill, which basically meant that only civil remedies were available for people who have been discriminated against or who have been abused because of racial vilification. What that has meant is this: because we now have the Hanson phenomenon and we have people actually being vilified, the law cannot take action against them. They have to take civil action in civil courts. That was the result of the conservatives' failure to pass the racial vilification bill in its full meaning when they were in opposItIOn. Nothing has been done to fix up this problem. If you read some of the comments of the member for Oxley-and some of her comto ments were reproduced on page 6 of the Herald-Sun on Tuesday, 18 June-in my opinion, they are contrary to the racial cation bill. Unfortunately, nothing very much can be done about it because there are no punitive sanctions. When we were discussing the racial vilificadanger tion bill, the issue of freedom of speech Of course, whenever you are discussing this question of whether people can express racial abuse, others who want to say, 'Yes, they ought to be able to do so,' bring up the question of freedom of speech. But both sides of the House, when this matter was discussed, agreed that there is a limit to the freedom speech; that is, racial abuse and abuse of people on the basis of their race should not admitted in this country. What have we had from the Hanson phenomenon and from Ms Hanson herself? We have had comments similar to those which the racial vilification bill was intended to deal with. When the Prime Minister was first asked comment on the maiden speech of Ms Jewish Hanson, did he emphasise the racial vilificafrom tion act? Did he emphasise the Racial Discriagainst mination Act? Did he emphasise the human rights commission's role in these matters? at all. On the contrary, he emphasised her right to freedom of speech as if there were unlimited right to freedom of speech, irrespecthe tive of questions of racial intolerance and racial discrimination. That is what he did. The Prime Minister failed even to refer the balance which this House had sought to achieve when it passed the racial vilification bill and when speakers on both sides of this House made the point that there is not absolute right to freedom of speech. There a universal right, but it is limited in one specific way throughout the world in conthi s at all.' siderations of this kind-that is, freedom of speech does not extend to being able to attack people on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin. Because the Prime Minister in his first comments on Ms Hanson's maiden speech notwithstanding failed completely to talk about that balance, to refer to that issue, it was assumed and widely accepted that she had an absolute right talk about these matters-and she continues to do so-irrespective of the fact that we ought to have been having a very thorough vilifiexamination as to whether the comments by Ms Hanson are contrary to the intentions and to the letter of the racial vilification bill. If you say things like, 'I believe we are in of being swamped by Asians, who arose. have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate,' and the comments are taken up and directed towards individual people, that is racial vilification. Individuals are vilified because they are of Asian background, irrespective of the fact that they may have made a significant and very of important contribution to this country. When did we last see in human history the be claim that a race of people form ghettos and do not assimilate-this idea of condemning a whole group of people? We saw that before the Second World War and during the Second World War when it was directed against the Jewish community and later on when it to formed the basis of the extermination of the people. It is not a very long way to go racial vilification comments to violence individuals and to organised attacks against those groups of people. We do not Not want this in Australian society. The Prime Minister, by not condemning this an matter from the very beginning, totally failed nation. As I said before, rather than talking about the member for Oxley's rights to freedom of speech, he should have been to focusing on the need to balance freedom of speech with responsibility in terms of these issues. After all of this process, we are now in a situation where internationally our reputaan tion has been sullied. The Prime Minister is now, a year later, goes overseas and says, 'This is all very unfair. Australia is not like The fact of the matter is that the Hanson phenomenon was allowed to spread and it was allowed to multiply. In the context in which we have economic problems and other problems in this nation-which we can address, the fact that we have differences of view in this place about how they ought to be addressed-we know that people will try to blame others of different ethnic cultures and of different races. When people feel threatened, when people feel their economic future is insecure and when they feel some angst about the future, it is a common phenomenon for them to try to blame people of a different race or a different culture for their problems. Therefore, we have had this idea that the immigration program in the last few years has been somehow responsible for our current ills, notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from economists that immigration is a net positive for the economy. The government does not even carry out a campaign to counter these lies being put about by the member for Oxley and her supporters. No campaign is carried out to show the enormous positive benefits which this nation has had from immigration, from multiculturalism and from the fact that we have managed until the Hanson phenomenon arose to be a harmonious nation in which people from more than 200 different cultures and traditions were working together and trying to build a better society. Then all of a sudden, because of the economic problems I mentioned plus because the Hanson phenomenon was allowed to continue in that way without much counter from the government until recently, we now are in this extraordinary position where a society which was previously held up as a model of multiculturalism and as a model of people working together by the United Nations itself in its conferences, is threatened. Because of these serious tensions and divisions, the rubric of our society is threatened. They threaten to divide our people and threaten to create an image of Australia internationally which is a very bad one and which will rebound on us, not only economically but also in terms of the standing of the nation internationally. Many people have said, 'Oh, this is a problem because of its economic consequences.' Of course the economic consequences for this nation will be extremely serious. But it is not just an economic question; it is a fundamental moral question. If United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights means something it means that all peoples, irrespective of their culture and racial background, have the entitlement to equal treatment and equal worth. Australia was one of the founding nations in signing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But, in recent times, some members of this House-and I do not just refer to the member for Oxley-seem to have forgotten about that. We are left, therefore, with a situation in which we now have to carry out a positive campaign in support of human rights. That brings me back to the problems that we have with this bill. We will be moving a number of amendments in the Senate to seek to strengthen this bill. We will also be continuously making the point to the Australian people that if you are serious about human rights, if you are serious about racial discrimination, if you are serious about discrimination on the basis of gender, if you are serious about doing something to improve the image of Australia as a nation in which human rights are respected then you do not cut the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-and certainly not by 40 per cent. That is a disgrace. It indicates that the government has lost its way in relation to these very important issues facing the Australian nation. As I said, it is no good the Prime Minister complaining internationally about these matters. (Time expired)",34
11,Mr SLIPPER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Fisher) (11.47 a.m.)Listening to the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) opposite, one could have forgotten that we were in fact debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1966. The honourable member appears to have digressed rather substantially into a wide-ranging attack on the approach of this government to free speech and also on the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I must say there is not very much uttered by the honourable member for Calwell that I agree with, but I defend very strongly his right to say what he wants to say in a democthe racy. It has been said that when freedom is curtailed freedom is lost. I certainly understand the robust debate which has taken place in Australia over the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley. I can understand why many people feel hurt and upset by SOl Ie of her statements. I can also appreciate that there is a very great risk to Australia's trade with our region resulting from those comments. But I think at the end of the day we have to appreciate that Australia is a democracy. We have freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughcourse, out the world. Sometimes, accompanying those freedoms, we have to put up with situations which not all of us entirely like. I was a speaker at a seminar organised here at Parliament House recently by the Japanese Embassy to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the signing of the trade treaty between Australia and Japan by a former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr MCEwen. During that seminar, which was attended by a number of Australian members of parliament and a number of Japanese members of parliament, the moderator, Mr Frank Devine, the former editor of the Australian, asked the Japanese delegation what the Japanese Prime Minister of the day would do if a Pauline Hanson-like figure emerged in Japan and made comments of similar ilk. It would surprise the honourable member for Calwell to know that the leader of the Japanese delegation said that the Japanese Prime Minister would do nothing. He said in effect, 'Japan is a democracy. People have the right of free speech in !apan.' That is what would have happened In that country. It is interesting that members opposite, particularly the previous speaker, able member for Calwell, have condemned this government's approach when we as a government have not really supported the views of the honourable member for Oxley at all. We have said that in Australia there is a democracy and that people are entitled to say what they want. Of course, what they say ought to be tempered with responsibility. The thing is, though, that in a democracy people are allowed to express robust and differing views. I think it would be a sad day if the thought police prevented anyone on either side of the parliament getting up and expressing an honestly held view. I have certain concerns about comments made by the honourable member for Oxley, but I believe that, in a free society, it is important that the honourable member for Calwell, the honourable member for Oxleyindeed, all honourable members-and members of the Australian community generally have the right to express their views. Of as I said, those views ought to be tempered with responsibility. But, at the end of the day, we have to come to a decision about whether Australia is a democracy or whether Australia is not a democracy. I reject also the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell criticising the coalition's approach to the Racial Hatred Act 1995 when it was a bill before the House. We believe very strongly in free speech. We think it is one of the fundamental freedoms that we have inherited from a thousand years of democracy. Our democracy is robust. I think it is very sad that the honourable member for Calwell seeks to criticise the government for standing up for what most Australians would accept as one of the very basic rights in our society. The Prime Minister himself has been very even-handed about this whole issue. If you have listened to what the Prime Minister has said and if you have looked closely at what he has said as he defends the right of people to speak their minds, you will realise that he said those rights should be tempered with responsibility. He has not hesitated to point out where he disagrees with the honourable member for Oxley. I believe that the Prime Minister has an entirely appropriate approach the honour- to this whole matter. I also have great confidence in the good sense of the Australian community. This is a wonderful country. We are a nation of settlers, along with our indigenous people. It ought to be appreciated that Australians are able to consider both sides of the argument, and I am confident that they will take a very sensible and balanced approach. Unlike the honourable member for Calwell, I intend to address some elements of the bill in my speech. This bill has two main purposes. Firstly, it aims to amend the Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation to reform the administration functions and structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Most importantly, it is a response to the decision of the High Court in the case of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found that the commission as a non-judicial body did not have constitutional power to determine disputes finally. And the fundamental change proposed in the bill is that the commission will no longer conduct hearings or inquiries in relation to matters that cannot be conciliated. The bill make the commission more focused. The president effectively becomes the chief executive officer of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and, as such, will have responsibility for implementation of cooperative arrangements and other administrative tasks. An important change is that the complaint investigation and conciliation function will be centralised in the office of president. The bill also simplifies dispute resolution procedures in human rights matters by eliminating the second tier of review in the commission-that is, the commission inquiry, which was not directly enforceable. It also provides that matters that cannot be conciliated or are not suitable for conciliation will be dealt with in the Federal Court. It says that the Federal Court will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms in determining proceedings brought before it under the legislation, and it does permit the judges to delegate some, if not all, of their functions to judicial registrars. Of course that will assist the Federal Court in dealing with the additional caseloads. The bill also makes provision for the commissioners other than the Privacy Commissioner to appear as amicus curiae to argue the policy imperatives of their legislation before the Federal Court, subject to the court granting leave for that to be done. The bill also proposes a number of access and equity reforms. The Federal Court will be able to adopt informal procedures, as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. Some people would say that the Federal Court is not the appropriate body to handle matters which were previously looked after by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but because of the decision of the High Court in relation to the separation of powers what we have done is bring forward what we believe to be a sensible compromise, a compromise which will provide for conciliation and which will provide for remedies when those are required. When there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance, and I believe that that is a very important inclusion, because the last thing that this government would want would be for people who are not able to afford to access remedies to be locked out. It is also envisaged that friendly procedures will be developed. Some people might say that friendship and the Federal Court are mutually exclusive terms, but what we have done is to bring forward this balanced approach to the Brandy decision. We believe that the Federal Court judges will be able to work the systems through so that in fact we have a situation which is eminently workable, fair and equitable. I am sorry also about the contributions made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Calwell. Again, they seem to have forgotten the particular bill that we were talking about. In addition, I think it was unfortunate that the honourable member for Banks has sought to politicise this matter and that those opposite have sought to criticise the government. What they have not done is to say that this bill is the government's response to the mess that was set up by the former Labor government. The former Labor government implemented the scheme that was found by the High Court to be unconstitutional. One would have thought that the former government should have done its homework, should have checked to see whether what it was doing would have been allowable under the law of Australia. It did not, and indeed the result is that the High Court brought down its decision which has ultimately resulted in the bill currently before the chamber. Within constitutional limitations, the bill provides the most efficient mechanism for the conciliation and arbitration of federal discrimination complaints. Most importantly-and you would be aware yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, what importance the coalition places on keeping its election promises-as a party going to the polls we promised that we would implement this bill. The bill before the chamber is yet another indication of the fact that, unlike our predecessors, this government is prepared to keep its election promises. The administrative structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be made more efficient, which is a first step to making sure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is able to serve the country well as we go into the future. There were also some criticisms coming from the Labor Party speakers over budget cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There was a suggestion, I think, by the honourable member for Calwell that, by reducing the budget to the commission, somehow this indicated that the coalition was not interested in human rights matters and was not interested in making sure that we had fairness and equity. It ought to be recognised that the coalition has required the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to find savings, as other government departments have had to find savings. Bureaucracy not only runs riot in other government departments but also is present in the commission. We have cut the budget by $1.5 million per annum while the loss of the hearing function will result in savings of $600,000. And it ought to be noted that the balance will be able to be found through increased efficiencies in the commission itself. The government, unlike its predecessor, realises that one has to balance the books. We simply cannot go on spending at the rate that the former government was spending. We have to accept that we must have income to meet our expenditure. By continuing to build up huge budget deficits year after year, our predecessors were mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren. We all recall that sad and sorry saga prior to the election last year when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, both told us that the budget situation was in surplus. We sought to find out what the information actually was, and we were told that the budget was in surplus but that exact figures were not available. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine our surprise on the Monday after the election when the incoming Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), was presented with the figures, which must have been available to the former government prior to the election. Far from having a budget that was in surplus, we actually discovered that there was a deficit of some $10.3 billion, and we had to fix the problem. We did not create the problem. We did not create the situation where there was a $10.3 billion deficit, but we had to fix it. We take responsibility for fixing it, and we will not run away and shirk our responsibilities to do that. That is why the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government expenditures have had to be reined in because we simply cannot go on spending more than we as a nation earn. The response of those opposite always seems to be to write more cheques and to spend more money, but at the end of the day the people of Australia do require fiscal responsibility and they do appreciate that one must essentially run a nation's books in the same way as one would run one's own household accounts. One simply cannot go on spending more than one earns. So we had to make savings. We would have preferred not to have cut government expenditures in some areas where we have had to, but at the end of the day the Treasurer had the intestinal fortitude in two successive budgets to stand up and say that enough was enough. There was a change in government. We were given a mandate by the Australian people to be economically responsible, and the government has ensured that we have not shirked our mandate and have not shirked our responimmigration sibility. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill has, as I said, two essential elements. One makes some amendments and reforms to the commission itself and the other very effective response to the Brandy case. We did not create the problem that made it necessary for this bill to be brought in, we not build up the budget deficit, but we have had to find the savings. We did not impleas ment the scheme that was overturned by the High Court in the Brandy case, but we have also had to fix this. It is really sickening to find the Labor coming into this chamber with speaker after malice in it. speaker after speaker pouring criticism on the government over a range of matters that relevant in any way, shape or form to the bill currently before the House. In addition that, not only are those criticisms not relevant to this bill but they are absolutely and pletely wrong. I commend the Attorneyshortcomings-'You General (Mr Williams) and the government for bringing this bill to the parliament. It is bill that is necessary, balanced, fair and equitable. The regime that will exist following the passage of this bill will have an entirely appropriate mechanism to listen to and deal with complaints in relation to discrimination. I commend the bill to the House.",37
12,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I am sorry there seems to have been some slip-up in the speaking order. I thought I would be speaking after Mr Nugent, the member for whatever. It would have been interesting to have followed the three speakers  member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and this the member for whatever-obviously all members of the same party because they are all giving the same sort of claptrap nonsense. I say to the member for Calwell that underestimated him. I said to the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the House the other day, 'Gareth, in my opinion you have just delivered one of the most sanctimonious fraudulent speeches that I have ever heard.' The deputy leader can take a bow for the member for Calwell. The member for Calwell approached me once when were both on the committee and said, 'Listen, we are not that far away. I support quotas for immigration.' That was interesting because I never have. He was quite happy to have quotas, but it seemed that he wanted to have one is a some control over the quotas. I can tell members of the House that I have travelled the world and there is no country in did the world prepared to give people a fair gQ more than this country. I came to this country a migrant, and when I went to Tailem Bend there were no migrants and I copped all the chiacking that usually goes on-'Pommies don't wash!', 'Pommies keep their coal in the Party bath!' - and I realised that there was no A fellow came to me recently to review a is not book. He was a Hungarian-a refugee. He came out here in 1948 as a reffo. His first job to was working for the army as a civilian and his boss was an army cook, who apparently comliked grog and used to abuse him for his own useless reffo this' and 'You useless reffo this, why have you done a this?' - but this fellow said, 'When I realised that I could abuse the boss back I thought, ""What a wonderful country this is.'"" That has been a hallmark of this country and this is what the likes of the member for Calwell and the member for Sturt want to sweep away with the nonsense they are putting forward. I am very critical of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill before us. If you look at funding in real terms, you see the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is still getting more than it got in 1989-90, and that is an indictment of this government, for it is quite clear to me that pontificating group, set up at taxpayers' expense and whose members draw large salaries from taxpayers and seem to think their duty is to continually denigrate us, I have should be swept away. That would save money to be put into much more useful things. If you gave me $10 million for Aboriginal housing, I could do more for Aboriginal housing than government has ever done. It seems that there is now a concerted policy of the Liberal Party to attack Pauline Hanson. I suppose she must pose some sort of a threat to them, so they denigrate her at every opportunity. If you go back to Pauline Hanson's first speech in this parliament it was a naive, honest, from-the-heart speech. It is the sort of speech that a politician should make and there should be more of those speeches in this parliament. There was nothing in that speech that warranted the vilification she got. What you saw across this country was a united effort from the media, Australia's sick academia, politicians from both sides and the churches to destroy this woman, and to destroy her so completely that no-one would ever raise these issues again. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) let the cat out of the bag in his speech. In that 2Y2-hour diatribe of voodoo incantation that passed for debate in this House, he said, 'Free speech is all right but you can't let free speech interfere with free trade.' Then, having realised what he had said, he said, 'I can't see how anyone could doubt the benefits of free trade.' I doubt the benefits of free trade. I have always supported bilateral trade and I will support fair trade, but free trade is a nonsense. It has done enormous damage to this country. That is simply irrefutable. If the minister wants to I would be very happy to engage in a debate with him on that issue. But that was it. They were quite happy to keep this argument milling around on the race issue but they did not want it to touch free trade. That is, of course, what is concerning the Liberal Party now. They areJocked into this dogma of rational economics-the creation of Paul Keating probably more than anyone else. It is a dangerous dogma. It is not an economic policy; it is extreme ideology and it is nonsense. The truth is that the Hilmer report is not about competition; it is about oligopoly. Once you get rid of small business, big business will collude. The mistake that all these people make when they go back to Ricardo and Adam Smith is that they forget that these people made it plain that they were talking about competition within national boundaries, not without national boundaries. The whole thesis and doctrine was based on competition within national boundaries. I get sick of people coming into this House and denigrating Australia, trying to make us look apologetic overseas. We have nothing to apologise for. I remember when I put out a paper called 'Immigration and consensus' I was interviewed for the ABC by a prominent journalist who is now the Labor state member for Perth. She was taking the line that criticising immigration was racist. I said to her, 'Let me read you a poem', which I will read to the House now: I have grown past hate and bitterness I see the world as one Yet though I can no longer hate My son is still my son. All men at God's round table sit And all men must be fed But this loaf in my hand This loaf is my son's bread. I said to her when I had finished, 'What do you think of that?' She said, That is the most racist thing I have ever heard.' She is now the Labor member for Perth. That was Dame Mary Gilmore. If you look at her history, I do not think anyone could call her a racist in any shape or form. It was a poem about a family's concern, and that is what we should be about-the family of Australia. I do not care where people come from if they come to this country, provided their commitment is to Australia. It is a very interesting thing that we heard not a word from any of our ministers, from the member of Calwell or any of those other self-righteous creeps that you get around the place. Let me read you this. We must accept the fact that the Chinese are not a group that could be assimilated easily. Once a Frenchman or German moves to the United States they become Americans, they speak American English, accept American customs as the norm. But not the Chinese. That is not me. That is Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia. He goes on with a diatribe against the Chinese-things I do not even believe. There is not a word of criticism of Dr Mahathir, but of course Malaysia maintains a policy of discrimination against the Chinese. That IS apparently all right. It goes on: China itself has fanned the Hames of mistrust on immigrants calling on overseas Chinese to build the country and launch in sometimes strident nationalist propaganda ... I have a Chinese friend who is a great Australian nationalist. He speaks to me frequently. He said, 'Of those 24,000 students that Bob Hawke let into the country' - you will all remember that flood of tears- 'not one was a refugee. They were the sons and daughters of the political and military cadre.' Of course they were, otherwise they would not be here. They have now been joined by a host of relatives. He said to me, '1 can tell you that one in five, maybe one in three, is a Chinese government sleeper. I can tell you that there is no commitment to Australia in the whole lot of them. Why do you do this to yourselves? 1 know these people. They do not change.' Of course, he is right. I have no problems dealing with China. I have been to China five times. I find the country fascinating. If anybody thinks that China is going to be a great bonanza for us, they are wrong. The Chinese at the end of the day will do it themselves, and good on them. That is what we as a nation should be doing. That does not mean that we do not trade with them. We take every trading opportunity. That Pauline Hanson is somehow going to affect trade is a nonsense that we are beset with. The only reason people buy from us is that we offer the best product at the best price. That does not mean to say that they will not use the words of the grovelling politicians that you find in this House and who sayMr Zammit-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",41
13,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I wondered how long it would be. Mr Zammit-If you wondered, why did you raise it? What the honourable member is speaking about has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the bill before the House. I ask you to ask him to return to the bill.",43
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,I would remind the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that you have been speaking for 10 minutes and you have not raised the bill in its any substance or form. I ask you politely to,43
15,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on that point of order: I have raised the bill. I have mentioned it several times. If you were listening to previous speakers-and I am sure you were-what you heard was a wide-ranging diatribe against Pauline Hanson. That was also nothing to do with the bill. Everything I am saying is as germane as everything that has been said there.",43
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,There is no point of order. I ask you to get back to the substance of the bill.,43
17,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The substance of the bill is this: with regard to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-this high-sounding, high-blown name-we have set these people up to somehow watch over us. As I said, they are fetching high salaries paid by the Australian taxpayer. They seem to think their job is to continually denigrate us, a denigration which is not justified. I am saying this again, Mr Deputy Speaker, to refresh your memory because I have already said it once. In my view, this organisation should be swept away entirely, but the government does not have the stomach for that. I hope they will have the courage to do it in small doses and continue to cut its funding so that it is no longer an oppressive threat to Australian sensibilities. In debating this bill, there has been an implication by many speakers that we are a racist country. I have made it clear in my speech that we are not. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has made several attempts to do this. 1 remember when Irene Moss wanted to do a paper to show how racist we were. Unfortunately for Irene, even their slanted investigation proved that Australia was probably less racist than most of the migrant groups who came to this country. So she turned it into an attack on Australia and its Aboriginal affairs record. This was at a time when there was an inquiry under way into Aboriginal deaths in custody. 1 recall entering one of the committee rooms here by mistake when she was holding forth about the terrible situation in Kalgoorlie. This is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for you. She was saying how Aboriginals were disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics for Kalgoorlie. Of course they are. The mining companies will fall over backwards to employ an Aboriginal if he can speak English, he can tum up for shift work and he can tum up clean. That is where they fall down. There are a lot of Aboriginals in Kalgoorlie. They have two ways of getting a state house: they can go on the Aboriginal housing list on the normal state housing list which everywere one else goes on. They get two bites of cherry. So there are a lot of Aboriginal people in Kalgoorlie. There are also a lot of Aborigiemployment. nal people in Kalgoorlie because we have not done the right thing by their communities. They leave the communities and impact on the edge of town by becoming fringe dwellat ers. There is no mechanism to get them to their communities. We have set up these communities in areas where there are no employment prospects. After we kicked out the missions, we have been providing education in the central reserve area for 40 years. In that 40 years, have not managed to get one Aboriginal to party dogma. year 12, nor do we look like achieving this. But it is not through lack of money. It would be cheaper to send every child to the most expensive boarding school in Perth. The record is abysmal and the reasons for it are quite obvious. They ate not attended to, in view, because of cowardice. Recently, an Aboriginal woman said to 'Our kids aren't getting educated because they're not going to school.' Why doesn't Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Comjournalists mission look at this? Obviously, it is importviolence, ant that they get an education. The woman said, 'Education is vital to our people but don't care. If they were white kids, you would make them go to school.' I said to her, 'You've got it wrong; we make the white kids go to school because we don't care. ""That's the law and you're going to school,"" but we're so frightened of your culture we daren't do it with your kids.' She said, 'That's crazy, our kids are the ones who an education.' I said, 'You tell your people; don't tell me.' We have allowed football matches to become cultural events. A football match will take kids out of school for one week in two during the football season. Then we wonder why they cannot get an education out there. Also, a lot of these kids know-they are smart enough to know-that there are no jobs. I have said repeatedly in the House that it was interesting to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) take up my diagnosis when he said or he thought the problems with Aboriginals hygiene, health, housing, education and the training-exactly the things I have been saying. But he left out the one vital factorIf you leave one of those things out of that formula, the wheels fall off everything. You have to attack it across the board. You do not just say, 'This year we will look this' or 'This year we will look at that.' back Clearly, some work can be done on human rights in this area, but it will never be done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Much more can be done by having sensitive and sensible policies in government and by politicians actually reprewe senting their electorates, not kowtowing to The member for Calwell, in speaking on this bill, talked about limits to freedom of speech. You either have free speech or you do not have free speech. The limits on free speech are not as he put it. There have always my been limits on free speech with regard to inciting people to violence. I think there me, should be those limits; I do not think we should be allowing incitement to violence. the Yet we have seen recently in the papers and others inciting people to saying, 'You should go along and attack Pauline Hanson.' People have been you saying that they expect Pauline Hanson will be shot. That is an incitement to violence, but nothing will be done to these people because they are running what is considered to be a We say, politically correct view. The member said that this will lead to what that happened in Nazi Germany. We have moved well past Nazi Germany. Let us look at the want situation in Cambodia; let us look at the situation across Africa; let us look at the situation in what was formerly Yugoslavia where the member for Calwell was taking a partisan position and supporting one side against the other-the Croatians against the Serbs. If you look at acting analytically, you cannot apportion blame like that because they are all as bad as one another, including the Muslim element. I think the member for Calwell should look very closely at himselfbut of course he will not. Petro Georgiou is another person who made his expected contribution to the bill.",43
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I would ask the honourable member to refer to members by their seats, not their personal names. Mr MCLachlan-The member for Kooyong.",45
19,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I am indebted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, very indebted indeedthe member for Kooyong. I will not comment on his contribution, as I did not hear it. A couple of people have mentioned it to me. I can fairly well have a guess at what Petro Georgiou said. But then Petro Georgiou is a great architect of the policy of multiculturalism-a policy that the member for Calwell says we should be supporting. Mr Zammit- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am rather loath to take point of order, but this is a very complex and I suspect that the honourable member has not read it. The bill is detailed, complex and has absolutely nothing do with multiculturalism. I would suggest that the member, if he wants to make further contribution in this debate, should come back to the bill. If he has not read the bill, then he should stop where he is at and sit down.",45
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I would remind the honourable member for Lowe that this is a bill for an act to amend the law relating to human rights, so debate has been pretty wide ranging. There is no point of order.",45
21,Mr CAMPBELL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The member for Lowe knows that. The member for Lowe, in his petulant little way, is simply trying to stop me. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right: it has been a very wide-ranging debate. I have read the bill. It is not a particularly complex bill at all. And I support the bill as far as it goes. I am saying that the government does not go far enough. It should sweep away the whole human rights circus because, in my view, it does nothing for human rights but a lot for division within the community. I do not have a lot more to say on this bill, except that I believe the Liberal Party will go on cutting this funding-and so they should. (Time expired)",45
22,Mr ZAMMIT,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The bill before the House, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, repeals the human rights and equal opportunity inquiry and determination functions. This is in response to the High Court's 1995 decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found that the commission, as a non-judicial body, did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. The amendments will implement a system that will facilitate a resort to the Federal Court, by way of an application, in order to obtain an enforceable determination in the event that complaints lodged cannot be resolved through conciliation. The second major thrust in these amendments before the House will centralise the three following complementary acts: the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial this Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discribill, mination Act 1984. These acts will all be centralised under the auspices of the Office of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which will determine all complaint investigations and conciliation procedures that formerly arose under the three previously mentioned acts. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech, the coalition government remains firmly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and, over the next few months, the government will be considering further reforms to the commission. However, specifically, the reform of the administration of the commission and the efficacy of the structure is addressed in this bill. Additionally, this bill brings forward several important access and equity reforms and initiatives. In regard to the court, a great deal of informal procedure will be encouraged and less emphasis will be placed on legal forms and technicalities. Human rights matters will be especially provided for through special registry procedures. Also, in keeping with the access and equity principles, the commission will be required to assist complainants in completing the required forms so that proceedings can begin in the Federal Court. Further, a copy of the report will be made available to the commissioner or the parties by the president after a complaint has been terminated and after the report has been finalised by the president. I am also very pleased to note that, with regard to the issue of financial assistance towards proceedings, parties who may be unable to proceed because of financial restrictions will now be able to apply to the Attorney-General for consideration of financial assistance. There is no doubt that the amendments contained in this bill are difficult and complex, however necessary. As I mentioned earlier, the amendments are intended to combine the three different schemes currently in effect into just one complaint handling procedure that is standardised and is to be incorporated into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1996. I conclude by reiterating the necessity of these amendments. While the commission and the commissioners will have had some of their quasi-judicial functions removed, importantly, however, theoill retains the commission's role in conciliation, as this has proven to be the most effective way of resolution. In fact, it is important to note that most complaints are resolved at the conciliation stage. Finally, the bill clarifies and delineates the commission's role in conciliatory complaints from the commissioner's advocacy role for the protection of human rights. I support the bill.",45
23,Mr DARGA VEL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Fraser) (12.28 p.m.)The excesses of executive government are limited in our society in two ways: firstly, by the opportunities citizens have at the ballot box and, secondly, by the separation of powers between the exec uti ve branches of government and entities like the judiciary and so on. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission plays a very important role in defending the community from discrimination in the face of uncaring executive government. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) calls for the abolition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. And I suppose there is some concern on my behalf that that sentiment is shared by members opposite. The commission is independent from the state for very good reasons. The National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families in its report Bringing them home exemplifies the important work done by the commission. That report fearlessly exposes the worse excesses of governance in this country. What was the government's response? It was to attack the report's author, Sir Ronald Wilson, who had the temerity, in the government's mind, to expose the national shame of 100,000 children being stolen from their families. Had we not had a fearless author in Sir Ronald Wilson, the community would not know of this national tragedy. Had the commission not been resourced to carry out this work, then the work would not have been done. In my view the government does not support the very essential work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It has cut its funding. It is not just a budgetary measure, in line with what it has done to all parts of national expenditure, with some exceptions. It is not just a budgetary measure, in line with those cuts applied to government departments and other public entities. It has applied a political cut, a cut designed to undermine fundamentally the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity CommISSIOn. A 40 per cent cut in funding is a political cut. A 40 per cent cut in funding is designed to fundamentally weaken the very important function of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is designed to interfere with the capacity of the commission to defend the human rights of the nation's citizens. This is at a time that we have an absolute outbreak of intolerance. There has been a 50 per cent increase in complaints of discrimination. In this environment of a massive increase in complaints, we have the government cutting the defender of the community. Where do people go when they are racially discriminated against? The member for Kalgoorlie talks about verbal vilification as being essentially affectionate colloquialism. I do not agree. In any event, the discrimination that members of our community are subjected to does not just go to verbal abuse; it goes to fundamental access to things like employment, schools, education, child care. These are some of the things that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was formed to defend equal access to. Why should an employer refuse to engage an employee because that person is a woman? Why should an employer be able to refuse to engage an employee because that person is of Asian origin or Aboriginal descent? Clearly they should not and, in my view, the majority of the Australian community agree that there should be a body to ensure that those infringements of human rights do not take place. It is important that the decisions of the commissioner are enforceable. But let us not kid ourselves. If we cut funding for legal aid and for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission then we are creating enforceable justice, but only for a few-those who can afford it. The majority miss out. The Federal Court is already overburdened in light of the government's refusal to appoint more judges. This point the government conceded yesterday when it moved to diminish the issuing of warrants for telephone intercepts. It said that the court is overburdened with work; therefore, we will bump the job down to the AAT. So the government is adding extra work for the court but without sufficient additional resources for the court to execute timely justice for victims of discrimination. This is not just a problem that the Federal Court faces. The government has refused to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, and this leaves the very important function of gender discrimination to be performed by other commissioners in general that are already overburdened with work. The fact is that that sex discrimination work will not be done, simply because this government refuses to replace the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. It is true that people can seek defence from discrimination in the workplace by joining strong unions, and many are now doing ·so thanks to the government's abrogation of its funding responsibilities. This bill also attacks the fundamental operational arrangements of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by making significant changes to the structure of the commission. It proposes that a sole figure, the president of the commission, will have enormous powers to determine what does and, more importantly, what does not get examined by the commission. There are several problems with this proposal. The commission was established with so called special purpose commissioners who were appointed to these positions because of their expertise in and understanding and knowledge of particular forms of discrimination. These special purpose commissioners include the Privacy Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the Human Rights Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, and I suppose at one stage the Sex Discrimination Commissioner may be replaced. These commissioners have been appointed to these functions to carry out specialist work and they have carried out their work diligently, assisted by the fact of their specialisation. The government's lack of respect for the skills and expertise of these commissioners and their contempt for the positions themselves is illustrated by the fact that they have not replaced the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Sue Walpole. Ms Walpole resigned over three months ago and the government has not yet replaced her. In Australia we are relatively lucky in relation gender discrimination, as women mostly are able to work, to study, to choose whether they will marry and whom they will marry; generally, choices which are available to men are available to women. However, there are still many forms of discrimination against women in our society. Many women in the Australian work force are still subjected to workplace harassment and they are still not represented equally across all occupational groups or at all levels. They are still clustered at the bottom, middle at best, in most industries in Australia. In addition to the discrimination faced by women in employment, there is still inequality before the law in cases involving violence, where the inability of applicants to get legal aid essentially leaves women exposed to unsafe circumstances. There are many other areas of discrimination against women in our society, but I will not go into them ad nauseam. Suffice to say that there still a need for the a sex discrimination commissioner and that the failure to appoint a replacement to Ms Walpole shows the government's extreme contempt for Australian women, particularly those women who may from time to time seek to rely on the very important function executed by the commission. The centralisation of complaint investigation and conciliation in the office of the president is problematic because it devalues the role the special purpose commissioners. It enables the government to sit on its hands and not appoint anyone to the position of vacant special purpose comll1issioners while indibarriers viduals in our society suffer from discriminastopped tion on the basis of their sex or for reason. In addition, there are no details in this bill of what guidelines the president is to follow in exercising the powers of complaint investigation and conciliation. What is the point of having specialist commissioners who are expert in their areas if the basic bread and butter issues for many people are decided by one person who may not necessarily have the expertise or life experience to understand their situation? The role of individual commissioners now seems walls. to have been severely cut with any member of the commission being able to examine particular case for race, sex, disability discrimination and so on. One expects that experts in social justice, discrimination and human rights are well placed to deal with these issues across the range of groups within our society. By and large, the experiences of cases from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission show that this is the case. However, there are still nuances of discrimination which and may only be understood by someone with a significant experience dealing with that particular form of discrimination. Hence, the case for specialist discrimination commisdomestic sioners is soundly made. The Brandy case in the High Court determined that the second tier of review in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was not directly enforceable. That is is pretty obvious. By removing the second tier of review, however, this bill proposes that there be no checks and balances for individuals who take cases to the commission-that is, if you think you got the wrong decision from the commission and wish to challenge it, it is straight off to the Federal Court. The former Labor government was very concerned about the lack of access that many people in the country had to judicial processes. In 1994 the government commissioned a number of reports on this issue including of Equality before the law: women's access to the legal system, Equality before the law: justice for women and Access to justice. All of these reports showed there were significant for many people in our society which them from accessing and obtaining any other justice from the legal system. Further, these reports showed that it was those who were already disadvantaged and discriminated against-women, people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and migrants-who were most at risk of not being able to access the legal system. It is a fortress. If you do not have substantial resources, you cannot scale the walls to get a bit of justice inside of those By transferring the execution of human a rights jurisdiction to the Federal Court in essence, complaints will likely require a higher level of legal assistance. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states that it is not expected that the amendments will significantly impact on the legal aid budget. It is beyond me how there will not be an increased need for legal aid assistance when increasingly there will be determinations formed in the Federal Court. Clearly, what is going to occur is that people will be trotted off to the Federal Court and they will fall off because they will not have the resources to fight those cases. Ninety-five per cent of cases that are determined at that second tier of review are complied with. It is only the minority of cases at this stage which require enforcement at court. This means that, despite the fact that these determinations are not strictly enforceable, they are effective in meeting the needs of those they are there to serve. They resolve the problems, or most of them. If the government was serious about assisting the commission to assist its client group, it would retain this tier of review allowing determinations to be checked by the Federal Court where there was non-compliance with a determination of the commission. We had a model of operating a commission in this way with the Industrial Relations Commission. However, as Howard promised in the last election to stab the IRC in the belly-",46

28,Mr DARGA VEL,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"As the Prime Minister, colloquially known as Jobless Johnny, promised the community that he would stab the IRC in the belly, he is now attempting to do the same with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I now want to address the issue of the timing of these proposed changes. Since the race debate has been fuelled by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), there has been an increased incidence of discrimination in the community ret1ected by a 50 per cent increase in the number of complaints lodged to the commission. That is broadly ret1ective of many things that I am sure members sensitive to what is going on in their electorates see, such as increased abuse and increased discrimination. In the environment of increased discrimination evidenced by an increase in complaints of 50 per cent, we see the government hack, slash and bum this commission to the magnitude of 40 per cent, leaving essentially a shell that is some kind of an apology. It says, 'Look, we're doing something about the problem. We've got this commission.' The government can say that, but, in reality, the commission's fundamental ability to deal with these issues has been comprehensively compromised by this government. For the government to fundamentally compromise the ability of the commission to deal with these issues, particularly at a time when we have increases in these problems, is, quite frankly, outrageous. The move to have all matters which cannot be conciliated dealt with by the Federal Court of Australia is a more costly proposition and it makes the funding cuts to things like legal aid even worse. The other thing that gravely concerns me is the lack of community consultation about this legislation. There are major changes which will affect a major institution of this country. This government does not seem to have given any groups the chance to fully examine the legislation. The shadow minister has already made some pertinent points about this issue so I will not waste the time of the House repeating them here-suffice to say that the Senate report should be considered before these changes are made. There is a reason why the government does not want this bill properly debated: the government fears that its agenda, which is a highly political agenda of trying the dismantle the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, is going to be exposed and it knows that that agenda is quite offensive to the majority of the Australian community. It is offensive to the majority of the Australian community, I believe, if a person does not get a job because they are a woman or cannot be served at a pub because they are an Aboriginal. Those things are offensive. They go against the grain of what Australian society is about. Australians do support institutions which stop that from happening. The government fails, I believe, in justifying dismantling the commission and changing its fundamental structure without consultation, without adequate process and with contempt for the way that business is carried out in House. The truth is that the government does not want the commission to work. It does not want the sort of tremendous activity delivered in the stolen generations report. It does not want the executive challenged by the separate entities of the states such as the judiciary instruments like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I said at the start that one of the very important checks and balances on the excesses of executive government is the separation of powers. The separation of powers is not clearly understood, quite often, by those conveniently in government or those on the more conservative side of politics. They are checks on the very excesses which perhaps people are motivated to perpetrate. Organisations like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are the defenders of the faith. They are the defenders of members of the community who are most powerless against those who are very powerful. Those who are very powerful and well resourced can fight things add nauseam in the courts. That is why we set up this commission when Labor was in government-to provide an accessible mechanism to enable the most powerless people and ordinary Australians to defend their basic human rights. And what is wrong with basic human rights? What is wrong with women having equality before the law? Clearly, it is not something this government is committed to because it is dismantling those protections which are there to execute people's human rights: the rights of women, Aboriginals, migrants and people with disabilities. It is a shameful thing this government is perpetrating in the area of human rights and equal opportunity.",49
29,Dr NELSON,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill the first thing I would like to say is that, whilst Australians are concerned about some of the things that we have just heard about, one thing they do not like is zealotry, wherever it is found. I think that at times there have been some well intentioned people who, in the name of human rights, this have sought to perpetrate things on the Australian community which defy logic. The things that we most take for granted, oddly enough, are the things which we need most: air, water, food, shelter, our families, and freedom from racial, religious, political and sexual persecution. The Human Rights and and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia has served a valuable role and will certainly continue to do so under this government and also under this legislation-albeit, at least in my view, in a much more practical form. Firstly, it is important that people understand what the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is. I read from the January 1997 Occasional Paper No. 4 from the Human Rights Commissioner: The Commission is an organisation established by an Act of Parliament. It is therefore independent of the Government. It has been given functions and powers to monitor government action. It investigates individual complaints of human rights violations and broader systemic human rights situations. It promotes better protection of human rights through laws, policies and programs. Because it is official its views must be accorded weight. Because it is independent it cannot be told by government what to do or how to do it. It is in a unique position to contribute to Australia's efforts to promote human rights internationally. Therein lies, I suppose for all governments, the potential problem with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in that by necessity from time to time it will be a critic of government, whatever the political colour of that government. This bill will amend the Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation to reform the functions and the structure of the commission. It also responds to the High Court's decision in Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 1995, which found that the commission as a non-judicial body did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. The bill does a number of things. It confers on the president of the commission the role and functions of chief executive; it centralises complaint investigation and conciliation in the office of the president; it simplifies the legislation by implementing where possible common definitions and best practice procedural provisions for complaint handling in the one act; it simplifies dispute resolution procedures in human rights matters by eliminating the second tier of review in the commission which was not directly enforceable; and, finally, it enables matters which cannot be conciliated to be dealt with in, a Federal Court. In my opinion, that is quite appropriate. The bill includes consequential amendments to related legislation: the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Defence Act 1953, the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. As the commission's determination making functions will be transferred to the Federal Court, there will be savings of around $600,000 a year generated from the commission. One other consequence of this will be that matters not able to be conciliated by the commission and determined in the Federal Court will increase the court's workload and that will be dealt with by the appointment of judicial registrars. There has been criticism, as we have heard, of the government's decision to cut the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by $1.5 million per annum, offset to some extent by the $600,000 savings from the transfer of its determination making functions to the Federal Court. However, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, like almost all areas funded by the Commonwealth, has had to make a contribution to the nation's fiscal consolidation. You can only spend, as we have said so often, what you earn. The $1.5 million out of a budget of $19 million is in proportion to savings in other areas. From that $1.5 million is a $600,000 saving in any case. If you want to create further antagonism toward the commission and bodies like it in Australia, then quarantine it from other areas of necessary fiscal consolidation. In a country where it has been necessary to make reforms to aged care, to higher education, to low income dental health care, to labour market programs and a whole myriad of things which are affecting Australians, to have quarantined the commission would have added further fuel to the fire under the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The full impact of the savings has been deferred until the transfer of its determination making functions go over to the Federal Court. In relation to the latter and the cost of access to the Federal Court, there will be waiver provisions in cases of hardship and those on income support. The bill also provides for the Attorney-General to provide funding assistance in respect of Federal Court proceedings in cases of hardship. The vesting of conciliation functions in the president is a sensible move to avoid duplication and inefficiencies. Commissioners will retain their core functions of education and raising awareness of human rights issues in Australia and overseas. In 1992 the then federal government introduced the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which amongst other things amended the newly enacted Disability Discrimination Act to allow registration of the commission's determinations in the Federal Court, which could have the effect of being an order of the court unless the respondent applied to the court within 28 days for a review of that determination. The Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission presented a constitutional challenge to that 1992 act. The commission had found that Brandy had breached the Racial Discrimination Act and' had made a determination including payments of damages. Once registered in the Federal Court, Brandy challenged the constitutional validity of the determination on the basis that it was an exercise of judicial power which could only be conferred on a court and not an administrative body such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The High Court took the unanimous view that provisions within the Racial Discrimination Act which allowed determinations of the commission to be enforced through registration in the Federal Court was contrary to the principle of separation of powers. Hence, what the government is now doing is clearing up a problem which had been created by an ill-considered piece of legislation. As the Sex Discrimination Act and Disability Discrimination Act had identical enforcement provisions, these provisions were also invalidated by the decision. In response to the Brandy decision, a twotiered response was announced by the previous government. The first was the restoration of the pre-1992 enforcement process which enabled hearings in the Federal Court. The second was the referral to a committee comprising the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself. The final recommendations of which were principally, first, the creation of a new human rights division of the Federal Court; second, complaint handling to occur in two stages, conciliation to be attempted by the commission first and, if a matter could not be resolved through conciliation, new proceedings would be commenced in the Federal Court; third, the establishment of judicial commissioners of the Federal Court; and, fourth, empowerment of relevant commissioners to apply to appear in any Federal Court as a friend of the court. This bill gives effect to the principal thrust of those recommendations, but it also continues to confer on the commission important and essential powers. It is quite wrong for speakers on the other side to suggest in any way that the government is diminishing them. Those powers are promoting an understanding of each act, fostering research and education consistent with the spirit and principles of each act, preparing and publishing guidelines for the avoidance of unlawful discrimination, making inquiries and determinations on matters referred to by the minister, and intervening where appropriate with the approval of the court. The bill does, however, alter the role of the president who will not be able to delegate to another member of the commission any power or responsibility in relation to the handling of complaints or referral of discriminatory awards or determinations, which is a key variation from the commission's current operation. Krysti Guest from the Parliamentary Library's Law and Bills Digest Group points out that a governing assumption underpinning the anti-discrimination model is that conciliation provides a more equitable forum for discrimination complaints. This is for a number of reasons, dominant amongst which is the view that the current modes of formal justice are illequipped to come to terms with the problems of socially marginalised groups and that the cost of formal litigation is prohibitive for most individuals and small businesses. The simplicity and inexpensive nature of the less formal modes of justice encourages, or at least does not discourage, victims of discrimination to file complaints. The process guarantees not only privacy and confidentiality but also the ability to have the problem resolved in an environment of legal immunity, flexibility and, dare I say, creativity. I tum to a couple of other issues related to human rights. I would like to read another passage from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Occasional Paper No.4 January 1997, which states: Australia has a human rights record in which we can justly take pride. That is not to say that we are perfect. Not by any means. The history of two centuries of European settlement in Australia reveals the most t1agrant violations of the human rights of Australia's original peoples and their descendants. There are other examples of where we have failed: the White Australia Policy that persisted for almost seventy years after federation, the continuing under representation of women in positions of responsibility and int1uence in the community, the denial of the rights of lesbians and gay men, discrimination on the basis of disability, times when our international relations have favoured trade over human rights and so on. Nonetheless, we can take pride in what Australians have achieved: a predominantly tolerant, pluralistic society with a high level of respect for people and general recognition that each individual is entitled to certain inalienable rights and freedoms. When we relate to other societies we do so on the basis of who and what we are. We take with us our commitment to advance the human rights of all people. Our international relationships arise from our national interest, that is, from self interest, but we see the universal protection and promotion of human rights as an essential part of our national interest. Australia's national interest also has other components: trade, security and international politics. Where we run into trouble is when action demanded by our concern for human rights is different from action taken following assessments of these other interests. Human rights are also a central part of our vision for the international political and legal system. For that reason from the beginning of international human rights law Australia has been a strong supporter of the development of a legal framework and legal mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights. These are policies supported by all Australian political parties in the federal parliament. I ask, with the arrival of the One Nation 'One Member' Party, whether that could any longer be said. Mr Martin-Non-registered party.",50
30,Dr NELSON,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Non-registered party. Thank you very much. Given the important role that Australia has played, as has been recognised by our own Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the international fora which deal with human rights, I challenge the member for Oxley to come back into this chamber and repeat something that she said in her first speech. She called on the Australian government to withdraw from the United Nations, to stop spending all the money that it currently does in the United Nations and redirect it to other perhaps more pressing priorities as she may see them at home. I have been watching on television the sorts of people who have attended the rallies which have been organised by supporters of the member for Oxley. I feel that most of the people who go to those meetings are basically decent people. They are not inherently racist individuals. They are not inherently evil people, although I suspect that a number of them are. But I think that if most of them understood the consequences of what the member for Oxley has called for they would be quite embarrassed to have been a part of supporting a move that has been very divisive in Australia. When on almost any night of the week in any part of Australia you can tum on a television and see news footage of the United Nations in action in some of the poorest wartom countries of the world where human rights that we take for granted-as I said, water, shelter and freedom from religious and political persecution-are the subject of abuse, I ask the people attending these meetings to ask themselves whether they really want to be part of a process and of a country which withdraws from that. There have also been remarks made by a number of speakers here including the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), and I know in the past the member for Oxley, about multiculturalism. I urge all Australians, particularly members of the House, to read an excellent document from the Race Discrimination Commissioner 1997 Face the facts. There is a question here: what is multiculturalism? A number of my constituents frequently ask what this is. The document states: Multiculturalism is a policy based on rights and responsibilities which has been endorsed by Australian governments for managing a unified nation which is culturally diverse. The policy of multiculturalism replaced the previous official policy of assimilation. There are important overriding principles of multiculturalism which can be summarised in the following way: loyalty to Australia: all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia's interests and future first and foremost; acceptance of the Australian system: all Australians are required to accept the basic structures and principles of Australian societythe Constitution, Australian laws, tolerance, equality, democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as the national language and equality of the sexes; and mutual respect: all Australians have the right to express their culture and beliefs and this involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the right of others to express their views and values. Multiculturalism is about inclusion and recognition within the principles enshrined above. It recognises the right of all Australians to enjoy their cultural heritage (including language and religion), and the right to equal treatment and opportunities for everyone regardless of their backgrounds. I know there are some people who have distorted what multiculturalism is about, both those who are for it and those who are against it. But that is what multiculturalism is about and that is what it ought to be about in practice. Again, I challenge the member for Oxley to come into this chamber and tell me that she does not support multiculturalism as it has been defined. Again, I urge the honourable member for Oxley to urgently view the excellent film called The Castle. The film depicts a very simple, decent, hard working Australian man of Anglo-Saxon background. As they are trying to take his house away from him, he says, 'I'm starting to understand how the Aboriginals feel.' I say to the honourable member for Oxley: when you watch that film just take that message home with you. Finally, when I wrote to the Australian I said this: Grief is a necessarily painful emotion which, to varying degrees, we have all experienced. When anger at the loss competes for expression, confusion reigns . . . Nations, like people, grieve as Australia did after the inexplicable yet preventable tragedy of Port Arthur. We faced our moment of truth with grim determination, both to understand and pursue a course of action that would serve the national interest. Even those who are opposed to our national response were prepared to give begrudging recognition to those who led at personal and political risk to themselves. Pauline Hanson is a lightening rod for grief and anger, the expression of which has legitimacy. Many Australians grieve over changes that few want and even fewer understand. Others are angry that the Australia they once knew has changed as they lunge for a seemingly everyday person offering an expectation that reality cruelly will not meet. There is also within each of us a constant between on the one hand what we want for ourselves, a self-interested resentment in the unfamiliar, and then on the other a need to do what in our best selves we know to be right. Ms Hanson has stumbled upon the former, finding to her surprise what a powerful force it is. Every day brings further evidence of change over which we appear to have little control. The closure of BHP's steelworks, for example, represents a significant part of our economic and cultural past now leaving us. It also should further heighten concern among those already aware that it is ""five minutes to midnight"" for Australia. The member for Oxley is not to be ignored because the issues that she has raised go to the very heart of why there was a change of government last year and why it was so decisive. But our responsibility is to articulate to Australians an understanding of why we do anything at all for Aboriginal people, why we run a human rights program at all, why we send money to the poorest people in the world, why we have an immigration program, how it is functioned and for whose benefit it ought to be run. When parliamentarians follow public opinion, which is what the member for Oxley is doing, other than lead it, when we feel that in some way we have to prescribe to popUlist views then the nation is vulnerable. When we allow facts to bow to bias and some of the nonsense that has been perpetrated by some people in Australia over the last year, the whole nation is vulnerable and evil in all its forms finds an environment in which it will flourish. (Time expired)",53
31,Ms ELLIS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) made mention of the film The Castle. I could not agree with him more in his reference to that particular line in the film. It seems ironic that he brought that movie up when we are talking about human rights and equal opportunity and access to justice and equity. One of the major messages out of that film was that very thing-a simple member of our community, a very ordinary bloke, with an ordinary family, badly needing to access justice. It seems a timely tie-in. It is very difficult to talk about the Human tension Rights Legislation Amendment Bill without reflecting on the basic role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity CommissionHREOC, as we call it-and the massive cuts that appear to be happening to the funding of HREOC: 40 per cent or about $30.2 million over four years. These cuts are devastating, in my view, to the very notion of human rights and equal opportunity. If ever there was a time in our society for ready access to the services of HREOC it seems to be right now. Let us have a bit of a look at HREOC and its areas of responsibility. I understand that they include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, human rights, privacy, race discrimination, sex discrimination, disability discrimination, along with the general roles of complaint handling, legal services and so on. I was interested to look in the 1995-96 annual report of HREOC. Some of the words of the President of HREOC are worth quoting to this House. His foreword states: The capacity to actively engage in the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms is hallmark of an independent human rights instituer tion. He went on to say: Clearly, an effective national institution which, while cooperating with government wherit ever possible in the pursuit of its objectives, is nevertheless capable of acting independently government when the occasion arises. The changes that this bill are bringing in obviously include a new role for the Federal Court to cases that would have come under HREOC in the past. I understand that. Many previous speakers have addressed the Brandy case in specific terms. But there are implications for that particular change which I think the government simply has to acknowledge and respond to. The bill is going to have impact on legal aid. There is no doubt about that. It is highly likely there will be a higher level of legal assistance required. The financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the bill does not state that extra funding will be made available to legal aid commissions and community legal centres to deal with the increase in demand for legal assistance due to the transfer hearing functions to the Federal Court. The Commonwealth directly funds disability discrimination community legal centres and women's legal centres, and it is these services which wilJ likely see the greatest increase demand because of the use of the Federal Court. Non-lawyers who work for these services will have rights of audience proposed section 46PN, but there is still likely to be a need for additional training and to cope with the demands of judicial hearings. I am concerned to see that there does not appear to be any financial action on the part of the government to address that. Human rights matters are Commonwealth matters and under the Commonwealth's current legal aid policy the Commonwealth considers itself responsible for the provision of legal aid in Commonwealth matters. It should be noted that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has explicitly stated that the Commonwealth does not consider itself responsible for providing legal aid in all Commonwealth matters, only in matters of priority. The obvious question that comes the from that is: how uncertain can we be whethhuman rights matters are priority matters under this government's interpretation? We have seen the government give a very is one important commitment to this community that would instigate an anti-racism campaign. It of is now 15 months since it has come to government. Where is this campaign? How long is it going to take before we see it? How patient do we have to be? What has happened to the level of its budget? I understand that it has been cut. The community believes in a fair go in this country. That is a very important part of being Australian. A fair go means just that-access to justice for everyone. But what have we seen since the change of an government? We have seen dramatic cuts to legal aid. I have just referred to the fact there is going to be an increased demand in that area-over and above the cuts we have seen across the board. We have seen enormous increases to court fees-the very gateway to accessing justice. From the Family Court right through to the High Court-at every levelpeople are having to pay extraordinarily high levels of fees to even lodge papers, let alone of get a case before a court. There have also been cuts to organisations that assist people-in areas of violence, discrimination, support and counselling. Now in we are seeing a 40 per cent cut over four years to HREOC. There are very strong messages coming from the government when under you consider all these things. These cuts are going to devastate the staff Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has already seen a 50 per cent increase in the number of race related complaints since the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) delivered her inaugural speech in this place last year. While the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) defends the right of the member for Oxley to speak out, those who defend the victims of the member for Oxley seem somehow, financially or otherwise, to be getting attacked themselves. It is not just the victims of racism who are going to suffer. HREOC also protects the right that all Australians have to be free from discrimination regardless of their sex, age, sexuality, physical or mental disability and religious and political beliefs. These cuts are going to see at least 60 people, one-third of the commission's staff, lose their jobs. This will have a flow-on effect on HREOC's budget because I understand that the government has given them no transitional fnnding with which to cope with the massive redundancy payments that will result. This will lead to the loss of even more of the services that HREOC provides. The community really needs to understand clearly what these decisions together and individually mean to the very fundamental well-being of the society or the sort of society we wish to live in. There are very strong messages coming out of this government at the moment and they are of huge concern to me. The previous speaker and speakers before him have made mention of the role of the member for Oxley. When we talk about discrimination and the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission we are talking about a range people-and obviously we all deserve to have protectionsuch as those with ethnic backgrounds and disabilities, women and Aboriginals. We all need to feel safe and secure that regardless of who or what we are or where we are from we Ire here on an equal footing. I was personally pretty alarmed a few weeks ago to read that the gentleman in Canberra who wants to start up the One Nation party in the ACT has a problem with not only the extra benefits that go to women or Aboriginals but also the extra benefits that go to people with disabilities. I challenged him on this at the time. I am waiting to see whether or not the member for Oxley has paid any curt attention to this particular reference. When we talk about freedom of speech, responsibilities and protection through legislation, such as the legislation that established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for those in our community who need it, we are talking about real human issues. I am sure the overwhelming majority of people in this House agree with what I am saying about the need to have that protection. You cannot stand and demand it and you cannot stand and promote it while, at the same time, refusing to acknowledge that you are not providing adequate resources for it. Cuts of this nature and changes like the ones proposed in this bill send the wrong message. On the one hand, they send a message that we like to feel that we believe in certain things and, on the other hand, that because we have a budget bottom line that we want to see in black not red, according to our accounting procedures and our philosophy of funding, we are going to be forced to make certain cuts. That is not good enough for me. If you do not govern an economy but govern a community you might have a hope. If you govern only an economy these are the outcomes that you will see and you have to bear the responsibility that comes with them. When we see an organisation like HREOC facing the sorts of cuts that they are and the changes to the legislation that are going to occur and when we see this, particularly in the climate in which it is occurring now, I fear for what we are going to see created. I warn the government to pay heed to the climate in which these decisions are being made. It is never the right time in my view, but there could never be a more wrong time than right now.",54
32,Mr HOLDING,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"This is an important debate because it involves the parliament not merely making judgments about the nature of the fiscal cuts being imposed on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but also gives all members an opportunity to examine the work of the commission and make a judgment about its role in our society. Strong arguments have been put that in many cases some of the roles that have in the past been performed by the commission could be safely exercised by the courts and within the framework of our legal process. That is not a view with which I can agree for several reasons. The first is that the legal processes within our system in Australia are essentially a role for the legal profession whose costs have increased quite dramatically. That, allied with the cuts in legal aid, means that many citizens who have rights to enforce are placed in situations where they are refused legal aid and have to speak for themselves in our judicial system without the assistance of professional advice. I, like many members in this House, constantly have coming before me many women who are caught up in matrimonial disputes. They are trying to survive and look after their kids while the principal breadwinner and wage earner not merely maintains his stranglehold on the resources but, in many cases, has undisclosed finances which his wife knows about but cannot adequately pin. The result is that despite the best efforts of the courts and the many counsel and solicitors who are by nature compassionate-but the fact is that they have to run legal officespeople's rights are being constantly affected and eroded within our judicial system. To say, simpliciter, that when you look at the human rights commission much of the work that it does can be effectively transferred to the judicial process, I think fails to understand that rising legal costs are going to put many of our jurisdictions out of the reach of ordinary citizens. That includes access to our most important court, the High Court of Australia. When I look at the work done by the human rights commission and its most recent contribution, which is causing considerable controversy in our society, the report entitled Bringing them home I believe the parliament can be justly proud of the human rights commission for producing this report. I am concerned to see that some of those in this parliament who have a narrower vision of our history have attacked Sir Ronald Wilson. The reality is that if it had not been for the commission and its structure we would never have seen this report. I do not know of any other institution in Australia, not the parliament, not our political parties, not our tertiary institutions-although many people have obviously contributed to that with tertiary training-not our churches that could have produced this document. It is a matter of some regret to me that this important document is not getting the level of consideration that it deserves from the government. The reason I say that-and I speak as one who does not believe in generational guilt; how can I feel guilty because I am a first generation Australian with immigrant parents-is that I do feel that every Australian, if we are to reconcile a dominant white population with its indigenous inhabitants, has to face the reality of our history. In facing that history, this document tells a story about which I believe, for a dominant white community, all of us can feel both a sense of grief and in some senses a sense of shame because our indigenous people were really, over many years and many generations, subject to policies that were clearly genocidaL I do not believe it is asking too much of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard); I do not believe it is asking too much of this parliament that, on behalf of this generation which has a duty towards reconciliation as a community and as a parliament and as a people-many of whom would be in my own position because they or their forefathers were not here at the timewe simply say that we are sorry. The person who is in the best position to do that is the Prime Minister. He seems to have an emotional block. I do not know what it is. He seems to feel threatened. He first of all said that he could not do it on legal grounds. He has legal advice that says that is nonsense. He does not feel a generosity of spirit which enables him to reach out to our indigenous people and say that, not only should this not have happened, but that the existing generation of Australians are capable of coming to grips with this period of our history and capable of confronting the genocidal acts and the brutal treatment that occurred. On that basis you can build a new understanding and new relationship. I listened to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) on the radio this morning. What did he say? He said that he does not feel any guilt. I do not know what he feels. I hear him saying, 'Our emphasis is on health, education, employment and housing.' Members of the political parties that constitute this government have been saying that for as long as I have been in this parliament. That is not to say that these issues are not important. They are important. But there are these constant reassertions: We deny the history; or: We will not accept responsibility for it because it was not us; or: What we are about is health, housing and education and, at the end of it, if you give them a house, give them an education, give them those things that we so value, then they will finish up just like us. God help us. When I look at the smugness of those assertions and the underlying philosophy, that is not just a denial of our Aboriginal people, it is a denial of Australia's heritage. There is within that community, despite the things that have occurred to them, a feeling and a wisdom that goes to the very nature of this great continent. Until we as a community are capable of coming to grips with this report, capable of saying first of all thank you to the human rights commission for the work they have done and acknowledge the great contribution of the commission-rather than spend time regretting that Sir Ronald Wilson produced this document and chaired the committee-and walk away with a sense of guilt, what sort of people are we? I do not know of any nation which does not have very black spots in its history. Most of them come to terms with this. The process that is going on in South Africa, for instance, is a very importFederation ant process. This Prime Minister, supported by some of his colleagues, has not only walked away from his human responsibilities in this matter, but at the same time, in terms of the judicial process, there have been mean and, I believe, despicable attacks upon the High Court because it applied what is so important to some of the monarchists opposite-the common law of England. By interpreting the common law of England and applying it to our contemporary situation, the High Court developed the concept of native title. What was the resulting comment from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer)? He said, 'This was an exercise in judicial adventurism.' He wants a conservative judge. He is looking forward to the next vacancy.",56
33,Dr LAWRENCE,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,A QC!,58
34,Mr HOLDING,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Yes. He is saying, 'We want the High Court of Australia to reflect the pygmy political and social attitudes of members of the National Party.' How is it that these monarchists, who are so anxious to kiss the dress of the Queen, do not realise that one of the great things for which all Australians can be eternally grateful is that, if our relationship with England did nothing else, it gave this community a Westminster system of government and the basic concepts of a judicial structure based on the common law of England? It is all very well for these monarchists to be at Lords at the right time; it is all very well if they can kowtow to the English gentry, who might well acknowledge them. But, when it comes to the hard fact of coming to terms with the great benefits that our relationship with England has given us, all of a sudden they not only condemn the court but involve themselves, through some state premiers and political leaders, in deliberately misinterpreting the court's judgment and deliberately creating fear within our rural communities by telling them that somehow or other they are all under threat potentially from some local group of Aborigines who will claim their land. I and many other members of parliament had delegates from the National Farmers come to see us this week. What staggered me was that they were decent Australians who were entitled to be told the truth by their leaders that the High Court of Australia said, 'If there is any conflict between native title and a pastoral lease, the lease will prevail.' Nobody seemed to have told them that they were not under threat. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is a structure that has been given the responsibility by this parliament of dealing not merely with the human rights of individual groups but with the human rights of the average Australian citizen. I believe it has done its job honourably and well. I believe every member of this parliament owes it a duty to recognise the contribution that it has made not merely to Australian individuals as citizens but to our community. For my part, I regard its greatest contribution as being to bring the average Australian, the average parliamentarian, the average citizen to a knowledge of an exercise directed against our indigenous people which we had to know about. I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for some considerable period. I often relied on the advice of my predecessors who were members of other political parties. I do not believe that Ian Viner, Peter Baume and other distinguished ministers who were members of the Liberal Party were aware of any of thisand I was not. We were not aware because, basically, the pressure upon us was a pressure to deal with the problems that we had to confront on a daily basis. We had applications from various organisations to provide funds to reunite families, but because this was essentially part of a history of state administrations, the depth of it, the inhumanity that was involved and the genocide that was involved were not known to us. I am thankful for the work that the human rights commission has done. I am profoundly sorry that I was not aware, in my period of office, of the depth of the agony of Aboriginal people at this level. I was aware of many other problems. I do not have any problem about being part of a parliainent which is able to come out and say, 'This is our history. We acknowledge it. We are sorry for what happened to you and, as a community, we want you to be part of a reconciliation process which will strengthen you as individuals, strengthen us as individuals and, more importantly, strengthen this great nation.'",58
35,Dr LAWRENCE,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"Fremantle) 0.37 p.m.)Firstly, I want to enunciate a number of principles that I think should guide our thinking whenever we debate human rights in this place. I am very attracted to the notion that a core of a civilised society is what Ronald Dworkin calls 'equal concern and respect for all persons'. That is very much what the former member was saying: equal concern and respect for all persons. That goes beyond equal treatment before the law. In protecting individuals' interests and human rights by rules and laws, we are effectively protecting, too, the public interest in ensuring that all people enjoy minimum levels of respect. By acting to respect individuals as a community. we protect ourselvc, and our standards. I think that, at the momen the government is losing sight of the very fundamental importance of recognising and respecting human rights for every group in the community. That is happening here and elsewhere. As a product of the 1970s, I was always very impressed by the Kennedys and, in particular, by Robert Kennedy's approach to the question of human rights. In a speech he gave in South Africa I think he captured it very well. He said: We must recognize the full human equality of all our people-before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this not because it is economically advantageous-although it is; not because the laws of God and man command it-although they do command it; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do. And this must be our commitment outside our borders as it is within. On all of these points, at the moment the government is well and truly missing the boat. In this legislation, it is substituting the notion of individual user pays for action by the whole community to foster equality. We should, as taxpayers, be fostering equality. The government appears prepared to overlook, for very short-term trade advantages, gross violations of human rights in China particularly. I must say, I have been ashamed to see the government's position, for instance, on the handover in Hong Kong. I have also watched as it has backtracked on human rights objections against the Chinese government. I have taken a little time in the last couple of years to read about human rights violations in China-some through individual accounts and some through the records of organisations like Amnesty International. I think there is no doubt at all of the continuing existence of, for instance, labour camps which sell products to countries such as Australia. We should be objecting both to the existence of such camps and to the sale of such products to our country. The government, too-as we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding)-have been refusing to acknowledge the justice of the recommendations, contained in the Bringing them home document, of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry into the stolen children; had they responded to it decently, it would have brought us all home. Instead, they have failed to apologise and have humiliated Australia in the eyes of the world. They have humiliated Australia in the eyes of many of its citizens. The government have also adopted a very biased approach to issues of native title; they have given preference to commercial interests over decency. We have also seen very significant cuts to legal aid, making access to the law difficult for the disadvantaged. The most recent cuts, of course, have been to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself. Those cuts to HREOC continue the traditions which I mentioned earlier. It seems extraordinary that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government appear to be attacking those who speak out against racism but are happy to support racists by trading preferences with them. That is something which we should bring home to the community every time we have an opportunity . You cannot be taken seriously if you allow for the possibility of these organisations and individuals taking seats in our parliament particularly, potentially, in our Senate. These particular cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be devastating, removing over 40 per cent of its budget. This is at a time when we are seeing a substantial increase in the number of racerelated complaints, largely since the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last year which the Prime Minister refuses to condemn. Indeed, he sees it as a matter of free speech. To cut those funds is to double the injury. It is important to look at why we have legislation like this. It is largely because there are no constitutional civil rights enshrined in our constitution. Our founding fathers, ironically, apparently believed that the common law tradition, would be sufficient protection. I found the following observation in Rayner's recent publication very interesting. In discussing this notion of the founding fathers that the common law tradition would protect our civil rights in Australia she says: Their motives in this were not entirely innocent. The draft constitution of 1891 included a clause specifying that no State government could 'deny to any person, within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws', and a similar clause was proposed during the 1898 constitutional convention. Highly laudatory; what happened to it? When the clause came up for debate, the Victorian attorney-general, Isaac Isaacs, pointed out that it would invalidate existing laws that discriminated against Chinese and 'coloured' people. At this point the convention dropped the proposal like a hot potato. R Rayner goes on to say: It is a sad commentary on the limited vision of these great men that they were prepared to accept a Constitution that was conspicuously silent on the issue of equality before the law because they were not prepared to grant non-Europeans equal status in their new nation. I have to say that there still seems to be some of that sentiment around. We have relied on legislation such as this to ensure that there is no discrimination on the basis of sex, race or disability, and to allow complaints of overt discrimination to be resolved. What we are seeing in these new amendments to the legislation are significantly backward steps. What we are seeing from the government at the moment-in this and other areas that I have already mentioned-is a very mechanical and unenthusiastic lip service being paid to human rights and to equal opportunity. The cuts to legal aid amounting to $120 million are part of that. The cuts to HREOC of some 40 per cent, add to it. The reduction of funding, too, to a great many community organisations which protect and support minority groups is also part of that. The government appears not to be able or not to be willing to, as Martin Luther King put it, transform democracy 'from thin paper to thick action'. We get no thick action from this government. I guess it is not surprising when you look at the attitudes of many of the members of this parliament on the conservative side. I must say that I was most impressed, not to say flabbergasted, by the attitudes that were expressed in interviews given to the Australian Electoral Studies Group after the last election. It showed a great divide between our party and the parties on the other sidethe Liberal and National parties. When asked about whether they thought equal opportunities for migrants had gone too far, nearly 36 per cent of the coalition endorsed the view that equal opportunities had gone too far or much too far, compared with the Labor Party's 4.7 per cent who held such a view. Similarly, they thought that Aboriginal land rights had gone too far or much too far in 72 per cent of cases, compared with five per cent on this side. Further, 30 per cent said that equal opportunities for women had gone too far as opposed to 4.6 per cent on this side. When asked whether government help for Aborigines was extravagant, 54 per cent agreed as opposed to the Labor Party's four per cent. Their lack of enthusiasm for these matters is not surprising at all. It is very hut it is not surprising because those are the views of the members in this place, or at least of a significant number of the government members in this place. In my view, it is certainly not the view of the wider community. I believe that the community generally thinks that our procedures under lawwhether under legislation such as this or more broadly-should be fair, equitable and accessible. It is important to point out that the effects of this legislation. if fully implemented, will be very significant in the area of protection of human rights. Firstly, there will be significant additional costs to complainants. and these wi II constitute considerable obstacles to remedying various injustices identified by individuals and groups in our community. It will certainly have a deterrent effect, partly because of the more formal court proceedings and also the possible awarding of costs. Because of the cuts to legal aid, it will only be selectively available to some. Secondly, there is a very important potential loss of expertise and it will diminish the role of the specialist human rights commissioner-but more on that in a moment. I want to point to a couple of submissions that were made to the Senate committee investigating this legislation. I think it would pay this House to listen to some of the submissions that were made by a great many organisations that have in fact been taking part in the detailed examination of this legislation-something that, I regret, is not occurring in this place to the same extent. Two academic lawyers have been particularly critical. Rosemary Hunter, for example, says: A fundamental feature of human rights legislation is that it cannot be treated simply as the province of lawyers. The legislation needs to be accessible to 'ordinary people'. She concludes: The Bill, as it currently stands, will make the legislation less accessible. That can hardly be a desirable outcome. Similarly, Beth Gaze from Monash University, having examined the legislation carefully sad, as an academic lawyer, speaks in the following terms: I am extremely concerned at the impact that the proposed amendments will have on anti-discrimination law in Australia. I believe that they will make complaints in the federal system virtually inaccessibleand underline 'virtually inaccessible'to most complainants for reasons of cost. I have not seen any justification for taking this step which is contrary to the well-established approach to legal costs which has been taken throughout Australian anti-discrimination law ever since it was adopted. It is hard to understand why a government, which claims to put great emphasis on individual rights, is taking steps to close off access to the primary avenue for individuals who are relatively powerless to complain about the sort of unfair treatment which is generally agreed to be unacceptable in a modem, democratic society. In other words, what they are pointing to is the fine irony that these legislative changes constitute further discrimination against those seeking remedies for discrimination. I wonder how the government can defend that outcome. I will look in a little closer detail at some of these changes-firstly, the increase in court fees, and in particular filing fees, in addition to whatever legal costs individuals may incur. Almost all of the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill make reference to the increased costs and their inequity. For instance, the Combined Community Legal Centres Group gave us the example of Maria-hypothetical, but similar to cases that they have seen. The case study says that: Maria is subjected to sexual harassment at work. Her employer is a large company. Not an unusual circumstance. It goes on: Prior to her sexual harassment complaint being resolved, she resigns and gets another job. Again, not an unusual circumstance. It continues: As a result, she's not suffered any economic loss. The case fails to settle at conciliation. Had the matter proceeded to hearing in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, there would have been no court fees and the cost of running the case would have been her legal costs, which we will underestimate at $4000 for a three-day The estimated award for pain and suffering based on similar cases in this jurisdiction would be between $5,000 and $7,000. Given the new Federal Court fee structure, she will now need to pay a filing fee of $500, a day hearing fee at $400 per day for three days of $1,200, setting down fees of $1,000, her legal costs of $4,000---a total of $6,700. Given the awards in this jurisdiction as mentioned earlier-$5,OOO to $7,000---there is no cost benefit to her pursuing her case. The failure of such cases to proceed also thwart the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. Respondents will not be encouraged to revisit their obligations under the act and other employees are likely to be subject to discriminatory treatment in the future. I think it is worth remembering that it is not just the individuals concerned who benefit from this action, but people generally-in this case, particularly women subjected to sexual harassment. Access to anti-discrimination remedies under this legislation will be significantly reduced, mainly as a result of those court cost increases. Again, the possible awarding of legal costs will combine to form a further disincentive, so the combination of court fees and legal costs will almost certainly often outweigh the individual benefits of proceeding. As I say, we all lose as a result of that outcome. There will almost certainly be fewer cases, too, resolved at the conciliation stage, and many people said this in their submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It will encourage the respondents, who are usually better resourced, to pursue the complaint to the hearing rather than resolve it, because they know that the costs will knock out the complainant. The $120 million worth of cuts to legal aid have also undermined access already, in that the New South Wales and Victorian legal aid commissions have announced that they will no longer grant access to and for discrimination cases. So we are seeing the effects of other government actions on this anti-discrimination legislation. As one of the submissions put it: This bill will if put into practice put so many obstacles and deterrents in the way of complainants that it may ... compromise their capacity to pursue hearing. avenues open to them at law. So the law may appear to allow it, but the costs militate against it. We are also seeing in this bill loss of informality of proceedings. The circumstances will not be so user-friendly and there will be considerable difficulties for people, for instance, whose first language is not English or who have a mental illness or some other form of disability. There are complex rules of evidence which will make it very difficult for those people who cannot but be unrepresented as complainants-they cannot afford the legal costs. Some have also commented on the significant loss of expertise and skilled people who work in the area and understand the specialist issues because of the changes to this legislation. Many submissions queried the wisdom of excluding commissioners from involvement in complaints, given their expertise and the non-judicial nature of their approach. The National Pay Equity Coalition said: It is the view of National Pay Equity Coalition that a specialist understanding of sex discrimination, in particular, is required in complaint handling, particularly with those complaints that arise from either indirect or systemic discrimination. In a number of workplaces, these forms of discrimination are demonstrated by the lower levels of access by women to promotion, training, superannuation and other goods and services. In other areas, the discrimination stems from the application of a workplace agreement. These areas are complex and require detailed investigation from the member of the commission who, by their appointment, is deemed the principal office holder and expert with regard to this form of discrimination. They go on to say: We feel that the measures contained within the bill provide for an inefficient use of the expertise within the cO'llmission. The bill clearly decimates the roles of the specialist commissioners and no adequate reasons are given. We are being deprived of the experience of hearing and determining individual complaints, and it is almost certain that the generalist commission will lose touch with the day to day issues of discrimination as has been found in other places. I began by saying how important it is that, as a community, we respect individual civil rights and liberties. What I see in this legislation is a significant step backward, and I am very concerned indeed that this government appears not to recognise the importance of human rights; rather, it sees those people protesting about the breach of them as a noisy minority. It is important that we ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can continue its excellent work by adequate funding and appropriate legislation. At the moment, we have neither.",59
36,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"in rf'ply-The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 has generated considerable interest. There has been a wideranging debate which has not, at all times, focused on the contents of the bill. Nevertheless, I thank those who have participated and I propose to make some comments on what has been said. I anticipate, however, that in the short time remaining before question time. I will barely make a start on the reply. It is pleasing that the opposition, through the member for Banks (Mr Melham), have indicated that they will pass the bill in this House. I note his indication that the opposition will reserve its position for debate in the Senate. Regrettably, this seems to be becoming a habit on the part of the opposition in relation to bills in my portfolio. It may be that it is simply a consequence of the shadow Attorney-General's being in the Senate. It also seems to be something to do with Senator Bolkus not getting his act together, the opposition not getting their act together, and therefore not being in a position to indicate what the view of the opposition is at the time the debate goes on in this House. Since most legislation-in my portfolio at least--commences in this House rather than in the Senate, it is a nuisance, not only for the government but for the public as well, because it means that the minister responsible is not able to respond to community views that are expressed through the opposition. The member for Banks, in this particular case, for example, hardly even referred to the provisions of the bill, and he really only debated the procedure and the process by which it came to be on for debate. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed and a little surprised at the tone of the speech of the member for Banks, which was a touch angry and a touch bitter. His recurring theme was that the House of Representatives was being treated as a rubber stamp. His principal point was that the House had not had the opportunity to consider the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which is considering the provisions of the bill and which is due to report shortly. I think the member for Banks is suffering from some misconceptions. In the normal course, this bill would not have been referred to the Senate committee until after its introduction into the Senate; that would have occurred after the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives. As it was, the government initiated the bill's early consideration by the Senate committee to expedite the airing of the various issues that we were sure would be raised in relation to the bill. It is desirable, from the government's point of view, that the new scheme is put in place as quickly as possible in order to replace current cumbersome complaint and enforcethe ment mechanisms operating within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. second, The Senate Legal and Constitutional LegislaAshes tion Committee has had two full days of hearings and has received substantial in relation to the bill. A range of issues have been aired, and all of them are on the public record and were available to anybody who wished to speak on the bill in this House. We note that the opposition is reserving position until after the debate in the But the member for Banks is disingenuous to suggest that there was no opportunity House to make detailed comments on the bill or, indeed, that the House is being treated by the government as a rubber stamp.",63

Did Bob Hawke go in his third, fourth, fifth or sixth year to the cricket? No, he did not even wait 12 months. He was at the very first Ashes series evidence after the March 1983 election.

He is well enough fowith cused on a very comprehensive itinerary which involves a range of appointments, not just in London but also in the United States. One of the practical aspects of this is worth highlighting; that is, the government will be represented at the summit in New York by the federal Minister for the Environment and Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill.

Youth Allowance",64
45,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware that many young people in my electorate of Gilmore recognise that the changing nature of the Australian economy requires a highly educated and skilled work force to compete in an international economy? How will the youth allowance assist Australia's youth to prepare for work? What is the government's response to criticisms of this popular measure?",64
46,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmunity. more for her question. The young people in her electorate clearly are much more fartaking sighted than those sitting on the other the House who have opposed the common youth allowance. The common youth allowtrying ance is one of the most significant measures in a generation to improve assistance to young people from low income families in this country. It replaces five complex fragmented income support schemes with one single and simple program that will be great benefit to these young people move from one stage of their life to another. It provides additional assistance to 137,000 young people on income support, including many young people in regional and rural Ausall tralia. The single most important aspect of the common youth allowance is the fact that at last it gives the right message to young people that the dole is not an acceptable alternative to investing in your future life with education and training. The common youth allowance gets rid of the schemes that the Labor Party left to the present government, which actually provided financial rewards to young people who preferred the dole to building up their skills. The fact is that Labor's approach to income support for young people actually encouraged young people go on the dole. I think it was very interesting to read the mirrors? statement in the Sydney Morning Herald editorial this morning, which states: The existence of unemployment benefits for young right! people under 18 ... has long been a debilitating factor in Australian society. In too many cases it has encouraged young people to leave home prematurely and inclined them to welfare dependmonthly ence. That is what the Labor Party supported and did nothing to change in 13 years of government. It was never going to change this situation. It is up to this government, with the common youth allowance, to break this vicious cycle and reward young people who are prepared to lay down proper foundations for their future lives. The common youth allowance expresses some very fundamental values of this comIt expresses values of personal responsibility, of family responsibility and of responsibility for your own life and side of planning something worthwhile for the future. At the same time, the Labor Party is to destroy legislation in the Senate which is there to provide further opportunities for young unemployed people. It is trying to destroy the work for the dole legislation and and it is trying to destroy the government's reforms to employment services to make sure of that unemployed people get much better as they opportunities to obtain jobs. When in government, the opposition pushed youth unemployment up to 34 per cent. It is a party which has nothing positive to say at to young people in this country or to their families. It is out of touch with the basic values of this community. Instead of the utter confusion it is showing on this, it should support this measure. Youth Unemployment",65
47,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question goes to the Acting Prime Minister. Isn't it a fact that the government's decision to remove unemployment payments from 16and 17year-olds, forcing them back to school, means that they are no longer counted as being unemployed?

50,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics wiil continue to collect statistics. Indeed, the whole processing of these statistics will absolutely continue on a monthly basis. For the member for Batman to suggest otherwise is being mischievous in the extreme. The truth of the matter is the Labor front-bench are smarting from very good public policy settings under the youth allowance. The youth allowance is all about providing an incentive. We are about giving an incentive for the youth to go into traineeships and apprenticeships, to get jobs, to prepare to get jobs, to be better skilled or to stay at school. Under Labor, there was a dole incentive to do nothing. Under the coalition, there is a youth allowance incentive to do something and to train for a job. Youth Allowance: Rent Assistance",65
51,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister outline for the House changes to rental assistance in the government's youth allowance package? Why has rent assistance been extended to students and what will be the standard rates of rent assistance for those receiving the youth allowance?,66
52,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. A welcome change embraced in the youth allowance package is the extension of rental assistance to a very large group of young Australians for the first time ever. This means a lot to many country people who have no choice but to send their children away from home to study. Many of these people have been able to obtain Austudy in the past, both under the Labor government and under the coalition-more so under us-but those students have not had access, in any form, to rental assistance. Rent assistance will become available to people on youth allowance who are married or have a dependent child, who are independent and are living away from their parental home, or who are dependent recipients who have an approved employment related circumstance or study related reason to live away from home. The maximum rate of rent assistance is $98.80 a fortnight at the moment. That new payment, in terms of its eligibility grouping of people, will now become available under the youth allowance package. The actual payment to an individual will depend of how much rent they are paying, the income they receive and the number of dependent children they have, but it can be as high as $98.80 a fortnight. It is an outstanding policy. It removes one of the key differences in income support arrangements between students and other young people. It gives real incentive and real capacity for young people to commit to a future and build their skills and obtain a job. The youth allowance policy is to help people who are helping themselves, and that is exactly what this change to rent assistance does. I regret that the federal opposition has learnt nothing from its defeat and learnt nothing from the thousands of blue-collar workers who are fed up with paying extra PA YE tax to provide for badly focused and badly administered social security payments under the previous Labor government. Youth Unemployment",66
53,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware that, according to the Department of Social Security, there are 500 young unemployed people who will be forced back into the four already overcrowded, overstretched senior secondary colleges in my electorate as a consequence of the government's attempts to hide youth unemployment? Will the minister now guarantee to provide the additional $20 million these schools need if they are to educate these extra students? Isn't this a problem that will arise not just in my electorate but right across the country? What are you going to do about this?",66
54,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Here we have a question that again reflects the fact that the Labor Party preferred young people to be on the dole. It now seems to be complaining that young people will have the opportunity to go back into school and get the skills and the education they need. Mr Crean-You don't assist them. You to this new have cut back.,66
55,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are degrading the public system.,66
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Denison!,67
57,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a former minister in this area, you would think the member for Hotham would know that the Commonwealth provides per capita funding for every student in schools. Therefore, there will be additional funding which follows these students into the classroom. But the present government has not been satisfied with that. The present government has put in place the most extensive reforms to vocational education and training that have been seen in a generation in this country. Amongst those reforms there will be vastly increased opportunities for young people in schools to get the vocational education courses that will be relevant to them when they leave. The great characteristic of the Labor Party's education policiesMr Crean-I rise on a point of order relating to relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was very specific. It asked whether the minister would ensure the extra $20 million would be available. He is not addressing that point. I would ask you to require him to respond to the specific question that you have required our side to ask. We now expect them to answer on relevance.",67
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Hotham. I uphold the point of order. I am encouraging the minister to address the question.,67
59,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Labor Party is the party which has totally neglected the interests of 70 per cent of young people,67
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,67
61,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is entirely relevant to the question. Mr Crean-The minister continues to ignore your direction to him, Mr Speaker. You have asked him to direct himself to the question.",67
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order because the minister had only gone four or five words into the next sentence. Mr Crean-But he has ignored what you said. He is talking about our performance, not the $20 million.",67
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am allowing the minister some latitude, but he is addressing the question. I am happy with it. I do encourage the minister toMr Crean-Are we the only side that sanctions apply to, Mr Speaker?",67
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. The minister will take due cognisance of my encouragement to address the specifics of the question.,67
65,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question asked about resources in schools for students seeking vocational educational and other educational opportunities. I am answering that question.,67
66,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the $20 million dollars in Franklin-in Tasmania?,67
67,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The present resource situation faced by these students,67
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Denison ! We know where Tasmania isrelax.,67
69,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He doesn't.,67
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The present resource situation results from years of neglect by the previous government. The 70 per cent of students who are not going on to university, as admitted by the member for Sydney, received virtually no consideration under the policies of the previous government. The policies of this government in providing $187 million over the next four years to expand vocational education the opportunities in schools, including school based apprenticeships and traineeships, will precisely meet the needs of these young people. In relation to this, it was very interesting to read in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald the statement by the President of the Secondary Principals Council in New South Wales, Mr Jim Harkin.",67
71,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order is on relevance. I appreciate your admonition that you know where Tasmania is. But the question was specifically related to the resources needed in the electorate of Franklin and to the $20 million worth of additional resources required for four senior high schools. The minister should answer that question.,67
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sure the minister will address the specifics of the question in the broader context of his answer. There is no point of order.,68
73,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have already stated, the resources flowing to schools follow the students from the Commonwealth. There is additional Commonwealth funding for every student who goes back into school. The Commonwealth is also putting additional resources into schools, including in Tasmania in the electorate of Franklin, to encourage students to undertake relevant vocational educational opportunities. I am now making the point that one of the senior representatives of principals in Australia has made the point that schools have to accept the challenge; we have to accept that secondary education is not just the right of the best 70 per cent of students. The Commonwealth is putting schools in a position where they can respond. The previous government did nothing to put schools in such a position. In fact, it provided students with a financial incentive to get out of school and live a life on the dole. That did the students no good and it did harm to the quality of the society in which they live. Youth Allowance",68
74,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the minister representing the Minister for Social Security. What is the minister's response to comments that the government's youth allowance reform will exacerbate rather than address problems faced in rural Australia? How will the youth allowance help rural and regional Australians such as the young people in my electorate of MCMillan?,68
75,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. The concerns that he has are ones that are well understood. The issue in relation to young people, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was highlighted when a number of members from this House-the member for Sturt in particular and, I think, the member for North Sydney before he joined us in this parliament-participated in youth forums in New South Wales and Queensland in 1995. They heard the views of many young people at that time about the disincentive that young people experienced with the regime that was in place at that time. Despite calls from welfare groups, Labor made no attempt to address these iniquities, and they allowed the complex system that we had in place to remain. This government's highest priority is to deal with jobs, and in particular jobs for young people. We are about encouraging young people to go into education and training so that they will be less likely to be unemployed. The opposition, on the other hand, judging by its comments, obviously prefers a situation in which young people are encouraged to remain on unemployment benefits rather than acquiring further skills. I have to say no amount of scaremongering in relation to these matters will change the facts. The facts are these: we will spend an additional $25 million in the first year on program costs as a result of this new initiative; we are introducing a parental means test which is more generous than it was under the Austcare arrangements of the Labor Party; and we are introducing a system where everyone on news tart as at 17 June will not have their payment affected in any way. This measure is particularly beneficial for those who are in regional Australia. There are many young people in rural areas who need to travel away from home to participate in education. This will be the first time that single people living away from home will receive up to $75 a fortnight. That will be particularly beneficial for those in rural and regional Australia. Together with this, there will be an increase in benefits for those under 18 who are away from home. They will be up to $ I 00 a fortnight better off. There have been allegations that these changes will be detrimental to the unity of families in the bush. I have this to say about such allegations: would you prefer to see a disaffected, depressed unemployed young person or one who is working constructively towards their own future. I have to say that the carping of the opposition in relation to this issue is a clear indication of their unwillingness to address the needs of young people in our community. This government wants to see young people, particularly those in regional Australia, boosted with self-esteem by the skills that they have been able to obtain. I would encourage members opposite to have a look at the way in which the issues here have changed very significantly in the day or so since this was first announced. I draw to their attention the editorials in the Herald-Sun in Melbourne-which was very supportive about the need to encourage young people to learn more in preparation-the Sydney Morning Herald and the Financial Review. I could not see more persuasive statements than those I saw in the Financial Review today, which I would encourage honourable members opposite to read. I quote this one: The Federal Government's decision to ditch the dole for under-18s and tighten access to benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds should be vigorously applauded. so should its move to replace a range of youth benefits-including unemployment, Austudy and family allowance-with a single payment, and its effort to push the young jobless to improve their skills rather than remain idle. They force all but the poorest parents to taker greater financial responsibility for their offspring. And they close a bizarre gap which has financially encouraged the young people to be unemployed rather than to study and given students greatly increased access to rent assistance. Together, these changes help engender a culture of self-improvement rather than welfare-dependence and dole culture which has crept into Australian life. NA",68
76,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom of Malaysia, led by their distinguished President of the Senate. I extend a very warm welcome to our guests. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Collins Class Submarines",69
77,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Defence aware of reports about seemingly intractable problems with the weapons system and steering of the trialling Collins class submarine? Is the boat currently authorised to submerge? Can the minister assure the House that personnel serving in the Collins during sea trials are safe?,69
78,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Curtin for his question. In answer to the last part of the question, of course it is safe or we would not allow it to go to sea. It is able to submerge at the present time. There have been some problems with the hydraulic couplings in the pastMrs Crosio---It goes down but doesn't come up!",69
79,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which were no doubt put on when you were in power. We have had them redesigned and they will go back again. As everybody knows, there is a long-term problem with the combat system which, when completed, will be several years late and will be the most sophisticated integrated combat system in the world. Like all of these new pieces of equipment, they are complicated, they have an infinite number of faults when they are being developed, each of them has to be corrected, and the ultimate prerequisite is safety. That is why we have had a number of inquiries, some initiated by me, some by the navy. Safety will be the ultimate requirement, but when the Collins submarine is finished, it will be the best conventional submarine in the world, in my opinion. Vocational Education And Training",69
80,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, what response have you experienced from Australia's youth and families to the government's far reaching reforms to the vocational education and training sector? Will these reforms give new hope to a generation of young people starved of quality training opportunities under the previous Labor government?",69
81,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moncrieff for her question. Of course, there has been enormous response around Australia to the government's extensive reforms to vocational education and training. Unfortunately, under the previous government the apprenticeship system was allowed to run down and there was a fixation on the 30 per cent of students going through school to university-to the neglect of the 70 per cent of students who are looking for other options when they leave school. This Commonwealth is now engaged in the most extensive reforms in Australia's history. ThiS year there are some 55,000 additional places in TAFE compared to last year. In the budget just brought down, the government has provided for some 100.000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for next year. And traineeship opportunities are already some 50 per cent above those available last year. There have been many efforts to misrepresent this situation. I particularly noted the comment in this morning's press from the minister for training in New South Wales, Mr Aquilina, who said that as a result of Commonwealth decisions T AFE would lose 6,400 places in New South Wales. The fact is that total funding for vocational education and training this year under the Commonwealth budget is some $144 million above that provided in the last year of the Labor government. The cuts to T AFE training in New South Wales occurred of course in the Carr government's own state budget. In the recent state budget in New South Wales, spending on T AFE by the state government was reduced by $9 million. If there is any threat at all to TAFE places in New South Wales, it is a result of the decisions of the Carr government. The Carr government is the only government in Australia which is dragging its feet on implementing the reforms on which all ministers agreed, even the New South Wales minister. But the Carr government is so much under the thumb of the Trades and Labour Council in that state that it is unable to introduce the reforms which are required to give young people these opportunities. Their federal counterparts are very well matched, because they are the people who not only pushed youth unemployment up to 34 per cent and neglected the students not going on to university but they are now trying to destroy the opportunities for 10,000 young people which would be provided through the work for the dole scheme. They are trying to destroy this legislation in the Senate. They also trying to destroy in the Senate the government's historic reforms to employment placement services that will allow many young people to access the growing apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities that this government's policies are producing. The Labor Party, state and federal, has absolutely no credibility at all when it talks about youth unemployment and the problems young people are facing. Its policies made those problems worse and, at state and federal levels, it has lost touch with the needs of the young people of this country. Heroin",69
82,Mrs CROSIO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. It raises another issue of critical importance to young people in particular. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that children as young as 11 and 12 are regularly using heroin in the streets of Cabramatta? When a hit of heroin costs little more than a packet of cigarettes, don't we have a national emergency on our hands, which requires a national response? Do you agree with Dr Woollard, the President of the AMA, that Australia needs 'a national consensus on strategies to deal with the drug problem''! Will the government convene a national drug summit to deal with this insidious traffic which is now killing 10 Australians every week?",70
83,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mrs Crosio-The Acting Prime Minister flicked me off yesterday .and he is doing it again today. Mr Downer-We have got a Minister for Health. He will answer it for you. Mrs Crosio-Yes, but I asked the Acting Prime Minister.",70
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect has asked her question. It is now being answered.,70
85,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the honourable member's concerns, which are shared by a very large number of people in this House. Australia has had a national drug strategy that has been a cooperative and a are consensual effort between Commonwealth, state and territory governments and between health, police and law enforcement departments. This is unusual around the world, and I have only yesterday got to see the review of the second five years of the national drug strategy. This review was undertaken by Professor Single, from the department of preventative medicine and biostatistics at the University of Toronto, and Professor Rohl, from the Police Graduate School of Management at Charles Sturt University. I wrote to state health ministers yesterday with copies of this draft report, and when I have their agreement I will release it. But I can say that this draft report from two very independent and esteemed people, one on the law enforcement side and one on the health side, has said that our response to drugs is something that has been held up as an example right around the world and something that has given this country great credit. It is a concern, and obviously it has got a great deal of publicity, but to simply try to convene a summit every time you have got a problem is window-dressing and I am not prepared to do it until I have had a chance to try to resolve the report that has been made and that we have got from state, territory and Commonwealth health ministers. I will just say I am very mindful that in 1986, when we had this first up, it was window-dressing, it was basically publicity, and I am not going to make the mistakes that were made under the previous government. It is too important a job to have a cheap stunt, which is how you dealt with it initially. United Kingdom",70
86,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question. How importantly does the government regard Australia's relationship with the United Kingdom? Is the Minister aware of criticism of the Prime Minister for visiting this very important bilateral partner for Australia?,71
87,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I know that he has a very great interest in the relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom. Honourable members will perhaps be surprised to learn that Australia is the fifth largest foreign investor in the United Kingdom, investing something like $28 billion in that country. That is one of the reasons why the United Kingdom is a matter of very real importance for Australia. Let me also say that the United Kingdom is the second largest foreign investor in Australia. The United Kingdom has $86 billion invested in this country. For those who do not think it appropriate for our Prime Minister to visit the United Kingdom, let me make it clear to this House-and to those who, for example, think jobs are a priority and that a visit to the United Kingdom is irrelevant to jobs-that something like 300,000 Australian jobs depend on British investment in this country. So it is quite important for people to understand the role that Britain plays in this economy. It is obvious that cultural ties and the like with the United Kingdom are also important and so, indeed, is the security relationship, with Britain being a member of the five power defence arrangements. It is clear that the relationship with Britain is a very important relationship to this country and to jobs in this country.",71
88,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When does the Test match start? Mr Crean-And Wimbledon!,71
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable members for Kingsford-Smith and Hotham!,71
90,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I note the interjection of the member for Hotham. The question I think the House would like to hear you answer is: how long are you spending in Bordeaux next month? Government members-Oh!,71
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right!,71

95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that for many of you that it has been a tough and demanding week, but the House is increasingly disorderly and I issue a general warning.",71
96,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know that you could call him Cheap Jack given that he has asked for a hire car to take him ar Jund Bordeaux, but we will do our best to make the appropriate arrangements. I did notice that, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition described the Prime Minister's visit to Britain as 'an indulgence'. I think that to describe the visit as 'an indulgence' is a matter of some very substantial surprise. It is a matter of surprise because the Leader of the Opposition has asked my department, which is happy to do so, to assist him with travel arrangements in july of this year. As I said, they are very happy to make the arrangements. He has asked us to help him with a program that takes him for one night to Hong Kong, to Dubai, to spend a day in Amman, a couple of days in Israel and a day or so in Singapore.",72
97,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Leaving aside the gross impropriety of the minister in his behaviour",72
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! What is your point of order?,72
99,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order is that the question was about the Prime Minister's visit and not about other members of parliament in relation to this issue.,72
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,72
101,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about Australia's relations with Britain as well. I was just telling the House that the Leader of the Opposition is going to a number of countries. The House may be interested to know that he is visiting the United Kingdom from 19 to 26 July-seven days in London. He has requested our assistance with accommodation at the Savoy and we are happy to help. He has requested our assistance with an appointment at All Souls College, Oxford, and we are happy to help. I just make the point, Mr Speaker, that we will help with these arrangements, and that is consistent with processes of government. But, to make criticisms about indulgences on our part and then seek our assistance to make appointments during seven days in the United Kingdom is, if I may say so, just a tiny little bit hypocritialso cal. The Leader of the Opposition will be in the United Kingdom during the fourth Test at Headingley. Government members--Oh!",72
102,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether he is going to the Test. Perhaps he would rather meet with Labor Party officials than go to support the Australian cricket team at the Headingley Test. I do not know, but we will help him get a ticket. Can I just conclude by drawing the attention of the House to an article that appeared in the Londof'. Financial Times on 17 June 1993. The article was headed 'Lording it up'. The article said: No less than four of Australia's 19 cabinet ministers are in London, Gareth Evans. Simon Crean, Laurie Brereton and Kim Beazley. The article went on to say: Surely this sudden interest in the mother country cannot have anything to do with the second test match beginning at Lords today. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",72
103,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects. I tell you what: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was then the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He is on that list, he was in London at that time; and you want to know did he go to the cricket at Lords. We checked your program: you played golf that morning at the Wentworth Golf Club. In the afternoon you went to Lords. Government members-Oh, ha, ha.",72

I ask the minister to table all the documents from which he was quoting, including the dates, and in my case the negotiations I was engaged in at that time. I ask that he table all the travel plans for all the government members of this parliament for this break and all the assistance has been required by all of them in that respect. If he does not table them, he stands condemned of total hypocrisy.",72

113,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister, while Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and with responsibility for retail tenancy and franchising, made any approach to, or had any communication with, any director or employee of Coles Myer or with former West Australian Planning Minister Lewis or his officers in relation to any business in which the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has a financial interest, in particular the Eaton lot in Bunbury?  required, I have made my declaration in the that register of members' interests. Secondly, my declaration is in the detail that all members are required to follow. Mr Crean-That has nothing to do with the question. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is relevance. Perhaps he is anticipating other questions, but my question went specifically to asking about a specific matter of his responsibility,. not whether he had tabled information as part of his declaration of members' interests.",73
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham. The minister will address the substance of the question.  background of the question and I think the honourable member will be happy with the contents of the explanation. The following companies I have disclosed own amongst other properties the following: Minninup Forum shopping centre, Leschenault Quays and the Homemaker Centre. In these three centres there are about 40 commercial and retail outlets. Amongst these outlets there are individuals, partnerships and proprietary companies. Also amongst these outlets are franchised operations such as Chicken Treat, Subway, Pizza Hut and Betta Electrical Service. It is irrelevant whether they are franchisees or franchisors: they are tenants and subject to equal treatment. There is no distinction between a tenant, whether they are a franchisor or franchisee. None of the companies in which I have an interest operates as a franchisee or a franchisor. As to the planning matters, apart from the standard political and social contact I have neither sought nor had any contact with any planning minister while I have been a minister. As far as the Coles Myer matter is concerned, I rang Mr Nick Greiner four or five months ago to ask for a contact name in Coles Myer for my brother. Mr Greiner suggested that my brother write to him. Other than this request for a contact point",73

116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison!  matter with Mr Greiner and I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner from this point. My brother subsequently wrote to Mr Greiner and was given a contact name. There are no commercial arrangements between Coles Myer or any other company in which I am associated. Compulsory Unionism,74
117,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given the government's policy of freedom of association, will the minister inform the House of steps taken to eradicate compulsory unionism and preference clauses from the construction industry and the Australian Public Service?",74
118,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In the period since 1 January the government has been busy encouraging the implementation of various parts of the Workplace Relations Act. With AWAs, I have reported to the House that a number of those have been approved. That number is building up-non-union agreements, the use of section 127 and the like. We have also made a particular point of encouraging the full implementation of the freedom of association provisions to ensure that we banish forever compulsory unionism. In that regard in the Australian Public Service, agencies wrote to members of unions . within the Australian Public ServiceMr Dargavel-They have already down that!",74
119,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and provided those members of the Public Service with the opportunity to continue to have union dues deducted from their payroll provided that theyMr Dargavel-They have already done that!,74
120,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,provide a fresh authority for the Commonwealth to continue to do so. Mr Dargavel-They have already done that!,74
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Fraser has defied my general warning that there is too much disorder in the House. I invoke standing order 304A. Remove yourself from the chamber. The honourable member for Fraser thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,74
122,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We knew the CPSU was weak because of the poor attendance at its various industrial actions, the latest being the rather juvenile campaign to have members sit on their hands for 13 minutes. But I have been interested in the response--or should I say lack of response-from so many who have previously paid their union dues through payroll deductions. In fact, in the last couple of months we have seen one-third of CPSU members decline to have their union dues deducted from their monthly or fortnightly pay packets. In the Australian Public Service, that represents a decline of 11,000 members in respect of that particular union. We have also been implementing this policy of freedom of association in the building industry. It was an important measure that, at the recent labour ministers' council meeting, all state and territory ministers-including the NSW minister-agreed to a code of conduct which will be inserted into a construction code at the forthcoming council meeting in August. In the meantime, I am pleased to inform the House that the federal cabinet has endorsed the code of conduct for the building industry, and that code will apply forthwith to new contracts being entered into whether in respect of existing prjects or new projects. The Commonwealth is a significant purchaser of new buildings. In 1997-98, the government will be undertaking expenditure of more than $1.1 billion on capital works and services. Examples of projects which will feel the impact of the code include the Russell Offices development project; the army presence in the north project at Palmers ton in the Northern Territory; the refurbishment of Old Parliament House; major construction and refurbishment of existing Commonwealth offices; the national research facilities program; the Australian Geological Survey Organisation building; and, not least in this list, the National Museum of Australia. The National Museum of Australia has a bit of a history, because this was one of the promises the previous government was always planning to get on with and which this government is proceeding to fund. It might bring back memories to some in the House that the former Prime Minister used to like to talk about what he was going to put in the museum. Now that we are going to be building the museum, we might have some say in that. A special section dedicated to certain members of the ACTU would be very appropriate. For example, we could have John Coombs of the MUA on a little stand with a voice-over saying, 'Listen, fellas, don't work too fast,' and with a no ticket no start sign.

Mr Allan Morris-There are times when there is not much point being in here with these rules that are applied. The point of order. I was raising, before you addressed him, was that you have a job to do. He does not help you by making a mockery of the rules that you set down only a few weeks back.

Minister, when you rang Nick Greiner, did you tell him what you wanted the contacts for? Was one of the contacts that you were given a Mr Graham Terry, the Chief of Property Development of Coles Myer? Will you tell the House the detail of the conversation you had with Mr Greiner? Did that conversation relate to the Eaton lot in Bunbury?

135,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minster for Foreign Affairs. I ask the minister whether he can advise the House on the accuracy of reports of the demise of Khmer Rouge leader 'Pol Pot. Are stories violent clashes in Phnom Penh on June 17 between rival forces of Cambodia's two Prime Ministers indicative of a marked deterioration in security in that city? In view of the government's close involvement with the Paris peace accords, what is the government's response to current alarming developments in Cambodia, and what are the prospects for second democratic election?",76
136,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the right honouraimed able member for his question. I know that all members of the House would agree with me cal that the right honourable member England has a deep and abiding interest in Cambodia, as does the Acting Leader of the Opposition and many others. Latest reports suggest that the murderous Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot faces imminent capture, and that is something that we welcome. The demise of the Khmer Rouge armed threat to Cambodian politics would be a to the welcome end to a bloody chapter in it Cambodia's history. There is, reportedly, careagreement between the two Prime Ministers that Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders would be handed over to an international what tribunal, if captured. I welcome this. The Australian government believes that Khmer Rouge leaders who perpetrated atrocities on the Cambodian people should be brought to justice. The Cambodian government is in no doubt about our strong concern that those Khmer Rouge figures involved in the murder of an Australian citizen should be brought to justice. In light of these developments, I am particularly concerned at the recent escalation in of politically motivated violence in Cambodia, such as the grenade attack on 30 March, and the violent clash between security forces loyal to the ruling coalition parties on night of 17 June, to which the right honourable member refers. Inflammatory statements by Cambodia's leaders and their race to secure military and factional support, including from defecting Khmer Rouge forces, have unfortunately only added to these tensions. This government is committed to restoring and rebuilding Cambodia's social and political of institutions. We are providing $92 million over four years in aid programs in the areas of education, de-mining, electoral assistance and health. Important priorities for our aid program are the promotion of good governance and institution building. I recently announced a contribution of $Y2 million to support preparations for national elections in a 1998, including the training of electoral officials. Our defence cooperation program is at assisting in the development of a professional armed force, neutral in its politiaffiliation, with projects in mine clearance, for New training and health. Finally, let me say that I expect to visit Cambodia in the near future, and will take the opportunity during my visit to pass some key messages to Cambodian leaders. I will impress upon them that the maintenance of the rule of law is critical to the implementation of the Paris peace accords and continuing support of donors in Cambodia's reconstruction process. I will also underline the importance of the Cambodian parties renewing efforts to resolve political tensions. NA",76

138,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the ministerial code of conduct as it relates to the minister's responsibilities. Minister, you have said that you do not involve yourself in the day-today operations of Prosser Automotive Engineering. Can you produce a letter to prove this, as the industry minister did when he was placed in a similar position in relation to his private company Ralsten? Further, are you aware that, as a company director, you are required under section 232 of the Corporations Law, subject to a substantial fine, to 'exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in protecting and advancing the interests of the company'? Minister, how can you meet the obligations as a director, which clearly require you to play a hands-on role, and at the same time observe the code of conduct, which requires you not to? Mr Lieberman- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 144. The content of the question is obviously out of order because it contains imputations and inferences.

141,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Will the minister inform the House of any new developments with regard to drug therapy for people suffering from mental illness, especially schizophrenia?",77
142,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There is an exciting development in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is a drug produced by Eli Lilly called olanzapine, going under the trademark of Zyprexa. Up until now the drug most commonly used has been clozapine, but that has a good number of people on whom it does not work and also has side effects that may be jerking movements or what, in medical terms, is called extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine only came into trials in the United States in the middle of last year. The trials have shown that it is in fact 10 to 12 per cent more effective than any medication for schizophrenia currently on the market, and it has 17 per cent less side effects. So for those people who have side effects from medication, it is terribly exciting. There are also rare occurrences when people are on clozapine where they have what is called a blood dyscrasia and the body does not produce white cells, so this is potentially life threatening. Olanzapine does not have the same sideeffects. This drug was considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee back in March and they recommended that, because it was more effective and because it had fewer side effects, it should be made available to the Australian public. What has been difficult here though is that this is a very cost medication and just for this one medication across the period of the forward estimates, it will cost around $65 million. However, I am pleased to inform the ourable member that yesterday afternoon we did get permission to place this on the maceutical benefits system from the first reprinting of the new schedule, which is August. We expect that several thousand Australians will benefit from this very high cost medication. It shows what the benefits are of having a pharmaceutical benefits system that is able to cope with the highest cost, newest medication, including one expensive as this. I expect that it will very exciting advance in treatment for people with mental illness. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",77
143,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Conhad. sumer Affairs. I refer to the ministerial code of conduct as it relates to the minister's responsibilities. Minister, is it not a fact you control Prosser Automotive Engineers, key member of the Property Council of Australia, and that you failed to disclose that membership? Is itnot a fact that the Property Council represented your company in four submissions to the fair trading inquiry you up, one of those submissions which advocated no change to the Trade Practices Act and rejection of Labor's better business conduct bill? Does not making such a submission to an inquiry you must decide on represent clear conflict of interest?  day control of the company mentioned. That company has a general manager and the the director in control of the day-today affairs of that company is the other shareholder, my brother. I have complied with the Prime the Minister's ministerial conduct. Comcare",78
144,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is high directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister heard claims that the independent inquiry into claims management by Comcare will lead to outsourcing of the function, leading to the loss of 400 jobs in honCanberra? What is the actual position?",78
145,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable pharmember for his question. I have seen the reports. Comcare has in fact not 400 but 215 1 people nationally involved in claims management, and of those about 70 are situated in Canberra. This review is not in any sense predetermined. It is a proper review into the claims management function. Clearly, the review-it has been made clear in what we as have said about it-does not in any sense be a relate to benefits but merely the service delivery or claims management aspect. I can advise employees in the APS that no detriment to them is in any way involved in respect of this claims management review. Comcare obviously handles a wide range of claims. Some of the claims which it deals with are stress claims. Let me give you an example of some of the claims that we have For example, an employee was involved in an affair at work. When the affair ended she felt she was unable to remain in the that workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The a cost to the Commonwealth to date is $80,000. A second claim: an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. He went on sick leave and lodged a compensation claim for stress. This set employee has been absent from work since mid-1995. A third claim: an employee claimed a work related stress condition due to disputes with his employer. The disputes related to the payment of higher duties and a the fact that his agency refused to provide him with a permanent position. The cost to the Commonwealth to date is over $192,000. This information has been provided to me by my department and by Comcare, but it shows scope of claims which they have to face. As a closing note, the government has a policy which is to ensure that the law reflects original intention of the legislation. It is a pity that the Labor Party is opposed to measures to clean up some of the unreasonable claims which have arisen as a result of the operation of the existing law. Instead of opposing this sensible measure, they ought to be supporting it. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",78
146,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. In light of the obvious continuing failure of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to meet the conflict of interest standards in the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct, will the Acting Prime Minister now require his resignation?",79
147,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has informed the House that he has complied with the requirements for declarations of his private interests both as a member and as a minister. The parliamentary committee report on fair trading has not yet been considered by the government. Further, the comments made by the Prime Minister on Monday are relevant to this and I concur with those comments. I have nothing to add other than to say that the real grubby aspect of this episode occurred yesterday when the member for Batman said in respect of comments on heroin, and I quote from page 5475 of Hansard: He's probably selling them in his shopping centres. Whilst he subsequently withdrew that and tried to claw out of it when he said there was no suggestion of this, that was a disgraceful intervention by that frontbencher. I know the front-bench is very nervous this week about their tactical errors with the announcement of Wayne Goss coming down here from Queensland. Is the member for Melbourne to be tossed off the front bench or the member for Banks? I hope it is not the member for Banks. Do you have to move aside for Wayne Goss or are you going to be okay on the shadow front bench? All I can say is that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has complied with the requirements. Refugees",79
148,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is the minister aware of allegations that some people are manipulating Australia's refugee application process to prolong their stay to enable them to work? What is the minister doing to address this problem?,79
149,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. I should first say that the government is committed firmly to assisting bona fide refugees. I make that threshold comment because I do not want there to be any doubt about my expectation that the department and the tribunal should act in accordance with our international obligations. However, this year we expect to receive some 10,000 applications for refugee status in Australia, and possibly more. That is 20 times more than we saw only seven years ago. The cost of assessing all of those claims through the various stages with judicial intervention, asylum seeker support and the like is over $60 million a year. A large number of the applications are not coming from residents of countries that are generally associated with human rights abuses. Numbers have come from the Philippines, Tonga, Fiji and Thailand. This financial year, the department has finalised more than 3,000 applications from those countries that I have mentioned and has been able to identify only four bona fide refugees. People are turning up at my department and asking for a $30 work visa, the name by which we understand the protection visa is now becoming known. By lodging an application, such individuals can obtain work rights in Australia and they know that they cannot be sent home until after their refugee application has been properly assessed and considered by the department, possibly the Refugee Review Tribunal, accessing my discretion and applications to the courts. We also know that, in many cases, what they are seeking is access to Medicare, benefits for which they have in no way paid or contributed. I am going to do something about this. In March I announced the comprehensive series of reforms that are involved in remedying these problems that we are associated with. Some of these involve changes to regulations; others involve legislation that I will introduce as a bill next week. Notice has been given by Senator Margetts that there will be a motion to disallow some of these regulations. I understand that she has taken exception to the measures to address abuse on the onshore refugee program, even though there is a clear recognition from community groups, including the Refugee Council of Australia, that such abuse is taking place and is high. I have to say that I have been advised by leading members of that body of their concerns about the abuse that is occurring. What we are seeking to do is to remove the incentives that are now current in the system that make it wide open to this form of abuse. The measures that we are seeking are, firstly, to have a $1,000 post-decision fee for applications lodged with the Refugee Review Tribunal. That fee is intended to deter people from making frivolous review applications simply to extend their stay in Australia. The fee would become a charge payable. It may not have to be paid if they leave Australia, but of course it would obviously have an impact on any further application they might wish to return. The fee will not be payable by people who are found to be refugees, people who go to the courts and people who access my non-compellable discretion. I want to make it absolutely clear that these measures in no way attempt to deny access to the protection offered to genuine refugees; they are aimed at stopping exploitation. The other measure that I would hope we might see support for is the measure that will limit access to employment in Australia to only those people who claim refugee status within 14 days of arrival in this country. The attempt at disallowing these regulations by Senator Margetts is only saying to those who abuse the refugee system that it is okay to slow down the processing system and it is okay to abuse it and to commit fraud against the Australian community. It is also saying that it is okay to delay bona fide people being able to get prompt remedy by the grant of refugee status. I have commenced discussions with the honourable member for Denison. I would hope that the members of the opposition would see in these measures an appropriate response to what is a real and very pressing problem that we face. I would hope that they would accord to this government the same degree of cooperation that we gave when these sorts of issues were being dealt with when they were in government. I would like to deal with one other matter briefly. Yesterday I answered a question in which I said that the cost of transport of the Chinese folk who arrived in Australia was $337,000. That figure was incorrect; it was $370,000. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Martin) proposed: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Cunningham moving forthwith: That this House censures the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs for his: (1) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he has been involved in the 'daily work' of a business; (2) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he retained directorship of a company operating in an area conflicting with the Minister's public duty; (3) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he failed to divest himself of all shares in a company involved in the area of his portfolio responsibility; (4) failure to fully declare to the Registrar of Members' Interests the nature of his extensive property holdings-and in particular, their relationship to retail tenancy and franchising, clearly within the Minister's area of responsibility-as required under the standing and sessional orders of this House, instead only admitting to ""Bunbury-various lots""; (5) failure to declare to the Registrar of Members' Interests membership, by a company controlled by him, of a professional organisation whose activities so directly relate to the Minister's area of responsibility that a connict of interest could readily be seen to arise; (6) maladministration of the small business portfolio which has caused the WA Retailers Association and the Australian Independent Retailers Council to call for his resignationaccordingly, this House calls upon the Acting Prime Minister to require the resignation of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Mr Reith-We will take the suspension motion if you would like to put that, and then we can debate the censure motion.",79
150,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Fine. Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",81
151,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Cunningham) (3.18 p.m.}-I move: That this House censures the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs for his: (1) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he has been involved in the 'daily work' of a business; (2) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he retained directorship of a company operating in an area cont1icting with the Minister's public duty; (3) breaching the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct in that he failed to divest himself of all shares in a company involved in the area sibility; (4) failure to fully declare to the Registrar of Members' Interests the nature of his extensive property holdings-and in particular, their relationship to retail tenancy and franchising, clearly within the Minister's area of responsibility-as required under the standing and sessional orders of this House, instead only admitting to ""Bunbury-various lots""; (5) failure to declare to the Registrar of Members' Interests membership, by a company controlled by him, of a professional organisation whose activIties so directly relate to the Minister's area of responsibility that a conniet of interest could readily be seen to arise; (6) maladministration of the small business portfolio which has caused the WA Retailers Association and the Australian Independent Retailers Council to call for his resignationaccordingly, this House calls upon the Acting Prime Minister to require the resignation of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. This matter comes before this parliament at a time when there is questioning of parliamentarians in every forum of this nation. The questioning of parliamentarians, and particularly those who are in influential positions like ministers, has been underpinned that much more by activities that we have exposed during the last several weeks in respect of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  Let me go to those very issues that we have outlined in our censure motion today and why we have called for the minister's resignation. Firstly, let me go to the ministerial code of conduct. In the very first section under the heading 'ministerial conduct', at page 10 of the document which the minister selectively quoted from in question time today, it is stated: Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. This clearly has been breached. It is also stated in this document: Ministers must not engage in any professional practice or the daily work of any business. of his portfolio responIt states: Ministers may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates business and if the retention of the directorship is not likely to connict with the minister's public duty. It says: Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. Finally, it says: Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another. What does a phone call to Nick Greiner on behalf of your business partner amount to, if not trying to exercise influence 'to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another'? In this case the 'another' is not only a business partner; the 'another' happens to be his brother. When you have a look at the share register and the structure in which this minister has set up his company, we find  minister; Mrs ProsserMr Crean-And not his brother!",81
152,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"And his brother. Yet the Prime Minister's own guidelines, Minister, say that you should not 'exercise the influence obtained from public office to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another'. What we have seen in this tawdry episode from the minister so far is that he has breached each of those guidelines. In terms of hands-on, I will come to hands-on with Mr Greiner in a minute, but let me go to handson specifically with the minister and whether he deals with his franchisees, with his tenants, in those shopping centres in Bunbury. In an article which appeared in the Herald-Sun, I think on the eighth of this month, under the by-line of Michael MCKinnon there was a description of one of the minister's tenants in the key fruit and vegetable market. The tenant said that he has a manager who works for him, Colin Woods, whom he talked to: 'If we have a problem, we go to Colin and he sometimes says he has to check with Geoff to see what he thinks.' Mr Lee-Geoff who?",82
153,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I think there can only be one Geoff in the hands-on management of this shopping centre, and that would be 'lots of Bunbury,' the minister for small business sitting opposite me right now. It goes further because damned out of his own mouth in terms of hands-on activity the minister went on the Small Business Show on Channel 9 on 18 May and said: One thing I can say is that I still employ people myself. I see the forms that government send through. I still see those sorts of things come through. So he is dealing with the hands-on daily activities of forms relevant to taxation matters and relevant to employment matters of employees in his shopping centres in Bunbury, Western Australia. The issue would be laughable if it was not serious. We know where this all started. This started because we had a look at his registration of members' interests entries. For the benefit of those masses in the gallery, the registration of members' interests says that we as members must conform with certain standards and we must provide to the registrar of members interests within a short period of time of each new parliament our pecuniary interests. I will say this about the minister: he has listed quite a number of companies under shareholdings and private and public companies. He has listed family and business trusts and nominees companies. They are all in there. He has listed Prosser Management, Prosser Automotive Engineers, Regional Property Investment, Prosser Homes, Prosser Automotive Engineers, Western Property Holdings Unit Trust, GD Prosser Engineers, the Ronald Walter Family Trust. When it comes to the real estate area, he declares for himself 'Bun bury , various lots'. One would think that, as this minister was given responsibility two months before putting these declarations in, he would have said, 'Look, I have to put my hand up, I own shopping centres.' It is a touch more than Bunbury, various lots. It is a touch more than that; it is at least three shopping centres and, as he said today, at least 40 tenants. With the other interests that he has, it is closer to 80. The minister clearly has not only understated his contribution here in the registration of members' interests but also he has done so for other motives. Ms Macklin-How much does he own? Mr Reith-He owns most of Bunbury. Why worry about a few shops? There is no disguising it. Here it is in the paper.",82
154,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"He has done so because he did not want his relationship with his own business interest to stand in the way of his role as the minister for small business. The reason we looked into some of these issues was that 12 months ago this minister established an inquiry into the concerns that small business people had about fair trading in this country. A little over three weeks ago that committee report was tabled in this place. It had implications in a variety of areas. It had implications for retail trading, tenants. It had implications for things like franchising. It had implications for the misuse of market power. It had implications and recommendations on legislative protection against unfair conduct. I would have thought and I think most small businesses would have thought that, if the minister for small business was a landlord, if the minister for small business also had a relationship as a landlord with franchisors who sublet the franchisees, just maybe there would have been a conflict of interest between him having responsibility for taking this report to cabinet with ministerial imprimatur with recommendations on what the government might do to assist small business-this constituency that the Prime Minister reckons he would lay down his life for; if he was in Australia-and this minister now saying that there is no conflict of interest despite his extensive holdings and that he can represent their interests. Does that stack up? There was a touch of Abbott and Costello in some of the responses that we saw earlier this week. In question time when we were asking the minister and the Prime Minister who had responsibility for the fair trading inquiry and specifically retail  If there is any area of perceived conflict of interest that will be handled by my colleague the minister for industry. This was question time on 16 June. Later in question time the Prime Minister said: When the government's response has been prepared, the ministerthat is the minister for small businesswill of course be in a position to pass policy responsibility should there be any potential of conflict of interest. At the end of question time we all went out of this House thinking this minister for small business still had responsibility for tenancy matters. However, by 7.30 and the 7.30 Report all had changed. I am told IS minutes before the minister went on that program he got a phone call from the oval office. I am told that that phone call basically said, 'You are not going to look after retail tenancy matters and let's hope the rest of them are okay.' What the minister said to Barrie Cassidy was: My colleague John Moore will handle that particular areameaning retail tenancyand I have already taken the matter up with him a short time ago. It is no wonder people were confused about this in the old Abbott and Costello fashion. On the same Monday in the Herald-Sun there was a very interesting article. This journalist had heard that Minister Prosser was going to be moved. So he made a few phone calls. He rang John Moore's office, the minister for industry. T\1ey said, 'This is all news to us.' John Moore said, 'I don't know if I have got it or not.' They rang the Prime Minister's office and were told, 'No, that's not right. It  will have to go to Mr Moore, but he is the portfolio minister.' As I said, it was a bit Abbott and Costello. It is like that old sketch: Who's on first, What's on second, and I don't know's on third. They do not know. They are going round and round passing the buck as to who has responsibility. Clearly, it was demonstrated that there was a conflict of interest. Otherwise, minister, tell us this-and we are dying to hear your response-why were you relieved of responsibility for retail tenancy matters? If there is no conflict of interest, as you have maintained, why did the PM take. it off you? Why did the PM ring you up 15 minutes before you went on the 7.30 Report and say, 'Geoff, sorry, mate, you are no longer in charge of retail tenancy issues'? Then we go to the issue of franchising. In franchising, again, it started in the budget last year when this minister, as an offering up of savings, said, 'No more funding of the Franchising Code Council of Australia. No more funding to assist the dispute resolution process involving franchisees and franchisors.' Yet the committee report that I have referred to makes recommendations at 3.1 about franchising. This minister has a relationship, as a shopping centre owner, with franchisors. He is also a franchisee in his own right with his petrol station. So surely recommendations 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, dealing with franchising in the fair trading inquiry report, must go to that responsibility. So, if the Prime Minister has taken responsibility off him for fair trading, why did he leave you, Minister, with responsibility for franchising? It begs the question: you cut out funding for the Franchising Code Council, and you have a clear interest in franchising because of your shopping centre ownership and your hands on day-today dealing there and, within three days of this report being tabled in the parliament, you gave an interview to the Australian, which states:  rejected calls yesterday by a parliamentary for legislation to regulate the franchise sector. That was three days after the report, yet he is saying, 'Cabinet has not made a decision on this.' But the minister has. Why has he? I think it is the question that was raised today about his interest in the Property Council that goes to that very matter. What he told us is that Prosser Automotive Engineers is a member of the Property Council of Australia. So what? As I said, there were four submissions made by the Property Council of Australia to the parliamentary committee of inquiry looking into fair trading issues. He is a member of it. They were representing him as a member of the Property Council of Australia. You start to say, 'Look, maybe that is not a bad thing. Maybe that is not quite true. Maybe he really is not represented by them, and they do not express his interests.' That might be so, Minister, except on 25 October last at the Hyatt Hotel in Perth you gave a speech to the Property Council of Australia. In that speech on all the retail tenants complaining about landlords-and, Minister, you are a landlord-you said: Many of these complaints are either unfounded or at least one-sided. Mr Kelvin Thomson-He's speaking from experience.",82
155,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"But wait, there's more. He went on to say: It is the government's view that the landlords should be free to exercise their property rights in all but the most exceptional circumstances. The government's view! The inquiry had not even started, but it was the government's view put to the Property Council of Australia that, 'Forget what they say. If it is going to disadvantage landlords, then it is all over, red rover.' We know on franchising that Cash Converters, Chicken Treat, Pizza Hut and Farmer Jack's are all part of his shopping centre complex. Are you going to stand up here, Minister, and tell us there is no conflict of interest between you taking the recommendations of the franchising forward on behalf of this government and the fact that you, as a shopping centre landlord-as an owner of inquiry shopping centres in Bunbury, Western Australia-do not have a conflict of interest? We look forward to that particular contribution. The other thing that I found of some interest in all of this was the revelation today about the very close relationships with the Coles Myer people-a board member of Coles Myer, I might say. We were a bit concerned about the Eaton site in Western Australia. We had heard that it was a greenfield site, the bulldozers went in and all the vegetation got knocked over-against the objections of the locals. The council felt a bit concerned about the member for Forrest. It is not as though this minister could walk down the street of Bunbury and say, 'Gee, I don't recognise that.' He walks down the street of Bunbury and says, 'lawn this. It's all mine.' The council, rightly, was a bit toey about this. Yet, when they had a look at the Eaton site, they saw that there had been a regional plan that was established to look after the interests in terms of planning matters. I know a bit about it, being a former town-planner. Against the objections and against that plan, the minister and his companies lodged the development application, were not satisfied with the result and went to the planning minister. In the consequent wash-up of all of that, approval has been given. The rumours went around that they were looking for a Target store. Who runs Target? Who, do I hear? Coles Myer. Who is one of the directors of Coles Myer? Nick Greiner, Deputy Chairman. Who got on the old dog and bone to Nick Greiner? The minister. You could just hear it, 'Minister, I am ringing up on behalf of my brother Steven, who has one-third of our business interest in Western Australia. Look, I have a small problem.' Mr Leo MCLeay-I need a Target.",84
156,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I need a Target-exactly. Minister, you did not respond to our question about that conversation. We would like to see the letter that subsequently went forth. That would be a very interesting thing for you to table here. We would like to see in your response to us today how a relationship, as was reported even in the West Australian today, where the former Minister for Planning in Western Australia, Mr Lewis, said that he bumped into you sociallyMr Leo MCLeay-He had a drink with him.",85
157,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"He had a drink and a prawn sanger in Perth and said, 'Minister, I understand you have a development application you have a few problems with. Can I help you on this issue?' Now we have Greiner and the planning minister in Western Australia and a greenfield site-wanting development, wanting a Target store on it-and you are going to turn around here and say, 'I haven't breached the Prime Minister's code, Mr Speaker. I haven't had hands on in this at all. I have been on the phone, but I haven't had hands on. I have spoken over a prawn sanger to the planning minister, but I haven't had hands on. I have spoken to my centre managers in Western Australia, and they do not move without asking me what to do, but I haven't had hands on. I haven't used my position as a minister in the federal government to advance my own particular commercial interests.' Not much! Minister, you stand up here and tell us that is not the case. Otherwise you have no alternative than to heed the Western Australian Retailers Association who wrote to your Prime Minister calling for your resignation. You have to heed the call by the United Retailers Association that you should resign. You have to heed the call of the Small Business Advisory Network that you should resign. You have to heed the call of the Small Retailers Association of South Australia that you should resign. You have to heed the call of the Queensland National Federation of Independent Businesses that you should resign. You have to heed the call of the Small Business Persons Association of New South Wales that you should resign. They represent small business. They have no confidence in you. The Australianwithout any prompting, I might say-two days ago, before we got started, called for your resignation, Minister, because they could see there was a conflict. We can see there is a conflict. If the Prime Minister were here, he would see there is a conflict. You should be removed. You should go. You deserve more than censure; you deserve to resign in front of this parliament right now. (Time expired)",85
158,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Is the censure motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (3.38 p.m.)-There is absolutely no conflict of interest. Opposition members-Oh!  same opportunity that the opposition had-to be heard in silence-so that the facts of this matter can be put on the record. More importantly, there was a fair bit of play made on the registration of members' interests so I thought I would look at how others in this place have filled out the interests register. I thought the first thing I should do is look at what the member for Cunningham, one Stephen Paul Martin, has done. When you get to real estate, he has got that some in Wollongong, New South Wales, and in Isaacs, ACT-that is a pretty swishy sort of area. Mr Martin-I am over here; you are the minister.",85
159,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Order! The member for Cunningham has had a fair chance.  Cunningham is pretty vocal. I would have thought that, as the shadow minister for smalI business, he would now start to understand some of the issues that confront smalI business. One issue that does confront small business and one of the issues they are most concerned about is unfair dismissal. I noted in reading an article entitled 'MP in unfair sacking row' in the Herald-Sun of Wednesday, 19 April this year that it said: The former Labor speaker of the House of Representatives, Stephen Martin, unfairly sacked pregnant staff member, the court has found. The opposition have made some play of the registration of members' interests. We go to Martin Ferguson and find that he has got a lot in Melbourne, Victoria. What is it? You do not say. Is it a shopping centre? Is it commercial? It has just got 'investment'. What sort of investment? You are trying to say how to filI these in. I have complied completely. I look at Laurie Brereton-and this is the one you like. What about Laurie? He puts down for his spouse's interest 'None known to me'. Then in the next bit his spouse has a half share. The next one says for his spouse 'None known to me'. So the opposition have a double standard. In government they did not know or did not choose to know. They put down statements like 'None known to me'. On the very point of the company which is the subject of this matter, the properties that the opposition seem so keen on-the Homemaker Centre, Minninup Forum Centre and Leschenault Quay-are alI owned by Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd. On the registration of members' interest it says: 'Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd'. What do they do? What are the activities of the company? They are engine re-manufacturers and property investors. So there is no question. Prosser Managements, another company, is a property investor. Regional Property Investment is also a property investor. Mr Crean-Where does it say that?  members' interests, if you had bothered to check. Mr Leo MCLeay-What does it say under business activities?  the company'. You are trying to run a line here. Mr Crean-Where is the shopping centre?  is not a shopping centre; it is a commercial development. There are only two conventional shopping centres. The important point is that I do own land in my own right. I own three residential properties in Bunbury, a residential a property in Canberra and some other commercial properties. I have listed extra land in my own name as 'Bunbury-various lots'. Look at what the opposition do. They just put the area down. I have complied with the method required to be used. There has never been a question about what I own, what I am involved in or the companies in which I have an interest in my home town. The opposition are trying to run this campaign to cover up for their own lack of policy in the smalI business area, to cover for the fact that they do not have a policy and to cover for the fact that the previous shadow minister for smalI business on the question of the unfair dismissal provisions said that he would reserve his decision about what they would do about it. The new incoming shadow minister said, as I recalI, that he would go and talk to small business. I would love to know the smalI businesses that he spoke to before he turned around and said that they are happy with the unfair dismissal provisions. Shadow minister, I have to tell you that they are not happy. The opposition mentioned a point in regard to the article in the Australian. If you had bothered to check that article in the Australian and checked the Hansard, you would have found the article was very different. If you looked at the quote that the Australian had claimed that I had told parliament and if you looked at the Hansard, you would have seen that I told parliament nothing of the sort. If you are trying to run on a lousy argument such as that, you are not going to go too far at all. In regard to tenancies, they do not understand that sure those companies have tenancies. Of course, they have tenancies. It is of no matter to those companies whether the tenant operates as Billy Bloggs Pizza, Pizza Hut, Chicken Treat or whatever. The companies concerned have tenancies involved whether they are in their own right, in an individual partnership, or in a corporate or company structure. What they do and how they trade is of no consequence in this particular matter whatsoever. In that matter, though, it was appropriate that I discussed with my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) the fact that it would be better if, on the question of tenancy matters, the response to the House of RepresentativesMr Crean-When we caught you 'out.  Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism the fact that to ensure there was no perception of a conflict of interest he should handle",86
160,Unknown,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Opposition members interjecting in this matter. I discussed it with Minister Moore, and he was quite happy to do so. On the matter of franchising, I have to tell the opposition that it was this government that set up the House of Representatives inquiry into franchising. We did so in May last year. Unlike the previous government, we did not put fences around it. We did not say, 'You can't come and tell us that.' We did not tum around and say, 'Oh, gee, don't tell us what we don't want to hear. Don't embarrass us,' Remember that the previous Labor government had a lot of shots at doing something about franchising. It is pretty Johnny-comelately. You had 13 years to do something and you did nothing. You whacked up a bill, got it out as an exposure draft, waved the exposure draft around and said, 'We're going to look at it. We're going to legislate.' But they did not, did they? They did not bother to go ahead with the bill. They did not legislate. They dropped it. They did not go ahead with it because they recognised it probably was not going to work-it was going to cause more problems than it would fix. What did they do next? They went to a voluntary code. They set up the Franchising Code Council. What is the line that you are trying to run? That we cut off the funds. You gave the council $375,000 in your last year of office. In our first year we gave them $648,000 and committed another $152,000 for the next year$800,000 over two years. That is one hell of a cut: $375,000 to $800,000. It is a question of analysing the fair trading report properly and the government making an informed response to that particular inquiry. We will do so. We will look at those issues in regard to small business so that when we come to respond to that report it will be an informed response that does not disadvantage any part of small business or, of course, those operating in franchising. We did set up the inquiry and allow people to put their concerns on the record. I have consistently said that, in that particular area, people have the opportunity to do so-and they have done so. The opposition, the Labor Party, is jumping to conclusions. The government has not responded to the report. Another report that I recall-the Beddall report, I think it was-was two years in the making. How long did it take you to respond? It took you 11 months to respond. Our report came down in 12 months, and we will respond in three months. There is no conflict of interest. My House of Representatives disclosure shows the companies. The opposition are mistaken: they do not realise that all three properties that they have mentioned are owned by the companies listed on the register. The companies are listed on the register. The company's role is as a property investor. The opposition has been running the line that the shopping centres somehow fit various lots. That is not so. That is not true. I have been very open and honest. There is no question in regard to the properties that I own in Bunbury. I do not bother to hide them behind fictitious names. It is well known what business interests I have. It was dead easy, even for this grubby mob, to go and find out about these business interests in Bunbury. This is the tactic of the federal Labor Party. The state Labor Party has been on at this for years and made outrageous statements in state parliament. That is the way state Labor operated. Once you were in opposition you picked up the same tactic.",87
161,Unknown,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,88
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Order! The member for Hotham! I have already cautioned you.  ministerial conduct and responsibility, again, I have complied with this guide. Sure, I am very lucky that I have got a brother-who is very close to me and who is involved in my businesses. If it were not for my brother I would never have had the opportunity to enter parliament. No-one could have taken over and run the day-today operations of the businesses in which I am involved without that family link and without that family support. The day-today running operations of the businesses in which I have an interest are controlled by my brother who is the other shareholder and the other director in the company. In regard to the management of the companies, there has always been a company manager. Of course, the daily decision making is controlled by my brother. On that basis, there is absolutely no conflict of interest in this matter. This is yet another smokescreen of the Labor Party. It is a cover for the very poor policy position they have in regard to the small business area. We have brought down the House of Representatives inquiry. We will respond in that area. I have disclosed my interests. In fact, I have complied with the ministerial code. I know that it must irk the Labor Party one hell of a lot that any small businessman can work their backside off, survive and prosper, build a business and make money. I do not make any apology for that because I succeeded in spite of everything that the unions and the Labor Party threw against me. I survived in spite of-as any small business person would remember-the prime rate interest rates under this lot. Interest rates in December 1989 hit 20.5 per cent. Many small businesses were paying 24 and 25 per cent. I survived it. I guess you are lousy because, as a businessman, I survived. I built up a small business. I have never thought to hide those businesses. They are very public in Bunbury. I might add that when the journalists that the shadow minister spoke of were running around the shopping centres, it got to the point where cameras went into the hairdresser's in one of the developments in which I have an interest. My lO-year-old son was having a haircut, and there were the cameras-driven by this lot. Mr Martin-When?  the comment of the member for Batman? That we are peddling drugs in the shopping centre. That kind of comment is a disgrace. You are disgraceful in what you are trying to run here. There is no conflict of interest. I have absolutely complied.",88
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I would like to say to both sides of the House that the censure of a minister is a very serious motion indeed. The level of sound and interjection coming from both sides of the chamber is not in accordance with the standing orders. I ask all of you to behave appropriately.",88
164,Mr CREAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"This is a serious motion and this is a minister who should have resigned last year. And it is a government that cannot protect him any longer. The fact of the matter is that he is a minister who has breached the code of conduct not once but many times. He breached it last year by retaining directorship in Prosser Engineering and then going ahead to make decisions as a fuel distributor when he had responsibility for the diesel fuel rebate. He also advocated publicly a position on petrol temperature correction which advantaged fuel distributors. We wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) twice on this and have never had a satisfactory response. The fact of the matter is that this is a minister who just continues to defy the code of conduct and this is a Prime Minister who so far has allowed him to do it. The point of this motion is to say,'Enough is enough. The code of conduct stands for something or, Prime Minister, tear it up. Don't come in here with your unction and tell us you are going to lift the standards of ministers and then not seek to apply them.' The fact of the matter is that the minister has been in breach on many occasions. The further fact is that every time he has been caught out his answer is to deny that he any longer has responsibility. That was his defence on the petrol issue. It was also his defence the other day on retail tenancy. He had this conversation with Minister Moore to give him the responsibility. Tell us, Minister, when you had that conversation, because that is very important to know. We believe you handed over the responsibility only after question time on Monday, between 3 o'clock and the 7.30 Report, when we exposed you in this House. If it is true that you thought you had a conflict of interest at that point, you have clearly had it at every stage beforehand since you were sworn in as a minister, because you have been dealing as a minister with retail tenancy and franchising issues and have also been effective landlord of three major properties, shopping centres, in Western Australia. I will be interested to know when you also transferred responsibility for franchising to minister for industry. I think we have to ask ourselves the question: are you saying that you have not taken one single decision on retail tenancy since you have been a minister; are you saying that you have not taken one single decision on franchising since you have been a minister? If that is the case, no wonder the business organisations are calling for you resignation. Also, if that is the case, what are you doing? You are earning your salary under false pretences. You are drawing a ministerial salary; you are given responsibilities, and every time you get into trouble you flick them off to someone else. You are gaining your money under false pretences. In this place you have made great play of the fact that you are proud that you are a made person. I congratulate you on that. The Labor Party holds no animosity about that. We welcome it; we encourage it. But the fact of the matter is that when you become a minister you have to make a choice. Your counterpart in the Senate, John Herron, did. He also has an interest that was passionate about-his medical practice. And when the Prime Minister went to him he gave it up, because he knew he had to make a choice. That is what you have to do. It is not that we say that you should never have built a business or that you cannot go back to it when you retire from this place or finish as a minister; it is just that when you are a minister you cannot do both. The reality is that you have wanted the best of both worlds, and you have hidden the extent of your interests to achieve the best of both. That is one of the charges we make of you today. We are not alleging any actual conflict. What we are saying is: all that is required to be covered under the code of conduct is the appearance of conflict. The evidence as it unfolds may prove that it has been actual; we may have some time to go on that. But all that is required is the appearance of conflict for you to have to comply and, having not complied, then resign. That is what Senator Short and Senator Gibson resigned for; not actual conflict, not a proven case of actual conflict. The Prime Minister consistently said the that it was the appearance of conflict, and they went for that reason. You should go too. In terms of the declaration that you have made such a pathetic defence of today in the parliament, let us just go to this: did you tell the Prime Minister that you had these three shopping centres? Did you tell Max MooreWilton? Mr Deputy Speaker, has he told Max Moore-Wilton, who, the Prime Minister said, would run the toothcomb over? You know, when they got into the trouble with Minister Moore and many other ministers after the Short and Gibson resignations, the Prime Minister said he was going to refer these matters to his department head? He also told people on the record-this is the Prime Minister-that he had given his party room, his ministers, a real sounding out as to the self- way they needed to comply in the future. It is a very interesting question, it is all very well to have something on this dec laration of interest, which we say is inadequate given what has developed, but did he tell the Prime Minister and did he tell Max MooreWilton? It is a joke. On the record of interests he has 'Bunbury, various lots'. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, what he did was to get the comma in the wrong place. It should have said 'Bunbury various, lots'. But what we have heard today is that it is not just 'lots', it is 'Bunbury, all'. In an interjection across the table, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) says that it is well known that the minister owns all of Bunbury. So it is not just 'Bunbury, all', it is just 'Bunbury'. Here's the minister with 'lots and lots' but no declaration of the detail of that. Three shopping centres-who owns them? Prosser Automotive Engineers is the principal owner of these things. It is very interesting because the cover-up of this minister does not go just to his declaration of interests in this parliament. It is very interesting to go to the annual return of the company-Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd. Listed under 'principal activities', Minister, is 'automotive engineers' - no mention of property and no mention of three shopping centres. We had to get it out of you in the parliament today that it owns the Homemaker, Minninup Forum and the Keys shopping centres. I would have thought they were reasonably 'principal' activities. What are they worth, Minister? What are you trying to hide in terms of putting under the ownership of automotive engineers a company that you control and which has got three shopping centre properties. What is the minister's defence? He says that he has declared it; it is all there. The problem is it is not all there and the reality that, when we went to this issue last year, because of the fact that it said 'automoti ve engineers' we just assumed that it was in the areas that it defined itself in. How would any reasonable person be expected to think that a company listed as 'automotive engineers' would own three shopping centres? These are three shopping centres owned not by just any minister but the minister who has responsibility for retail tenancy and franchising. Don't you think that constitutes an appearance of conflict of interest? You don't! The fact of the matter is that, even if you do not list the details, there is a further requirement in the declaration of your interests in paragraph 13, which asks if there is: Membership of any organisation where a conflict of interest with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise It is blank in relation to this, Minister, and paragraph 14 asks about: Any other interests where a conflict of interest with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to ari se It is blank again. Not only has he not listed the three shopping centres, he has not listed his membership of the professional organisation that represents the top 100 property centre owners in the country, one of which is Prosser Automotive Engineering. It does not list his membership of that select group in his declaration of interests. We have copped it on this side from the Leader of the House saying, 'Where are you in terms of your conflict of interest as members of trade unions?' The point is that we own up. We put in our declaration of interests that we are members and we are proud of it, but the fact is that we are among hundreds of thousands. He is one of 94. He is one of the top 100 shopping centre owners in this country and he does not declare it in his interests, nor does he declare his membership of an organisation that makes representations to government on his behalf. It is also the point that that organisation of which he is a member made a submission calling for no toughening of the Trade Practices Act and no further legislative underpinning in relation to retail tenancy-a position is that the review that had to hear this thing unanimously recommended should be done. This is the minister who has responsibility for making decisions in relation to that report. So he is a member of an organisation saying 'Don't do it' to himself making the decision. That clearly is a conflict of interest. Minister, let us go to the revelation today: the fact that you had made a phone call to Mr Greiner, not just any director of Coles Myer but the former Premier of New South Wales-another Liberal and another mate. Whom did you want that mate to talk to amongst his mates in Western Australia? Was it the Premier, Richard Court? Was it the former minister for planning, Mr Lewis? We would like to know, but do we hear it from you? No, because your pathetic defence is that you have complied. The fact is you have not complied. Mr Deputy Speaker, the other thing that we would like to know of this minister is: what was the conversation when he rang Mr Greiner as director of Coles Myer? Did he seek the contact specifically of the property manager for Coles Myer? Was the Eaton shopping centre site part of that discussion, and will he table the letter that his brother subsequently sent to Mr Greiner? What this demonstrates, if it demonstrates nothing else-and let us see what the further evidence produces-is that he clearly involved himself in the activities of the business. He cannot come into this place and say that he is not there involved in the day to day business of the operations. I might say that I remember that this was a problem that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) got himself into with Ralsten, but he produced a letter that said that he was divorced from the day to day operations of the business. His letter, from Wilson Wilde, the other shareholder, said: I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities the company during the period mentioned abovethe period being when he is a minister. If your argument, Minister, is that you are not involved in the daily affairs of the company, that you have separated yourself because you became a minister, produce the letter. The minister for industry was required to do it. The Prime Minister required it of him, and he did so. If this is the claim of the minister for small business, then he likewise must produce such a letter. Otherwise, it will be demonstrated that he is again misleading this parliament. The fact of the matter is that he has not produced one iota of evidence today to show that he should not be censured and be forced to resign. He has breached the code of conduct thrice: involving himself in the day-today activities of the business, retaining a directorship against the guidelines and retaining shares in companies that clearly involve a breach of interest, a conflict of interest, because they are shares and directorships associated with issues, amongst other things, of retail tenancy and franchising-clearly - reas within the ministerial responsibility. It IS for that reason that this minister deserves not only to be censured but also to be asl'd by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Ti· Fischer) to resign. If he does not do it, thPrime Minister, between overs at Lords, ought to be watching this with a great deal of concern. He ought to be making the phone call and saying, 'Geoffrey, time is up. We have given you a chance and you have failed.' (Time expired)",88
165,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It does not add to the opposition's case for them to be referring to the trip of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the UK after we heard the details of the sojourn of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) in Bordeaux for a month. When it comes to hypocrisy they spell it with a capital H for you, sport. The look on your face: how we enjoyed question time. The four ministers and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) off to the Savoy for a weekthank you very much-after his criticisms! A very telling aspect of this censure motion is that it is not led by the Leader of the of Opposition. Where is the Leader of the Opposition? Mr Gareth Evans-It's irrelevant. The deputy leader.",91
166,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"The relevant shadow minister says, 'The deputy leader.' I surmise, and I bet you I am close to the mark, that the Leader of the Opposition this morning read the papers and said, 'We have not got much to go on on this Prosser matter, so I think I'll go to Queensland for the day. I think it is more important for me to miss a full day of parliament, to miss the opportunity to run the Prosser matterMr Hardgrave-He's gone to Cairns.",91
167,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I do him a great disservice. I thought he had gone to Brisbane. But it could not be warm enough in Brisbane, so he has gone Cairns. He could not have gone further if he had tried. Mr Crean-He is worried about the sugar industry.",91
168,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Oh, Cheap Jack gives us the interjection, he gives us the justification. says, 'Oh, Kim's worried about sugar.' That is the reason. Not only am I going to respond to the details, but let me make the point: have not been prepared to put up the Leader of the Opposition for this. It is a simple rule in politics: if you do not treat it seriously do not expect anybody else to treat such motions seriously. There has been no breach of the ministerial guidelines. The fact of the matter is that, as the Minister for Small Business and Con tion time today, he is neither a franchisor nor a franchisee. Where is your argument? You're quickly! stunned. All of a sudden, quiet in the chamber. First time today. Half of your case is the minister within his portfolio has responsia bility for franchises, and therefore you say that he has a conflict of interest, but you happen to forget the fact that he is neither franchisor nor a franchisee. He is just not Mr Crean-He may take decisions that relate to it, you dope.",92
169,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Now they say he may decisions which may have an effect on them. The cabinet takes generic decisions which affect all sorts of situations. We took a decihave sion in conformity with an election promise to provide a family tax initiative. It does affect me personally, but I am sure that there are people on our side to whom it has some effect. We took a decision recently-because in the tax system we inherited you pay tax what you earn, you put it in the bank and pay tax again-that, at a time when we are trying to encourage savings, there is a generic benefit for people to take advantage of the savings rebate. That applies to our side their own option as it applies to your own side. It has a generic effect. On this particular matter, he is the minister for small business, but the fact of the matter is that he is neither a franchisor nor a franchisee. The second leg of your claim on the conflict is that the minister has responsibility for tenancy. I heard you say it. The fact of the matter is that, under the Australian constitution, tenancy matters are matters for the state. It is a very simple point to make. You have to establish a link between what he is doing He as the minister and the responsibilities he has and the constitutional position and the matters before him. The fact of the matter is that you tenancy law is a matter for the state. Mr Crean-Well, why did he give it over?",92
170,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"You have effectively admitted my point. Your next point is, 'Why did he give it over?' The answer to that is quite simple. You should not get so excited, Simon. Do I have your full attention? Mr Crean-Absolutely.",92
171,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,Absolutely and completely? Mr Tim Fischer-They will lose it pretty,92
172,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I want to savour the moment that because we do not get it often. We have had report from Mr Reid and his colleagues. The minister has said, as it has recommendajust tions in relation to tenancy, that the a government's response will be handled by the it. senior minister, Mr Moore. The committee has brought down a report. The committee has raised matters. Tenancy law is a matter for the state. They have raised matters and Mr take Moore will handle that matter. In simple language, for all the rhetoric we had from you, he is not a franchisor or franchisee, so you don't get him on that. In not respect of tenancy, that is not a matter of Commonwealth law. It has been raised in a report, so it has been passed to the senior minister for the government's response. We on do not have a government response at this you point. When we have considered the report fully, then we will. That is basically it. Let us look at how you have mounted your censure motion. In the first paragraph you at claim he has breached the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct in that he has been involved in the daily work of a business. I find this a bit far-fetched. The minister is a self-made success story and he has done very well. We are proud to have people on our side of politics who have done well in their businesses. This minister, by the age of 24, had created 80 jobs in the construction industry. By the time you were 24, mate, you had destroyed 80 jobs in the construction industry, and a lot more by the time you got here. He is a successful business person. He has a lot of property interests in Bunbury. Well, good on him. I would like other people who are successful in their businessMr Crean-We have conceded that point.",92
173,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"No, you don't concede that point. Mr Crean-We do concede it.",93
174,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"No, you don't. This is your political attack. We know the way you play the game. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",93
175,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"And so sensitive are they, Mr Deputy Speaker Mr Crean-The minister should not continue to mislead. I did concede that point in my address.",93
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,I caIl the Leader of the House.,93
177,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,They are a sensitive lot. So the first paragraph of the censure motion was about ministerial conduct. Mr Martin-Nick on the line?,93
178,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"We will come to all these matters. The code of ministerial conduct states that ministers must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. What that means, obviously, is that you are not to have a hands-on management of your business. It is clear from the code of ministerial conduct that if you have built up assets, as this minister has, the code of conduct does not require you to dispose of absolutely every last personal asset that you have. It would be a bit of a nonsense, wouldn't it, if you build up a family business, your reward for going to the federal parliament to represent your local people is that you have to seIl absolutely every last thing that you have built up. It is contemplated in the ministerial conduct rules that people will continue to have family assets which they have built up and retain directorships in them. When all is said and done, that is all that this minister has done. You say, 'Oh, well, he's had daily conduct of the affairs of his business.' That is your argument; I heard the minister for Cunningham make that claim; I mean the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). Mr Martin-Peace be with you, my son.",93
179,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It will be a long time before you are a minister, and it won't be here! Their evidence of his regular hands-on management of his business is an article in the Melbourne Herald-Sun, is it? ",93
180,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It is by Michael MCKinnon. The headline is-and it is not a bad headline: 'MP landlord praised'. The article states: He's a very good landlord; he lives just around the comer from the shop. I would rent from him again without a moment's hesitation. The claim is: If we have a problem, we go to Colin and he sometimes says that he has to check with Geoff to see what he thinks. Mr Crean-Not Stephen, his brother, but Geoff.",93
181,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"The fact of the matter is that that does not refer to the time. As the minister says, that has not been the situation since he has been a minister. It is a pretty obvious explanation. You do not accept it, but it is a pretty obvious explanation. The second one is a quote. I love this one; it is unbelievable; it shows how out of touch you people are. You say, 'Oh, there's a quote from the minister.' I do not have the exact words, but it is to the effect of, 'Oh, I've seen the forms go through and I know how much red tape there is in small business.' And you say, 'Oh, proof positive that he's managing his business day to day.' How out of touch are you to have absolutely no understanding of the matter. All he is doing is expressing and articulating a problem that many hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country have to deal with every day, and that is a pile of red tape in which you bound every small business in this country basically to prevent them giving other people jobs. That is the flimsiest piece of evidence ever produced. In a real court of law, they would drum you out and take your ticket from you. There is no breach of ministerial guidelines. The other aspect which they seem so concentrated on is the disclosure the minister made in his House of Representatives registry statement. That is a pretty reasonable statement. In fact, it complies. The interesting thing is you have never objected to this statement before. That statement has been on the public record since March last year. If you reckon that it did not comply, why didn't we hear about it before? Mr Crean-Because we did not know he had shopping centres. Because he hid them.",93
182,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It is the second time in my political career that I have listened to the other side and there is no response. Why is there no response? It is obvious-there is no response from them because the fact is that the minister has fully complied with the requirements. Those opposite have referred to my aside and to my interjection across the bar tableand I am sure the minister will not mind me saying that. But the fact of the matter is that the minister's business success is well known in Bunbury-in fact, the bloke in the MCKinnon article says that. People refer to that fact. The fact is that, because he is a good landlord and he lives there and is known around the street, people know what the minister has done over the years in B unbury. There is no surprise about any of this. Not only is he a good member, but he also has a good reputation as a small business person in Bunbury. After going through all of the things that have been said, the reality is that he is not in breach of the guidelines. He has complied with the requirements for members to register their interests. Basically, that ought to be the end of it. The opposition have also raised aMr Crean-You're not very well prepared for this.",94
183,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It is not a matter of not being prepared for it. It is just a matter of it having taken me only six minutes to completely demolish you, and I now just want to go over it and complete the job. The minister today, in answer to questions, gave a complete statement of those property interests of his and his family. Sure, he has his brothers running his family companies. I say that we are proud to have people who have been a success. It is important for the small business community to support this minister, because it is important to have somebody in the government who actually knows about small business. One of the problems we had with having you in office for 13 years was that you never had any sense of understanding of what the small business community was confronting. I will tell you why we are committed to small business: it is the backbone of the private sector in this country; it is the future for hundreds of thousands of young people to get jobs; and it is an element of our community which deserves support. We reject this motion. (Time expired) Question put: That the motion (Mr Martin's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.28 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

Is the Deputy Speaker aware that the NOES Senate has published the details of questions on notice, the number, the time it has taken to answer the questions and the percentage answered within the time by each portfolio? Will he undertake to publish similar information for the House and do so on a regular basis, as the Senate will? Further, will he consider writing to the Procedure Committee seeking their advice on the time taken to answer questions on notice--currently at 60 days-being reduced to 30 days and harmonise answers to questions on notice with the Senate?",94
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. I was not aware of what the Senate was doing. I will certainly refer your question to Mr Speaker, who I am certain will provide you with an answer. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade",95
185,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SPEAKER,"I have a question, Mr Deputy Speaker, for you to convey to the Speaker. It goes to the relationship between members of the House and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It relates to the matter raised today and the answer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs today. We are encouraged by the government to liaise with Foreign Affairs when we are visiting other countries. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a question which is simply put to disguise the member's complaint about matters which occurred during PAIRS question time, but the relationship between individual members and departments of state is certainly not within the jurisdiction of the Speaker.",95
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I thank the Leader of the House. I will hear the question.,95
187,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SPEAKER,It goes to the question of the privacy of members of the House in relationship to the Department of Foreign Affairs.,95
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Bearing in mind, of course, that the Speaker's guidelines provide for a question to be succinct and not include any debate, and I am sure the member for Newcastle will abide by that.",96

190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I do not need any background. Could I just have the question, please?",96

194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I invite you to resume your seat. I understand the question fully. It would be my opinion and ruling as Deputy Speaker that this is not within the purview of the Speaker. But, of course, if he wishes to revisit the matter, he can. It is not the position of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to make comments or decisions regarding the relationship between individual members and departments. Mr Allan Morris-I asked you if you would pass the question on to the Speaker, rather than rule on it.",96

199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,96
200,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It goes to the Hansard of yesterday at page 5475. As I indicated to the Speaker prior to question time today, I had cause to request Hansard to investigate whether or not they had accurately reflected an interjection by me in question time yesterday. Hansard has advised me that, on examination of the sound record, the interjection is inaudible. On that basis, I would seek to make it entirely clear that the interjection as recorded at page 5475-1I have had this confirmed by a number of my colleagues and I know in my heart that I said it-should be 'They're probably selling them in his shopping centres.' On the basis of the precedent relating to a similar situation concerning the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)",96
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think you should show where you believe you have been misrepresented.,96
202,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This is my only opportunity to correct the record. In doing so, I want to make it abundantly clear",96

205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Resume your seat. I thank the honourable member for Batman for his personal explanation. I must say to him that Mr Speaker also had the matter investigated by Hansard and would confirm that the interjection by you on the tape was inaudible. However, the senior reporter present at the time wrote down what you said in shorthand and later transcribed it and believes that the Hansard, as it stands on that page for yesterday, is correct. Should you disagree with that, you are always at liberty to cont(lct Mr Speaker to ask him to have another look at it. But the information Mr Speaker has from Hansard is that the statement is correct.",96
206,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On the personal explanation, I make it abundantly clear that, to my way of thinking, Hansard does not accurately reflect what I said, but, more importantly, because it affects not only myself",97
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You are not adding any new material to this.,97
208,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think it needs to be abundantly clear because it just does not affect myself but also affects the minister for small business.,97
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Look, I am sorry. You have shown where you believe you have been misrepresented. As I have said, and I have made the offer, if you believe that that is still incorrect, I will certainly ask Mr Speaker to have the matter looked at again.",97
210,Mr KERR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point is order is thus: the member was making a personal explanation pointing out where he believed he was misrepresented and correcting the record. Following that, you made certain further remarks to suggest that the member was in fact incorrect in relation to what he was asserting. I find it passing strange that the processes of the House have been so abused. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: I believe the member should withdraw that comment because he has said that you have abused the process of the House by the comments that you have made. The only comment that you made was that you also have had the matter investigated.  Mr Reith-He did. He said that he had had the matter",97
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"That Mr Speaker had the matter investigated. Mr Reith-Sorry, that the matter was investigated and that the response was that the Hansard person believed that what appeared in Hansard was a correct transcription of the words that they had written down at the time. That is what I understand to be the case. I do not think the matter should be allowed to go any further. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order which might help us with this issue. Interjections that people make are not sent to them for correction or checking by Hansard, unlike the speech that a person makes. So a person does not get a chance to contradict it until some time later. The member for Batman was genuinely trying to be generous in his comments to the minister. Maybe if you gave him half a minute's indulgence he could put that on the record. It would reflect well upon him and the minister and the House. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: my point of order is that there is no provision in the standing orders for the matter to be further debated. He has shown where he believes he was misrepresented. On that basis, there is nothing further under the standing orders which provides you with an opportunity to allow him effectively to debate it. The facts are that, whatever exactly the words were, the shadow minister attempted to slur the name of the minister. It was a shameful act. Now that he has complied with the standing orders, that should be the end of it. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Mr Leo MCLeay-Now you can make a personal explanation. Seek leave to make a personal explanation now on him.",97
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member for Watson will resume his seat.,97
213,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make a personal explanation on the comments just made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith).,97

239,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I was commenting on the comments made in the second reading debate by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) as to the process by which the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill came to be debated at this particular juncture. The member is asserting that the government has mishandled the timing of the debate, but we totally reject that suggestion. I make a number of points in reply. A number of months ago, my office discussed with the office of the shadow Attorney-General the reference of the provisions of the bill to the Senate committee, the timing of its report as well as the timing of the debate in the House of Representatives. At one point, Senator Bolkus's office requested that debate in the House not occur until after the Senate committee had reported. My office indicated the government's desire for passage of the legislation as soon as possible to overcome difficulties that the previous government had in fact sought to overcome itself. Senator Bolkus's office took that comment on board, and we did not hear anything more about it. At the initial stage of the reference to the Senate, the Senate fixed a report date considerably in advance of the reference. It was some date in April. Even that was not achieved. It is now due to report some time in this month. Given the length of time the bill has been in the public domain-a period of I think more than six months now-we simply reject the suggestion that it ought to be postponed any longer, and I have already indicated that the hearings by the Senate committee have been completed. What we do not know only at this point is what recommendations that committee will make. The member for Banks also lamented the failure of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to consider the legislation. He would know as well as anybody that the legislation is usually referred to one or other of the committees. In this particular case, the Senate committee was the one chosen. He would also know very well that the reference to the House committee does not prevent it being referred to the Senate committee, and there may well be duplication. In this case it was not seen as appropriate that there be duplication, it being anticipated that the legislation would largely be uncontentious. It was seeking to do what the previous government itself had sought to do. The member for Banks seemed to suggest at one point in his speech that the bill tuted part of an agenda for dismantling the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. He seemed to suggest that it was the government's policy that if Labor did it it must be changed. The simple response to that rather wild assertion is that the amendments contained in this bill are necessary to respond to the decision of the High Court in the Brandy case and the restructuring of the commission to strengthen the role of the president. They are initiatives which follow from a report commissioned by the previous government. The reforms in the bill are consistent with the views expressed in relation to the direction of the commission by the previous government when in government. Turning to the debate, I indicated it was wide ranging. In fact, it did not deal with specific provisions of the bill to any great extent at all. Broader issues were focused upon. In particular, reference was made by a number of members to the current racism debate and the role of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in relation to that. Reference was also made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on separated children. Reference was also made to foreshadowed budget cuts to the HREOC budget. I do not propose to comment on the first two matters that I mentioned except, in relation to the first, to mention that there was a speech by the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) in which he canvassed issues in relation to the current racism debate. I note that he drew commendation from both sides of the House for his contribution. In relation to the budget cuts, this was the subject of debate earlier today when the Attorney-General's Department appropriations under Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98 were considered in the Main Committee. In relation to that, let me just briefly mention that the government is committed to a strong and independent federal human rights body. Any reduction in funding is not reflective of a lack of commitment to human rights nor is it politically motivated. The changes simply reflect a need across government to ensure that, in difficult financial times, funds are constiapplied and directed in an efficient and streamlined manner. The commission's growth over the last decade has been disproportionate to that of other areas of government. Over the past nine years, funding to the commission has increased from about $4 million to more than $20 million-a 500 per cent increase. )ver the same period, staff numbers increased from about 51 to 200-exceeding at one stage even 220. The reduction to the commission's funding in the 1997-98 year is in real terms only the four per cent efficiency saving applicable to all agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio. Legislation currently before the parliament is the government's first step to improve the structure of HREOC and its operations. The legislation is consistent with changes previously foreshadowed by the Labor government. On that basis, any suggestion of a political motivation for it must be rejected. The further reduction in the commission's funding for subsequent years-1998, 1999 and beyond-amounts in real terms to about 27 per cent. Given the 500 per cent increase over the last nine years-this has to be seen in context-it is a significant reduction, but there is a great deal of room within the commission for efficiencies. If the commission acted in a more corporate and collegiate manner, then it would not need anything like the budget it has nor would it need anything like the staff numbers. The government-and I have stated this publicly in the past-will be giving further consideration to reform of the structure of HREOC. I hope to bring recommendations before the parliament within a few months. The reforms under way and those to be brought will strengthen the role of HREOC as an independent watchdog. Australians will continue to have the ability to make complaints under federal anti-discrimination laws. I tum to the bill. The bill has two main functions. The first function is to respond to the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. In that decision, the High Court found that the commission, as a non-judicial body, did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. Its second function is to amend Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation to reform the administration functions and structure of the commission. These reforms are designed to enhance the protection and promotion of human rights of all Australians and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of HREOC The member for Banks and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) have criticised the bill on the ground that it will make it more difficult for persons alleging discrimination to pursue their issue. This criticism is based on some factors, such as the more formal nature of the Federal Court proceedings, exposure to an adverse costs order and payment of various court fees. In response to those assertions, let me make some points. First, the existing system is, as already explained, unsatisfactory because there are potentially three levels of dispute resolution: conciliation, the commission hearing and, if the hearing leads to a determination of a complainant, enforcement in the Federal Court by way of a hearing de novo. Under the proposed scheme it is envisaged that there will be a human rights registry of the Federal Court and that many matters will be referred not necessarily to judges but to judicial registrars. Although subject to review by the Federal Court judges, decisions of judicial registrars are enforceable if no review is sought. I am advised that there has been ongoing liaison between the commission and the court to develop user-friendly procedures. In relation to matters to be referred to judicial registrars, although this is ultimately a matter for the court, as I said, decisions are enforceable on their own merits if no review is sought. Secondly, although it is true that the usual rules as to payment of fees in the Federal Court will apply-and that would be the case should it be necessary for a person to initiate enforcement proceedings-fees apply to enforcement proceedings under the present regIme. Ms Macklin-Which have gone up under your government-haven't they?",102
240,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"They have gone up under our government. The government is pursuing a proposal under which the people who use courts will pay for the use of them. However, people who cannot afford to pay for them will not be required to. In the Family Court, 40 per cent of litigants do not pay because they are either on benefits or can demonstrate hardship. The same principles will apply in the Federal Court. The current jurisdiction of the Federal Court has few people in that category because it is generally a court for business and government rather than a court for the ordinary litigant, but the same rules will apply when the court deals with human rights matters. Thirdly, the bill contains a number of initiatives designed to reduce formality in the Federal Court proceedings and possibly lead to less reliance on legal representation. The government believes the proposed scheme strikes an appropriate balance to provide people with access to a remedy for discrimination and the desirability of parties thinking seriously about the manner in which they conduct themselves during the course of a complaint once it becomes necessary to consider involvement in Federal Court proceedings. The opposition-typically for bills in the Attorney-General's portfolio-have indicated they will move amendments in the Senate. I say typically, because in the Attorney General's portfolio area the opposition position on the bill is rarely explained in this House. We have to wait until the Senate considers the legislation before we hear what the opposition's view is. The government will consider any amendments that the opposition seeks to move in the Senate. It will also consider on their merits any recommendations made by the Senate committee when it eventually gets around to reporting. I will briefly mention some of the comments made by individual members. The member for Jagajaga has a constituent with a particular difficulty. In the interests of time. I will not explain it, just to say that the bill overcome that problem. Ms Macklin-Except for the fees she will have to pay.",104
241,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"If she is able to demonstrate hardship she will not have to pay fees. I welcome the comments of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) in support of a proposal I have floated in relation to the establishment of a federal magistracy. If that is able to be established, that would overcome a lot of the problems that are raised in argument against the use of the Federal Court. There would be additional informality.  the merits of the Brandy decision. I do not want to comment on that. He also sought some legal advice in relation to the difference between judicial and administrative decisions. I invite the attention of the member· for Chifley to the report of the Brandy case where there is something of an explanation of the nature of judicial power as distinct from executive power. The report is in volume 183, Commonwealth Law Reports at page 245. The relevant passage is at pages 256 and 257 in the judgments of Chief Justice Mason and Justices Brennan and Toohey. One of the differences between the tribunals he mentioned-the Social Security Appeal Tribunal and the Immigration Review Tribunal-is the enforcement mechanism which was in focus in the Brandy case.  question of spurious claims being brought before the commission. I think he had in mind the experiences of constituents. I think the procedures that are proposed in relation to bringing proceedings in the Federal Court will probably prevent spurious claims being pursued significantly by prospective litigants. They will have to think twice before going to the Federal Court. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) seems to think that the government has merged the roles of the Privacy Commissioner and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. That is not right. The Privacy Commissioner is acting on an interim arrangement only, and the government intends to appoint a Sex Discrimination Commissioner. (Extension of will time granted) I am indebted to the House and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) was quick to point out something that has been a matter of debate in the House in the past, that really the Labor government was at fault that the Brandy decision was brought down. In the debate on the amendments-I think it was in 1993 or 1994 or thereabouts that the amendments were enacted-it was pointed out by speakers, including me, that there was a prospect that the amendments would be held to be unconstitutional. It was, therefore, really not very surprising to a number of people that they were. I am indebted to the member for Fisher also for his defence of the budget cuts. The member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel)wrongly, I think-asserted that there had been a lack of consultation on the bill. I think his misapprehension is based on a lack of knowledge of what had gone on in the development of the bill and that it was to a large degree built upon a bill that had been created by the previous government. The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) asserted that more legal aid will be required and suggested that inadequate funds had been set aside. That is really a separate debate on legal aid. Again, that subject was canvassed in the debate in the Main Committee this morning on the Attorney-General's appropriations under Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98, which has now been passed. She also raised the question of cuts to HREOC. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) raised mainly the issue of the separated children report, about which I do not propose to say anything in this particular debate. He also referred to a tax on the High Court. That is an additional subject. I think he was the only one to mention it. I do not propose to say anything about that either. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) raised issues relating to access to the court which I think were raised in a different form by other speakers. I have already commented on that. I am indebted to the members who have spoken for their interest. I think there is a genuine interest in the work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I hope there will be a genuine interest and a constructive contribution when we come to debate further proposals for reform of the structure of HREOC which in the government's view are necessary. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",105

These amendments provide for transitional arrangements for complaints which have been lodged with the commission but which will not have been completed at the commencement of the new legislation. In summary, the transitional arrangements provide that a complaint which has progressed through the initial inquiry and conciliation stage and has commenced a substantive hearing with the commission will remain to be determined under the existing law. All complaints which have not commenced a substantive hearing prior to the commencement of the new law will be transferred to the new regime at the appropriate stage in the process. The transitional arrangements have been developed in such a way as to minimise the impact on parties who have reached significant stages in the existing complaints process, while also taking into account the need to address the problems highlighted in the High Court's decision in Brandy and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In addition, the government amendments include a number of minor consequential amendments and savings provisions which either supplement or make corrections to the original bill.

244,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 seeks to amend the provisions of the Health Insurthose ance Act 1993 which relate to the professional services review scheme. The national health insurance system we have in Australia, comreferrals monly known as Medicare and widely loved by the Australian community, requires firm but fair policing of any attempts to defraud the taxpayer or any attempts by medical practitioners to overservice. It is the responsibility of the national government to make sure that there is that fair policing of any attempts to misuse taxpayers' money. This responsibility was recognised by the previous Labor government, which moved to establish the professional services review scheme. The introduction of that scheme was supported by the then opposition. In the same manner, these reforms which the Howard government is seeking to introduce will have the support of the Labor opposition. We believe that these reforms will clarify and the professional services review scheme. I add at this stage that I am grateful to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Department of Health and Family Services for the detailed briefing that they have provided to the oppoon sition on the legislation. The bill contains the following key elements. The first removes the provisions which allow the determining officer to impose a fine on medical practitioners found to have engaged in overservicing-that is, to clarify any concern regarding inappropriate use of judicial power. The only financial penalties then are those relating to the repayment of The second key element allows for an increase in the maximum periods of disqualification to three years full or partial exclusion from access to medical benefits. The third element allows committees to have access to documents, subject to appropriate privacy provisions, prior to the hearing. The fourth element clarifies a possible confusion that the committee may use sampling techniques in assessing a practitioner's conduct but may not choose to use such a technique. There was some concern, some legal advice, which might suggest that in some way the committee is obliged to use sampling techniques. This amendment makes sure that that confusion is removed. The fifth element allows a greater range of to appropriate professional bodies, where inappropriate conduct is discovered. All these changes are likely to improve the Commonwealth's ability to fairly but firmly police Medicare and they therefore have the Labor Party's support. I am pleased to note that these changes will not be retrospective, something which I could not say about every piece of legislation that this minister and this government have introduced in the last 12 months or so--in particular, the legislation on provider numbers for doctors in training.

245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Bringing Them Home",112
246,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that members of the opposition have been taking advantage of the opportunity during the adjournment debate to read into the record, and hopefully for the small number of people who might be listening to parliament, some of the records that were provided for the Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, which gave rise to the report known as Bringing them home. I am one of those people who believe that, as to the separation of those children at that time, those decisions-and I think that most people probably agree-were often made in good faith. But the fact is that the decisions were wrong. They were appalling, there were disgraceful and they were grotesque. They affected little children who were physically tom away from their parents and away from their families, and who were subjected to emotional, physical and sexual abuse of the grossest kinds. As I say, we have taken the opportunity to read into the record some of these accounts. Let me read into the record, for the benefit of those people who may be listening, the evidence that was given about and by a person known as Carol: [Carol's grandmother was removed to Beagle Bay at the age of 10. She and her husband had 10 children. When her husband was transferred to the Derby leprosarium, all ten children were placed the Beagle Bay dormitories. Carol's mother was 8 years old when she was removed. Carol was born in Broome in the mid-19S0s. When she was three, her mother died leaving four children. Although her grandmother was still alive, Carol and her siblings were removed to the Beagle Bay dormitories. Carol spent the next 14 years there.] Five generations of my family have been affected by removal of children. Four generations of my family have been removed from their mothers and institutionalised. Three generations of my family have been put into Beagle Bay Mission dormitories. Four generations of my family went without parental love, without mother or father. I myself found it very hard to show any love to my children because I wasn't given that, so was my mother and grandmother. When I think back on my childhood days-sad, lonely and unloved childhood days-we should have been treated better than we were by the Church. We were mistreated badly. I was abused by the missionaries from all angles-sexual, physical and mental. I am a strong person in myself. I had to be strong, I had no-one to tum to, no-one to guide me through life. 6.30am every morning, straight from bed, we had to kneel and say our morning prayers. 7am we had to go to church for mass. If we didn't we would be punished, like going without a piece of bread for breakfast or get the strap or whipped on our palms. 7.30am we had to thank God before and after our breakfast. 8.30am before and after class we said our prayers. lOam we had to say another prayer before we had our cups of milk and morning tea break. II am we had catechism taught to us which was part of praying and learning the history of our church. 12pm again we said our prayers before and after our lunch. 1pm we said another prayer before and after class. Spm we prayed again before and after our supper. 6pm most times we had to go to church for Benediction or rosary. 7pm we would kneel and say the last prayer of the day, which was our night prayers. We were locked up every night. Also during the day on weekends and public holidays. That was only when we didn't go out on picnics. 7am breakfast-very light which was only sago with milk or most times porridge. lOam morning tea time: one cup of Carnation milk. 12am lunch, very light sometimes one piece of bread covered with lard along with a small piece of boiled meat. We loved it all the same. Spm supper, very light which was 'bubble-bubbles' which was only flour, sugar and water, and if we were lucky we would have a piece of fruit. We had nothing else to eat, only if we stole vegetables from the garden. We had two big in vegetable gardens. Every vegetable was grown there yet we were never given any. We never had vegetables. Things that we never saw on our meal table yet were sold elsewhere from Beagle Bay Mission. When it was my tum to work in the convent kitchen I saw that all the vegetables that our people grew were on their meal tables. Everyone would think we were doing the laundries for a big hospital, how many times and how we washed the missionaries' laundry. Every Sunday evening we had to soak the missionaries' laundry. Every Monday morning we washed clothes by hands or scrubbing board. We then had to rinse and put it into the big boilers. Then rinsed, then starched, then rinsed, then squeezed and hung out to dry. We had to iron all the clothes, plus mending and darning. Carol goes on to detail some grotesque experiences that she had. We have suggested that, while people perhaps now should feel no personal guilt, it does not take very much for us to say to those poor people who are still alive, because it was still taking place up to 20 years ago, 'We are sorry'. (Time expired) RAAF Base, Richmond",112
247,Mr BARTLETT,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (5.35 p.m.)I rise tonight to respond to a shameful piece of deceit, deceit framed as a question during the last question time on Thursday of the last sitting week of parliament. The question by the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) pertained to Richmond RAAF Base, a central feature of my electorate of Macquarie. In his question, the member for Fowler referred to the: . . . government's announced closure and sale of RAAF Richmond, contained in the defence efficiency review ... This is totally wrong, but not only is it wrong, it is far worse: it is either a case of appalling ignorance or of blatant dishonesty. Either the member for Fowler had not bothered to read the defence efficiency review, to which he so loosely referred, in which case such a statement was grossly irresponsible, or else he was aware of its contents and deliberately chose to distort it. Either way, it is a pathetic and unabashed case of scaremongermg. Labor is determined to try and score points regardless of the truth, regardless of the facts and regardless of the anxiety they create in the broad community. For the record again and for my constituents in the electorate of Macquarie, the facts are these: the government has not announced the closure of RAAF Richmond and the government has not decided to sell RAAF Richmond. The defence efficiency review merely indicated a number of properties whose usefulness would be evaluated in the medium term. The comments by the member for Fowler were totally and completely misleading. The RAAF base is central to the economy and the culture of the Hawkesbury. It employs 3,000 people, including 200 defence civilians. In addition, another 100 contractor personnel are employed by other industries on the base. A substantial number of ADF personnel reside in the Hawkesbury-Nepean region-either on the base, in Defence Housing Authority housing or in private housing and others in local privately owned homes. They spend their pay packets in the local community, their children attend school in the local community and many of their spouses work in the local community. In short, they are a part of the community of the Hawkesbury. In all, the RAAF Richmond base brings about $2 million a week into the local economy. These are the direct benefits. The indirect spin-offs in employment, income and job generation are enormous. Clearly, for these reasons, RAAF Richmond is essential to the Hawkesbury, essential to its economy and central to its community. Its closure would be, in a word, devastating . This fact is obvious to anyone who lives in the Hawkesbury. What is needed on this issue is a careful analysis of the facts, not the cheap dishonest fear campaign of the member for Fowler and other Labor members obsessed with short-term political point scoring. I might add that on defence issues Labor's credentials are hardly what one would describe as impressive. Under Labor, defence spending as a percentage of government outlays declined until it had reached an unacceptable level. The former government sold $180 million worth of Defence properties in its last five years and short-listed another $500 million worth of properties for sale. In its own white paper some years earlier it had raised doubts about the future of RAAF Richmond. Labor has no credibility at all on issues of defence or, for that matter, on any other issue. It certainly has no credibility on the issue of RAAF Richmond. The approach by the member for Fowler on this question is the same approach we have seen time and time again from Labor--cheap scaremongering, deceitful misrepresentation and total disregard for the concerns of the community. These tactics have come to dominate this opposition. When they have a record they are ashamed of, when they have no constructive policies to present and when they have nothing else to offer they resort to fear and deceit. Their response to the future of Richmond RAAF base is typical of such an approach-an approach that we have seen in the last year from Labor to cover for their own shameful lack of policy. When an opposition has nothing constructive to say, no positive policy alternatives, and nothing to offer the voters of this country it does what Labor is continuing to do: it resorts to deceit, dishonesty and fear. On the issue of RAAF Richmond, as on most issues, the opposition stands condemned by its own record, tactics and dishonesty. Kyi, Aung San Suu Bringing Them Home",113
248,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I will refer to two matters in this adjournment debate: first, the 52nd birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and, second, evidence on the inadequacy of mental health services in the Wilson report, Bringing them home. Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon on 19 June 1945. The Australia Burma Council has organised celebratory messages and greetings to be sent to her on this day. I much regret that it was not possible to find time in this House to debate, however briefly, a congratulatory notice of motion put down by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and me. The Australia Burma Council said: It would be encouraging also for the Australian Parliament to pass a motion supporting Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and for the media to give Burma special attention on this day. Amidst the turmoil of increased political oppression, slavery and the recent death in custody at the hands of the SLORC of National League for Democracy's, Monywa Tin Shwe, the world's most admired political leader and pro-democracy campaigner, Nobel Laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who turns 52 next week, will never give up fighting for the freedom of her people. Denied access to her husband and children for more than a year, she will once again celebrate her birthday alone. Aung San Suu Kyi was the daughter of the great Burmese nationalist politician Aung San who was born around 1914. He became the recognised leader of Burma immediately after World War II and formed the first government-and then, along with several other of his ministers, he was assassinated. At that stage Suu Kyi was two years old. She went into exile with her mother. She was educated in India and Burma and worked for the UN in New York. She was exiled by the military government of Ne Win. She returned to Burma in 1988 and became the leader of the National League for Democracy. Although she was placed under house arrest in 1989, her party won the May 1990 elections, gaining 81 per cent of the seats. As we know, the army refused to cede power and she remained under house arrest until July 1995, attracting international support for her cause. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and the Simon Bolivar Peace Prize of UNESCO. I visited Rangoon on 18 and 19 March in an attempt to see Suu Kyi, bearing greetings from her husband, Dr Michael Aris, whom I have met several times in various continents and regard as a friend, and her son Kim whom I also met in Oxford a few days earlier. The situation with Suu Kyi when I was there was that she remained under virtual very house arrest. The telephone has a terrible habit of dropping out, so it is impossible for her to sustain contact with the outside world. Her husband had gone for over a fortnight without being able to speak with her. She is forbidden to have a satellite based mobile phone. When I went up with the officials from the embassy on three occasions, we were turned away by soldiers, police and officers of the SLORC. Each time a cameraman appeared from behind a bush and took photographs of us all, details of our names and who we were. It is a very oppressive situation. I know that Suu Kyi had been advised that I was about to attend. I hope she was looking forward to the visit, as I certainly was. She is, for practical purposes, denied free access. I quote a terrible paragraph from Bringing them home, under 'Mental health services': ... the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party ... concluded that, Mental distress is a common and crippling problem for many Aboriginal people and appropriate services are a pressing need. Advances in the understanding and treatment for mental health problems have been impressive since World War II; this progress has yet to benefit Aboriginal people. Culturally priate services for Aboriginal people are virtually non-existent. Mental health services are designed and controlled by the dominant society for the dominant society. The health system does not recognise or adapt programs to Aboriginal beliefs and law, causing a huge gap between service provider and user. As a result, mental distress in the Aboriginal munity goes unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated ... (Time expired) Old Sydney Town",114
249,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House my concerns, and the concerns of many Central Coast residents, about the obvious deterioration of one of the most significant regional tourist attractions, and an important piece of our heritage, situated in my electorate of Robertson. This facility is called Old Sydney Town and it is situated at Somersby, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. I would like to preface my remarks by recording my strong support for and firm commitment to the Old Sydney Town complex. My comments tonight are not in any way designed to denigrate the complex or in fact to cause them any adverse publicity. The concerns raised by Central Coast residents, and also raised by some staff members at Old Sydney Town, have now reached a level where action must be taken to secure the future of this magnificent place. Old Sydney Town is situated on a parcel of land owned by the New South Wales Labor government. The attraction itself is also owned by the New South Wales state government, but it is leased to an overseas based entertainment company. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have had a long association with Old Sydney Town. In fact, from the very first days after it opened, in my younger days in one of my many business ventures, I had reason to visit Old Sydney Town on a daily basis for many years. I witnessed first hand the growth of this very important heritage program. In September 1983, as the then Liberal candidate for the state seat of Peats, I called on the Labor government to secure the future approof Old Sydney Town because I was alarmed at the deterioration that I had seen in the park. I was determined to save this most valuable resource for future generations and, at that time in particular, for the 1988 bicentennial celebrations. In November 1983, the state government responded to my call to secure com- the future of Old Sydney Town by announcing a five-year plan which would secure the future of the complex. In 1985, the then New South Wales Minister for Tourism and Sport, Mike Cleary MP, called for tenders to lease the theme park. Later, the minister announced that the successful lessee-Far East Hotels and Entertainment Pty Ltd-had guaranteed somewhere between $15 million and $20 million to revamp the park. In addition to that, the minister also approved up to $5 million from state government moneys to further assist the program. Mr Deputy Speaker, where has that money gone? Was in fact any money ever provided from either party, and what was it used for? The Australian community demands answers to these questions, and they certainly deserve answers to these questions. Amongst the promises made by the minister, and as a result of the lease agreement, was that the historic church should be completed; that was in 1985. As a member of the Kariong-Somersby Rotary Club, which meets every Friday morning at Old Sydney Town, I have a reason to regularly drive past that church, and I can assure honourable members and the Australian public that the church is still in the same state that it was in in 1985, with no roof, no windows and totally incapable of providing dry or shaded areas for tourists to watch the programs and shows that take place inside that church. There are also areas of the park which are closed off because they are not safe for the public. I well remember the many weddings and functions that used to take place on the vessels Perseverance and Contest, which were moored in the harbour at Old Sydney Town. The Perseverance used to be a beautifully rigged twin-mast vessel and it was very popular for those sorts of activities; it was also used extensively by Australian film crews. The masts are now gone and all that is left is one decaying mast sticking up in the middle of a rotting hull. The other vessel, the Contest, has sunk. Old Sydney Town is manned by many loyal and dedicated staff who, week after week, toil to ensure the standards of Old Sydney Town are kept to the best that they possibly can be. But they are concerned; they are distressed by the obvious lack of injection of funds into very important historical asset, and I am told that they are concerned about the very future of the park. I know that the Hon. Mike Gallagher MLC has also been contacted by community members on the Central Coast, and he is intent on raising this issue in the New South Wales parliament. Back in the mid-1980s, I was at the forefront of the fight to save Old Sydney Town to ensure that this Australian heritage asset did not disappear. Central Coast residents pressured the Wran government into doing something about this precarious situation in the mid-1980s, and it is my intention to be at the forefront of this push again by the Central Coast community, some 12 years later, to save Old Sydney Town before it reaches the point of no return. I call on the Premier, Bob Carr, to do something about the deplorable state of this valuable heritage asset that belongs to the people of New South Wales and of Australia. (Time expired) Bringing Them Home",115
250,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (5.50 p.m.)Over the last month or so, members of the opposition have been reading into the record during the adjournment debate stories from the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. That report, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is entitled Bringing them home. During those few weeks since May, over 90 of those stories have been read into the record of this parliament by members of the opposition. As Chief Opposition Whip, I thank them for doing that. It is a shame that in that time the government's heart has not been softened. It would seem that many members of the government have not had their hearts softened either, because anyone who has read this report could not help having their heart broken over the plight of these children who were taken away from their parents for no other reason than that they and their parents were Aboriginal. They were put in institutions across this country, often by people who this thought they were doing the right thing, but the reality is they could not be considered in any way, shape or form to be doing the right thing. I made a speech in this House in October of last year about this report when it was in its final stages of being brought together. When making a speech-this often happens with members in this place-things go through your mind that you might not have thought about when preparing your speech. I have three sons and, while making that speech, I thought: what would I have done if someone had taken one of my kids away from me, for no other reason than that child was my child? I do not think I would have been half as forgiving as the Aboriginal people have been. I think I would have been seeking vengeance myself. The most amazing thing that comes out of this report is that the people who were offended against-the Aboriginal children and their parents-do not seem to be wanting vengeance. All they seem to be asking is that someone say, on behalf of Australia, 'We are sorry we did that.' Most of the state parliaments in this country have done that. Yesterday, there was a very moving ceremony in the New South Wales parliament. That parliament asked an Aboriginal woman to take the floor of the House and speak on behalf of the children who were taken away. She said that a lot of very sorrowful things had happened to her and that the one thing she would do would be to fight for her children. While the government says that they have various reasons for not wanting to do this, surely as a parliament we could now come together and say that we are sorry to these people. In evidence given to a Senate estimates committee last week, the government's Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester, said that he believed the government could construct a form of words that would allow the parliament to make that apology and not incur any liability. A number of the people who were offended against-a number of these people who were children in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s-have said that they do not want compensation. They just want someone to say, 'We are sorry.' You do not need to look far to understand why there are higher levels of crime and social disruption in Aboriginal communities than the European community in Australia. In New South Wales a quarter of the Aboriginal people, who are now my age, were taken away from their families. How else can those people grow up except by having dislocated lives? Their children will also have dislocated lives. If one way of helping that one inch is for the parliament to say 'We are sorry' on behalf of the Australian people, we should. I am certainly sorry, the opposition is sorry and I am sure many members of the government are sorry. I am sure that you too are sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. Surely we can all say that in order to heal some of the wrong that has been done. I thank my colleagues for what they have done to help with that. (Time expired) Kyi, Aung San Suu",116
251,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I, too, would like to register a birthday wish with a difference. Although not a constituent of mine, Burmese political leader and campaigner for democracy and human rights, Aung San Suu Kyi, is a member of a much larger constituency-that of mankind. Aung San Suu Kyi will not spend this day, the day of her 52nd birthday, in the company of her husband and sons, but will remain confined to her house, behind the barricades erected by the Burmese military regime. 1Ji; birthday wish is a tribute to her and the courage of those members of the National League for Democracy who, guided by the strength and determination of Aung San Suu Kyi, risk their lives daily to continue the struggle for democratic rights in their country. This is a personal birthday wish rather than a speech on international relations. It is a heartfelt message of goodwill that in no way attacks the sovereignty of the Burmese state. It is a simple reminder that, for many people around the world, a birthday is not a day of celebration but simply another day in the year of an ongoing struggle for the freedom that many people take for granted. Aung San Suu Kyi's struggle is not about distribution of political power. It is not a cynical bid by a disenchanted leader to regain the privileges of public life. It is simply a struggle for her right to be free-for freedom of expression, freedom of political association, and the freedom for the Burmese people to elect the person they want to lead them. I am relieved to say that these are not issues that the average Australian will have to face on the day of his or her 52nd birthday. Aung San Suu Kyi's fight is a peaceful one-one which avails itself of no other weapon than the courage to stand and be counted. What she demands from the rest of the world-from countries like Australia-is a recognition of the plight of the Burmese people, and an assurance that the support of the Australian people for what she is doing will never wane. Aung San Suu Kyi has never truly seen herself as a leader, or a martyr of a cause. Her Nobel Peace Prize has never changed her understanding of the ordeal that she has been through. She sees herself as someone no more traumatised by her fate than so many among her 40 million fellow Burmese. Such an unassuming approach reminds us of the universality of her struggle. In every country where basic human rights are denied, there are people who stand up for human dignity, whether or not their sacrifice makes it into history books. The members of Burma's National League for Democracy are not superhuman in their demonstrated courage and determination; they are simply expressing virtues which are inherent to us all-courage in the face of adversity, and a passion for what is right. The average Australian may never have to call upon such virtues, or may be able to express his or her passion for justice in the context of pired) democratic debate. But I would like to think that we are all capable of standing up for the right of every human being to live with dignity. Aung San Suu Kyi's messages are based on moral, ethical and spiritual norms which we would all recognise. Differences of language and culture should not lead us to ignore the struggle of the Burmese people, or to tum a blind eye in the name of a government's right to sort out its own domestic problems. The Burmese leadership-the military regime of the SLORC-is not representative of the aspirations of the Burmese people. Despite the restrictions placed upon her by the authorities, this courageous fighter for freedom still speaks out fearlessly against her country's military regime. In so doing, she embodies the energy and courage displayed by her late father, General Aung San, in his fight for independence. Like many great leaders of the past, she has set the stamp of an idea on an era-an idea of freedom for an oppressed nation. Aung San Suu Kyi constantly reminds her followers that their fight for freedom should never violate their basic obligation to respect human life. Her weekly messages to her own people and her wider audience in the 'free' world are of human qualities which give rise to dignity and freedom. Sadly, these are messages which are yet to reach the hearts of the leaders of a regime, who are still chasing legitimacy and who have recently intensified their crackdown on their political opponentsnamely, members of the National League for Democracy. Without losing sight of the wider issue of democracy and freedom, I mean this birthday wish to be personal. As a backbencher of a the small parliamentary democracy, representing 90,000-odd average Australians, I hope that Aung San Suu Kyi's next year of life can be happier-that she may be reunited with her family, and that she be given a chance to live not as an international figure in the struggle against oppression but simply as one of the 40 million-odd Burmese people with the normal hopes, aspirations and concerns of her fellow country men and women.

1662) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Does the Australian Electoral Commission charge federal Members of Parliament to produce a street list for their electoral divisions; if so, will he consider providing those lists to Members as part of the resources available in the discharge of their duties. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Members of Parliament have no entitlement, under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, to the free supply of street list information. The AEC currently maintains a printed list of streets for individual federal Divisions. Requests for street lists from Members of Parliament will be met on a cost-recovery basis, and only if resources are available. However, as this product was developed for AEC internal use, it may contain street information in a fonnat that is not suitable for use by Members. While the AEC does not have the resources to undertake computer programming to meet requests for the supply of street information in non-standard formats, the ongoing review of AEC requirements may lead to the development of a more suitable product which could then be made available to Members of Parliament.

336,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) In the period I June 1996 to 13 June 1997 I have received 512 letters on dental matters, the majority of which related to the cessation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. (b) In the period 1 June 1996 to 13 June 1997 I have received 1566 letters covering a wide range of issues concerning private health insurance. I am unable to separate which of these letters dealt specifically with premium increases and I cannot justify the hours it would take my Department staff to examine files to separate this correspondence. Illegal Heroin Importation (Question No. 1700) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Is he able to say what percentage of the total estimated amount of heroin imported illegally into Australia is actually seized by the authorities. (2) Has the figure risen or decreased since 1990. (3) Is the estimated cost to the Australian economy due to the trade in illicit drugs close to 0.5 per cent of GDP; if not, what is the estimate.  member's question is as follows. The Australian Customs Service is responsible for the detection and seizure action in relation to drugs detected at the border. From 1 July 1996 to 3 June 1997 the Australian Customs Service has made 60 heroin seizures totalling 153.1 kilograms. (1) I am not able to estimate the total amount of heroin imported illegally into Australia and I am therefore unable to estimate the percentage seized. (2) I am unable to say. (3) I do not have an estimate. (Question No. 1712) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to part (1) (c) of question No. 1476 (Hansard, 14 May 1997, page 3591), concerning the level of airborne asbestos fibres in Wittenoom and Telstra's decision to no longer install or maintain services in that area, how low does the level have to be before Telstra is not concerned. (2) Will Telstra disclose the levels of airborne asbestos at (a) Tom Price, (b) Paraburdoo and (c) Newman, including levels after blasts. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether Austel (a) does not consider two pay phones to be a substitute for the discontinued service and (b) believes that Telstra has an obligation to maintain existing services. (4) Are persons in remote areas entitled to have their services maintained. (5) Further to the Minister's answer to part (4) of question No. 1476, is the Minister able to say whether Mr Blount pays tax in Australia on his salary. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Telstra has advised that it is concerned to abide by recommendations made by a competent authority, in this case the Western Australian Government, which has posted Wittenoom as an area sufficiently contaminated with asbestos fibres as to be dangerous to a person's health. Telstra is concerned that the health of its employees is not put at risk by requiring them to enter the Wittenoom township to perform work associated with installing and maintaining telecommunications services. (2) Telstra is not in the business of measuring asbestos contamination levels itself but does respond to the monitoring of such contamination by relevant Federal and State bodies. As far as Telstra is aware, no agency has raised the issues of extensive, residual asbestos contamination in Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Newman. (3) I am advised that service to Wittenoom has not been discontinued. Telstra has entered into an interim agreement with the residents of Wittenoom to maintain the existing service, so long as it can be maintained, or until permanent service arrangements (as described below) can be implemented. The agreement calls for Wittenoom customers to hire a contractor to assist in the maintenance of the Telstra service. Telstra has agreed to reimburse the residents of Wittenoom for all reasonable costs associated with such maintenance and to train the contractor. Telstra and Wittenoom residents have reached an agreement in principle regarding permanent telephone service to the town. A new network boundary will be established outside the asbestos contaminated area. The residents of Wittenoom will be responsible for terminating the town's telecommunications distribution facilities at the new network boundary. Telstra will be responsible for providing network access at that point. Under the proposed arrangements, Wittenoom residents will hire a contractor to extend distribution facilities to the boundary and maintain the services within the asbestos contaminated area. Telstra will reimburse the Wittenoom residents for all reasonable costs incurred in the maintenance of the service, including labour, training, equipment and materials. In Telstra's view, these arrangements will allow the residents of Wittenoom to fully enjoy the advantages of a modern telecommunications network, while offering appropriate protection to Telstra's employees. (4) Telstra's Universal Service Obligation is to ensure that standard telephone services, payphones and prescribed carriage services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, including remote areas. (5) No-As indicated in response to Question No. 1476, it is inappropriate to provide details about an individual's taxation affairs which remain a matter between the taxpayer and the Australian Taxation Office. This approach is consistent with the requirements of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which includes specific secrecy provisions to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information.

Shepherds Hill Cottage (Question No. 1760) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: Program Is Shepherds Hill Cottage in Newcastle protected by a covenant prohibiting the use of the cottage for other than historical or recreational purposes; if so, will the Commonwealth invoke its authority under the covenant to restrain development of the site which is in conflict with the objectives of the covenant. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Shepherds Hill Cottage is protected by a covenant. Clause 2 of the covenant states 'The Transferee shall not use or permit to be used the land and any thereon for any purposes other than as a historical and recreational site provided however that the cottage on the said land (being the cottage known as 'No 45 The Terrace, Shepherd's Hill'), may be occupied as a home for an artist-inresidence or for any similar purposes not inconsistent with the said historical character.' If any proposed use of the cottage contravenes clause 2 of the covenant the Commonwealth would be entitled to obtain an injunction from the Supreme Court of New South Wales restraining the State of New South Wales from so using the cottage. Should a use which contravenes the covenant be approved by the State of New South Wales, the Commonwealth would consider invoking its authority under the covenant.",179
