4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"During the earlier part of the session much time was occupied at the beginning of the sittings of the House with the asking of questions without notice-sometime s half an hour or more. To save time, and in order that there may be ful l opportunity to obtain the information which honourable members require, the Government has decided to ask for notice of all questions except such as may be very urgent. This will ensure that more satisfactory replies can be given.",12
5,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Are we to understand that it is not the desire of the Government that honourable members should ask questions without notice? If that is so, I suggest that we be definitely informed to that effect, so that we may not waste our time in asking questions in the House.",12
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The privilege of asking questions without notice is given to honourable members so that they may obtain from Ministers information that is so urgently needed that a question cannot be placed on the notice-paper to be answered the following day.

12,Mr BRUCE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,Information on that subject will be contained in the budget statement of the Treasurer. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. PARAGRAPH IH MELBOURNE Herald-.,12
13,Dr MALONEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"I desire to. make a personal explanation. The Herald newspaper of Melbourne has seen fit to attack me for. asking questions in this House. Any one who has studied parliamentary procedure and practice as laid down in May, will understand that the asking of questions is one of the most important privileges of an honourable member. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Abbott) is reported by this newspaper to have said that he is thinking of having a return made showing the number of questions asked by members in a flippant and frivolous spirit. I can assure him that I have never asked questions in a flippant and frivolous spirit. Every questiou that I have directed to the Government has been put for the purpose of seeking information. The Federal Capital Territory is without representation in this House, and in view of the fact that already £12,000,000 has been expended - mos t of it wasted-at Canberra, surely when injustices are brought under my notice I have a right to exercise my privilege of asking questions.",12
14,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN, The honourable member is going beyond the scope of a personal explanation.,13
15,Dr MALONEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"It is not often that I give way to indignation in my declining years. The Herald is one of my best friends in Melbourne, and it has shown much kindness not only to me but also to the poor people of that city. The notice-paper shows that 24 questions are being asked by Government supporters.",13
16,Mr ATKINSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member himself has asked a number of queshonorable tions.,13
17,Dr MALONEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"I daresay that I have asked more than my fair proportion, but honourable members will recognize that we have had a recess of five months, and are, therefore, entitled to obtain information at this stage. The Government has never refused to reply to my questions. All matters with which I have concerned myself have been of public importance, and as I have said before, T intend to continue to claim the privilege of asking questions in this House.

Is it a fact that aliens who have completed the prescribed residence and can obtain the necessary certificates as being f it to be citizens are not allowed to become citizens, if during the late war they refused to obey the orders of the Consul-General of an alien nation to return to their native country to fight the enemies of such country? 2. Have any regulations been passed in the Department against any such aliens who are resident in Australia. If so, what arc the names and addresses of such residents?",13
19,Mr ABBOTT,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No such practice exists at the present time, although certain applications for. naturalMiscellaneous . . ization received shortly after the termination of the late war from aliens who had refused to join up with their country's military forces during the war period, were deferred for some time before being finalized. 2. No such rpgulations have been passed. NA STATES OF AMERICA.  Trade and Customs, upon notice I.

Is it a fact that cancer in the humans attacked the glands? 3. Is it proof that when glands are affected in sheep and other animals it is from certain diseases ? 4. Are the diseases which affect these glands liable to be injurious to the human being who consumes such meat?",14
22,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,TRADE WITHTHEUNIT ED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes.

25,Mr BRUCE,COMMUNICATION FEOM,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is presumed that the communication to which the honourable member refers is one relating to the projected visit to Australia of a representative of the Norfolk Island Planters Association. The date of that communication is 24th January, 1929. 2. The then Acting Administrator has reported that the letter was delivered at his office on the evening of 25th January. 3. The letter was transmitted by the Acting Administrator under cover of a despatch dated 5th February, and reached my department on 14th February. A steamer left Norfolk Island on 20th January, the day immediately following the receipt of the letter, but the Acting Administrator considered it proper to make inquiries as to the extent to which the meeting referred to in the communication was representative of the planters, before he forwarded the letter and sponsored the association's representative personally. The further information he required was contained in a letter from the secretary of the association, dated 31st January, which did not reach him until Sth February, the date of his covering despatch. 4.

In view of the fact that at the Imperial Conference of 1926 it was decided that further consideration of the question should be postponed, pending the report of the Committee of Experts which, it is proposed, should deal with various matters connected with the operation of dominion legislation, and in view of the possibility of an attempt being made to regulate the problem of dual nationality and no nationality by international agreement (vide Summary of Proceedings of Imperial Conference, 1926), will the Prime Minister inform the House(o) Whether the report of the Committee of Experts is available; and (6) Whether the Government intends to send a delegation to the Codification of International Laws Conference, to be held early next year at Geneva, under the auspices of the League of Nations, at which this subject will be considered?",14
26,Mr BRUCE,NATIONALITY OF MARRIED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Any amendment of the Commonwealth Nationality Act in the directionindicated could only be made after the amendment of the British nationality law, and subject to the various dominions being in accord, as it is necessary that there should be uniformity of nationality law throughout the Empire. The question of the loss of nationality by a woman as a result of marriage w it l i a foreigner was raised and full y considered in connection with a questionnaire drawn up by the Preparatory Committee on the Codification of International Law in respect to nationality. The reply sent by the Commonwealth Government, which was in accord with the attitude of the British Government and the governments of other dominions, was to the effect that the Commonwealth Government would be prepared, subject to the general acceptance of similar provisions, to consider favourably a proposal that a British woman marrying a foreigner should not thereby lose her nationality if by her husband's national law she did not, on marriage, acquire her husband's nationality. 2. (a) The Committee of Experts on the operation of dominions legislation and other questions, will not meet in London until October next. This committee will not, however, discuss the question of nationality. (b) A provisional date only, namely, 13th March, 1930, has been so far fixed by the Council of the League of Nations for the meeting of this conference. The Government will give consideration to the question of representation thereat when the date of the conference is definitely fixed. NA",15
27,Dr MALONEY,WAR PENSIONERS AND WAR,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that dependants of the brave soldiers who lost their lives in the late war, and also the dependants of the soldiers who were so severely wounded as to prevent them from earning their living, are penalized by being compelled to assist in paying the interest on war debts? 2.. If so, will he request his department make actuarial calculations as to the amount individually paid with a view to returning such amount to each of the dependants of our brave men? *",15
28,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PENSIONERS AND WAR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The dependants referred to are subject to the general taxation laws of the Commonwealth from which interest is derived, but in this respect they are not penalized. 2. It is not proposed to amend the laws relieving such dependants from the incidence of taxation-eve n if it were practicable to do so-and no good purpose would therefore be served by making the actuarial calculations referred to.

38,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CUSTOMS A ND EXCISE,"The general secretary of the T.B. Sailors and Soldiers Association of New South Wales wrote to many, if not all, honourable members in the following terms:This association has for some time been considering the advisability of having all amendments, additions and executive minutes referring to repatriation matters consolidated in the Repatriation Act, and have decided to earnestly request all members to extend their sincere help in this direction, for as you are aware, some of the most vita l legislation in of connection with these matters is only in the form of executive minutes or Cabinet decisions, and we feel that incorporation of such in the act itself is of paramount importance to all returned men, particularly in the future. We recognize that such excellent work has been accomplished on our behalf by yourself and fellow members, and we would be pleased if you would reply at your earliest convenience intimating your willingness or otherwise to further our objective on the floor of the House. Thanking you in anticipation of your active support. As Minister in charge of Repatriation, I wrote to the general secretary of the association as underW it h reference to.your letter of 10th June, and to my Cabinet colleagues, I have gone thoroughly into the matter of your requests. So that there may be a complete appreciation of the position by your association, I am forwarding to you, under separate cover, a copy of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and Regulations, with all the amendments which have been issued to date. It will be noted that most of the benefits (other than pension) granted to ex-members of the forces, arc covered by regulation, and such matters as the grant of medical treatment, surgical aids, artificial replacements, living allowances, arc included in this category. Outside the act and regulations it would seem that the only Cabinet decision which effects the association is the granting of a minimum pension of £2 2s. per week in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis accepted as arising out of the ex-soldier's war service. In view of this, I think you will agree that the position is quite clear and that no further action is called for on the part of the Government. Further, on a scrutiny of the whole of the benefits which are available, you will see that adequate provision exists for ex-service men who have suffered war damage. I have not h in g to add.

Is it a fact that the Third Commissioner of the Federal Capital Commission knew nothing of these Estimates until they appeared in the press; if so, why?",17

The Chairman of the Federal Capital Commission authorized publication of particulars of the works proposed to be undertaken. 2. The total amount of the expenditure to be incurred by the Commission had been approved by the Treasurer. 3.

Is it a fact that water boiled in an aluminium kettle or pot for twenty minutes shows, on chemical test, aluminium hydroxide? 2. Is it a fact that certain foods, when cooked in aluminium pots with sodium bicarbonate, show the effect of chemical action? 3. Is it a fact that by this means aluminium salts are taken into the system in varying quantities? 4.

Is the Health Department aware of adverse findings against the use of aluminium cooking utensils in America and other countries ? 0. Will the Minister have this matter investigated in the interests of public health?",19
53,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CUSTOMS A ND EXCISE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1.

The amount would depend on the alkaline state of the water. 2.

Apparently aluminium salts ingested with the food are not absorbed from the intestine in appreciable quantities. 4. The quantities given off from utensils are too small to cause ill-health. 5. Of five leading authorities, three make no mention of aluminium as a possible source of poisoning. The views of the other two have been quoted above.

65,Mr GULLETT,CUSTOMS A ND EXCISE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1 and 2. It is very difficult to prove dumping within the meaning of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Aet; but many inquiries for that purpose are made with regard to women's clothing, and, when possible, the provisions of the aet are applied. In some cases it is necessary to refer the matter for inquiry in London, or on the Continent. 3.

A good deal of confusion, doubt, and misgiving exists, and should be dissipated.",26
123,Mr BRUCE,SOUTH TASMANIA N,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.18] - The measure which the Government is asking for leave to introduce provides the machinery under which it it proposed to establish the industrial regulation of the shipping and waterside industries, control over, which the Government have indicated they will retain, in view of the full powers to legislate with respect to those industries, that they possess under the trade and commerce power conferred by the Constitution. The measure also proposes to give effect to the policy of the Government in relation to the evacuation of the field of industrial regulation of other industries. It is not my intention to ask for leave to proceed to the second-reading stage today. Upon the leave that is sought being granted, the bill will be brought in and formally read a first time. I propose to give a full explanation of the measure tomorrow, when I intend to move that it be read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Mr Bruce, and read matters in relation a first time. PAPERS.

124,Dr EARLE PAGE,SOUTH TASMANIA N,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.24] - The seventh consecutive Budget, which I have the privilege of subhas mitting to this Committee is historic, that it embodies for the first time the pleted scheme of the financial made between the Commonwealth and the States. That scheme is based on the broad foundation of the consolidation and redemption of the Commonwealth and State debts. All existing debts of the Commonwealth and the States and all new loans raised are now subject to definite sinking fund obligations. The new sinking fund Commonwealth debts has operated for six years, and the new sinking fund for debts for two years. In the six-year period more than £31,000,000-o r average of more than £5,000,000 per annum-ha s been provided from Commonwealth revenue and like sources for the redemption of the Commonwealth debt. In the two-year period an addirisen tional £1,752,000 has been provided from £52,913,000. Commonwealth revenue for the redemption of State loans. The annual sum now payable from Commonwealth revenue and cognate sources for debt redemption ceeds £6,000,000. These are facts of great £262,276,366, importance in any study of the financial position of the Commonwealth. The population of a country is its greatest asset. The population of the Commonwealth has increased in the last seven years from 5,510,000 to 6,337,000, an increase of 827,000, or 15 per cent., and by more than 1,000,000 in the last nine years. The overseas trade has moved in the following manner during the last three years:(a) Excess ol Year. Imports. Exports. Imports. (6) Excess of Exports. £ £ £ 164,716,594 144,895,183 (o)'19,821,411 1627-28 147,944,970 143,213,070 (a) 4,731,900 . . 143,628,000 144,780,000 (t» 1,152,000 An adverse balance of £19,821,411 in our visible overseas trade in 1926-27 has been converted into a balance of £1,152,000 in Australia's favour in 1928-29, or an improvement of £20,973,411. The production of the Commonwealth increased in the last seven years from in £379,382,000 to £442,000,000, an increase comof £62,618,000, the figures for the respecagreement tive years being:£ 192223 .. 379,382,000 192324 . . 400,183,000 1924-25 .. .. 454,106,000 1925-26 .. .. 431,504,000 192627 . .. 446,874,000 1927-28 .. .. 453,311,000 1928-29 (approx.) .. 442,000,000 Bank deposits throw further light on for our economic position. The average deposits in trading banks, including the State Commonwealth Bank, for the June quarter, 1929, totalled £328,600,000, an an increase of £76,000,000 since 1922. The thrift of our people is perhaps the most gratifying feature of our economic position. Savings Bank deposits have from £162,275,000 in 1922 to £215,188,000 in 1928, an increase of From 1923 to 1927, life insurance policies have increased by 70,823 to a total of 866,710, whilst the exsum insured in the later year was an increase of £52,226,421. In industrial insurance the figures are equally encouraging. The number of policies in 1927 totalled 1,481,044, an increase of 337,040 over 1923, whilst the sum insured increased by £20,723,750 to a total of £60,732,865. In life and industrial insurance combined, the sum insured in 1927 was £323,009,231, an increase in'four years of £72,950,171. The thrift of the people is also strated in the ownership of their own homes. The 1911 census disclosed that 52.22 per cent, of private dwellings were Revenue either owned or were being purchased by Expenditurethe occupants. At the 1921 census this percentage had increased to 56.32, and it may be confidently expected, with the additional financial accommodation being granted by house building authorities, that the 1931 census will disclose a further large increase in the percentage. An examination of the public debt transactions of the Commonwealth discloses a reduction of £6 12s. 5d. in the debt per head of population in the last seven years and a progressive change in the character of the debt. In this period the dead weight ""war debt was reduced by £45,000,000, while the works 'debt was increased by £58,000,000, or a net increase - of £13,000,000 in seven years. Commonwealth taxation, despite increased social obligations undertaken by the Government and greater assistance rendered to the States, which together absorbed £9,562,000 more than the corresponding obligations in 1921-22, represents a smaller percentage of the total production than in 1921-22, and remains practically stationary per head. In 1921-22 the total Commonwealth taxation was £9 0s. 4d. per head. Last year it was £8 17s. 8d. per head. In 1921-22 the total production was £344,302,000, and the total Commonwealth taxation was £49,679,000. In 1928-29 production totalled £442,000,000 and taxation £56,303,000. The percentage of taxation to production was 14.42 in 1921-22 and in 1928-29 was 12.74. Despite these favourable factors, Australia is faced with two main difficulties-^first, a decline in the value of her production owing to falling prices of staple commodities, and secondly, a danger of an actual diminution in production owing to industrial disturbances. The strength of the nation and the present standard of living can be maintained only by increased production resulting from improved methods of working and industrial peace. Dr Earle Page. THE PAST YEAH. The estimated and actual transactions of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the demonyear 1928-29 are as follows:Estimated. Actual. £ £ 63,01.0,000 61,419,770 Part 1-Ordinar y votes and appropriations 51,069,717 51,899,077 Part 2-Busines s undertakingsloss 319,755 338,216 Part 3-Territories loss 572,650 504,814 Part 4-Payment s to or for the States 11,034,912 11,030,038 63,597,034 63,778,745 Estimated surplus £12,960 Actual deficit £2,358,975 REVENUE, 192S-29. The failure of the revenue collections to reach the budget estimate was whollydue to the decrease in the returns from customs and excise duties, which were £2,241,429 below the Estimates. Direct taxation yielded £134,918 more than was estimated, whilst the other receipts fell short by £83,719, the net result being a shortage of actual receipts of £2,190,230. When the budget was introduced justification of the customs and excise estimate was found in past experiences and in the prospects of a bountiful harvest and an increased wool clip. Past experiences had shown that after temporary depressions, resulting in a drop in customs and excise revenue in 1917-18 and 1921-22, the succeeding year in each instance disclosed a full recovery in the revenue. ' Whilst it was reasonable therefore to anticipate the receipt in 1928-29 of collections equal to those of 1926-27, the budget allowed for a decline in 1928-29 of £252,000 notwithstanding that in the meantime additional duties estimated to yield £500,000 had been imposed upon motor chassis. A revival of trade was reflected in increased customs and excise receipts for October, November and December. I u fact, the receipts for that quarter, £11,448,834, were the greatest in the history of the Commonwealth; the next highest being in 1926-27, when £11,234,270 was collected in the corresponding quarter. This revival was checked, however, by the stoppage of work in the coal and timber industries, by adverse seasonal influences in some portions of Australia and uncertainty as to future prices .of our commodities. The shortage in receipts mainly occurred under the tariff divisions for apparel and textiles, metals and machinery, hides-and leather and rubber, and was partly accounted for by the increased production and use of Australian materials, particularly rubber goods. EXPENDITURE PROM REVENUE, 1928-29. The estimated revenue, which depends on factors the Government cannot control, differed by 3£ per cent, from the actual, whilst expenditure only differed by one-third of 1 per cent. This was due to the most rigid scrutiny of the accounts before presentation to Parliament and to the exercise of the most continuous oversight of expenditure by Ministers and heads of departments throughout the year. On the votes for the departments and for Defence this resulted in an actual decrease in expenditure. The increases occurred mainly in old-age and war pensions. Claims for these are undoubtedly affected by a time of depression which in itself makes old folk eligible for old-age pensions who in times of prosperity maintain themselves.

Actual expenditure in excess of the estimate The chief increase above the estimate was war pensions, £145,774. Invalid aud old-age pensions reached the huge sum of £10,124,239, being £124,239 above the amount estimated. ""War and repatriation services, payments to States, invalid ancl old-age pensions and other statutory payments last year absorbed £54,676,961, which was £13,618,390 in excess of the customs and excise revenue, and represented 85 per cent, of the total expenditure. The scope for other savings is thus limited to 15 per cent, of the total expenditure, but the Government's policy of strict economy has effected savings wherever possible. In Defence Services a saving of £119,278 was effected. A saving was also effected in the cost of administration of departments. Eor the year 1927-28 the cost of these services was £3,081,253. The budget estimate for 1928-29 reduced this to £3,025,962. The actual expenditure proved to be £2,987,306, or £38,656 less than the estimate and £93,947 less than the expenditure of the previous year. Despite the normal increases which might be expected to follow increase of. population and an extension of services, departmental expenditure has decreased. The cost of departmental expenditure per head of population, which surely is a test of sound administration, has shown a steady decline during the life of the present Government. In 1921-22 the cost per head was 10s. 7d.; in 1928-29, 9s. 5^d. This consistent record of wise and prudent £ control of public expenditure challenges 150,763 comparison and speaks for itself. It has been accomplished despite the provision 96,032 02,815 of increased public facilities and services and the constant increases of salaries by 315,610 awards and regulations. It has been effected . by eliminating waste wherever possible and especially the waste of Commonwealth and State duplication, of which a typical instance is the amalga86,250 mation of Commonwealth and State income tax collection. In business undertakings, the results disclosed a surplus on the post office of 47,049 £158,328, as compared with the budget estimate of a surplus of £107,710, or an 181,711 improvement of £50,618. Although on the revenue side there was a shortage of £148,300 compared with the budget estimate, due to conditions being less buoyant than anticipated, savings in expenditure amounting to £198,918 more than offset this shortage.

The moneys lent to the Federal Capital Commission by the Treasury in 192829 totalled £555,000. The loans raised by the Commonwealth for the States for development and migration totalled £1,352,573. This expenditure is included in the State loan programmes. DEBT REDEMPTION . On 17th November 1928, the electors, by a three to one majority, approved an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to deal effectively State debts. Subsequently the Commonwealth Parliament, in the exercise of its new powers, validated an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, in which provision was made for the management of State debts, the control of borrowing, and the provision of sinkf ing funds. The Commonwealth took all State debts from-the 1st July, Dr Earle Page. assuming as between the Commonwealth and the States the liability to the bondholders. New sinking funds have been estab£ lished, as the agreement requires, to provide for the redemption, with in a period of 58 years from 30th June, 1927, of the State debts existing at that date, and for the redemption over a period of 53 years 1,389,028 of each new loan raised for the States after 30th June, 1927. As the National Debt Sinking Fund Estimated Actual Act of 1923 had already made suitable £ £ provision for the redemption of Commonwealth debts, we now have, for the first time in the history of Australia, adequate and properly safeguarded sinking funds 878,091 covering the full amount of the debts 675,000 of the Commonwealth and the States. 638,500 Commonwealth Debt Redemption. 203,196 250,000 The amount applied towards the redemption of Commonwealth debt in 1928-29, was £6,230,708, the details be230,838 ing:£ £ 132,815 Contributions from Revenue48,742 Payments to the Sinking Fund .. 2,469,272 9,024,375 7,735,103 Payments to the British Government 1,424,967 3,894,239 Moneys akin to RevenuesReparation receipts 876,404 Half of Commonwealth Bank Profits 349,204 1,225,608 Interest on Investments 30,312 Repayments ol moneys lent by the Commonwealth 1,059,536 Other Contributions 21,013 Total 6,230,708 This amount is equivalent to £ 1 1 3 s . 5d. for each £100 of the Commonwealth debt with existing at the beginning of the financial year. In addition to the regular contributions provided for under the sinking f u n d law, the Commonwealth has, during the last six years, redeemed £7,415,755 of debt r o m surplus revenue and has thereby over effected a permanent annual saving of 1929, about £400,000 in interest.

The moneys for 1927-28 did not come into the Sinking Fund until 1928-29, because of delay in the ratification of the agreedue ment in one of the States. Total Debt Redemption. Combining the Commonwealth and States figures, we find that the total amount made available last year for the £4,S37,484. redemption of Commonwealth and State debts was £10,891,869. The payments in redemption of Commonwealth and State debt during 1928-29 totalled £6,657,795 in Australia, aud £3,396,502 oversea. follows: The balance of the moneys made available Gross during the year is represented by investments. As definite illustrations of the value of the Sinking Fund, I may say that, in conNet debt at 30th June, 1929 nexion with our conversion operation of September, 1928, we were able to pay off bondholders to the amount of curred £1,170,000 out of the fund, and that regards our May, 1929, conversion, no cash subscriptions were asked for to pay misapprehension. off persons who did not convert, the National Debt Commisison having made available funds up to £1,500,000 for purpose. In the case of the Queensland Loan of £12,704,000, which fell due London on 1st July last, a sum of ties £300,000 was paid off out of our Sinking Fund moneys, whilst the South Australian Loan of £200,000 which also fell due London on 1st July was wholly repaid from the Sinking Fund. These facts show clearly that Australia is effectively attacking the task of redemption. PUBLIC DEBT, 1928-29.

In this period our war debt was reduced by £5,602,361, while works debt increased by £10,439,845-the increase in the gross debt being, as already stated, The net debt at 30th June, 1929, was £349,356,349, as against £347,168,157 at 30th June, 1928, and is arrived at as Commonwealth debt at 30th June, 1929 . . £ . . 377,621,572 cash and Deduct loan balances and sums repayable in cash to the Treasury .. . . 28,265,224 . . 349,356,349 The debt which the Commonwealth inon behalf of the States increased in as 1928-29 by £43,019,528.

The £43,000,000 represents the sum total in of both conversions and new borrowings for the States in 1928-29 in respect of which Commonwealth securities were so issued. As an indication of the extent of debt new State borrowings for the year the figure has, therefore, no significance. THE NATIONAL DEBT.

Our war debt has thus been reduced by £45,276,000. Our debt for Commonwealth works has £58,058,000. On a per capita basis the total debt has decreased by £6 12s. 5d. per head. A net increase of £12,782,000 in our public debt for a period of seven years-o r an average of slightly over £1,800,000 a year when £8,000,000 of tangible assets have been created each year-is a matter for praise rather than censure. The position is improved if we remember that, as against £45,276,000 dead-weight war debt which we carried seven years ago, an equivalent amount of debt has been transferred to the category of works debt, represented almost wholly by assets, and most of them of a productive character. The debt position in the last seven years may be briefly summarized thus :1. There has been an increase of £13,000,000 in the gross debt - slightly over £1,800,000 per annum. Dr Earle Page. 2. About £58,000,000 of assets have been created during this period against this increase in debt. 3. Of this ambunt, £33,000,000 has been expended on post office assets and war service homes which immediately provide both for interest and redemp1929 tion. 4.

These figures are not comparable with those of Great Britain, Canada, the United States and other countries, because in Australia many public utilities, such as railways, tramways, telephones, electricity, water supply, &c, have been provided by the Governments, whereas in the countries mentioned similar public utilities have been left to private enterprise. COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA. The Commonwealth Bank is continuing to make steady progress and its usefulness as a national institution is heing gradually developed. The profits of the bank (which exclude those of the Note Issue Department and Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia) for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1928, amounted to £431,523. Note Issue Department. The profits of the Note Issue Department were £1,042,899, of which £782,174 was paid to Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth and £260,725 to the Rural Credits Capital Account. The statutory reserve of the gold holding as against the notes circulation required under the Commonwealth Bank Act governing the Note Issue Department is fixed at 25 per cent - the percentage at 30th June of this year, however, showed the very satisfactory position of 52.42 per cent. Rural Credits Department. The development of the Rural Credits Department of the bank is very satisfactory, and the purposes for which it was created are being fulfilled. Advances to the primary producers have during the 1928-1929 season exceeded those of any similar period. Advances for the period have been made against arrowroot, butter, cotton, eggs, egg pulp, canned fruits, frui t pulp, jam, fortifying spirit, peanuts, superphosphates, wines, wool, wheat. Since the Rural Credits Department of the bank was formed, the interest charge on advances has been reduced on two occasions by $ per cent., the rate of interest now standing at 5£ per cent, per annum. The profits made by this department during the year ended 31st December, 1928, aggregated £42,426, one-half of which was transferred to the Rural Credits Reserve Fund, and the remainder to the Rural Credits Department Develop- ment Fund. Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia. The position of the Commonwealth Savings Bank is now shown independently of that of the Commonwealth Bank. The profits of the Savings Bank for the year to 31st December, 1928, were £309,309. During the year the necessary legislation was passed in three States to enable advances to be made from the Commonwealth Savings Bank to existing authorities in furtherance of the Government's housing scheme, and in addition moneys have been made available to the prescribed authority in the Federal Capital Territory. Commonwealth Bank Profits. The total profits of the Commonwealth Bank (including the Rural Credits Department and the Savings Bank) have grown steadily during recent years, the figures being1924 .. .. 250,953 1925 .. .. 452,389 1920 .. .. 479,858' 1927 .. .. 673,100 1928 .. .. 740,832 These amounts do not include the profits of the note issue. THENEW YEAR. In framing the Budget for the year 1929-30, the Government was faced with almost unprecedented difficulties. The temporary financial depression pointed to reduced revenue from direct and indirect taxation. Growing commitments for interest and sinking fund, pensions and repatriation of soldiers had to be met. The royal commission which inquired into the financial position of South Australia had recommended financial assistance to that State, and Mr Justice Pike, after an exhaustive inquiry had recommended that the Commonwealth should shoulder a still further burden in respect of soldier land settlement. Provision for capital expenditure was rendered most difficult by the disturbed conditions in London and New York and the depression in Australia. In addition it was necessary to formulate a scheme for liquidating the deficits of the two preceding years. How it is proposed to overcome these difficulties will now be explained. I shall first deal with capital expenditure. LOAN EXPENDITURE, 1929-30. In approaching the question of what capital works should be undertaken in 1929-30, the Government had regard to the general financial situation. The Loan Council metin May and at once realized that financial conditions made smaller Government programmes inevitable. In August the Loan Council again met, and in the light of existing financial conditions aind with the best advice it could obtain, iboth from official and unofficial sources, - decided on a further drastic reduction of 20 per cent, in the already curtailed programmes. This involves much lower expenditure on very desirable though not imperatively necessary services. The actual loan expenditure for 192829 was . . .. .. 7,635,347 The estimated loan expenditure for 192930 is .. .. 5,085,645 Estimated decrease in 1929-30 .. 2,549,702 The estimated loan expenditure for the current year is £3,938,730 or 43 per cent, less than that estimated for 1928-29, and is £2,549,702, or 33 per cent, less than the actual expenditure of last year, the details being:Post Office, works and buildings . .

Advances for Purchase of wire and wire netting . . .. .. - Immigration-advance s of passage money, &c. . . .. Other items Deduct repayments to loan fund . . In addition to the provision made for loan expenditure by the Commonwealth itself, £384,700 is provided towards a total of £450,000 for expenditure on works by the Federal Capital Commission, and £2,000,000 for loans to the States' under the £34,000,000 development and migration scheme. This £2,000,000 is included in the loan programmes of the States. The loan expenditure of the Commonwealth falls into two main categories. The first of these, which consists of Post Office works and buildings; war service homes, defence works and buildings and other Commonwealth works is essentially a Dr Earle Page. Commonwealth matter. The second consists of contracts entered into with the various States. The Post Office vote, which is approximately half of the total Commonwealth vote, is chiefly for the purpose of installing telephone services, of which the Commonwealth has the monopoly. Last year over £2,000,000 was provided for this purpose. These works are immediately revenue-producing to the full extent of the interest paid and in addition provide adequate sinking fund contributions. So £ long as telephones are a Government monopoly, the demands of public business and convenience must be satisfied. The war service homes vote is about one-fifth of the total Commonwealth loan programme. It is a definite encouragement to thrift, and an incentive to the soldier to marry, settle down, and people the Commonwealth. These loans are repayable by instalments spread over a definite period of years and carry interest at 5 per cent. The repayments automatically go to the sinking fund to redeem E stlmate 1929-30. the original loan from the public. At £ the present time there is less than 1 per 2,600,000 cent, of arrears. The general depression 950,000 and the fact that many houses are becom288,500 ing vacant make it unwise in the interests 631,000 5,300 of the soldiers themselves to pursue too 290,500 vigorous a building policy at present. 200,000 The amount of £631,000 provided for 100,000 the Grafton-South Brisbane railway is in accordance with an agreement made 100,000 between the States of New South Wales 79,345 and Queensland and the Commonwealth 5,250,645 in 1924 to carry out the first step in 165,000 the unification of the railway gauges of Australia. This work is being carried 5,085,045 out under a firm contract between the contracting Governments. It has been found that the sum of £4,000,000 authorized for this work will be exceeded owing to alterations in the conditions of labour and estimates of materials. An Appropriation Bill will be brought down in due course. Eiver Murray Waters absorb £200,000 for the current year. This sum is one-quarter of the total expenditure of the Eiver Murray Waters Commission in &ecordance with an agreement made in 1914 with the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The sum set down this year will be sufficient to carry on pending the economic survey now being made of the Eiver Murray valley. Wire netting advances will amount to £100,000 in accordance with an arrangehave ment made with the States in 1926 for of loans under special terms and privileges to increase the carrying capacity of great pastoral regions. SOLDIER LAND SETTLEMENT. When plans were first made for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, the Commonwealth desired to control the work. The States, however, insisted on having full control and in excluding the Commonwealth from any share in the administration. It was agreed by the Commonwealth and the States that certain concessions should be granted to soldier settlers, and the Commonwealth undertook to contribute to the expense involved in these concessions. The following assistance has already been granted by the Commonwealth:(a) Sustenance was paid to settlers to the extent of approxiCommonwealth mately £500,000. (fc) A rebate of 2\ per cent, ' annum for the first five years was made of interest on vances by the Commonwealth to the States for soldier settleJuly, ment, the rebate amounting £4,735,000. This was intended at the time, by States and Commonwealth, to cover the position:Commonwealth's responsibility for losses in respect of soldier land settlement. (c) In 1925 the Commonwealth offered to relieve the States of responsibility for £5,000,000 of the principal amounts of soldier settlement loans owing to it by the States and to reduce the rate of interest on the balance of those loans to 5 per cent, per annum after 31st December, 1930. This was designed to bring the Commonwealth's contribution up to approximately half of the total losses and was subject to the condition that the States dealt fairly with all soldier settlers. In 1927 the Commonwealth decided to an independent investigation made the whole, position of soldier land settlement, with a view to securing a compreour hensive and final solution of the difficulties involved. Mr Justice Pike, of the New South Wales Land and Valuation Court, a leading authority on all land matters, was commissioned to conduct the investigation, and after making exhaustive inquiries into the nature of and amount of losses and the responsibility for losses, has furnished a report. . The Commissioner is of opinion that, whilst the Commonwealth is under no legal responsibility in the matter, the Commonwealth and States should share equally in the losses and that, in calculating the further amount of loss to be borne by the Commonwealth, previous assistance should be taken into account, with the exception of the sustenance grants amounting to £500,000. The Commissioner, therefore, recommends that the should make a further contribution by taking over from the per States such an amount (£2,447,782) as will bring its contributions up to half of adthe total loss. He also recommends that this debt should be assumed as from 1st 1927, and interest rebate should be to made at the rates paid, by the State to the Commonwealth. The following table preboth pared by the Commissioner sets out the Amount Gross Further Josses as Commonwealth already contriamount to found by half be written the Com- share buted by off by missioner. thereof.

This will involve the further writing down of indebtedness in the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. . The term "" home maintenance area "" means such an area as when worked by an industrious settler will, under average seasons and circumstances, return him sufficient to meet his commitments to the State and maintain himself and his family in reasonable comfort. The Commissioner considers that the failure to provi.de such areas has been largely responsible for losses, and will cause further losses unless adjusted. It will be noted that the State of Western Australia has already been relieved of considerably more than half of its loss. Mr Justice Pike's investigation was instituted by common consent for the purpose of arriving at a final adjustment of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. The Government, therefore, accepts the recommendations of the Commissioner, and will take action on the following lines:(1) That the basis suggested by Mr. Justice Pike, viz., that the Commonwealth and States share equally in the losses, be accepted, and that to give effect to this decision, the Commonwealth assume responsibility as at 30th June, 1927, for a further amount of £2,447,000 of the soldier settlement loans owing by the States. (2) That a condition of such acceptance be the completion of the satisfactory settlement of the soldier settlers now on the land, particularly in respect to the provision of home maintenance areas. (3) That, in order to cover losses to be incurred in providing home maintenance areas, the further loss on that account be taken as £300,000 and that £150,000 be added to the Commonwealth's share of the loss, making, say, £2,600,000; the £150,000 to be allocated to the States affected on the basis of the number of soldier settlers now on the land. This clause applies to New South Wales Dr Earle Page. (outside irrigation areas), Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. (4) That the interest concession made by the Commonwealth to the States in 1925 be varied so that after 31st December, 1930, the States and the Commonwealth shall share equally any liability in excess of 5 per centum per annum for interest payable on the Commonwealth loans from which the money due by the States to the Commonwealth for soldier land settlement was provided. (5) That this settlement be effected only on the States agreeing that it be full and final. EXPENDITURE OUT OF REVENUE, 1929-30. Part I - Departments and Services other than Business Undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth: In preparing the estimates of expenditure for 1929-30, the Government carefully examined every avenue of expenditure, 'with a view to its limitation in every possible way. The serious position of the finances was brought under the notice of all concerned, and the co-operation of the Public Service Board, heads of departments and departmental officers, was secured in a sustained effort to reduce departmental and other expenditure to a minimum. As a result, economies were effected in many directions, but particularly in the departmental expenditure. Increasing payments 'due to awards and to the growth of business have been offset in practically all cases by definite reductions of expenditure in other branches of departments. The result is that, though unavoidable increases of £582,561 had to be provided for in respect of War and Repatriation Services, In valid and Old-age Pensions, and Interest and Sinking Fund on Works Loans, the net increase in expenditure was limited to £87,084. A saving of £500,000 was thus secured as an offset against the unavoidable increases referred to. The estimated, expenditure under Part I . of the Estimates is £51,986,161, being an increase of £87,084 above the actual expenditure of the previous year. The following are the chief items of increase :War and repatriation services .. Invalid and old-age pensions Interest and sinking fund on works loans . . 180,030 Other statutory payments . . Deduct decreases- £ Defence . . 290,282 Ordinary votes of depart- mcnts .. .. 0,595 Miscellaneous services . . 172,772 Additions, new works and buildings 37,625 Net increase For Defence £4,345,000 is provided. This is a reduction of £290,282 on the corresponding expenditure of last year. This reduction has been secured mainly in the naval services. The reduced provision includes £106,000 for Civil Aviation, which, with £144,000 available in Trust Fund, provides for a total programme of £250,000. The amount set down for Miscellaneous Services is £266,837, or a decrease of £172,772 below the expenditure of last year. This decrease is partly due to the abnormal expenditure on Commonwealth elections last year, and partly to confining services for this year to absolutely essential requirements. For Additions, New Works and Buildings, the sum of £158,816 is set down, or a decrease of £37,625 below the expenditure of last year. War, Eepatriation, Defence and Special Appropriations account for no less than £48,580,000 out of the total expenditure of £51,986,000 for Part I . This only leaves £3,406,000 for other services, which includes £2,980,711 for ordinary administration expenses of departments. The departmental expenditure really reflects the true cost of government administration. Despite the extension of services, the expenditure in this section of the Estimates has for some years been practically stationary. The expenditure for 1927-28 was £3,081,253, for 1928-29, £2,987,306, and the estimate for 1929-30 is £2,980,711. This' result has been achieved notwithstanding that the in£ creases in salaries alone, due to arbitra226,770 tion determinations and increments to 175,701 officers who have not reached the maximum of their grades, amounts to approxi11,797 mately £80,000 per annum. This excellent record is due in great measure to the 594,35$ strict control of expenditure by the responsible officers of the several departments and to their loyal co-operation with Ministers. This control has been assisted by a continuous economy campaign carried out through the medium of departmental committees. 507,274 87,084 In a department like that of Health, it is not possible to reduce the expenditure without sacrificing a national and beneficial policy. The estimate of £147,000 for Health is an increase of £26,000 on the expenditure five years ago and is essential for giving effect to the national policy formulated by the Federal Health Council. For the other departments, the provision has been reduced below the actual expenditure of last year in some cases, and in other cases there has been slight increase due to new activities such as the control of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the total provision for this year is £6,595 below the expenditure for 1928-29 and £100,542 below the expenditure for 1927-28. War and Eepatriation Services absorb £30,324,521, which is an increase of £226,770 over last year. The chief expenditure is interest and sinking fund, which account for £21,180,000. Notwithstanding the conversion of £150,000,000 of 4J per cent, and 5 per cent, loans to 5J and 5£ per cent, loans, the total charges for interest and sinking fund have remained practically stationary during the last five years. This is due to the redemption of £7,500,000 of war debt from accumulated surplus moneys, and about £3,400,000 from reparation moneys, which have brought about a saving of over £550,000 a year in interest. War pensions account for £7,850,000. There has been a gradual increase in this item, and the peak year will soon be reached. For Eepatriation Services £1,000,000 is set down! This includes provision for medical benefits, living allowances, the war pensions appeal tribunals recently appointed, and £158,000 for the education scheme for soldiers' children under eighteen. Eor children over eighteen, about £20,000 a year is being expended out of balance held in trust account. If any saving is to be made in this item, the most practical method is to apply all available moneys to the education of children under eighteen. Special'Appropriations other than War and Repatriation total £13,910,160, being an increase over last year of £367,588. The services covered by this item have already received parliamentary approval. The chief increases are £175,761 for invalid and old-age pensions, and £180,030 for interest and sinking fund on works loans. Bounties and assistance to primary industries amount to £640,000. Maternity allowances account for £600,000, a reduction of £61,000 on the expenditure of last year. This reduction will be brought about by amending legislation restricting the bonus to persons with a family income not exceeding £8 a week. Old-age and Invalid Pensions absorb £10,300,000-a n increase of £176,000 over last year, and more than twice the increase in the Estimates as a whole. In the liberality of its treatment of those permanently or totally incapacitated, whether as the result of war or civil diseases or injury, and in the generosity of its treatment of aged pioneers, Australia has led the world. This has imposed an expenditure of nearly £18,000,000 per year on the taxpayers of Australia, equal to a tax per head of nearly £3. In addition an enormous sum in connection with social relief is also levied upon industry under legislation and administration of various States. Workers' compensation annually costs £2,826,000 in premiums, of which £974,000 represents costs of administration and profits. Widows' pensions in New South Wales are costing £700,000 per annum. The relief of widows and orphans in other States costs annually a further sum of £1,200,000, which must be met by taxation. In addition a number of staff pension schemes are in operation in various States, to which the State Dr Earle Page. Governments contribute liberally. Outside of these schemes, which directly involve taxation, many firms are contributing large sums to privately-managed schemes, while in addition industrial insurance societies and friendly society organizations cover a wide field among the thrifty. It is evident that because of the multifarious forms of administration and methods of handling there is much overlapping administration and consequent unnecessary costs. There is at the same time a vast field among the least provident, which has not been touched at all. The cost of hospital upkeep that is borne by the States, and the economic loss that is borne by the community, are materially increased through the preventable illnesses of many who under present conditions are not provided for, and cannot procure for themselves the necessities that will restore them quickly to health. To bring order out of this chaos, to eliminate the useless overlapping that is at present taking place in connection with social relief, to lessen the charge on industry at the same time as the benefits to the individual and the community are increased, the Commonwealth Government brought down a National Insurance Bill. This measure provides for compulsory insurance against sickness, accident, permanent disablement, death or old age and makes provision for widows and orphans and children's allowances when the breadwinner is removed. The scheme aimed at altering the nature of the present old-age and invalid pension system where poverty, in addition to advanced age or permanent incapacity, is the credential required for the pension. It is obvious that such a test for the pension must discourage thrift and be repugnant to, even if inevitably accepted by, many deserving citizens. The National Insurance scheme provides for the removal of this defect in our present system by making old-age and invalid pensions a right of the worker because of contributions during his working life, a right which he will obtain without question as to his other savings or financial position. To superimpose this system on the present chaotic and wasteful conditions would result in an added burden on industry. Accordingly when the Bill was introduced, it was stated that it was not proposed to proceed with, the scheme until the whole question had heen discussed with the State Governments and other organizations concerned. At the Premiers' Conference in May last, the Commonwealth Government therefore asked the States whether they were prepared to assist in co-ordinating or, if necessary, to transfer by legislation, the control of this whole field. After discussion arrangements were made for a questionnaire to be sent to the States to ascertain their present costs and methods of relief and the most economical means of consolidating them. believed that the saving that could be thus effected in administration would very closely approximate, if it did not exceed, the charge on industry that additional benefits of the National Insurance Scheme proposed by the Government, would entail. Until the questionnaire has been replied to and the whole question thoroughly examined and the best means of co-operation discovered, the Commonwealth Government intends to postpone further dealing with the National Insurance Bill. our present circumstances it has to be recognized that however desirable social legislation for the conferring of additional benefits upon the people may be, there is a limit beyond which we cannot wisely go in this direction. Expenditure upon schemes of this character falls ultimately upon the industries of the country, and the burdens so imposed are immediately reflected in the cost of living of the nation, while the benefits to the community may be delayed. In the meantime it should be observed that if a permanent and progressive decline in the price levels of our commodities should take place the only method whereby the expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions, which absorbs more than the whole income tax of the Commondevelopment wealth, can be maintained, is by increased and more efficient production in Australia. The continuance of industrial stoppages and fomenting of industrial conflict must - depress our standard of living. The greatest hardship will fall on the invalid and aged who are helpless to avert the blow. PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION. The Commonwealth Public Service - controlled in part by the provisions of Public Service Act, in part by regulations made upon the recommendation of the Public Service Board, and in part by determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator. This complicated and overlapping system cannot be regarded as satisfactory in principle, and the expense and complexity which result from the action of several agencies in the same field are not satisfactory in result. There should be, subject to preservation of Parliamentary control, a definition of the spheres of the various authorities. It is It is accordingly proposed to introduce legislation to this end. LIF E INSURANCE. The Government is bringing down a bill to regulate the business of life insurance. The need for such a measure has long since been apparent, not only to safeguard the interest of the policy holder, and thus maintain inviolate an important form of thrift, but to replace the differIn ing-and in some cases defective-law s of the several States, by a uniform law which will operate effectively throughout the Commonwealth. The provisions of the bill are based mainly on the life insurance legislation in force in Great Britain, in the States of the Commonwealth and in New Zealand, on the report of the Commonwealth Royal Commission on Insurance 1910, and on the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of the British Board of Trade submitted in 1927. Consultation with the Australian life insurance authorities has taken place in the preparation of the bill. DEFENCE. During the last five years, the Treasury has provided substantial sums for Defence in accordance with a well defined policy laid down in 1924. An additional expenditure of £1,000,000 per annum for the development of ordinary Defence services was provided, as well as £7,400,000 for naval construction, and special sums of £250,000 and £200,000 for air services equipment and civil aviation respectively. In addition, £620,000 was provided as a reserve for Defence. In the ordinary course, the Government is would now have proceeded further with the the development of the air services and would have put iuto operation the three vears' developmental programme of the air force recommended by Air Marshal Sir John Salmond. The financial situation, however, makes it impossible for the Government to commence this programme of air force development during the present year, and, moreover, necessitates some adjustment of Defence activities in other directions. The total expenditure on defence under ordinary services, new works, loan expenditure and development programme last year was £5,383,892. The Government proposes to provide in 1929-30 a total of £5,146,356, a reduction on the total of £237,536. In drafting the Estimates in accordance with the reduced sum available, full regard has been paid to the relative importance of all activities, and the economies have been confined to the curtailment of services having least ill effect upon the bigh. standard of efficiency desired of defence services generally. The basic organizations will not be permanently affected by the reduced expenditure, nor will their efficiency be impaired to any great extent. CIV IL AVIATION. The new air mail services between Perth and Adelaide, and Charleville and Brisbane, were established in January and April, 1929, respectively, and a contract has been let for the commencement of a further service between Camooweal and Daly Waters by February, 1930. The activities of flying training clubs and schools subsidized by the Commonwealth are developing satisfactorily. Funds have been made available for the provision of new aerodromes and hangars, as well as for improvements to terminal aerodromes in certain of the capital cities.. In all, £250,000 will be available in 1929-30 for civil aviation. The expenditure in 1928-29 was £115,612. NA RESEARCH. After mature consideration, the Government has authorized increased expenditure by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the conduct of its investigations. Provision is made for an Dr Earle Page. expenditure of £256,811 as against £99,520 actually spent last year. The capital expenditure on laboratories will absorb £109,000, whilst £89,000 is required for work already in progress. The balance of £58,000 is for the extension of work during the current year, when, with completed laboratories, a very determined attack will be possible on outstanding problems affecting animal industries. Of the total estimated expenditure for the year, the council will obtain a recoup of £34,000 from the Empire Marketing Board. The provision pf additional funds during the present year has been rendered possible by the action of the Commonwealth in appropriating portion of its surplus revenue in earlier years for payment to a trust account for scientific and industrial research. The greater part of these moneys will be absorbed this year. Thereafter, moneys provided by the Commonwealth for .this purpose will be a charge on the revenue of the year. When this happens, the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will be in jeopardy unless the industries benefiting by its work are prepared to provide funds for its continuance. The Government is willing to support this work, but cannot carry the whole burden. It will be essential that private individuals and interests should come to the assistance of the council in many of its activities if they are to be maintained. The council is restricting its attention almost entirely to the primary industries. Increasing severity of competition in the products of these industries is forcing every country to look to its costs of production and to eliminate waste, whatever its cause. Our annual losses from animal and plant diseases, from the spread of weeds, from insect pests, and from lack of real knowledge of our soils, run to millions of pounds. Scientific research costs little compared with the huge stakes available to those who will use it. Prickly pear control in Queensland is becoming a world-famous instance of applied biology. Probably the value of land saved or reclaimed in the present year will be several times the total spent by the Commonwealth and State Governments on the investigation of the methods now proving so successful. Wool is menaced by competition of other fibres, and a serious situation confronts Australia unless the cost of its duction can be reduced and its use extended. Wool is a crop from the soil, obtained through the sheep, and if we are to avoid waste and obtain maximum efficiency at the lowest cost, we need far more information than is at present available regarding the nutrition of the animal, the factors determining its yield of wool and its resistance to disease. Rapid progress is being made along these lines. Four field stations provided free of charge by pastoralists are in operation, and the number should be increased. This work is as indispensable as the intense advertising campaign which the industry is now considering. It seems likely that a simple method of coutrolling bitter pit in apples has been discovered. The problem of blue mould in tobacco is already well on the way towards solution. Minor troubles^ sucb as water-blister in pineapples, are yielding to systematic work. A section is being established for the importation and testing of plants likely to be of economic value. America imported 78,000 new plants in about twenty years, with immense advantage. The entomologists are concentrating on the sheep blow-fly, the buffalo fly, white ants, codlin moth and other insect pests, and are seeking methods for controlling weed pests. A heavy feeder on St. John's wort is about to be imported. Ragwort, hoary cress, thistles, Noogoora and Bathurst burrs, stinkwort, &c, are receiving attention. Animal diseases are being investigated. Liver fluke in sheep need no longer be tolerated. Braxy disease is yielding to investigation in Victoria. Caseous lymphadenitis-the greatest evil threatening the sheep industry-present s a most acute and urgent problem. Work in the irrigation areas is extendingI n the field of food preservation and transport, co-operative work is in progress with authorities in Great Britain, covering both fruit and meat. All these investigations are investments of a most promising type. They touch every State, and existing scientific institutions throughout Australia are becoming more closely associated and, in a measure, stimulated as a result of this prosteadily growing Commonwealth effort. A ll this makes for economy and strength within our own borders. No less important is the imperial aspect of the situation. Through the Empire Marketing Board we are receiving considerable assistance not only financially, but by securing for ourselves the results of investigations throughout the Empire. There is a "" team idea "" in this scientific work. Never before has the Empire in its peacetime pursuits aimed so earnestly at united work as it is doing today in scientific and industrial research. NA DOMINIONS. The possibility of the British Government abolishing preference to the Dominions is a matter of most serious concern to Australia. In view of the importance of the issues involved, and of the advantages to be gained by fostering interempire trade, the Government hopes that action will be deferred until the subject can be fully discussed by the British and Dominion authorities in conference. The approximate value of the preference granted by Great Britain to Australian products in 1927-28 was £1,400,000. If the British goods imported into Australia subject to preference had paid the general rate instead of the preferential rate of tariff the amount of Customs duty for 1927-28 would have exceeded by £7,600,000 that actually collected. GERMAN REPARATION. The Young Committee of Experts recently investigated the problem of reparation, ancl submitted a revised scheme for a permanent settlement. The scheme provides for Germany to pay 37 annuities, averaging £99,500,000, to cover her obligations in respect of reparation and other charges under the Treaty of Peace. After the period of 37 years, Germany would be liable only to provide inter-allied war debt payments to the United States of America, which continue until 31st March, 1988. The British Empire's share of the annuity of £99,500,000 is, approximately, £20,450,000. This represents a loss to the British Empire of about £2,500,000 a year compared with what the Empire would have received if the total annuity had been distributed in the same proportions as the Dawes annuities were distributed. Before the committee of experts furnished its report, indications were received that the British Empire would probably suffer in the basis of distribution of new annuities. The Commonwealth Government at once cabled to His Majesty's Government, and urged that every effort should be made to prevent any modification being agreed to which would have the effect of unfavorably altering the basis upon which the Dawes annuities were distributed. matter, the Commonwealth Government strongly supports the British Government's attitude of opposition to the adoption of the Young plan in its present 1 form.

The passenger traffic on this railDr Earle Page. way in the last three years has increased from 24,351 to 31,109, an increase of 6,758 or more than 27 per cent. The business on this railway is hampered by breaks of gauge and narrowgauge lines. The running of Commonwealth trains into Adelaide station, as provided for under the Railways (South Australia) Agreement Act 1926, will in some measure correct this position and will secure greater traffic with better financial results. The Commonwealth has included in its offer to South Australia a proposal to take over the Eed Hill-Salisbury railway together with its capital liabilities. The line would be In this converted into 4ft. 8£in. gauge to obviate uneconomic necessity of putting down a third rail at a cost of £300,000. Postmaster-General's Department. TELEPHONE SERVICES. The phenomenal expansion of the telephone services continues. During 192829, 29,033 telephones were added, bringing the total to 505,554. ' There are 221,725 telephones in the country, representing 43.8 per cent, of the total. Australia is sixth on the list of telephone density in the countries of the world. £ Last year approximately 35,000,000 trunk calls were handled-doubl e the 13,000,839 annual output five years ago. 829,101 The proposal to link Tasmania with the mainland by means of a wireless telephone service is being actively pursued. £ Several experimental installations of rural automatic exchanges are successfully operating. With a view to selecting places for the introduction of automatic equipment, a comprehensive review .is being made of all districts in the Com562,560 monwealth. 200,001 TELEGRAPHS. Direct working has been established between Perth and Melbourne. Provision is made for the introduction of fast speed printing telegraph services on carrier channels between Perth and Adelaide during the current year. These arrangements will be extended in order to give Perth direct telegraph communication with Sydney and, later, with Brisbane. The first picturegram service in the Commonwealth is in process of installation between Melbourne and Sydney and will be available for service at an early date. All matter capable of photographic reproduction may be transmitted by the photo-electric process being established. NATION AL BROADCASTING SERVICE. In accordance with the Government's policy for the inauguration of a national broadcasting service, a contract for the £25,910,357. supply of the programmes throughout the Commonwealth has been placed with the Australian Broadcasting Company. The responsibility for the technical services has been vested in the post office, and the two principal broadSpecialSpecial casting stations in Sydney and Melbourne respectively have been transferred to the new system. Plans are being developed for the provision of a complete network of casting stations intended to afford an efficient service to a very large percentage Contribution of the population of the Commonwealth Orders have already been placed for two additional stations, and provision has been made to commence work on three further stations during the current year. The construction programme will occupy possibly three years. The surplus resulting from the services to be rendered by the Post Oflice Departviz., ment in 1929-30 is estimated at £829,161 compared with a surplus in 1928-29 of £158,328. The improved position is the result of a campaign of rigid economy and oversight of all expenditure combined with an adjustment of charges for telegraphs and telephones. PART III - TERRITORIE S OF THE COMMONWEALTH. As the revenues payable to the Treasury from Territories are negligible, practically the whole of the expenditure is a burden on the general revenue. estimated that the deficit arising from the administration of the Territories will be £627,630 in the current financial year, being an increase of £122,816 over the previous year. This increase is chiefly accounted for by increased expenditure of £87,972 on the Sydney-Canberra road, and £33,229 for interest on loans. PART IV - PAYMENT S TO OR FOR THE STATES. The permanent provisions of the financial agreement haviiig now come into force, the Commonwealth Budget, for the first time, reflects the interests payments on the debts of the States. The Budget figures are thus swelled by an amount of The following are the details of the estimated expenditure for payments to the whole of the States in 1929-30:£ payment to Tasmania payment to .. Western 250,000 Australia '300,000 Special payment to South Australia 300,000 Belief to South Australia in connection with Fort AugustaSalisbury railway .. .. 60,000 broadGrants to States for Federal aid roads 2,000,000 towards sinking fund on State debts ..

The "" balance of interest on State debts "", £30,000,000, will be recovered from the States so that the burden on the Budget' will be £11,489,912, an increase of £453,274 compared with 1928-29. This increase is made up of assistance to South Australia totalling £360,000, an additional grant of £30,000 to Tasmania, making the total grant £250,000, and £63,274 in Commonwealth contributions to the sinking fund for the extinction of State debts. In the report of the royal commission appointed to inquire into the finances of South Australia as affected by Federation, which has already been made availI t is able, it was recommended that the Commonwealth should make a grant to the State of £1,000,000, to be paid in two equal annual instalments. It will be generally acknowledged that in considering the question of a special grant of Commonwealth revenue to a State, the position of the Commonwealth finances as well as those of the State, be kept in mind. The Government, after having given careful consideration to the report of the royal commission, has decided to make a grant of £1,000,000 to be spread over three years instead of two years as recommended. The Commonwealth's proposal is to make certain cash payments and to take over the Bed-Hill-Salisbury railway, and the liability for interest and sinking fund in respect thereof. The annual liability is approximately £60,000 and forms part of the three annual grants rereferred to. The cash payments and the relief, taken together, will total £360,000 in 1929-30 and £320,000 in each of the two following years. If the Government of South Australia agrees to this proposal, the Commonwealth will in effect, De contributing £60,000 to the revenue of that State each year after the year 1931-32. When the question of a grant mania for last financial year was under consideration, the Government stated that, For the redemption of debt before it could agree to the principle of For naval construction a fixed grant for a period of years, whole question of internal transport, which was one of the prime causes of Science and industry investigations the financial difficulties of Tasmania, the associated question of ports and harbours, should be reviewed by a committee. Air Service equipment . . These matters have now been discussed Civil aviation by the two Governments and agreement has been reached as to the action to be taken. The Government accordingly now proposes to make a grant of £250,000 per Purchase of radium annum to Tasmania for five years. FEDERAL AID EOADS. The Federal Aid. Eoads Board scheme is now operating smoothly in all the States, and good progress is being made in the construction and reconstruction of the roads covered by the first five-year programme. The improvement in road surfaces, not only along the main trunk and arterial roads, but also in newly developed areas, is largely due to the penditure of the funds provided by Commonwealth and the States under the Federal Aid Eoads Act, which contembeen plates an expenditure of £35,000,000 Dr Earle Page. a period of ten years. To date, £10,500,000 has been allocated to specific must roads, and an amount of £7,244,808 has been expended in carrying out the approved programme. USE OF SURPLUS EEVENUE. Until two years ago the Commonwealth was never without surplus revenue. In 1927-28 there was, however, a deficit of £2,628,743 in the Consolidated Eevenue Fund. The prospects of a revival in Customs revenue then justified the Government in refraining from making proposals for the immediate liquidation of that deficit. These expectations were, however, not realized. There was a further deficit of £2,358,975 in the revenue of 1928-29, so that at 30th June, 1929, there was an accumulated deficit of £4,987,718. Before dealing with the liquidation of this deficit, I propose to show the uses made of surplus revenue since 1923-24. The chief purposes for which surplus to Tasrevenue was used were:£ . . 7,415,000 7,000,000 the Grants to States for development of main roads .. . . 1,250,000 000,000 and Assistance in the marketing of primary products .. 500,000 .. 250,000 .. 200,000 Prospecting for oil and precious metals . . 220,000 .. .. 100,000 The debt redemption payments represent so much money actually saved and have resulted in an annual saving of nearly £400,000 in interest. The sums provided for defence purposes have enabled the Commonwealth to complete its naval ""construction programme out of revenue and to develop its defence forces. The moneys put into science and industry investigations were a good investment from which practical results are already being obtained. The Main Eoads Grant exassisted the States in the development of the main roads throughout Australia. The moneys put aside to assist marketing have well spent, whilst the securing of over radium requires no justification. ESTIMATED EEVENUE, 1929-30. The expenditure under the four of the Estimates will now be summarized so as to ascertain the amount of revenue required to balance the Budget for year. Part I . of the Estimates-depart ments and services-othe r than business undertakings and territories .. . . 51,080,161 Part III . of the Estimates-Terri tories Part IV . of the Estimates-Pay ments to or for the States . . LessPart II . of the Estimates-Busi ness undertakings . . t The Commonwealth Government's taxa* tion proposals must cover this expenditure. At the same time, it is necessary to deal with the accumulated deficit of £4,987,718. To liquidate the whole of this accumulated deficit in one year would impose intolerable burdens on industry in Australia and would accentuate and prolong the existing temporary depression. The Government therefore proposes to liquidate the deficit over a period of years, and has decided to budget this year for a total revenue of £64,198,000 consisting of Customs and Excise . . . . £43,750,000 Direct Taxation Miscellaneous After providing for the expenditure of £63,837,102, there will remain a surplus cast, and of £360,898 available towards the deficit. This is being supplemented by an amount of £1,200,000 which fortunately has become available. In November last the altered. Public Trustee reported that, in his opinion, the interest and other revenue earned by the Public Trustee did not have to be accounted for as Separations, but should be paid to Commonwealth Eevenue. At the same time, the Auditor-General sought legal advice regarding the profits of the Custodian of Expropriated Property. The Solicitor-General advised that it was not necessary to treat the profits and income of either the Public Trustee or the custodian as reparation receipts, and that there was no objection to the payment parts of the moneys to the Commonwealth revenue. As the result, the accumulated income of the custodian and of the Public the Trustee, amounting to approximately £1,200,000, will be available this year for £ payment to revenue and will be applied towards the liquidation of the deficit. With the surplus of £360,898 already referred to, there will thus be this year a total of £1,560,898 towards extinction 027,030 of the deficit, leaving £3,426,820 to be dealt with subsequently. 11,489,912 With a decline in Customs and Excise 04,103,703 receipts, the amount of revenue required to meet, the expenditure for 1929-30 could not be obtained from existing sources of 260,001 revenue at present rates. Additional taxa03,837,102 tion therefore becomes necessary. The Government realizes that this additional taxation must bear as lightly as possible on industry, and therefore proposes to place the burden upon the users of luxuries and upon those whose financial position is such that they can bear the additional burden without personal hardship. DIBECT TAXATION. The estimated revenue from land tax is £2,800,000, being £188,885 less than the actual receipts from the previous year. The reduction in the proceeds from this tax is due to the leeway made up in 192829 in collecting arrears of tax. The 15,700,000 rate of tax is not being altered. 4,748,000 The revenue to be derived from the estate duties tax is very difficult to forethe estimate of £1,900,000 for 192930 allows for a decrease of £180,149 as compared with the actual collections last year. The rate of tax is not being Income Tax. It is proposed to raise £10,000,000 from income tax during the present financial year by a number of amendments in the law, principally for the purpose of checking the avoidance'or evasion of tax, and by a super-tax involving a 10 per cent, increase in the rate of tax on taxable incomes exceeding £2,000 when received by individual persons. Eates of tax payable by companies or by an individual whose taxable income does not exceed £2,000, will not be increased. The increase proposed will cause the rates payable on incomes exceeding £2,000 to be 18.8 per cent, greater than the 1915-16 rates. The rates operating in 1928-29 were 8 per cent, greater than those of 1915-16. Those operating in 1926-27 were 20 per cent, greater than those of 1915-16. The maximum increase in rates above 1915-16 occurred in 1920-21 and 1921-22, when it reached 70f per cent. The proposed amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act will also remove several injustices in the assessderive ment of co-operative companies which have been disclosed recently. Taxation of Overseas Shipping Businesses. A committee of the Ove'rseas Transport Association which met in Sydney in June, 1929, has submitted to the Government recommendations that action should be taken to remove what is regarded as injustice to overseas shipping businesses arising out of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act which tion require such businesses to pay income on an annual statutory taxable income equal to 7\ per cent, of the total receipts of the business in respect of passengers, cargo and mails taken on board at an Auswhich, tralian port for transport abroad. The committee urged the adoption of the scheme approved by the Imperial Ecois nomic Conference of 1923 upon subtinuance missions by the Shipping Taxation Committee Conference, viz., that Commonwealth should only tax upon a taxable income arrived at by applying to the total Australian receipts the avercitizens. age rate of profit derived by the shipping business from all its shipping activities throughout the world. The Government is giving consideration to the recommenBritish dations of the Overseas Transport Assoexpansion ciation. Taxation of Ex-Australian Income. It was stated in the Budget Speech 1928-29 that, in accordance with an undertaking given to Parliament in Dr Earle Page. preceding session, the Government was communicating with other governments in relation to the taxation in other countries of residents of Australia for the purpose of examining all the facts connected with the taxation of that income in those countries, and of considering the difficulties to be overcome to eliminate double taxation in the event of the Commonwealth taxing its residents on income derived from sources outside Australia. The present income tax laws of the Commonwealth provide for the taxation of income derived from sources within Australia, whether by residents of the Commonwealth or by persons who reside beyond the Commonwealth. Persons who income, from sources external to : Australia are subject to the taxation laws of the countries from which the income is derived. The major portion of income derived by Australian residents from external sources is derived from the United Kingdom, where this income is subject to taxation. In certain cases income derived from sourceswithin the Commonwealth is also subject to British taxation. An an arrangement has been made with the British Government for the diminution of the hardship arising from the imposiof double taxation in such cases. The tax arrangement is embodied in Commonwealth and British legislation. It is an arrangement which is regarded by the Commonwealth as fair and equitable, but owing to the higher rates of taxation operating in the United Kingdom, is favourable to Commonwealth revenue. It not desired to prejudice the conof this arrangement unless it is reasonably certain that the adoption of the a new system would not result in diminishing Federal revenue and inflicting undue hardship upon Australian In reply to the communication from the Commonwealth Government, the Government has stated that any of the scope of dominion taxation to income derived from the United Kingdom will tend to diminish the revenues of the British Exchequer, and that action in the direction of taxation of of ex-Australian income will raise the question of the necessity of revising the the basis upon which relief from double income tax is now allowed. The reply of the British Government invites attention to the report recently presented to the League of Nations by the Government experts on double taxation and tax evasion. It is also suggested that the subject might appropriately be reviewed at an Imperial Conference. In anticipation of the possibility of the question being raised at the next Imperial Conference, the Commonwealth Government is seeking further information from the governments of other dominions before finally reaching a decision on the matter. Amusement Receipts Tax. It is proposed to raise additional revenue of £600,000 by means of a tax of 5 per cent, on the .total receipts from charges for admission to entertainments. This tax will be a levy upon a national luxury, which, it is considered, should make a special contribution to the national revenue in the present circumstances, and will take effect on 1st September, 1929. Records relating to the present entertainments tax, which will continue, show that the attendances at amusements increased enormously since 1921-22, namely, from 78,000,000 to 126,000,000 in 1928-29. Customs and Excise. The estimate of customs and excise revenue is £43,750,000, or £2,691,429 excess of the actual collections of the vious year, and £197,522 more than the collections of 1926-27. As the decline in customs and excise revenue was chiefly responsible for the revenue failing to cover the expenditure of the Commonwealth in the last two years, it has been decided to impose ditional revenue duties, estimated duce £2,750,000. The customs duty on 'real silk piece goods is being raised from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, foreign, the British prepetrol ferential tariff remaining unchanged. The duty on artificial silk goods is altered to 25 per cent. British preferenWithout tial tariff, and 35 per cent, foreign tariff. Precious stones, which at the present time are free of duty, will in future carry an impost of 10 per cent The foreign and intermediate duties on motor chassis, both assembled and unassembled, will be raised by 10 per cent., the British preferential tariff remaining unaltered. . An additional duty of L£d. per foot on foreign cinematograph films will also be imposed, no change being made in the British preferential tariff, which still remains free. Customs duties on brandy, gin, liqueurs, bitters, rum, whisky and wine are being raised by 2s. per gallon. This is equivalent to an increase of slightly more than 5 per cent, on present rates on spirits. An additional excise duty of 2s. per gallon is being imposed on spirits manufactured in Australia. An additional excise duty of 3d. per gallon is being imposed on beer, raising the excise from Is. 9d. per gallon to 2s. per gallon. In order not to prejudice local manufacture, a similar additional duty will be imposed on imported beer. The customs duty on tobacco-manu have factured and unmanufactured-and on cigarettes is being raised by 8d. per lb. The duty on cigars will in future be 12s. instead of l is . per lb. under the British preferential tariff, and 14s. instead of 13s. per lb. under the general tariff. Thus, whilst the duty ou leaf for in the manufacture of cigars will be inprecreased by 8d. per lb., the duty on imported cigars will be increased by Is. per lb. An excise duty of l d . per gallon is being imposed on petrol refined in Australia, and a customs duty of 2d. per gallon is being placed on the petrol conadtent of all enriched crude petroleum and to proonce-run distillates. The proposed duty on the petrol content of enriched crude petroleum and once-run distillates, and the excise upon refined within Australia have been deemed necessary in theinterests of being revenue for road construction purposes. these adjustments, a considerable and increasing quantity of petrol refined in Australia was escaping taxation for road purposes and an undesirable taxation anomaly was being created. In selecting these items care has been taken to avoid imposing taxation on the necessaries of life and the increased revenue will be obtained from luxuries without adding to the cost of living. Moreover it is considered that the creases will not materially interfere the measure of protection enjoyed by any Australian industry. Should it be found, however, that the changes do in any way reduce the measure of protection now entrial joyed by any Australian industries, the Government will be prepared immediately authorities. to consider the necessary tariff adjustments. It will be noticed that in the tariff changes now made, the margin of perous British preference has either been mainwheat tained or increased. CONCLUSION. I have endeavoured to lay before the Committee the more prominent and sigis nificant features of the finances for past year, and in broad outline have viewed the situation since this Governticularly ment took office, as well as our present general economic position. I have also indicated the measures which, after mature consideration, the' Government proposes to adopt for balancing the national budget and liquidating the deficit. Naturally it would have been a more tion. I moveagreeable duty for me to have been in a position to announce that it had been found possible to achieve this objective the one method of reducing our outgoings. Unfortunately that was not possible withOrderedout encroaching upon payments of an obligatory nature supported by all parties in the House. While expenditure has tion been reduced wherever this could be done, buildings, &c. it was only possible to completely bridge the gap by raising additional revenues. And in formulating proposals for this purpose, the Government has endeavoured to raise the required moneys with the least possible dislocation of our economic conditions. It is hoped that these additional burdens will be merely temporary. This should be Dr Earle Page. possible if there is a cessation of industrial conflict with a revival of industry. That our unhappy industrial conditions have checked the flow of private capital, into industry is evidenced by the recent growth of fixed deposits in the banks. The increase of £33,000,000 in these deposits in the last two years is clear evidence that investors are marking time inand awaiting a clearer industrial outwith look. This withholding of capital from industry effects the worker most of all. The Government is proposing to remove one potent cause of turmoil in the indusfield by doing away with the duplication of Eederal and State arbitration National finance is no exception to the general law of ebb and flow. For many years Ave have been favoured with prosseasons and good prices for our and our wool, resulting not only in revenue sufficient for all governmental needs, but enabling many remissions of taxation to b'e made. That sooner or later we should enter upon a period of some depression was inevitable. This condition merely a passing phase in our economic the life. We have ample resources awaiting reour energies. In many directions-par railways-the States have created capital works adequate to a much larger population and a much greater production. A sure path out of our difficulties can be found in a combined effort to obtain industrial peace and increased and more efficient producThat the first item in the Estimates, under Division I-the Parliament-namely , "" The by Presidei - £1,300 "", be agreed to.

That item provides for a rebate of 2d. on the duty on petrol which goes into non-road use. The Government regrets very much indeed that we are abandoning the original intention of Parliament to make a rebate of 2d. a gallon on imported petrol used for industrial and other purposes apart from the propulsion of road vehicles. Honourable members will remember that this rebate provision was agreed to in August, 1926, soon after the additional duty of 2d. a gallon on petrol had been imposed for raising a fund for national road construction in co-operation with the States. The object of the rebate was unquestionably a most praiseworthy one, but from the outset its administration was found to be impracticable.

The only instances of payment were to large manufacturing firms such as rubber companies and dyeing works, which were able to purchase their petrol supplies direct from the importing companies. I was very much interested in the matter, and went into it with a view to seeing if the rebate provision could not be made to operate as was intended by Parliament, and particularly whether it could not be made operative over the rural districts of Australia. I am sorry to say that I have found the difficulties insuperable. The first difficulty was that under the Customs Act a rebate can be made only to the original person paying the duty. Unfortunately, in the distribution of petrol, the importer is very seldom the retailer. Except in a few isolated instances the importer sells through thousands of retailers spread over the countryside. The only possible procedure, therefore, is for the importer to collect evidence through retailers, including the thousands of garages scattered throughout the States, that the petrol had actually qualified for rebate, and was going into nonroad use. It would then he for the wholesaler, having satisfied himself regarding the evidence, to make the rebate, and afterwards claim it from the department. At the outset the companies made some attempt to do this, but they found it so difficult that by the time. I took over my present position they had definitely ceased from trying to operate the provision at all. Mr J. FBANCIS - I have been informed that the system is operating in New Zealand.",49
126,Mr GULLETT,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"I can give only my own experience. Difficulties exist here which may not be present in New Zealand. I took the matter up with the companies, and for some time. I thought that we might find a solution. In that belief I answered a question in this House some time ago stating that I was hopeful of a satisfactory settlement being arrived at.",55
127,Mr LACEY,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,Is there no relief possible for those who make an application for rebate ?,55
128,Mr GULLETT,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"There has been none so far. After thoroughly exploring the problem, we hoped for a time that we should be able, not to put the rebate scheme into operation, but to substitute for it an equivalent bounty of 2d. a gallon. This bounty was to be paid direct by the department to applicants producing satisfactory evidence that they had not used the petrol on the roads for motor vehicle propulsion. I am sure, however, that the committee will recognize the extraordinary difficulties of administering the provision even in that form. Most persons who use petrol in stationary engines, farm tractors, motor boats, &c, are also motor car owners. It was fairly obvious that in the operation of this rebate, or of the equivalent bounty, there would always be present an abnormal opportunity for straight-out misuse of the provision. We thought, however, that by setting up an organization which itself would probably be quite an expensive thing, we might be able to operate the 3ystem with success. Unfortunately, we then came upon a further difficulty which finally influenced us in our determination to abandon the plan altogether. That difficulty is the refining of petrol within the Commonwealth itself. The Commonwealth Oil Befineries has been refining petrol in Australia for a number of years, and produces several millions of gallons each year. Moreover, within the last twelve months, in addition to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, the Shell Company has been refining at Clyde in New South Wales. It has refined several million gallons of petrol, and put it on the market in New South Wales as Shell petrol of the same quality, and under the same description, as the imported Shell. That was the final consideration which induced the Government to place the present proposal before Parliament. In the first place, no purchaser could distinguish between the imported Shell and that refined within the country, and there was the further possibility of anomaly in the operations of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. There exists now a considerable prospect that the local refining of petrol will be rapidly extended in Australia. Having in mind all these considerations, the Government, with the greatest possible regret, has come to the conclusion that the rebate system cannot be administered satisfactorily. Mr J. FRANCIS - Did the Government give consideration to the scheme operating in New Zealand today ?",55
129,Mr GULLETT,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"We gave consideration to the South Australian scheme. In that State a similar provision was operated down to two or three years ago, but the extraordinary developments which have taken place since then in the way of bowser distribution, and the great increase in the number of selling agencies, have complicated the position enormously. I am confident that if honourable members will take into consideration the difficulties of administering this provision, and of avoiding misrepresentation and heavy over-payment of rebates, they will agree with me that the provisions cannot be administered satisfactorily, and that the Government is now taking the right step. If this provision cannot be administered it should not be allowed to remain in the tariff schedule. The present position is hopelessly unsatisfactory, and the Government, with the greatest reluctance, has come to the decision that the provision should go. Progress reported. COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION BILL. SECOND READING.",55
130,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [5.10] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. In the last Parliament a bill relating to the compensation of Commonwealth employees was dealt with by the Senate, and was introduced into the House of Representatives. The bill, however, was not passed before Parliament was dissolved. A new bill was introduced, and was passed through the Senate in February, and read for the first time in the House of Representatives. The bill provides for the compensation of Commonwealth employees according to modern ideas on that subject. It is based on the bill brought before the last Parliament, but certain alterations, to which I shall later refer, have been made. Commonwealth employees are not entitled to participate in the compensation rights under State laws, and therefore Commonwealth legislation is necessary. The present act was passed in 1912, and the bill now before the House provides for its repeal and the substitution of new provisions. The bill contains many important variations from the present law, the chief of these being:(1) Administration to be in the hands of a Commissioner. (2) The act to apply to all employees, irrespective of salary, but to exclude naval, military and air forces. (3) Payment of increased compensation. (4) Payment of medical benefits. (5) Specified payments for certain injuries. (6) Payment of compensation for incapacity arising from industrial diseases. Under the present act questions of compensation are decided by agreement, arbitration, or by the court. In the case of death the practice is to refer questions of dependency to the court, thus causing delay and expense. Provision has accordingly been made in the bill that the act shall be administered by a Commissioner. His powers and functions are set out - in Clause 6, and it is proposed that he shall determine all matters, subject to the provisions of the bill. There is, however, a right of appeal from his decision to a county court. The present act applies to all civil employees of the Commonwealth, except employees receiving more than £500 per annum. In the bill the limit of £500 has been abolished, and the bill will thus apply to all civil employees. The present law also extends to the naval and military forces, except when on active service. As the various Defence Regulations contain comprehensive provision for compensation in respect of injuries to members of the Forces, it is proposed that the bill shall not apply to them. Provision is made for the extension of the act to employees of such authorities established under the Commonwealth as are prescribed by regulation. The bill can thus be made applicable to such an authority as the Commonwealth Bank and the authority will, unless otherwise prescribed, be responsible for the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of the act. Under the present act, in case of death, the compensation to dependants, wholly dependent, is a sum equal to three years' earnings, subject to a minimum of £200 and a maximum of £500. The bill provides for more liberal payment and the amount of compensation will be a sum equal to 156 times the weekly pay at the time of injury, subject to a minimum of £400 and a maximum of £700. In case of total or partial incapacity, the existing law allows a weekly payment not exceeding . 50 per cent, of' the claimant's average weekly earnings, and subject to a maximum of £2. The bill provides for a payment not exceeding two-thirds of the weekly pay at the time of injury, and the maximum is increased to £3. In addition, child endowment at the rate of 5s. for each child up to fourteen years of age is to be paid during total incapacity. In creased payments may be made also 'to employees under twenty-one years of age, and if their cases are reviewed after reaching twenty-one years, they may receive up to two-thirds of their probable earnings, subject to a maximum of £3 per week. This is a substantial extension, as the maximum under the present act is £ 1 ' per week. The present act does not prescribe payments for specific injuries. The absence of this provision makes it necessary to arrive at an agreement in each instance or go to the court. Modern compensation laws, including State acts, contain a schedule of fixed payments for specific injuries. The bill accordingly contains a schedule in keeping with modern requirements, the payments varying from £600 downwards, according to the nature of the injury. The present act contains no provision for payment of medical benefits to injured employees. The trend of modern legislation is to provide for such benefits. Provision has accordingly been made an the bill for payment of medical, surgical and hospital treatment up to £100. This payment is in addition to the compensation otherwise provided for in the bill. The bill proposes that the liability of the Commonwealth shall be limited to £700, plus medical expenses, except in the case of permanent total incapacity. It is felt that this limit should not apply in the case of an employee who has received injuries which render him totally incapable of doing any further work. It is considered that the best way to assist such an employee is by a permanent weekly payment instead of lump-sum compensation. The bill accordingly provides for a weekly payment of two-thirds of his pay, subject to a maximum of £3, without any limitation as to the period and total liability. When the Workmen's Compensation Act was passed in 1912 there was no Superannuation Act in existence. latter statute was passed in 1922, and provision was made for pensions to be paid from joint contributions by the employees and the Commonwealth. Where an employee receives an injury resulting in permanent and total disablement, that employee, if a contributor to the Superannuation Fund, is entitled to a pension. If death results, his widow receives a pension of half the amount that would have been payable to the employee. In both cases a pension is also paid in respect of children under fourteen years of age. As the Commonwealth provides half of these pensions-for the majority of the present employees the Commonwealth contribution exceeds half - the Government has carefully considered what additional payments shall be made in such cases as compensation under this bill. As a result the provisions which the Government [10] deems'equitable have been set out in clause 18 of the bill. Briefly stated, the effect of that clause is this: Where death results - (i ) The widow, in addition to the pension under the Superannuation Act, will receive lump-sum compensation, according to the provisions of the first schedule, less the capitalized value of half the pension ; (i i ) there is a saving clause that a minimum payment equal to half the compensation will be paid to the widow; (i i i ) where the employee leaves a widow and a dependent mother, the latter will be entitled to her full share of compensation, and the widow's share will be reduced as already indicated, subject, however, to a minimum payment of half that share being made. In the case of permanent and total incapacity, the weekly payment to which the employee would be entitled under the first schedule is to be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the weekly pension payable to him under the Superannuation Act. This is an important concession beyond the provisions contained in the bill that was dealt with by the Senate in the lastParliament. That measure stipulated that the full pension should be deducted. The Government has given further cpnsideration to the matter in the meantime, and it is now proposed that only half the pension is to be deducted. When the previous bill was under The consideration in the last Parliament, a discussion took place in another place ou the question of industrial diseases, for which no provision had been made. As a result of that discussion, the Government gave an assurance that the matter would be investigated by the Health Department, and that, if necessary, an amendment would be made in this chamber. The whole question has since been - examined by the Health Department, and the bill now contains provisions for payment of compensation to employees contracting industrial diseases. These provisions are set out in clause 10. They provide that compensation shall be payable as if the disease were a personal injury by accident. The list of diseases is contained in the second schedule. The assurance given last year has been fulfilled. The bill contains comprehensive provision for compensation to all civil employees of the Commonwealth in respect of personal injuries by accident and industrial diseases. These provisions are in keeping with the trend of modern legislation, and are very much more liberal than those of the present act. The Govern- the chamber. ment considers that they should apply uniformly to all civil employees, and that the power to compensate for injuries to civil employees under any other laws of the Commonwealth should be abolished. The bill accordingly provides that such - a power shall be taken away from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator, and that the existing awards relating to accidents shall be non-effective. Similar provision is made in respect of the regulations affecting civil employees under the Defence Act 1903-1927, and the Naval Defence Act 1910-1918. Debate (on motion by Mr LACEY) adjourned. ESTIMATES, 1929-30. ADDITIONS, NEW WOBKS, BUILDINGS, ETC. In Committee of Supply: PARLIAMENT. Proposed vole -£3274 .",56
131,Mr JACKSON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"An item of £3,274 is provided for alterations and additions to the ventilation and cooling plant in Parliament House. Will the Treasurer please explain this item?",58
132,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [5.28] - This amount has been included in the Estimates at the request of the President of the Senate and Mr. Speaker, and £2,674 is to be expended in the main building, and £600 on the refreshment rooms. This work is proposed as the result of numerous complaints regarding the system of ventilation and cpoling in this building. The Chief Engineer of the Works Department and the Chief Engineer of the Eederal Capital Commission have submitted reports, which were considered at a recent meeting of the Joint House Committee. Steps will be taken to carry out these works before the summer .arrives.",58
133,Mr LISTER,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Corio) [5.30] - I desire to draw attention again to the poor acoustic properties of this chamber. An honourable member who sits on a back bench, as I do, has very great difficulty hearing the remarks of Ministers, who face the Opposition benches when they are speaking. As a matter of fact it is almost impossible to hear what is being said if any conversation is going on in When this subject was last, brought under the notice of Mr. Speaker, he said that an investigation would be made to see whether anything further could be done to improve the position. I should like to know the result of that investigation. It is not. reasonable to expect members to sit at. strained attention in order to catch the remarks of the Ministers or private members who may be addressing the House.  - Is any provision being made to extend the public seating accommodation in the chamber? Seating accommodation could not be found last evening for anything from between 60 and 100 members of the general public who were here and desired to hear the debate. That was an inconvenience not only to them, but also to honourable members and the attendants of the House, whose time is much taken up in making inquiries to see whether it is not possible to squeeze in a few more people - As' the popularity of Parliament appears to be on the increase, and people wish to hear what is being said here, it behoves us to do something to increase the accommodation, if that can be done.",58
134,Mr WEST,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"East Sydney) [5.33] It is most unfortunate that the ventilation of the dining room and lounge of this building is so unsatisfactory. In summer time the temperature is often from 30 degrees to 40 degrees higher inside those rooms than it is outside. That could have been obviated to a large extent had proper windows been put in the building. It is quite evident that those who were responsible for the drawing of the plans did not understand much about the science of building ventilation. In my earlier life I had a good deal to do with the ventilation and equipping of buildings, and I am quite sure that had proper windows been put in the dining room, things would have been much better. It is very well known that hot and vitiated air always rises in a room. The hot air in the kitchen rises and it affects the in ventilation of the rooms immediately above it. I introduced a discussion upon this subject at a meeting of the House Committee when I was a member of it, but my observations received very little attention from the presiding officers. It will be of little use for us to instal extra fans unless we provide some means of clearing the rooms of the hot air. If it is allowed to remain there the fans will simply circulate it and the atmosphere will not be appreciably cooled. If this proposed expenditure is for the purpose of making effective improvements I shall support it. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) spoke about the acoustic properties of this chamber. Since the various openings round it have been curtained, the position has been considerably improved. There was a proposition to hang certain draperies in the galleries, but I resisted it with some heat and thereby incurred the displeasure of the presiding officer of the Senate. I sincerely trust that nothing will be done with a view to improving either the ventilation of the dining-room or the acoustics of this chamber until expert advice has been obtained. Mr A. GEEEN (Kalgoorlie) [5.40] The billiard-room is like a sweat-box in the summer. I should like to know whether there is any means of ventilating it from the top. If there is, it does not appear to be used.",58
135,Mr JACKSON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Bass) [5.41] - We should go to the root of the trouble. The difficulty is that the boiler-room is immediately underneath the members' lounge. That cannot be overcome by merely increasing the number of fans. We ought to go into the question of the practicability of removing the boiler-room altogether. I am aware that this is termed a provisional Parliament House, but it seems to me that it will become permanent.",59
136,Mr GIBSON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Corangamite-Post master-General and Minister for Works and Railways) [5.42] - I understand that the Joint House Committee and the engineers have been in consultation upon this subject, and that the work proposed to be done is recommended by them. The proposal is to instal a better cooling system in the portion of the building to which reference has been made.",59
137,Mr BEASLEY,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"West Sydney) [5.43]. - I am a member of the House Committee, and, to the best of my recollection, although this subject was discussed by it, no finality was reached. A decision was deferred pending the receipt of additonal information from the engineers. From my experience in the electrical industry, I am certain that our electric motors are considerably overloaded. They may at any time break down and cause serious trouble. The conditions under which the engineering employees in this building have to work-thos e engaged in woi'k associated with the heating and ventilation plant-ar e most unsatisfactory, and injurious to health. Some of the members of the industrial organization to which I belong, the electrical trades, are employed on this work, ancl on several occasions I have interviewed them on the subject. I know, therefore, from personal contact with them, as well as from medical men in our party, that their working conditions are unsatisfactory. I trust that something will be done to remedy this unsatisfactory state of .affairs, and also that the provision made on these Estimates will provide - for an electrical installation which will remove the danger of overloading that now exists.  the existing,financialconditions we should be thoroughly satisfied that this expenditure is warranted before we agree to it. E am told that this is merely a provisional Parliament House, and that the Government is very anxious to proceed with the building of the permanent structure upon the hill at the rear of this building.",59
138,Mr FENTON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"There is no chance' of that.  not, it seems to me that this money could be spent to much better purpose in other directions. """,59

I contend that we ought to be given an opportunity to consider such items before the expenditure is incurred. The Government has had a good deal to say about the necessity for economy. I suggest that it should begin to practice economy at home, and not expect the workers of this country to set an example in that direction. I do not propose to vote for this item until I am satisfied that the expenditure is necessary.",59
141,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Cowper-Trea surer) [5.45] - This item is on the Estimates as the result of the representations of the Joint House Committee, and if honourable members object to it, they may remove it from the Estimates.

144,Mr FENTON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Maribyrnong) [5.47]. - I think that the erection of the war memorial at Canberra might very well be delayed. I say that without any disrespect to our returned soldiers and patriotic citizens. In practically every constituency postal facilities are long overdue. Postal works are reproductive, but recommendations for the construction of .new buildings are invariably turned down by the central office, the cuse being that no funds are available. Surely we could expend £30,000 on more useful works than a war memorial at Canberra. I do not think that anyone can lay the accusation at my door that I have ever been adverse to perpetuating the memory of those who sacrificed their lives for us during the Great War, but in these days of so-called re-organization and the retrenchment of staffs, the proposed expenditure of £30,000 might very well be deferred. I therefore make my protest against this item remaining on the Estimates.",60
145,Mr COLLINS,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Wakefield) [5.49] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I represent an electorate which probably contains' more returned soldiers than any other electorate in Australia. I am as loyal, first to Australia and then to the British Empire, as any man in this community; but I contend that at this juncture, when the Government has serious financial problems to face, it would be absolutely wrong to spend this money on the erection of a national war memorial. I recently attended a large gathering of returned men at a town in my constituency. This subject was discussed, and every returned soldier who was present took strong exception to this proposed expenditure at a time of financial stress. The item could well be postponed.",60
146,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"Adelaide) [5.51] - I oppose this item of expenditure. No one can. reasonably accuse me of lack of appreciation of the efforts of our soldiers overseas. I was there; aud those who took part in the war naturally have a greater appreciation of the hardships that were suffered by our men than those who stayed at home. This item means n. bigger expenditure than is indicated on these estimates. The proposed expenditure of £30,000 is really the forerunner of an ultimate cost of £250,000. Had we money to burn I should not object to the erection of a national memorial. But nearly every little hamlet and village in Australia has its local war memorial, ancl the people of Australia have not been lacking in the expression of their appreciation of the sacrifices of those who fought overseas. I appreciate architecture and works of art. To a great extent the people of, Australia ex- are losing sight of the need for architectural beauty in our public buildings.",60
147,The CHAIRMAN,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,Mr Bayley) The honourable member's remarks are not in order.,60
148,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,Surely I am entitled to express my views about Canberra.,60
149,The CHAIRMAN,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"On the particular item before the chair, the honourable member is not in order in discussing that subject.",60
150,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"The item deals with a proposed expenditure at Canberra, ancl I am giving my reasons for objecting to it. The memorial is to be erected at the foot of Mt. Ainslie in honour and in appreciation of our heroes who sacrificed their lives overseas. That means that most people in Australia will never see it. It would be a farce to erect this building, in view of the present state of the finances.It would be of infinitely more service if thf* money were expended in relieving the ferings of those who were disabled at the war. Many of our returned soldiers today are being turned out of war service homes because they cannot meet their commitments. It would be better to give these men free homes than' to expend £250,000 upou a memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie. The returned soldiers are entitled to more consideration than they are getting from this liament. Those who during the war stayed at home aud invested their savings in war loans, are drawing interest to the amount of £18,000,000 per annum, yet it is costing this country only £8,000,000 for pensions to our warracked heroes. We can never recompense our returned soldiers for their sacrifices on our behalf. I believe that if the people of Australia were appealed to, they would insist on our tubercular soldiers being given attention that would, enable them to live in comfort during the few short years of life remaining to them. When these men enlisted they were the flower of the manhood of Australia. Had the war not intervened we must assume that they would have been able to at least earn the basic wage.",60
151,The CHAIRMAN,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,The honourable member must not develop that argument further.,61
152,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"I am giving my reasons for opposing the expenditure of £30,000 on the war memorial, and I am showing that, the money could be better spent in other directions.",61
153,The CHAIRMAN,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"I cannot permit, the honourable member to develop that line of argument.",61
154,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"How can I oppose this item without stating grounds for my attitude? Will you, Mr Chan-man, inform me what argument I may use to conform with your ruling? My remarks are being circumscribed and for me it is a rather i ncongruous position.",61
155,The CHAIRMAN,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,The remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) have not been circumscribed. He has been given ample latitude. He has stated at some length his view that the money could be better used in benefiting returned soldiers.,61
156,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"I am afraid we shall have to agree to differ. I have put the suf- position as I see it. The proposed expenditure should not be authorized. I am opposed to it for the reason, among others, that the great majority of the people of Australia will not have an opportunity to visit the memorial in Canberra. The scheme may be very fine in conception, but I should like to see the memorial erected in either Sydney or Melbourne, or, better still, in Adelaide, Par- the most beautiful city in the Commonwealth. I take off my hat to the Australian soldiers for what they did in the war, and so long as I live I shall be willing to expend the last ounce of my strength in securing adequate recompense for all war-racked ex-service men. I make a distinction between the man who is now suffering some disability as the result of the war and the ex-soldier who is in the enjoyment of robust health. I hope I shall never find it necessary to make any claim on the Commonwealth for war disabilities that may assail me in later years, but I know that there are many thousands of our returned men who are in urgent need of financial aid. I trust, therefore, that before we sanction further expenditure on the war memorial at Canberra, every returned soldier will be amply requited for the sacrifices he made on behalf of Australia during the war. When we have met all demands upon the Commonwealth in this respect, Ave may feel at liberty to think about spending a quarter of a million upon a war memorial in Canberra.",61
157,Mr THOMPSON,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"New England) [6.4]. - I wish briefly to support the proposal of the Government to proceed with the erection of the war memorial in Canberra. I took this stand in the last Parliament, and I see no reason now to change my view. This work will have to be undertaken sooner or later. I cannot subscribe to the opinion that appears now so prevalent, that the financial position of the Commonwealth is such as to warrant the discontinuance of expenditure on the national war memorial. After all, the amount involved is inconsiderable when one considers the importance of this proposed great national tribute to the Australian soldiers who fell in the Great War. The Government cannot be charged with extravagance in providing £30,000 as a commencement. To me, the amount seems somewhat inadequate for a start. I am afraid it will give the people the impression that the idea is to proceed with the work at a snail's pace. I should like, to see the memorial completed within the next two or three years. The expendi- that happened in the war years. ture provided for in these estimates is so small that I fear there is no immediate iutention of pushing on with this urgent national work. I regard it as urgent, hecause it is now ten years since the war ended, and it is time that Australia fell into line with the other belligerent nations and erected a worthy memorial to those thousands of men who gave their lives for this country in that great conflict. If we abandon this project now, we shall suggest to the world that the financial position of Australia is so unsatisfactory as to render it inadvisable to proceed with this important national expression of the ideals and traditions of our people. The figures placed before honourable members this afternoon by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) do not indicate that, in a financial sense, we are up against insuperable difficulties. A total expenditure of £250,000 on the memorial is extremely moderate. If we can get a really worthy memorial for that sum we shall be doing very well indeed. In my opinion, the amount mentioned should not represent the total expenditure that should be authorized. If the Government's policy is to complete the memorial up to a certain stage for £250,000, and then, when the finances of the Commonwealth improve, to authorize further expenditure, the proposal, I am sure, will meet with the approval of the people of this country. Those honourable members who are urging a general curtailment of what they term unnecessary expenditure on a National Memorial are carrying their objection a little too far. If we do as they suggest, we shall place Australia in a false position, because Ave shall be creating the impression that this country is in for a long period of financial depression. So far as I can see, our financial troubles are likely to be merely temporary. I agree, of course, that in setting aside £30,000 as a first instalment the GoA ernment is acting wisely. It may r be desirable to go sloAvly for this year, but if we make a false gesture by examining critically the proposal to erect a National Mr Thnnipitoii. Memorial, we shall give the people the idea that Ave have gone cold on our war time sentiment and do not wish to be bothered Will further expenditure upon any project calculated to remind us of all I strongly urge the Government to go ahead with the scheme. I am sure it will turn out right in the end. If this expenditure is' authorized IIOAV, Ave shall have no further protests concerning the general proposal, and Avhen the memorial is completed it Avill act as a magnet, attracting a large number of tourists to Canberra. From this point of vieAv it may be regarded as an important national asset, apart, altogether from its sentimental value. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has urged that Ave should discontinue all expenditure on ornamental buildings in Canberra for some time, at all events. There might, be something to say for that policy if our finances Avere really in a hopeless state; but they are not, and we should remember also that already the CommonAvealth has been involved in the expense of £12,000,000 in establishing this capital city, so we cannot very well go back. Our purpose now should be to so improve and beautify this city, both from a residential vicAvpoint, and from the tourists' viewpoint, to attract any increasing number of visitors to Canberra. Nothing is likely to prove more attractive than this magnificent National War Memorial. I feel sure that when it is finished it will draw tens of thousands of visitors to this city. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [6.11]. - I am surprised that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) should have deemed it necessary to raise objection to this proposed expenditure on the National War Memorial in Canberra. But the honourable member is rather late. The proposal has been before the' House on former occasions. It Avas referred to the Public Works Committee some time ago for inquiry and report. That body made its inquiry and furnished a report to this House. The contract for the foundations has been let, and already a considerable amount of building material has been accumulated on the site. The memorial is necessary for the housing of hundreds of thousands of pounds Avorth of war exhibits which, are stored in rented buildings in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere. It is the plain duty of this Parliament to authorize expenditure on a memorial, so as to provide, without delay, ample accommodation for the vast accumulation of war exhibits now in possession of the Government. The memorial will, as the honourable member for New England (Mr. Thompson) has said, attract large numbers of tourists to Canberra. It is only right, therefore, that there should be as little delay as possible in carrying out the work. I do not take the view that our financial position is so unsatisfactory as to render further delay necessary. In any case, the memorial will provide work for a large number of men. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) should not object to that, and there should be no objection to the scheme on the - ground that the memorial is to be erected in Canberra. The Government is to be congratulated for having made provision in these estimates for the work to be commenced. I hope also that the work will be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible, so that soon Ave shall have a memorial worthy of the men Avho went overseas and gave their lives for their country.",61
158,Mr YATES,BRITISH PREFERENCE TO THE,"I rise to a personal explanation. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) suggested just IIOAV that I was opposed to the creation of work for the unemployed. I do not wish any such mis-statement of my views to appear in Hansard Avithout comment from me. I am as anxious, as any other honourable member that work should be provided for our people. All that I am urging is that it should be work of a reproductive character, because I Avish to see our people profitably engaged, rather than employed on schemes that will not return interest on capital expenditure.

159,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Flinders-Prime Minwere ister and Minister for External Affairs) I'S.O] -(B y have)- While the Parliawhich ment has been in reeess several matters of major importance in relation to the foreign affairs of the Empire have been under the consideration of the Government. These matters have assumed a considerable degree of prominence, and last week I indicated that I Would take the earliest occasion to make a stater ment regarding them, and would afford the House an opportunity to discuss them if it desired to do so. The three matters to which I propose to refer are the contemplated Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance, the proposed resumption of diplomatic relations Will the Soviet Republics and reparations; taking them in that order. Honourable members Avill knoAv, from what they have read in the newspapers, that recently the British Government has been negotiating with the Prime Minister of Egypt for an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance to settle outstanding matters at issue betAveen Great Britain and - EgyptThose negotiations have gone a considerable distance, and certain heads of agreement have been submitted to the Egyptian Prime Minister, Avho proposes to put them before the Egyptian Parliament in an endeavour to secure its acceptance of them, and, if that happens, the negotiation of a treaty based on those heads will be proceeded with. TAVO most satisfactory events have occurred this year concerning the relations of the British Government and Egypt: the settlement of certain outstanding financial matters, arrived at in February last, and the completion of an agreement in May in relation to the controversial subject of the utilization of the Nile waters. Last month advantage was taken of the visit of the Egyptian Prime Minister to Great Britain to resume the negotiations for a treaty which were broken off in 1928. These had been conducted between Sir Austen Chamberlain, on behalf of the British Government, and SarAvat Pasha, the then Prime Minister of Egypt, but the proposals arrived at were rejected by the Egyptian Parliament. The negotiations were resumed Will Mahmoud Pasha, the present Prime Minister of Egypt, on a . basis very similar to that on which they conducted in 1927, and in a paper, which I shall lay on the table, is the note was addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Great Britain to Mahrnoud Pasha, indicating the lines upon which, the British Government was prepared to negotiate a treaty. These differ from the former basis gard to a matter in which Australia has the greatest interest, the protection of that great artery of Empire communications, the Suez Canal. Under the negotiations of 1927, for a period of ten years the British forces in Egypt were to continue to be located at the discretion of the British Government in Cairo or Alexandria, or in any other part of Egyptian territory that the British Government might determine. In the present note it is proposed that the British forces shall be withdrawn from those two great cities, and located on the Canal. Further, in 1927 it was contemplated that the British forces would remain, in Egypt proper, if I may use that term, for a period of ten years, and then if no agreement concerning them could be arrived at by the two Governments, the matter should be referred for determination to the League of Nations. present proposal for the withdrawal of the British forces to the Suez Canal involves two questions of major importance. One is of the greatest moment to Australia, namely, whether the Suez Canal can be adequately defended by British troops stationed on the Canal itself. second matter, although also of interest, is not of such great concern to the Commonwealth in particular; it is the protection of foreigners in Egypt when the British troops have been withdrawn from Cairo and Alexandria. In the note it is proposed that after the treaty has been consummated, the responsibility of the British Government for the protection of foreigners in Egyptian territory shall be taken over completely by the Egyptian authorities; of course many problems would arise if the Egyptian authorities were not, in fact, able to carry out their obligation to protect foreigners within the territory. That question, however, vis a vis the Empire is one primarily for the determination of the British Government; in the protection of the Suez Canal Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand are, I think, equally concerned. These matters have been referred by the British Government to the Governments Mr Bruce. of the dominions and full consultation has taken place regarding the proposed agreement, although, with the exception of in. re- Australia and New Zealand, the dominion governments are not greatly interested. The Commonwealth Government recognizes the necessity for some settlement of these matters. We agree that it is necessary to attempt to arrange some basis for an alliance between Great Britain, and Egypt by which the questions outstanding between them will be definitely settled once and for all. But, whilst expressing our appreciation of the desire of the British tJovemment to arrange such an alliance, we have made it clear that no treaty would be acceptable to Australia which did not adequately and absolutely safeguard the Suez Canal. That, I think, is, speaking generally, the opinion of the whole people of Australia, irrespective of their political differences on other matters. The position has been investigated, and the view of the British Government is that the The proposal for the withdrawal of its troops to the Suez Canal area will adequately ensure the protection of the Canal. It is further proposed in the note that, in the event of war or threat of war, the British authorities shall receive every assistance from the The Egyptian authorities, and that all railways, communications, aerodromes, and other facilities shall be made available to the British authorities by the Egyptian Government. Moreover, it will be competent for the British Government to increase it3 forces in Egypt to any extern it thinks necessary. Buring the period of peace, with no threat of war, the British troops are to be located on the Canal; but it will be within the discretion of the British authorities to determine the but strength of the force to be kept there. The British Government is quite satisfied that adequate provision for the protection of the Canal is assured under the heads of agreement submitted, but the Australian Government is not yet completely satisfied on the point. We are prepared to acquiesce in the making of a treaty; but only subject to our final determination that the provision for the protection of the Canal is absolutely satisfactory and adequate. Mr E. RILEY - Suppos e the Commonwealth Government did not consider the provision adequate?",63
160,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,I ask honourable members opposite not to raise difficult quesspeak tions at the present time. To do so would not render service to Australia. At present we have only the heads of agreement for the negotiation of a treaty.,65
161,Mr BRENNAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,This emphatic language is rather challenging.,65
162,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"The British Government, unlike the honourable member, takes a wise and reasonable view of the situation.",65
163,Mr BRENNAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Why does the right honourable gentleman say that?,65
164,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Because I think it obvious that the attitude of the honourable member is neither intelligent nor helpful. The British Government, appear?* to have a wider vision, and is prepared to discuss these matters with the Australian Government before any treaty is arrived at, so that the interests of the Empire may be properly conserved. I suggest that in any discussion that may take place on the paper which I am. about to lay on the table it, is undesirable anything should be said which might embarrass the negotiations that are proceeding. This Government will not acquiesce in regard to proposals for any treaty unless we are satisfied that Empire communications through the Suez Canal, which are of vital interest to Australia, are adequately safeguarded.  ments governing the control of the Canal expire ?",65
165,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,The Suez Canal is owned by a company in which Great Britain is the predominant shareholder. Mr E. RILEY - Does Australia hold any shares in the company?,65
166,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"No. ' Great Britain's shares were acquired when Disraeli was at the head of its affairs. Their purchase was one of the greatest acts of statesmanof ship of recent times. The ownership of the canal, however, does not, in itself, safeguard Empire communication through it. The paper that I propose to lay upon the table merely embodies a note that has been addressed by the British Government to the Egyptian Government, setting out the heads of the agreement which, in due course, will be submitted to the Egyptian Parliament for its consideration. The second matter on which I desire to is the resumption of diplomatic relations between the' British Government ancl the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This matter was taken up two or three months ago by the British Government, and fairly full reports of the negotiations have appeared in the press. It will be recollected that in February, 1924, just after a previous Labour Government had come into power in Great Britain, diplomatic relations were resumed with the Soviet authorities, and ambassadors were exchanged between the two countries. Those relations continued until 1927, when, as a result of a raid upon the premises of a Soviet trading company in Great Britain, documents were obtained which showed that that trading activity was in reality a centre for the dissemination of Bolshevist propaganda in Great Britain. The British Government, which had the support of the British Parliathat ment in its action, thereupon promptly severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet authorities, the British ambassador being recalled, ancl the Soviet ambassador being asked ro leave Great Britain. On the 24th June last, the matter was again taken up by the present Labour Government of Great Britain. It advised the Dominion Governments that it proposed to enter into negotiations with the SovietGovernment with a view to relations being resumed . between the Soviet ancl Great Britain. Our reply to the cablegram of the British Government was that we fully recognized that the existingseverance of relations between the two countries could uot continue indefinitely, that we were completely in sympathy with the proposal that negotiations should be opened with a view to the resumption diplomatic relations, but that we held strongly the view that before that could happen certain outstanding questions must bo settled. We particularly stressed the view that definite action should be taken to prevent the diplomatic representation of the Soviet Government from being made the medium for the dissemination of propaganda in British territory, and we indicated that unless satisfied that there were safeguards against the dissemination of Bolshevist propaganda in Australia, we should not be prepared to receive a representative of the Soviet Government. That view was generally acquiesced in by the British Government, which indicated that, before resuming diplomatic relations, it proposed that there should be a settlement of outstanding questions, such as those relating to the debts owed to Great Britain. The British Government stated that it proposed to approach the Soviet Government on that basis. On the 12th July last we were advised that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain had approached the Norwegian Government with the request that its representative in Russia should open up negotiations with the Soviet Government with a view to the resumption of diplomatic relations. The Note despatched through the Norwegian representative at Moscow was dated the 15th July, and was couched in the following terms. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have carefully considered the existing state of relations between this country and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and are prepared to re-establish the normal machinery of diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on the understanding that the reciprocal rights and duties which international law recognizes as incumbent on States in their relations with one another subsist between this country and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. To this end His Majesty's Goveniment invite the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to send a responsible representative to London in order to discuss with the Foreign Secretary direct the most expeditious procedure for reaching as rapidly as possib.10 a friendly and mutually satisfactory settlement of the outstanding questions between the two countries, including those relating to propaganda and debts. On the 24th July, the Soviet Government delivered the following reply to His Majesty's Government in Great Britain, through the Norwegian representative at MoscowThe Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics note the communication from the British Government that they are willing to re-establish diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, of which the interruption was not in consequence of the fault or the desire of the Government of the Union. The Government of the Union welcome this proposal in the interests of both countries and of the cause of peace. The Government of Mr Bruce. the Union consider it necessary that there shall be established, as soon as possible, lasting agreement regarding the disputed questions, and believe that such a lasting agreement can only be attained through both parties being treated as having equal rights, and by the maintenance of reciprocal dignity and esteem. The Government will assume the rights and duties of States in diplomatic relations between them as soon as the British Government takes upon itself these rights and duties. In view of the fact that the note from the British Government aims at the preliminary exchange of views, exclusively regarding the procedure to be followed in the subsequent discussion of the disputed question, and not an actual discussion of these questions, and being of the opinion that these deliberations regarding procedure can be concluded in the course of a very short period, the Government are requesting Monsieur Dovgalevski, plenipotentiary representative of the Union in France, to journey to London for this purpose. On receipt of that note, the Soviet representative in France was invited to visit London. He did so, and conversations vvere held between him and Mr. Arthur Henderson, the British Foreign Secretary, on the 29th and the Slst July. Those negotiations were of a personal character. The British Government offered to resume diplomatic relations on the basis that, there should be a preliminary discussion of outstanding questions, such as the debt and the manner in which the propaganda which unquestionably had been carried on in the past i;onl<:i be prevented. Unfortunately, the powers conferred upon the Soviet representative did not allow him to conduct negotiations along those lines. The attitude of the Soviet Government was that there should be an immediate resumption of diplomatic relations and an exchange of diplomatic representatives. Mr Henderson made it perfectly clear that the British Government was not prepared to resume negotiations with, the questions I have mentioned still outstanding. He contended that the solution of those questions should precede the resumption of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors, and pointed out that it was his hope that the discussion could take place during the parliamentary recess which was then about to commence, so that he might be. in a position to give to the British Parliament when its sittings were resumed a definite indication of the basis upon which it was proposed to resume diplomatic relations between the two countries. He also made it clear that before relations were resumed and ambassadors exchanged, the British Government would submit, or at all events report, the matter to Parliament. That view was entirely unacceptable to the representative of the Soviet Government, who clearly had no power to negotiate on such a basis. The matter was determined by a note addressed by Monsieur Dovgalevski to the British Government on the 31st July in the following terms:The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have done everything on their side to facilitate rapprochement between the Union and Great Britain and the resumption of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. The fact, however, that the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has stated to Monsieur Dovgalevski, the Soviet Ambassador to France, that it is impossible the British Government to re-establish normal relations between the two countries before a solution of the questions outstanding between them shows that the British Government do not desire or are unable to bring about the resumption of these relations. If*such were not the case, the British Government would not have proposed, as a preliminary condition for the re-establishment of normal relations, the solution of questions so complicated and contentious as mutual claims and counter claims. This new circumstance, which was not foreshadowed by the note from the British Government addressed to the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the 17th - Inly, requires a fresh examination of the question. For that reason, the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs finds itself compelled to ask for fresh instructions from the Praesidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Union, which will consider the new proposal of the British Government at its next plenary session. There the matter has ended for the time being. As there is no indication as to when the meeting of the Praesidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Union will take place, it must be assumed that negotiations have been temporarily suspended.",65
167,Mr FENTON,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,The Soviet Eepublic is a very good wool-buyer.,67
168,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"It is quite easy to uuderstand that the honourable member has considerable sympathy with the Soviet Government; but it would be an admirwhich able thing if in these matters honourable members opposite possessed a little of common-sense of the Labour Government of Great Britain. The third matter is the subject of the German reparation payments, which has assumed considerable importance by reason of the recent attempt of the nations concerned to arrive at a definite settlement of this very difficult and complicated problem. On the 16th September, 1928, representatives of the British, German, French, Belgian, Italian, and Japanese Governments agreed, at a meeting held at Geneva, that it was desirable that an attempt should be made to overcome some of the existing reparation difficulties, with a view to arriving at a final and satisfactory settlement of the whole matter. It was agreed that acommittee of financial experts should be nominated for by these six Governments, and in the course of further conversations among representatives of those Governments, it was considered desirable that representatives of the United States of America, should be invited to sit upon the committee, which was to meet in Paris at the earliest possible date, its conclusions to be reported to the Governments concerned and to the Eeparations Commission. The United States of America agreed to its citizens acting on the committee, nnd the first meeting of the committee was held in Paris on the 11th February, Mr Owen Young, one of the representatives of America, being made its chairman. The committee was entirely a committee of experts, nominated by their Governments; it was not a committee of representatives of Governments, nor were its conclusions binding on the Governments concerned.",67
169,Mr HUGHES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Was that committee working on the Dawes plan ?,67
170,Mr BEUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"The Spa agreement of 1920, as modified by the Dawes' plan of 1925, was the basis of the deliberations of the committee. Its deliberations were protracted, and, although no official reports were issued, unofficial reports began to appear in the press, one of clearly indicated that provision was being made for an alteration of the the annuities payable by Germany. It was further indicated that the variation of percentages would mean a diminution of the amount received by the British Empire. Under the modified Spa agreement the distribution - was as follows:France 54.4 British Empire 23.1 Italy 10.0 Japan Portugal Greece Roumania . - 1.1 Jugo-Slavia 5.0 Belgium 4.5 The British Empire's share of 23.1 per cent, is distributed in this mannerGreat Britain 80.85 Canada 4.35 Australia 4.35 South Africa Mew Zealand 1.75 India 1.2 Newfoundland Dependent Colonies .8 Upon the publication' of those unofficial reports, the Commonwealth Government cabled to the British Government indicating that, without having before it any official information with regard to the reports of the experts who were in conference, it could not express any views upon any proposals that the committee might have in contemplation as to the diminution of the annuities payable by Germany; but would be prepared to consider the matter when the facts were placed before it. The cablegram stated further that we were disturbed by the suggestion that there might be a departure from the existing basis of distribution, and strongly urged that no agreement should be arrived at which countenanced the diminution of the British Empire's proportion of the annuities as fixed by the modified Spa agreement. On the Oth May, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr ""Winston Churchill) made a statement in the House of Commons to the effect that the conclusions of the Committee of Experts did not commit His Majesty's Government, which remained entirely free to review the whole position, and to make its own decision upon the recommendations of the committee when published. He further stated that the British Government was not prepared to acquiesce in any proposals for the future distribution of Mr [irnm. annuities which meant a reduction of the percentage to be received by Great Britain. Per eent. Mr COLEMAN - Were the conclusions arrived at by the Committee of Experts unanimous? .75 Mr Bruce - Yes . On the 7th June .75 the Committee of Experts presented its .4. report. I do not propose to weary thf House by giving its proposals in detail. They are embodied in the paper which I shall lay upon the table, but I wish to direct some remarks to the contemplated reduction of Great Britain's share. The Per cent. report, as perhaps was natural, was accepted by Prance, that country receiving a considerable increase in its percentage .6 under the new proposals. Germany accepted the report as a basis for negotiation and discussion, and a conference was .1 summoned to discuss the matter. It met at the Hague on the 5th August of this year.",67
171,Mr BEASLEY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"What was the proposed reduction in the percentage payable to Great Britain? . Mr Bruce - Grea t Britain would receive approximately £2,500,000 less per annum. Mr J. FRANCIS - What was the amount agreed to at the Spa and the 1925 Paris conferences, and what is the proposed amount?",68
172,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"It would take too long to give the honourable member such details, but I shall state the substance of the arrangements. There are various recommendations on which I need not elaborate, but the re-allocation of the percentages would mean a yearly loss to Great Britain of about £2,500.000. .",68
173,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,What percentage diminution does that represent?,68
174,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Unde r the existing agreement, the British Empire receives 23.1 per cent, of the total annuities paid by Germany. I cannot give, off hand, the percentage reduction, but the yearly reduction is about £2,500,000. The total German annuitiesare fixed as follows:September 1, 1920, to March 31, 1930 . . £37,000,000 1930-31 to 1065-60-3 6 annuities, with an average of .. .. 99,500,000 1966-67 to 1.987-88-2 2 annuities, sufficient to cover the war debt payments of the different countries to the United States of America. The conference which met on the 5th August appointed financial and political sub-committees, which have been considering the report of the experts. The Commonwealth Government has requested His Majesty's Government to represent it at the earlier stages of the conference. The attitude of the representative of the British Government, the Chancellor  has been a definite one, with which we in Australia entirely agree. He stipulates that there shall be no reduction of the percentage of annuities which the British Empire receives under the existing agreement. Great Britain does not challenge the total amount to be paid, the conditions of payment or the establishment of an international bank, as recommended by the Committee of Experts. It objects, however, to the basis for the distribution of the annuities proposed, and to the size of the French share of the unconditional annuities, which amounts to £24,500,000 out of a total of £33,000,000. There are two classes of payments, unconditional annuities and conditional annuities. But, instead of delaying the House with a lengthy dissertation on the subject, I shall ask honourable members to examine that aspect of the matter for themselves by a perusal of the papers. The British Government takes strong exception to the amount of the payments in kind, which in the past have had a very disastrous effect upon British trade, and strongly urges the increased reduction of, and the speedier abolition of deliveries in kind, especially coal. The deliberations at the Hague Conference, which started on the 5 th August, have centred on Mr. Snowden's objection to the proposed reduction of the payments to the British Empire by about £2,500,000 a 3-ear. If this reduction were effected, Great Britain's share of the reparations would equal only the amount required each year by the Government of Great Britain to meet its future obligations in the way of debt repayments to the United States of America. If the payments are reduced as contemplated, the result will be that Great Britain will have no hope of recouping herself for the £180,000,000 or £200,000,000 which she has already paid to the United States of America in settlement bf her war debt obligations, over and above anything she has received in the way of payments from her own debtor nations, or by way of reparations.",68
175,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Did the experts advance any reasons in support of this proposed reduction?,69
176,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Yes ; very full reasons were offered. It ""would be expensive to have the report printed and circulated, but I shall lay it on the table so that it may be available to any one who is interested in the subject. The British Government is fighting this battle very strenuously, and I believe that the people of Australia have every sympathy with it, and are prepared to offer it all possible support.",69
177,Mr HUGHES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"What would this revised scheme, if given effect, mean monetarily to Australia ?",69
178,Mr BRUCE,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"It - would not mean any financial loss to Australia.

MrWHITE (Balaclava) [8.50] This is, perhaps, not the time, following upon an all-night sitting, to do justice to a subject which I feel is almost sacred. I cannot remain silent, however, while there is any danger that the project to build the Australian National War Memorial in Canberra may be abandoned. With all due deference to those honourable members who this afternoon opposed the building of the memorial, I feel that they have not a sufficiently l of t y conception of what the memorial stands for. It will not represent merely so many tons of marble or brick; the spiritual significance of this shrine, if it is to have any significance at all, is that it w i ll t y p if y the spirit of sacrifice. We are all prepared to admit that the memorial is essentially a tribute to those soldiers who lost their lives at the war. Their names, and theirs only, will be engraven upon it . It is to them that we luckier ones, we who did come back, those who were not able to go, and those who profited and cheered, should pay tribute. It is our duty to see that they are not forgotten. It will be contended, perhaps, that there is no danger of their being forgotten while memorials to them stand in every town throughout the country. Certainly those men who lost their lives in the service of their country will not be forgotten in this generation, because most of them left others behind to mourn their going who w i ll remember them as long as memory lasts. But wil l the nest generation remember, aud the next? This memorial is designed to be a perpetual reminder throughout the ages of the sacrifices made by those who died for their country. The Legacy Club has as its motto and watchword the beautiful verse written by Col. MCCrae, who was killed in France, a verse containing sentiments we would do well to remember. It is as follows:To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high, If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders' fields. We must not fail in this duty to the soldiers who passed over. Moreover, this building will be not only a memorial, but also a war museum, and the repository of the priceless historical records of the Australian Imperial Eorce. It will be an everlasting reproach to us if we neglect to proceed now Will this undertaking. We must not delay the - matter so long that public interest in it - vvill wane. existence of small memorials throughout the country should encourage us to propeed with this work immediately. Who has not felt inspired by the sight of the simple but beautiful memorial which overlooks the tOAvn of Albury, that shaft of light which at night can be seen for miles in every direction? If Mr White. the States and the small towns can each have their OAVJI memorial, is it not. still more important that the national city of Australia should be embellished with a memorial t y p if y i ng the sacrifice of Australian soldiers as a whole? Parliament agreed to the erection of this memorial some time ago, and money has already been expended on the work. No doubt it is an effective argument in these straitened times to urge that funds should not be expended on what some might describe as useless bricks and mortar. That, however, is not the way in which Ave should ArieAV the matter; we should recognize our duty, and proceed Will the work to which we have pledged ourselves. The Legacy Clubs of Australia at their Eederal conference have carried a resolution to the effect that when the Avork is put in hand only returned soldiers should be employed upon it , and that, I think, should commend itself to every one. We should deliberate now, not as to whether we should proceed Will the work, but as to hoAv soon we can proceed Will it. Eor that reason I support the motion now before the committee.",69
179,Mr TONES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Indi ) [ 8 . 5 8 ] - I cordially approve of the noble sentiment, which inspires and the Avorthy conception which prompts the erection of a National War Memorial at Canberra. Such a memorial will serve as an appropriate tribute of homage to those Avho gave their lives during the Great'War. There are very feAv cemeteries in Australia where one cannot find a tablet or tombstone erected to perpetuate the memory of some individual soldier who gave his l if e for his country. More than that, in practically every town and village throughout Australia memorials have been erected to the honour of those Avho left the district to serve their country overseas. In the capital cities elaborate memorials have been erected in honour of those Avho have fallen, and in Melbourne a magnificent shrine of remembrance is The now in course of construction. It therefore seems fitting that in our national capital a suitable memorial should some day be erected, but the view I hold is that it is our first duty to see that returned soldiers who are still with us, and their dependants, are amply provided for. I am sure that that would be the wish of those men whose memories it is desired to perpetuate. It is distressing to realise that, notwithstanding the. efforts made to repatriate returned soldiers and to alleviate the sufferings of many who returned incapacitated, many are still urgently requiring greater consideration ancl comfort than they are now receiving. If it is the desire of the Australian people to properly recognize service and sacrifice, I unhesitatingly contend that the proper way to do that is to improve the conditions of our returned soldiers ancl their dependants.",70
180,Mr ATKINSON,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,But the money provided under these estimates could not be spent in the direction which the honourable member suggests.,71
181,Mr JONES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"If a saving of £30,000 could be effected in this instance, a similar amount could possibly be made available from another source. I am not opposing the construction of a national memorial, which is undoubtedly an essential work, but I maintain that in the present financial circumstances it cannot be regarded as urgent. Recently j . attended a conference at Albury to urge the necessity of completing the construction of the Hume reservoir, which I regard as a reproductive work.",71
182,Mr ABBOTT,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Is not the Hume reservoir near the electorate of the honourable member ?,71
183,Mr JONES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"An ex-president of the Returned Soldiers Association attended the conference, ancl suggested that the construction of a national memorial at Canberra should be suspended for the present, particularly as many of his comrades who had been engaged at the Hume reservoir had been thrown out of work in consequence of the restriction of opera-tions. The completion of that great undertaking should not be delayed, as the moment it is completed it will commence paying interest on capital expenditure. During a recent tour of the upper Murray ancl the Riverina districts, I was in .conversation with a number of graziers who were looking for agistment for their stock owing to the drought there prevailing. I was informed that in one year 15,000,000 sheep died in Australia and if these had a value of 20s. a head, the total loss to Australia was tremendous. If a huge national work such as the Hume reservoir had been completed and water made available a good deal of that loss could have been obviated. Every penny available should be expended on reproductive national works of that character, and I appeal to the Government to seriously consider the completion of that undertaking, which will be of great benefit to thousands of settlers. I desire to make it quite clear that I am'not opposed to the ultimate erection of a national war memorial, because I tliink it is the duty of the Australian people to recognize the sacrifice of those who fought for the Empire. I agree with the views ex pressed by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who said that we had to consider the spiritual significance of such a memorial, and not its actual value. A simple cenotaph such as is erected in London would cost very little, and perhaps would serve the purpose until sufficient funds are available to carry out a more elaborate scheme. As I consider it desirable to defer this expenditure, I shall vote against the item.",71
184,Mr BELL,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Darwin) [9.7] - In the Works and Buildings estimates submitted last year, provision was made for a portion of the cost of a national war memorial at Canberra. On that occasion I opposed the expenditure, and I am still of the opinion that, for a time at least, the money which it is proposed to spend could be put to a much better use. I congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) upon his maiden speech in this House, and agree with what he said concerning the spiritual significance of a national war memorial. As we have been reminded by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) of the necessity of keeping down expenditure to the lowest possible limit, we must curtail works which are not urgently needed. It is pleasing to find that there are many fine memorials . erected throughout the Commonwealth, the cost of which has been spontaneously met by the people in the districts in which they are erected. At present a memorial is being erected on the Suez Canal in memory of those who fell in Sinai and Palestine, the cost of which was raised by a voluntary contribution of a day's pay from the men engaged in the eastern section",71
185,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,What has been done in connection with that memorial?,71
186,Mr BELL,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"It will be completed early next year. As the fund was started soon after the first battle was fought in the eastern section, many gallant men contributed towards their own memorial. The proposed national war memorial in Canberra is of a different character, as it is being provided out of public funds. As loan expenditure has to be curtailed to the extent that expenditure is incurred on essential public works, we arc actually constructing the memorial with borrowed - money. I am sure my attitude will not be misunderstood. I am in favour of the construction of a suitable memorial when funds can readily be made available; but I maintain that at present it is our duty to proceed with the work of defending and developing this country rather than with constructing a memorial on the slopes of Mount Ainslie, in the Eederal Capital' Territory, in honour of those who gave up their lives in the Great War. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [9.11] - I intend to support this item, as I feel that the construction of a national war memorial at Canberra should not be further delayed. I am somewhat disappointed to find that the amount provided is not larger. I have no desire to confuse the issue by levelling a charge against the Government for neglecting to do the right thing for our returned soldiers aud their dependants, many of whom I know are in a desperate plight. Acute distress is prevalent in the capital cities in consequence of unemployment. and hundreds of returned men in the coal-fields have been locked out in consequence of the situation that has arisen there. The work of constructing a national war memorial at Canberra was referred to a parliamentary committee which two years ago submitted a favourable report. Last .year Parliament voted £50,000 for this purpose, of which amount only £30,000 was expended. It is now proposed to vote an additional £30,000 for this financial year. member of the Public Accounts Committee, which inquired into the building costs iii the Federal Capital Territory, I formed the opinion that the main essential in Canberra is a fixed construction policy. During the initial stages difficulty was experienced in obtaining the services of a suitable class of workman, owing to the uncertainty of continuous employment. Business people and the residents generally are also inconvenienced by the lack of continuity in government policy. In these circumstances I trust that this - big national work will be proceeded with, as the amount provided in this instance is small compared with the total cost to be incurred. Much of the opposition to this item has come from representatives of electorates in Victoria and South Australia, and I am afraid that their attitude is inspired by antagonism to the Federal Capital, which is so closely identified with the State of New South Wales rather than by a desire to see the money expended in other directions. From time to time members of the Opposition have criticised the Government for its failure to proceed with a progressive policy of public works; in so doing we have never suggested that such works should not be undertaken in Canberra, or should not include the National War Memorial. One reason, why I desire public works proceeded with is that employment may be found for the large number of unemployed in our midst. If the nmount of £30,000 appearing on the Estimates is voted it will provide for no more - than the preliminary works necessary before a commencement may be made with the erection of the main buildings. The considerable unemployment in Canberra will be relieved by the voting of this amount, because much of it will be expended in wages, and help will be afforded to the unfortunate men connected with the building trades who have been rendered workless through the lack of continuity in the policy of building this city. I could say a great deal regarding extravagance and fraudulent practices in the development of the Federal Capital, but past history will uot be allowed to prejudice my mind against the item now under consideration. I hope that the As a Minister for Home Affairs will make a statement as to what, amount has been already expended, and how the proposed vote of £30,000 is to be applied.",72
187,Mr MACKAY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Lilley) [9.17] - I was Chairman of the Public Works Committee which presented to this Parliament in June of last year a report on the proposed National War Memorial, a project that has heen before the people of Australia for a considerable time. recognize that we are passing through a period of financial stringency, but of the amount of £50,000 voted last year, only a portion has been spent and the balance is still available for this year. The Public Works Committee took exhaustive evidence in regard to this proposal, and was informed that the records to be housed in the memorial are very valuable. In Melbourne and Sydney they have been viewed with interest by hundreds of thousands of people. The War Museum is not a mere collection of guns and ments of war, but is a remarkable assembly of relics, photographs, writings, drawings, and paintings, which will constitute a very interesting and instructive record.",72
188,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Was the Committee realise unanimous in recommending the work?,73
189,Mr MACKAY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"To the best of my committed recollection, it was. One of effective arguments that might be used in favour of immediately proceeding with the voted against it. erection of the memorial is that the collection now temporarily accommodated in Sydney is highly inflammable. We should not continue to risk a fire which would destroy records that could not replaced. The War Memorial will inmemorial clude a register of the names of the 80,000 Australians who lost their lives during Great War-the only complete public Howse). record of its kind in Australia.",73
190,Mr BRENNAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Hav e we not arranged for a War Museum apart from the War Memorial ?,73
191,Mr MACKAY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"No ; the War Memembers. morial will house the collection now known as the War Museum. The purultimate pose of the memorial will uot be the glorification of war; rather will it tend to educate the minds of all beholders garding the horrors of war. I agree that, in a time of financial stringency, expenunselfish diture should generally be confined to productive works; but the National Museum represents an obligation to, and a contract made with, the Australian people, and already its construction has been too long delayed. The total cost, cluding the laying out of the gardens aj-proaches, will be . approximately [li] £400,000, but the Government is proposing to spend only a small amount this year. If we are sincere in our professed I intention to honour the brave men who fell in the war, we should act before the enthusiasm of the community commences to wane. I hope that during the next twelve months the economic position of Australia will so improve that it will be possible for this Parliament to vote the whole of the amount necessary to complete the memorial.",73
192,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Reid) [9.21] - In regard to the proposal to postpone further work on the War Memorial, I have an impleopen mind, and before I commit myself I should like to hear a statement from the Minister for Home and Territories. Obviously this is a non-party matter, and honourable members on both sides are divided in opinion as to whether the work is of immediate and pressing urgency. I that by a resolution carried unanimously by this House last year we are to the completion of a National the most War Memorial in Canberra.",73
193,Mr KILLEN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Not unanimously; I,73
194,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"There may have been a division as to the expediency of expending any money last year, but the be motion for the construction of a war in Canberra was carried without a division on the motion of the Minthe ister for Repatriation (Sir Neville",73
195,Mr LAZZARINI,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,But not necessarily unanimously.,73
196,Mr KILLEN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Severa l speeches against the proposal were made by honourable,73
197,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Not against the construction. Nobody in this Parliament is opposed to the suitable commemoration of the sacrifices made by reAustralian soldiers in the Great War; everybody is ready to pay tribute to the spirit which impelled men to reoffer their lives on the altar of their War country. Some people may be of the opinion that the war was fought in vain, and for mistaken ideals; but that consideration does not affect my judgment of in the proposal now before us. The quesand tion we have to consider this evening is whether it is expedient during the present period of financial stringency to spend £30,000 on the memorial this year, hearing in mind the fact that expenditure on very urgent national works of a reproductive character will be either suspended or seriously curtailed. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones) truly said that if those who have fallen could. be consulted, they would tell us to proceed with urgent national projects which will provide work and sustenance for the living. I ask the Minister to tell the committee what amount was expended on the memorial last year, and how it was expended.",73
198,Mr ABBOTT,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Of the £30,000 voted on the Estimates last year only £10,000 was spent; the balance was placed in a trust account, and is available for expenditure this year.",74
199,Mr COLEMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"If the building had been actually commenced it would be economically unsound to discontinue construction and dismiss the hundreds of men engaged upon it ; but if construction has not commenced it may be advisable to divert the proposed expenditure to some more urgent work in the Federal Capital Territory. A vote against the item will not involve the abandonment of the memorial; it will merely mean the postponement of further operations until the next financial year. However, the committee is groping in the dark, and perhaps hours of unnecessary debate will be avoided if the Minister will explain to the committee exactly what work has been done. Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [9.28]. - I am surprised to hear some honourable members opposing the continuance of operations for the erection of a National War Memorial in Canberra. perience warns us that often when the erection of a memorial is delayed the work is never undertaken. I have in mind proposals for the erection of memorials to the memory of those who fell in the-South African War; some which were delayed were not completed for 25 years, and others not at all. In 1925 this Parliament, sitting in Melbourne, passed the Australian War Memorial Act, which provides1. There shall be a Commonwealth Memorial of the Australians who died in war. 2. The Memorial shall be known as the Australian War Memorial, and shall consist of the collection of the war relics of the Commonwealth and such building for the accommodation of those relics as is specified by the Governor General by notice in the Gazette. 3. The war relics of the Commonwealth shall include the relics, records, models, pictures, photographs, and other articles which at the commencement of this act comprises the Australian War Museum and any other such articles, having relation to the war, which are acquired in pursuance of this act. The report of the Public Works Committee regarding this project is well worth reading. Of the war museum it saysThis great collection is said to be unique of its kind, in that it constitutes not a war museum portraying-muc h less glorifying - war , but a memorial conceived, founded, and from first to last worked for by Australian sailors and soldiers themselves in honour of their fallen comrades. The national war memorial is to take the form of a monumental building in which the war records and relics of the Australian Imperial Force will be housed. A feature of it will be the Hall of Memory, upon the walls of which will be inscribed the names of our illustrious dead. It is estimated that upwards of 80,000 names will be placed upon those walls. Sixty thousand of these will be the names of the men who were killed on active service; the other 20,000 will be the names of men who have since died from war injuries. The names will be recorded without any indication of rank or distinction, in order that they may mark the equal sacrifice of every Australian who gave his life for his country. I know that some honourable members feel that this is not the time to Past exspend a large sum of money on a memorial, but the fact remains that the representatives' of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League in every State in Australia have urged that the work should be put in hand at the earliest possible moment. I believe that that is the overwhelming opinion of the great majority of ex-service men. As a member of the War Memorial Board, appointed to assist and advise the Commonwealth Government in building the memorial in Canberra, I frequently the remind myself of the immortal words in the famous funeral oration of Pericles, spoken 2,000 years ago over the dead soldiers of another democracyThey gave their lives. For that public they received a praise which never ages and tomb most glorious-no t so much the tomb which they lie, but that in which their survives to be remembered for ever when occasion comes for word or deed. I trust that honourable members will show by an overwhelming majority that they favour pressing on with the erection this memorial without delay.",74
200,Dr MALONEY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Melbourne) [9.39] Whether we should or should not erect memorial to our glorious dead is hardly the question before us. All that we be concerned with is the form that the memorial should take. We should have memorial of the greatest beauty that the human mind can devise. It will be agreed, I think, that the most beautiful buildings which human hands have made have been temples. There is, perhaps, nothing to compare with the Parthenon at Athens; but we need more than a temple. It will be remembered that Eepatriation building in Melbourne situated near the Victorian war memorial, and alsonear the lesser memorial erected in honour of the South African soldiers. - I was looking at those memorials some little time ago, when a hungry and ill clad digger whom I knew, came along and that should be done. said to me "" They propose to put up national war memorial at a cost of many thousand pounds. When they build this memorial they should make provision in or his immediate relatives. it for diggers who are down on their luck to get a bath, a bed, some decent clothing, and a feed "". That would be a worthy memorial. I have always been opposed to the building of solitary monuments. I know that this proposal has received the approval of Parliament, but it is very difficult at times for one to register disagreement with propositions that are placed before the House. I cannot speak as a "" digger "", although I volunteered active service during the first week of war. Dr Charles Eyan, before whom had to appear, laughed at me and told me that I was too old. I may have been old, but surely I could have been of some service at the front in bandaging a limb or in some other way. I was a member of the Victorian Eecruiting Committee right through the war. As a matter fact, I was the only original member of it left when peace was declared. I heard many recruiting addresses delivered from gift our public platforms by eloquent men a in all grades of society, but never once did in I hear a speaker promise our young men fame that if tMey enlisted the Government would see that a glorious monument was erected to commemorate their deeds. They were promised, however, that their wives and mothers, and their children and other of dependants, would be cared for. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) has referred to the delay that a has occurred in many places in the erection of war memorials. This delay should has often been due to lackadaisical trustees of various funds that have been a raised for the purpose. I well remember that my friend, the late Sir John Madden, Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, promised the men who enlisted that their wives and children and other dependants would be cared for; but subsequently I often heard him say with intense feeling that his lips had been made to lie, for the the promises made to the men had not been is fulfilled. After the South African war the promises made to the men were scandalously repudiated or forgotten. It was not quite so bad after the last great war. But we still have a long way to go - before it can be said that we have done all Consequently, I a favour the building of a memorial in which provision will be made for helping any sick, hungry or unfortunate digger, We want more than a building which will satisfy our sense of beauty. We want something that will make it possible for us to render practical help to the men whose deeds we are seeking to recognize.",75
201,Mr ATKINSON,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Wilmot) [9.40] his I agree with (honourable members who have said during this debate that money is needed for a great many reproductive for works in Australia; but I feel that we the have a sacred duty to discharge in the I building of this memorial. The work should be put in hand and completed as early as possible. While I shall be glad to do all I can to ensure that the available public funds will be put to the best use in meeting the needs of the country, I feel that I should be failing in my duty of if I did not advocate the completion of this memorial, which we hope will give true aud beautiful expression to the spirit of self sacrifice displayed during the war by those who went on active service. The memorial should be of such a nature that it will for all time inspire young people with the highest ideals of citizenship and patriotism. I trust that war will soon be ended for ever, but there will be other avenues of life in which the spirit of self sacrifice will need to be played. I congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) upon his first speech in this House. He struck a high note and set before us a great ideal. He may find it difficult to maintain his ground in the hurly-burly of politics, but he has certainly started well. I feel that our pressing on with the building of this memorial will not in any way prejudice the claims of the needy ex-service men in our midst. Even if the memorial were not built the money proposed to be devoted to the purpose would not be available for other repatriation purposes. We ought to do every thing in our power to rehabilitate our soldiers and to ensure that their dependants are provided for,, but we should also build this memorial. I trust that this proposed vote will be agreed to, and that next year an even larger amount will be placed on the Estimates for the completion of the work. I am not an ardent advocate of Canberra, for I am of the opinion that we have come here far too soon. But seeing that we are here, the war memorial should be constructed without delay.",75
202,Mr ABBOTT,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Gwydir-Minister for Home Affairs) [9,46] - When the Public Works Committee reported on the proposal to erect a war memorial at Canberra its cost was estimated at £270,079. That was for a building to be constructed with a granite facing. Accessory services debit able against the cost of the memorial were estimated to cost a further £99,892, making a total of £369,971 for the main building. In addition, there was a sum of £43.019 which, while not actually debitable to Ihe memorial, was for works to be carried out by the Commission in keeping with the plan for rhe development of that part of the city known as ANZAC Park. Parliament adopted the report, and a sum of money was placed on the Estimates. As, however, the whole of the amount so provided was not expended, the sum of £20,000 was placed in a trust account. Should this item be agreed to, the total our amount available this year for the main work of the building will be £50,000. The proposal to construct this building should, be viewed from two angles; first, it will be a memorial to the Australian dissoldiers who fell in the Great War; and, secondly, it will play an important part in the development of the national capital. Honourable members will recall that, when on ANZAC Da'y of this year a commemorative stone was laid by the Governor General, the ceremony was most impressive. The service was broadcast throughout Australia, and according to newspaper reports, considerable interest in the proceedings was taken by the people everywhere. Every organization of returned soldiers has approved of the erection of the memorial, and, so far as I know, the majority of the men to be employed on the building will be returned soldiers. In my opinion, the housing of the records and souvenirs of the Australian Imperial Force is an important part of the project. Those records have made a tremendous appeal to the Australian public. The aggregate attendances* of persons who have inspected them in Melbourne and Sydney have exceeded the attendances of visitors to similar exhibits in other countries. There is clear evidence of the interest of the people in this matter. As the Minister in charge of Canberra I remind honourable members that during the forthcoming year there will be a considerable lessening of construction work in the capital. Approval to this item will mean that 40 or 50 married men who otherwise would be thrown out of employment will be kept working.  men are working on the memorial site now?",76
203,Mr ABBOTT,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Not many. The developmental work there has been chiefly the levelling of the approaches, requiring probably fifteen or twenty men. For the reasons I have given I appeal to the committee to agree to the item -.  - I congratulate the Government on the inclusion of this item. Work in connection - with, the memorial has already been started. A commemorative stone was laid as part of an impressive ceremony in April last, and the stoppage of the work now would be a reflection on a previous decision of this Parliament. As the representative in this Parliament of the district of Eden-Monaro, I am aware of the hardships of those living in Canberra and Queanbeyan. building of the national capital attracted many workmen who now, owing to financial stringency, are out of employment. Only yesterday J. drew the Minister's attention to the case of a man whp, after seventeen years residence in the district, had received notice of dismissal. He is only one of many similarly situated. Most of the £30,000 proposed to be expended will be paid to artisans and others. The noble sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) in a speech on which I compliment him, will, no doubt, appeal to honourable members. I ask them also to consider the effect which the passing of this item will have on the workers in this district.",76
204,Mr JAMES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Hunter) [9.53] - I am opposed to the spending of a large sum of money on the construction of a war memorial at .this juncture. It is not I have no desire to honour the men who fought in the interests of the nation; my opposition to the project is due to my knowledge of the distress which prevails throughout the Commonwealth. The money could better be expended on works of a reproductive nature which would be of benefit to the country and give employment to many returned soldiers and others who are in search of it today. Another reason for my opposition to the proposal is the treatment meted out by the War Service Homes authorities to many returned soldiers in my district. Many of the men who are living in war-service homes have recently received ejectment notices. The Minister said just now that the various organizations of returned soldiers throughout Australia have approved of the scheme. I do not question his statement, but I know that some of them are' greatly dissatisfied with the treatment of returned soldiers. If the nation wants to do something for its soldiers, it should assist those who are alive; it should show some practical sympathy with those who returned maimed, or through the unfortunate lockout in the coal mining industry cannot pay the instalments due on their homes. It is deplorable that in these cold winter months returned soldiers, with their wives and families, should be threatened with ejectThe ment. I know of cases in which little children, only a few months old, will have to leave their homes at the end of this month unless the arrears of rent due by their fathers are paid.",77
205,Mr FENTON,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,Surely they will not be turned out.,77
206,Mr JAMES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"I have here a letter sent by the Cessnock and District Sub-branch of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia to the DeputyCommissioner of War Service Homes as well as many others from soldiers who, according to these threats, will have to go out of the war service homes they now occupy. This letter readsSir,I have before my notice a notification from your department, sent to Edwin Odgers, of 6 Harris-street, Cessnock, notifying him that owing to his account being in arrears to the extent of £53 10s., the Commissioner is reluctantly obliged to institute proceedings for that recovery of the land and dwelling. This man is well known by my committee to be a sober and level-headed man, with an earnest wish to do the right thing at all times. For the past two or more years he has had one continual up-hill struggle. He was one of the unfortunate men to be put off work more than two years ago. In the meantime he got a start again, but was soon laid idle owing to an accident. Then came the present five months lockout during which time he was bereaved of his wife, so you will quite realise his cup of bitterness. His payments prove that he has a genuine being desire to pay off his liability when in a position to do so, as he has previously overpaid his monthly instalments on many occasions. He now states that if his offer will be acceptable to the Commission, he is prepared to pay £1 per month in excess of his monthly instalments, or probably more when the present coal trouble is ended, but owing to the uncertainty of its termination, he cannot fix a definite date on which to commence his payments. I can assure you that his promise is genuine, and will be fulfilled as soon as possible. If the Commission carries out its intentions to the letter, and finally ejects this man, the Commission will have achieved an unprofitable result, having on its hands another empty house. Many hundreds of houses are standing empty in this district, and are quickly becoming dilapidated. It appears to be far better to appreciate a willing and genuine paying tenant to an empty house with no prospect of a future tenant. Many landlords here are only too pleased to keep a house tenanted during this crisis, even if the tenants only act as caretakers of the property. Odgers is not asking for such consideration as this, but this sub-branch appeals to the Commission to again review this case, and stay its hand until after the settlement of the present coal trouble, as my committee are certain that this man's future efforts will fully justify any leniency you may extend to him. Thanking you in anticipation of a favourable reply. Yours faithfully, That is one case. The reply was that one month's extension would be given to this man; but, in the meantime, he must pay 5s. a week towards wiping off the arrears of payments. How could this man find 5s. a week when it takes him all his time to get sufficient to eat. The miners on the coal-fields are scouring the country to get the necessaries of life for their wives and children. They have no money with which to buy these things.",77
207,The CHAIRMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,I have allowed the honourable member great latitude; but I cannot permit him to discuss in detail the conditions on the northern coal-fields. He must confine his remarks to the item before the Chair.,78
208,Mr JAMES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,I am speaking of the returned soldiers.,78
209,The CHAIRMAN,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"The item under discussion relates, not to returned soldiers, but to the building of a war memorial.",78
210,Mr JAMES,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"I hope later to have an opportunity of reading the numerous ejectment notices that I have with me. I oppose the erection of a war memorial while the spectre of starvation is stalking through the coal-fields. Money should be expended only on reproductive works. Our boys fought for this country. Many and varied were the promises that were made to them at the time of their enlistment. They were told that they were going to make the country safe for democracy and fit for heroes to live in ; but instead of this they find the country still governed by wealthy exploiters. Many of those who returned to Australia found also to their sorrow that it was difficult for them to secure employment. They and their dependants are being treated shamefully by the governments of Australia. I oppose the item providing for this memorial, which will cost approximately £250,000.",78
211,Mr LAZZARINI,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Werriwa) [10.5] I am opposed to the proposed expenditure of £30,000 towards the erection of a war memorial at Canberra. There is a saying that it is better to pin a rose to the coat of a living man than to lay an expensive wreath upon the breast of a corpse. That, I think, will explain to honourable member's my attitude towards the proposal (Sgd.) F. COBURN, to erect a national war memorial. To-day Hon. Secretary. the Government is dismissing from its departments men who received injuries overseas; yet in this House it talks of lofty ideals and sentiments and the need to commemorate our soldiers' sacrifices at the war. Our boys enlisted in order to save this country for democracy, and believing that the war would end war. If we are to build a war memorial it should be as the result of spontaneous contribution by the nation, and not by borrowing money or draining a depleted treasury. It is unfortunate that we have in this country a Treasurer who is utterly incapable of making ends meet. This talk by the Government of noble sentiments and lofty ideals is sheer hypocrisy. To-day returned soldiers are being ejected from war service homes, and many others are on the verge of starvation. The Government speaks of the self-sacrifice of the men who gave their lives for their country; but no mention is made of the self-sacrifice of those who returned injured and sick. Our returned soldiers are entitled to every consideration, and for that reason I oppose the item.",78
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Eranklin) [10.7]. - I have always failed to perceive how any great sacrifice is involved in borrowing money to erect war memorials. Some of the memorials that have been built in the form of halls, with the names of our gallant soldiers inscribed therein, are a credit to Australia; but in many cases their erection has entailed no sacrifice on the part of the community. In view of the statement of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) this afternoon, the building of the memorial should certainly be postponed. This is not the time for Parliament to indulge in the expenditure of money unless for urgent purposes. It is worse than foolish-in fact, it is deliberately wrong-for us to attempt to hide the fact that we have lean years ahead of us. The decrease in the price of wool is a serious blow to Australia. Some experts estimate that wool prices have been reduced by at least 35 per cent. In view of that position, we are not justified in spending money on items such as this, no matter how much we may desire to show our appreciation of the sacrifices of our gallant soldiers, especially of those who did not return. This is not the proper way to show our sympathy towards these men. It has been said that many returned soldiers, some of whom were wounded during the war, are being deprived of their employment today because of the financial stringency. Before we set about the business of erecting a war memorial, we should show our sympathy with these unfortunate returned soldiers in a more practical way. If their voices could be heard here to-night, they would tell us emphatically that the best memorial that could be erected in honour of comrades who fell, would be to make more adequate provision for the dependants of deceased soldiers, as well as for those who were injured and are now in search of employment. I hope that the Minister will consent to the postponement of this item until the Budget has been discussed, and until the House has decided what action shall be taken to meet the accumulated deficit of the last two years. No honourable member wishes to vote against the proposal to erect a war memorial in Canberra, but some of us at least feel that our duty towards returned soldiers who are in need today is more pressing. We feel that not one shilling should be spent on a war memorial whilst ex-service men are out of employment owing to financial stringency. There are tens of thousands of men looking for work in all parts of Australia. I say, therefore, that this is not the time to consider proposals of this kind. If the Minister persists in pressing the item to a division, I shall feel it my duty to vote for its postponement.  [10.13] - It is a pity that this proposal should be decided on considerations of sentiment. There is the practical side also to consider. I heartily agree with the remarks of the honourable member - who has just resumed his seat (Mr. MCWilliams) and the speech of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones). I believe that if the returned soldiers themselves had an opportunity to express their views, they would with one voice declare that the best memorial which the Commonwealth could erect to the memory of their comrades who had fallen, would be to use this money to provide more adequate pensions for dependants of deceased soldiers and for the sustenance of ex-service men who are suffering from war disabilities. I am not opposed to the erection of the war memorial in Canberra at a suitable time, and I feel sure that other honourable members who have urged the postpone^ ment of the proposal have done so on the ground that the time is not opportune. Scarcely a day passes without the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) referring to the difficult position in which the Commonwealth finds itself, and every day newspapers are directing attention to the awful state of our finances. But I do not take a pessimistic view of the future. I believe that although we are passing through a bad time as a result of this Government's mismanagement, there is a good time coming, and that we should all strike a cheerful note, even if we are confronted with a huge deficit. The other night I was present at a public meeting which was attended by many returned soldiers, who owing to the present financial stringency, had lost their employment on the Hume works, and were being turned out on to the road. The president of the local branch of the Returned Soldiers League, who was one of the speakers at the meeting; said that about 400 returned soldiers had lost their employment there recently, and that they and their wives and children were now in want, simply because money was not made available for the continuance of the work, whilst at the same time the Government was making provision for the erection of this unproductive memorial in Canberra. Much has been said in the course of this debate about returned soldiers being in favour of the scheme. The president of the league in the Hume district at all events does not favour it, and I think his view is the sensible one. I endorse what the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has just said. I should prefer to see the money for this memorial made available to provide more adequate pensions for the widows and orphans of deceased soldiers, and certainly I shall vote for the postponement of this item until the financial position of the Commonwealth has improved. Even in the Federal Capital area, the housing provision for a number of ex-service men is shamefully inadequate. The shacks and unsightly cubicles which one finds in the construction camps here are not fit for human beings to live in. Whilst men are being housed in this manner, there is absolutely no justification for proceedwould be served. ing with an unproductive work like the proposed war memorial. Honourable members on this side of the House, who have spoken against this item do not object to the erection of the memorial itself. All they say is that Ave should wait till a more opportune time, and that if money is available it could be put to better use by providing more liberally for widows and orphans of deceased soldiers, and giving employment for ex-service men who are now out of work.",78
213,Mr ABBOTT,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"If this work is not proceeded with there will be more men unemployed in Canberra.  Minister's statement does not impress me. When I asked him a little while ago how many men were affected by the scheme, he said "" about 20"". If this scheme were postponed and if the money to be made available for it could be spent on the Hume reservoir for instance, it would give employment to a large number of men who already have their homes established in that district. This would be infinitely better than spending money oh an unproductive work in Canberra and encouraging men to leave other districts to secure employment here where there is no suitable housing accommodation for them. The Hume reservoir is a national work in every sense of the word. There is no justification whatever for throwing those men out of employment, and certainly no justification for the expenditure of loan money on a national war memorial when funds cannot be found for a reproductive work such as that I have in mind. The action of the Government is quite illogical. I am not opposed to the erection of the war memorial at the right time. There is a time and place for all things. Dozens of letters requesting assistance are received by honourable members every week from widows and other dependants of deceased soldiers. Some of these dependants receive only 10s. or 15s. a week by way of pension. If the proposed expenditure were not sanctioned at the present juncture, no reflection would be cast upon the memory of the soldiers who have laid down their lives for their country, and at the same time the best interests of those they have left behind",80
214,Mr COLLINS,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"Wakefield) [10.21] - I take exception to the reflections cast upon the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) and myself, because of our attitude to this proposal. Every honourable member will recollect the explanation givenby the honourable member for Adelaide. The honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Eiley) declared that the opposition to the proposal came chiefly from members from South Australia. That was a most unfair reflection upon those members. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) said that, if the work was not proceeded with, a valuable collection of war mementoes might be destroyed. Surely they are housed somewhere at the present time, and there is no immediate danger of their destruction.",80
215,Mr LAOEY,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,There is a grave fear of it. Mr J. FBANCIS - Adequat e protection cannot be afforded in the buildings available.,80
216,Mr COLLINS,RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,"It seems to be a strange position. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr DCameron) hoped that the work would be proceeded with at the earliest opportunity; but I submit that the present time is not opportune. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) contended that money was not available even for essential works, and yet he maintained chat the present proposal should be proceeded with. Although I am not a returned soldier, 1I have the honour of being a rejeoted volunteer for active service, and I bave taken the greatest interest in the returned men, even since the Bigning of the armistice. In the large constituency which I represent there are hundreds of returned soldiers who are now living on the bread line, nnd I maintain that the money proposed to be expended on the memorial, desirable as it may be, could be used to better advantage in assisting the soldiers and their families who are now in immediate need. According to the Minister, the approximate cost of the work will be in the neighbourhood of £369,000, but judging from experience of the estimated and actual cost of public works, I should not be surprised if the expenditure eventually amounted to nearly £500,000. Jf the time were opportune, I should not object to the Government spending even £1,000,000, if necessary, in order suitably to perpetuate the memory of the ineD who died for their country in the late wax. The Minister remarked that, if the proposal were rejected, workmen in Canberra would be thrown out of employment. The Minister also Btated that an amount of £17,000 from previous votes was unexpended. Tbat sum should be sufficient to keep the same number of men employed on the work in the current year. Although T appreciate the great service rendered to the Commonwealth by the members of the Australian Imperial Forces, I hope that every honourable member will object to the expenditure now proposed. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.32 p.m.",80
