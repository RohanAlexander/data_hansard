1,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown, I move That the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) do take the chair of this House as Speaker.,13
2,Mr MUXOAHY,Unknown,I second the motion.,13
3,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I accept nomination. THE CLERK --There being no further nomination, I declare Mr Roseveai elected. Members of the House then calling Mr Rosevear to the Chair, he was taken out of his place by Mr Sheehan and Mr Mulcahy and conducted to the chair. .Mr SPEAKER , standing on the upper step, said- I thank honourable members for having elected me to the high and honourable position of Speaker of this House. Mr Speaker having seated himself in the chair. - Mr Forde (Capricornia-Deput y Prime Minister) - In the unfortunate absence of the Prime 'Minister (Mr . Curtin) through illness, I , on behalf of the Government and, I am sure, of the House, offer to you, Mr Speaker, hearty congratulations upon your election to the high office of Speaker. During your' brief occupancy of the chair in the last Parliament you discharged your functions with impartiality and considerable ability. Honourable bers may rest assured that you will continue to act. up to the highest traditions of the office. You follow a long line of distinguished men, and I am confident that during your period of office you will distinguish yourself and give complete satisfaction to all honourable members.",13
4,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," The Opposition desires to be associated with the congratulations that are offered to you, Mr Speaker, upon your appointment. While in the Senate just now listening to the remarks that were addressed to us by the Senior Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General, I was much struck by the phrase used by His Honour, that we should "" retire to the place where you are to sit and there proceed to the choice of some proper person to be your Speaker"". Oddly enough, even then I had the vague idea that, you, sir, would be that proper person. You occupied the chair for only a brief period in the last Parliament, but it was sufficiently long to imbue every honourable member with the confident belief that you would be a remarkably successful Speaker. If you will permit me to catalogue them, I may say that you possess all the qualities that are needed by the occupant of the chair, namely, marked ability, great good humour, a ready w it , and a sound knowledge of the .procedure of this House. You also have exhibited the quality of impartiality. If I may say so, you will need to exercise that quality in this Parliament; because the Government is now "" compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses"" that you will find it necessary to keep your head permanently inclined to the left if you are not to do more than justice to the right. I am sure that you will do that. We all congratulate you.",14
5,Mr FADDEN,Unknown," On behalf of the Country party I , too, extend congratulations to you, Mr . Speaker - I am sure that the Ministerial party, and the House as a whole, bave made a. wise choice in having elected you to the high and honourable position of Speaker. You held that position with marked ability, conscientiousness, and impartiality for a period during which mem- we who sit on this side of the House had the opportunity to gain evidence of your qualifications. A continuation of the qualities that you tben displayed will prove eminently satisfactory to the party that I have the honour to lead.",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Government (Mr Forde), the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Menzies) and the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) for their very kindly expressions in regard to myself. As the Deputy Leader of the Government bas said, I follow a long line of honourable gentlemen wbo have occupied this chair with great distinction. I shall endeavour to continue to give that satisfaction which the leaders of the parties have said that I gave during my previous occupancy of the chair. PRESENTATION TO GOVERNOR-GENERAL.",14

9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to report that, accompanied by honourable members, I proceeded to the Library of Parliament and presented myself to His Excellency the Governor General as the choice of the House, and that His Excellency was kind enough to congratulate me on my election as Speaker.

Motion (by Mr Forde) agreed toThat a committee consisting of Mr. Chambers, Mr Williams and the mover, be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament, and that'the committee do report at the next sitting. HOUR OF MEETING. Motion (by Mr Forde) agreed toTha.t the House, at its rising, adjourn to tomorrow, at 10.30 a.m. NA SIR WILLIAMHILLIRVINE . . Mr EORJJE (Capricornia - Deputy Prime Minister) - I regret to inform honourable members of the death on the 20th August last of the Honourable Sir William Hill Irvine, formerly Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice of Victoria and earlier a member of the House of Representatives and Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The late Sir William Irvine had a very successful career embracing law and politics, the latter covering both State and Commonwealth spheres. He was elected in September, 1894, to the Legislative Assembly, Victoria, for Lowan, which seat he held till the 25th June, 1906, when he resigned. He held several ministerial offices. He was Attorney-General from December, 1899 to November, 1900, and Premier from - June, 1902, to February, 1904, holding with that office the portfolio of Attorney General til] July, 1903, and afterwards that of Treasurer. Turning his political activities to the federal sphere, he was elected to the House of Representatives, for Flinders, an Victoria, at the general elections in 1906. 19,10, 1913, 1914 and 1917. He became .Attorney-General in June, 1913, and held that .office until September, 1914. He resigned his seat in this House in April, 1918, upon his .appointment as Chief Justice of the State of Victoria. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of that State on the 8th'October, 1918. Possessing qualities of mind of a very high order, he devoted himself unsparingly to the service of his country. He assumed the task of guiding the people of Victoria during a period of very great difficulty in the history of that State. His entry later to federal politics gave further scope for the exercise of his great talents. His wide scholarship, devotion to duty and dignified courtesy earned the deep esteem of his fellow men. alone the State of Victoria, but the whole of Australia, I believe, derived material benefit from the eminent services which he rendered and we pay homage to the memory of a great Australian. I move That this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honourable Sir William Hill Irvine, n former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Flinders, and a Minister of the Crown, also a former Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice of the State ot Victoria, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",16
14,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion. It was my proud privilege to know Sir ""William I r v i ne very well, both as a politician and as a lawyer, and I shall always look back to him as one of the very great Australians of my time. He had great scholarship; he had great character; he had great courage, and, perhaps above all. he had great honesty of mind. As an advocate, as a statesman and as a judge, he served this country as, I believe, few men have served it . Tn those circumstances, we do very well to remember his work and his character, because the history and the progress of any country depend upon the quality of the men and women who serve it . Australia, I believe, was very fortunate indeed to attract first the life and then the service of such a man as Sir Willia m Irvine, and I shall remember him very distinctly as one who has very profoundly influenced my own l if e and occasionally, I hope, influenced my own conduct. The Opposition joins with the Governmeni in its expression of regret and sympathy on this occasion.",17
15,Mr RYAN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," As the present member for Flinders, which was represented for so long by Sir Willia m Irvine, I wish to pay tribute to hi3 memory. In the past, Flinders has been very fortunate in having as its representatives men of great distinction. Amongst previous representatives none served this country better in a wide sphere of offices than the late Sir Will i a m Irvine. He was, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, for twelve years the member Not for Flinders and he rendered excellent service. There are few Australians, I think, in any sphere of life who have sh own more selfless devotion to duty over a wide range of positions, including the most eminent that could be bestowed, tban Sir Will i a m Irvine. He was a man of the highest integrity and character, liberally endowed with great qualities, a man to be admired. His memory will remain as an inspiration to all tbose in public life today who are shouldering the burdens which he bore so long and so honourably.",17
16,Mr FADDEN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Darling Do w n s Leader of the Australian Country party) [3.41] - The Australian Country party associates itself with the sentiments which have been expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister regarding the passing of such a great Australian as was Sir Willia m Irvine. H is record is the best monument to his memory, and it will be an inspiring example to all Australians who desire to give this great country the service which is so requisite to the maintenance of our institutions and our democracy. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA NA CUNNINGHAM.",17
17,Mr FORDE,THE HONORABLE JAMES," It is with sincere regret that I refer to the death of Senator the Honourable James Cunningham, which took place at Albury on the 4th July last. The late James Cunningham had a long and distinguished record of service as a representative of the people, having sat as a member of each House of the Western Australian Parliament, as well as in the capacity of a senator in the Commonwealth Parliament. . He was first elected to the Legislative Council of Western Australia for North East Province at the by-election on the 7th July, 1916. He was defeated at the election in 1.922 but was elected to the Legislative Assembly in January, 1923 at the by-election for Kalgoorlie, which seat he held I moveuntil defeated at the general election in 1936. He served as an honorary Minister from the 16th April, 1924, to the 15th December, 1927, and as Minister for Goldfields and Agricultural Water Supplies from the 15th December, 1927, to the 23rd April, 1940. He was elected to the Senate for Western Australia at the general election on the 23rd October, 1937, taking his seat from that date. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from December. 1937, to August, 1940. He was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from the 10th September, 1940, until the 1st July, 1941, when he was appointed President of the Senate. He held this high office at the time of his death. His personal qualities endeared him to all members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, regardless of party. The late senator was a stalwart of the Labour movement in Western Australia in which, first as a trade union organizer and later as u representative in parliament, he gave loyal and faithful service. He will be remembered for the very deep interest which he displayed in the welfare of the workers of that State, particularly the miners, and later the workers and miners throughout Australia. His administration as a member of the Government of Western Australia was performed in the same capable and thorough manner as characterized all the work that he undertook in the course of his public duties. His occupancy of the presidential chair of the Senate was marked by courtesy and dignity, backed by a thorough knowledge of parliamentary procedure. The loss of the late James Cunningham will be felt, by the whole nation, but particularly by the State of Western Australia and a wide circle of friends fo whom he endeared himself by his sterling character and kindly disposition. We extend our sincere sympathy to his widow and family, to whom the loss is irreparable. We trust that they will be comforted in the knowledge that he served his country well and was well beloved by his fellow men. As a tribute to the service which he rendered to the Commonwealth and to the State of Western Australia, the late President of the Senate was accorded a State funeral. That this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honourable James Cunningham, a senator for the State of Western .Australia, President of the Senate, and a former State Minister, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious .public service, :ind tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the widow and members of his family in their bereavement.",17
18,Mr MENZIES,THE HONORABLE JAMES," On behalf of the Opposition, I support the motion. Those of us who are not members of the party to which the late honourable senator belonged, knew him best in his life at iCan'berra, and every member of the Opposition in both chambers regarded him as a friend. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde) said quite truly that his tenure of office as President of the Senate was marked by great courtesy and competence, and he added to those qualities a genial and unaffected friendliness and a wise experience which impressed all members of both Houses very much. His sudden death-hi s most unexpected deathcame as a great shock to members of this Parliament, and honourable members on this side of the chamber certainly desire to be associated most warmly in the message of condolence to the bereaved family.",18
19,Mr FADDEN,THE HONORABLE JAMES,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party). - Tb e Australian Country party desires to associate itself with the sympathetic sentiments that have been expressed regarding the late Senator the Honourable James Cunningham. I numbered bim among my intimate friends. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde) has rightly stated, the deceased gentleman had endeared himself to every honourable member of both chambers. We learnt of his death with feelings of great sorrow, and we sincerely join in the expressions of regret that will be conveyed to his bereaved ones.",18
20,Mr JOHNSON,THE HONORABLE JAMES," I was privileged to know the late James Cunningham for the greater part of my life. Indeed, I was associated with him .in my youth, at a time when he was performing the pioneering duties associated with the establishment of the Labour movement in Western Australia. He rendered to the Labour movement loyal and honest service that inspired other people to work for the promotion of its ideals. He was a man of great ability. At first he served the Labour movement in .an honorary capacity; later he was appointed secretary of a trade union. He entered the legislative halls of Western Australia, and subsequently was eleeted to the Parliament of the Commonwealth and was quickly elevated to the high and honourable office of President of the Senate. The late senator had friends throughout the Commonwealth. He was, in every sense of the word, a "" b i g "" Australian. He studied all questions from the national standpoint. I conclude with the words of Roderic Quinn that "" God summoned a man whom we ill could spare"" when Senator Cunningham died. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA DAVID JOHN OKEEFE.",18
21,Mr FORDE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Capricornia - Deputy Prime Minister). - I sincerely regret to inform honourable members of the death on the 21st July last of the Honourable ' David John O'Keefe, a former senator and member of the House of Representatives, and later Speaker of the manian House of Assembly. He and I were amongst the members who entered the Parliament following the election in 1922. I always regarded him as one of my dearest friends, and his passing will cause sorrow to all honourable members wbo were associated with him. He bad a very long and varied parliamentary career. Prior to his death be was one of Tasmania the small band of surviving menrbers of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was elected to the Senate for Tasmania at the general election in 1901. Detorious feated at the general election in he was again elected to the Senate at the general elections of 1910 and He was Chairman of - Committees from 1910 to 1914 and ,was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in 19.17-18.. At the general election :of 19.19 he w.as again defeated, but was elected to the House of Representatives for - Denison, Tasmania, at the general election in 1922. He lost that seat in 19.25 amd unsuccessfully contested the Senate - elections in 1931. In 1934, he turned his attention to .State politics and gained election to the Tasmanian House of Assembly., - as the representative of the constituency of Wilmot. Subsequently, he became Speaker of that chamber and held that high office until 1941. In that year he was awarded the distinction of Companion of the Order of 'St. Michael and St. George. The late David O'Keefe was one of the pioneers of the Labour .movement and for years was a member of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party. He was held in high esteem, not - on'ly by those whose views were similar to his own, but also by all his political opponents as a forthright man who had strong convictions but who was tolerant of the views of others. He shared in the foundation of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and with several short breaks continued to be associated with the Parliament for 25 years. This .long period of national service, together with his subsequent career in the State legisJature, testified to the confidence and high regard in which he was held by the people of Tasmania. In recognition of the service which he rendered to the Commonwealth and to Tasmania, the deceased gentleman was accorded a - State Tas- funeral. I hope that it will be some consolation to liis sorrowing family to know that his passing is - mourned not only in this Parliament but also by a llarge circle of friends throughout Australia. I moveTliat this House records its siuuei'c regret at the death of the Honoraible David John O'Keefe, a former senator for the State of and member of the House of Representatives - for the Division of Denison, and Speaker of the House of Assembly, Tasmania., places on record its appreciation of his meripublic service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the widow and members of his 1906, family :in ttheir 'bereavement. 1914 - MrHUGHES (North Sydney-Deput y Leader of the Opposition) - I second the motion, and associate the members of the United Australia party with the remarks of the Deputy Prime Ministei- (Mr. Forde). I knew the late Honourable "" Dave "" O'Keefe very well. He and I were elected to the first Commonwealth Parliament, and we were closely associated, as fellow members of the Labour party, for many years. He was a man of fine qualities. He bad a high concept of public service and was most diligent in the exercise of his public duties. He was a friendly soul, a lover of liis felTow man in office, and accessible to all who sought his advice. Asthe Deputy Prime Minister has said, he earned the respect and regard of many besides those of his own political party. It was my happy portion to maintain unbroken friendly relations with Mr. O'Keefe, not only during the period of hi3 membership of this House and of the Senate, but also in his later years Speaker of the House of Assembly of Tasmania. He was n man whom I was proud to call my friend. He served his country faithfully and well. I join most sincerely in expressing, on behalf of the United Australia party and for myself, our sincere sympathy with the members of his family in their bereavement.",19
22,Mr FADDEN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I associate the Australian Country party with the sentiments that have been expressed, and desire our sympathy to be conveyed to those wbo have been left to mourn the death of Mr O'Keefe. Mr BARNARD' (Bass) - I also desire toassociate myself with the sentiments that have heen expressed regarding' the l'ate ""Dave"" O'Keefe. It was not my privilege to know him as a member of this Parliament, but I knew him when. I was quite a. young man in the LabOiUE' movement.. He was one of the stalwarts of the Labour party in Tasmania, and was known to me, by repute, for many years before-1 knew him personal ly. I had the highest regard for him and I agree wholeheartedly with what the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Fordo)' has said about his sincerity and honesty of purpose-. He was a manof great coim-age who always expressed himself firmly concerning the great principles for the upliifting of. humanity for which he stood. During my early association with the Labour movement Mr. O'Keefe helped me greatly with friendly advice and in other ways. He possessed sterling, qualities which enabled him to render great service, to the Labour movement, not only in this Parliament but also throughout his adult life. He saw the Labour cause grow from very small beginnings to the great movement which it has now become. I join in the expressions of sympathy with his widow and family in their bereavement. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF MR, EDWARD' RILEY.",20
23,Mr FORDE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," The Grim Reaper has as been busy since the Commonwealth Parliament last assembled. It is with deep regret that I refer to the passing of yet another former member of the Parliament, Mr Edward Riley, who died at Sydney on the 21st July last. I have no doubt that he was known to many members of this Parliament as one who served his country with distinction for many years. He was popularly known to many of us as "" Old Ted Riley "" during the period when his son Edward Charles Riley was also a member of the House as Representative for the Division of Cook. The late Mr Edward Riley was elected to the House of Representatives for South Sydney at the general elections in 1910 and at each successive general election until 1931, when he was defeated. He was chairman of the - Standing Committee on Public Works from 1914 to 1917. He was a member of a select committees' on the effect of the operation of the Navigation Act on Trade in 1923, and on Commonwealth Electoral Law and Procedure in 1926-27. Edward Riley served Australia and the Labour movement with zeal and ability. He was a staunch advocate of better conditions' for Australian workers and his pioneer work in connection with arbitration and. wage regulation will long be remembered by them. A man of purpose and yet a man of goodwill, he w.as held in affection and high regard by the members of theParliaments in which he sewed. We extend our deep sympathy to the members of his family who mourn his loss. I move That this Bouse records its sincere regret at the death of Mr Edward Riley, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of South Sydney, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to his relatives in their bereavement.",20
24,Mr HUGHES,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I second the motion and associate the members of the United Australia party with it. I knew the late Mr Riley very well. He was one of my oldest and best friends. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, he was for 21 years a member of this Parliament, during which time as fellow members our relations were intimate and cordial. But I was closely associated with bim long before the establishment of Federation. In the very early days of the Labour movement in New South Wales he was one of the most active and stalwart lighters in both the industrial and political wings of Labour. The value of his services was recognized by the industrial movement at whose instance be was appointed assessor in the first Arbitration Court of New South Wales and I had the honour of appearing before him in many cases. He made no enemies for he was what Dr Johnson calls a "" clubbable man"", and men of all shades of political opinion were glad to call him their friend. But beneath his genial disposition he was a man who stood fast by great principles and spoke his mind boldly. His name will live, for he did yeoman work in the Labour movement when to be a Labour man was to be a pariah, an outcast. It was with very great regret that I heard of the death of "" Ted"" Riley which occurred quite suddenly, for I had arranged with his son-in-law to visit him. I held the late Mr Riley in the highest esteem and conceived for him great affection. Our friendly relations remained unaffected by differences of political opinion. He was a man of fine character who devoted himself to advancing the interests of his fellow men. I deeply mourn his loss, and join with the Deputy Prime Minister in expressing profound sympathy with his bereaved relatives.",21
25,Mr FADDEN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party). - The Australian Country party desires to be associated with the sentiments that have been expressed.,21
26,Mr SHEEHAN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I , too, support the motion. I knew the late ex-honourable member for South Sydney for a long period. My family and his resided in the one district, and we were always great friends. He was the father of a magnificent family of Australian boys and girls. His son, Mr. E. C. Riley, entered this Parliament many years ago, with the result that the father became known as "" Old Ted"", although he was still quite a young mail. The older people in my electorate, which many years ago formed a part of the electorate of South Sydney, still speak with great respect of the magnificent work that was done for the district by "" Ted "" Riley, and of the r-ompetent and capable manner in which he discharged his duties in this Parliament. He laboured quietly, yet energetically and enthusiastically, on behalf of the people of the nation. I deeply regret the passing of this great Labour pioneer, and extend to his family the most profound sympathy. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF MR. JOSHUA THOMAS HOSKINS WHITSITT .",21
27,Mr FORDE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," A further regrettable loss has been sustained among former members of this Parliament by the death of Mr Joshua Thomas Hoskins Whitsitt. which occurred at Burnie, Tasmania, on the 14th September last. The late Mr Whitsitt was elected to the House of Assembly, Tasmania, for the constituency of Darwin, at the general elections held in 1909, and retained that seat until 1922, when he was defeated. Later in that year, at the federal general elections, he successfully contested the Darwin seat in the House of Representatives. He retired on the expiration of the Ninth Parliament in October, 1925. Those of us who were his contemporaries in the Commonwealth Parliament remember him as a forthright man of great individuality and independence, who did not hesitate to express, in the most eloquent terms, the very strong convictions that he held. Whilst most honourable members may not, perhaps, have personal, knowledge of the deceased gentleman, it will, I am sure, be the wish of the Souse to record the respect that is due to a former member whose loss is mourned by those who were near and dear to him. I move That this House records its sincere regret nt the death of Mr Joshua Thomas Hoskins Whitsitt, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Darwin and member of the House of Assembly, Tasmania, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the widow and members of his family in their bereavement.",21
28,Mr MEWZIES,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I second the motion. It was not my pleasure to know the late honourable gentleman; but the particulars that have been' given to the House by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde) show that his career was typical of many useful careers in the public life of Australia, He served the one electorate in the State Parliament for no fewer than thirteen years, and then served the same district in the Commonwealth Parliament for another three years. That fact, in itself, speaks volumes for the respect in which life must have been held by his constituents. I am sure that what has heen said by the Deputy Prime Minister accurately describes the character in which he impressed himself on this House. The Opposition associates itself with the motion, and with the sentiments in which it has been proposed.",22
29,Sir EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," On behalf of the Australian Country party, and of his old colleagues, I pay tribute to the late Mr Whitsitt, a former member for Darwin, who had a very lengthy association with the public life of x\ustralia in both this Parliament and the Parliament of Tasmania. In his youth he had heen a .banker, and a very keen student of economics. He then became a fanner, and an even keener student' of rural economics. His convictions in regard to the methods that should be adopted in the handling of both of those subjects were deeply held, and when he was stirred his eloquence, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde) has said, emerged - in a teeming flood. I recall that on one occasion he made in the space of nine minutes a speech which, when recorded in Hansard, consisted of 5,000 words; and my impression is that all his words wero not recorded. He was easily the most eloquent and rapid speaker that this Parliament has known. He was a very warmhearted, as well as an impulsive, man, and a great friend of the people. His early years were passed in close association with medical men, from whom he acquired a great deal of knowledge. During the whole of his life he was a great friend of all his neighbours; in fact, Dame Enid Lyons has told mc that he was known in Darwin as the good neighbour, of all the people there. We do well in associating ourselves with the motion proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister, expressing our recognition of the value of the work that he did in both his public and his private capacities. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ADJOURNMENT.",22
30,Mr FORDE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Capricornia-Deput y Prime Minister) [4.12],-As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, I move That the House do now adjourn. Question resolved in the affirmative, nouse adjourned at 4.14 p.m.",22
