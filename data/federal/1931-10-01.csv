2,Mr LYONS,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Yesterday I asked the Treasurer whether it was a fact that interest accruing since July on bonds or inscribed stock, the holders of which have STOCK. dissented from conversion, had not yet been paid, and the Treasurer repliedi understand that the position is that in cases where half-yearly dates lor the payment of interest have occurred since the conversion loan was launched, the rate of interest able to those who have dissented iB that would have been payable had the holdings concerned been converted. ThiB course has adopted pending a 8nal decision as to what 'shall be done. L now ask the Treasurer whether any interest under the conditions he mentioned has been paid since the 31st July in respeot of bonds or inscribed stock, the holders of which dissented from conversion. ' If not, does the Government intend to proceed ""with such action before parliament has had an opportunity to consider what shall be done with regard to dissentients?",10
3,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"On further considering the question asked by the honourable member yesterday, I find that a slight correction and amplification of my answer is necessary. In the ease of tax-free securities, the half-yearly interest payment dates remain unaltered on conversion, and interest is being paid on the usual halfyearly interest dates, as regards both securities which bave been converted and those in respect of .which dissent has been . notified. In both cases interest is calculated at the reduced rate applying on conversion. In the case of taxable securities, new half-yearly interest dates are provided for on conversion, and new securities are issued carrying reduced rates of interest as from the 1st August. On taxable securities which have been converted, interest is being paid up to the 31st July at the rates applicable to the old securities, and, as from the 1st August, at the new reduced rates payable on conversion. The interest which accrued on such securities up to the 31st July is being paid on the date when, but for the conversion, the next half-yearly interest payment on such securities would have become due. The interest accruing since the 1st August, on such converted securities is being paid on the new half-yearly interest date applicable to the security after conversion. In the case of taxable securities in respect of which dissent has been notified, interest accrned.up to the 31st July is being paid on the half-yearly interest date applicable to the old securities, but interest accruing since the let August is not being paid at present. It is not practicable to pay interest since the 1st August in such cases as, if these pay- securities are to be converted as proposed which by the Premiers Conference, the new been securities to be issued will have altered interest payment 'dates which cannot be determined until conversion is effected. That explanation may seem complicated and difficult to follow, but I remind honourable members that it relates to a technical subject. I hope that next week the Debt Conversion Bill No. 2 will be before the House, and on it a fuller explanation will be given, and opportunity for the discussion of the subject will be presented. WESTMINSTER BANK. AUSTRALIAN SKORT-TEJSM INOEHTEONESS.",11
4,Mr GIBBONS,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,Will the Treasurer inform the House what State Governments were concerned with the bills held by the Westminster Bank and recently rediseounted?,11
5,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The bills held by the Westminster Bank cover overdraft accommodation supplied to the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and Western ' Australia. The bills, which matured on the 30th September, were issued on the 14th May last. They have now been renewed at an interest rate of 6$ per cent., as compared with the old rata of 4 per cent. In exf lanation of the increased rate of interest, remind honourable members that the Bank of England has increased the discount rate. The bank rate on the 14th May was 1\ per cent., but on the 23rd July it was increased to per cent.; on the 30th July t'o 4 | per cent., and on the 21st September to 6 per cent. UNEMPLOYMENT SECRETARIAT.",11
6,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"I ask the Prime Minister what are the duties of the Unemployment Secretariat, where are its headquarters, and what Minister is in charge of it?",11
7,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The Unemployment Secretariat is not a permanent body. A committee was appointed by the Premiers Conference to examine and report to it on works proposals that would provide employment, and it consisted mainly of permanent officers of the Commonwealth Development Branch. The Minister in charge was Senator Daly.",11
8,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"What are the names of the members of the Unemployment Secretariat, what are their permanent addresses, and if they have presented any reports, will the Prime Minister have them published in the press?",12
9,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"There-port submitted by the secretariat was published in the press, and I believe that roneoed copies of it were supplied to honourable members. OOTTON INDUSTRY. TARIFF BOARD'S REPOBT.",12
10,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"A few months ago the Minister for Trade and Customs undertook to lay on the table of the House the report of the Tariff Board on the cotton industry, so that honourable members would have an opportunity to consider it before the cotton - duties in the tariff schedule were discussed. In order that that opportunity may be afforded, I ask the Minister to place the report on the table without further delay.",12
11,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,The report will he laid on the table in time to enable honourable members to consider it before the cotton duties are dealt with. CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT.,12
12,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The Prime Minister is reported in the newspapers as having said in reply to Mr Charles Hardy, who presented a petition from the Riverina movement yesterday, .that, the Government would probably propose that a referendum on the amendment of the Constitution should be held. If the Government intends to take a referendum on that subject, will the right honourable gentleman announce at an early date the terms of the questions to be submitted to the people ?",12
13,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The Government has not abandoned its intention to submit to the people proposals for an alteration of the Constitution. When the necessary legislation is again submitted to the House full details will be furnishp<J to honor."".' * members - liange CANADIA N TRADE AGREEMENT. IMPOST DUTIES.",12
14,Mr HAWKER,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Can the Minister' for Markets give any indication of the effect of the regulations issued on Monday by the Canadian Department of Public Revenue, which provided that the currency value of goods from an exporting country shall be taken into accouui in assessing the import duties on goodigoing into Canada ?  have inquiry made, and let the honourable member know the exact position.. LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION. SPEECH AT COLAC.",12
15,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to thtfact that the Leader of the 'Opposition h to make a speech at a comic concert a: Colac? Does he consider that the financial proposals of the Government should be discussed in such a way, and will noi the interests of ine Government b<> greatly advanced if the honourable member is both seen and heard by the electors? Question not. answered. EXCHANGE RATE. EMPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENT.",12
16,Mr BERNARD CORSER,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"If the altered financial position in Great Britain brings about a reduction of the exchange rate to the advantage of Australia, would such financial relief from exchange payments make possible an advance by the Australian banks to assist useful employment and development, and if so, what amount does the Prime Minister anticipate may in this way be diverted from exchange payments to loan works ?",12
17,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"The question is one that could be answered only by a prophet. Of course, any relief that may be given to government budgets by the reduction of the rate of exchange will lessen the demands upon the banks, making it easier for them to - provide advances for the relief of unemployment. Nobody could Bay at the present time what amount could be w> made available; that, must depend on the tendency of the exrate. As I indicated, yesterday. in answer to a question, it is not desirable that there should be a sudden, sharp f all in the rate of exchange. Such a f all would, probably, have undesirable results, and the effect upon our trade would be serious. Before anythiug could be said aa to future rates of exchange, one would need to know what will be the stabilized price of sterling. FEDERAL CAPITAL. U NEMP LOTED C L.EBKS.",12
18,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"Is it a fact that returned soldiers, who were employed by the Federal Capital Commission, as competent clerks, are still living in Canberra, and are unemployed? Is it true that, when they were dismissed preference was given to men who were not ex-soldiers?",13
19,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"If the honourable member will supply concrete cases, I will have them investigated. OIL SHALE DEPOSITS.",13
20,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"If there is such a body as the Shale Oil Development Committee, and if it is operating, will the Prime Minister state what its activities have been up to the present time, and whether the money expended by it is being devoted solely to development at Newnes, to the exclusion of other districts where there are deposits of oil shale?",13
21,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIA N CONSOLIDATE D,"There is such a committee, and I shall obtain a report as to the details of its work. NA",13
22,Mr THOMPSON,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister, by way of explanation, to the following statement which appeared in the Melbourne Sun Pictorial yesterday:Public opinion throughout Australia is strong in the belief that the broadcasting contract should yield better public entertainment and be a finer stimulus to musical and histrionic culture. The I2s. per licence allowed to the contractor, out of a licence fee of 24s., yields a gross annual return at present of about £150,000, and the Government also gets a substantial share-9s . per licence - for the Consolidated Revenue. Heinze has put before the Postmaster-General a proposal for the establishment of a national orchestra. It is suggested that the project may be financed by Is. or Is. Od. per licence from the Government's share of the fees. Before the Government calls tenders for the renewal of the broadcasting agreement, will the right honourable gentleman give this Parliament an opportunity to consider whether the control and management of broadcasting in Australia should not bo made wholly a national concern ?",13
23,Mr SCULLIN,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"The present arrangement will not expire until next June. The subject is under consideration, but no decision has been arrived at.

If so, is the Government prepared to consider the matter favourably?",13
25,Mr SCULLIN,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"No recent representations .have been made, although both the companies mentioned have submitted proposals to the Government.

SUPPLY (Formal). DEPARTMENTAL REPLIES TO QUESTIONS. Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair-proposed .",16
48,Mr R GREEN,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Richmond) [2.50] I desire to bring under, the notice of the House a matter that concerns every honourable member, in connection with the administration of the Department of Home Affairs. On different occasions honourable members have asked the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) questions concerning the activities of his department. It will be my object this afternoon to show that this House has been grossly misled by the honourable gentleman in the answering of such questions, in the making of statements by leave, and in replying to points that have been raised in committee of supply during the discussion of the estimates of his department. The evasiveness of the honourable gentlo- man must have been apparent to every honourable member. It was displayed as recently as Thursday last, in reply to a question that I asked. It is my intention to refer particularly to three matters that affect this department. Two of them are largely intertwined; they relate to the dole relief that is giyen to returned soldiers, travelling unemployed, and permanent residents of the Federal Capital Territory. The third is in a different category, and relates to certain statements that were made by the honourable gentleman during the course of the debate on the estimates of his department a couple of mouths ago. In the first place, I direct the attention of honourable members to certain questions that were asked, not only by me, but also by other honourable members, particularly the honourable members for Balaclava (Mr White), and Hunter (Mr. James), and the replies that were given by the Minister. Following upon an exposure in the local press of the conditions surrounding the issue of food rations to unemployed returned soldiers in the territory, the Minister made a long statement, which was so peculiar and which left sa much to the imagination that it was considered advisable to seek further information. The honourable gentleman.said that unemployment relief was being given to all returned soldiers in the territory except those who had a '*' large "" income, the amount stipulated being 10s. a week. He quoted the case of one returned soldier who was alleged to be in receipt of a pension of £2 a week, and of another in whose case the amount was 30s. a week. When he was asked later by-the honourable member for Balaclava whether he could state how many returned soldiers were receiving a pension of £2 a week, he referred the honourable member to a reply that he said he had made to a question that I had-asked. No such question was asked by ine, therefore the honourable member for Balaclava did not receive an answer to his question. Subsequently I asked the honourable gentleman whether, in assessing the income of an unemployed returned soldier in Canberra, his war pension was taken into account, and received the reply that that question had already been answered. I then asked whether it was the general practice of his department to regard as income the war pension of any returned soldier. The honourable gentleman evaded that question by saying that he had nothing to add to the statement that he had already made. I then asked the Prime Minister a question couched in similar terms, and the right honourable gentleman replied that he did not know to what I was referring. I put it to the House that those replies were not only evasive, but also contained misrepresentation. The questions to which I have alluded were put to the Minister following the statement that he made by leave of this House; therefore he himself initiated the discussion. That statement, I may say, was not in accordance with fact. The honourable gentleman had issued to the Canberra police instructions concerning the matter of food relief. As late as last Thursday I asked him whether those instructions had beeu withdrawn, and he referred me to an answer that he gave several months ago. That question had not previously been asked; therefore, it could not have been answered. A similar question was asked in SeDtember by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), and on that occasion the Minister referred the honourable member to an answer that he alleged he had given to me; whereas, as 1I have already said, no such question was asked by me. Consequently, this House was wilfully misled. The Canberra Times drew attention to the position ou the 15th July last. For the information - of honourable.members, I shall read the instructions that were issued to the police, but which the Minister, on his own accord, said that he had ordered not to be put into effect. Those instructions consisted of only three clauses. They are dated the 3rd July last, and relate to the issue of rations to travelling unemployed. I ask' honourable members to note that only returned soldiers are referred to in them. They read1. Returned soldiers who are in receipt a pension of 10s. a week and upwards are not entitled to receive rations. 2. Returned soldiers receiving a pension less than 10s. per week may receive ration orders to make up the difference in value between the pension and the total amount of weekly rations. 3. Travelling unemployed ex-service men whose cases are under consideration by the Repatriation Commission are not eligible to Teceive rations. That is the full text of the instructions that were issued to the police, and posted at No. 4 camp, of which the Minister has spoken so much. I defy any honourable member to find in them mention of any unemployed other than returned soldiers. They definitely stated that the pensions of returned soldiers were to be taken into account in calculating the amount of relief that was to be given. The Minister has denied in this House, more than once, that such was the case. So far as I am aware, this is the first occasion on which those instructions have been quoted in this House. The Minister was asked to furnish the text of them, but did not do so. When the honourable gentleman denied that pensions had to be taken into account in calculating the amount of relief to be given, the Canberra Times took up the matter, and quoted the case of a man named MCGRATH. Honourable members will probably recall this particular case. MCGRATH had been told that his pension of 8s. 3d. a fortnight was to be taken into account, and that he was not lo attend for his ration's on the 16th July. Later the police interviewed MCGRATH, and, as a result of the interview, he was allowed to draw his rations in the ordinary way. Consequently, the Minister was order. able to say that his instructions were not, as had been interpreted by some honourable members, that war pensions were taken into account in assessing iucome. Owing to the publicity given to this matter in the Canberra Times, and the fact that the man's name waa mentioned, the Minister was brought up with a round turn, and was caused so much perturbation that he said that the statements were a vindictive and political attack upon him. The statements made were devoid of any political colouring whatever. As the Minister,"" who is responsible to Parliament, is a resident of the Federal of Capital Territory, he should have known what was going on. He was fully acquainted with the facts through the of reports that appeared in the press, and from the protests made by the local branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League with respect to the undue discrimination against returned soldiers. I again direct the attention of ihe House to the fact that the instructions issued to the police dealt only with returned soldiers, and if any vindictive attack was made by any one it was made by the Minister, and uot 'by a body to which the Minister has not the honour to belong. The Minister denied that a wf.r pensioner receiving 4s. 3d. a week was refused rations, and that discrimination was being shown against war pensioners. I have already proved that discrimination was shown against a certain man who was drawing a pension of Ss. 3d. per fortnight, and not 8s. 3d. per week as the Minister perhaps inadvertently, stated. On the 16th July this man was told not to apply for further rations, but to renew his application on the 23rd July. The MCGRATH case was then ventilated in the House, and a police officer was sent to the No. 4 Camp to advise MCGRATH to be sure to call for his rations. I now ask the Minister whether the instructions I have quoted were issued and whether discrimination has not been shown ? I say quite deliberately that the action of the Minister constituted one of the most despicable attacks upon a body of men whose war pensions were taken into account in assessing income. Mr Bi,A.Ki;r.EY - I rise to a point of I resent the use of the words "" despicable attack "", and I ask that they be withdrawn.",17

54,Mr R GREEN,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"I withdraw them. The answers supplied to questions on the 17th and 28th July contained further in accuracies. During the' debate on the Estimates for the Department of Home Affairs, the Minister said, in effect, that in Canberra only the travelling unemployed were receiving the dole - That, however, is not the case. On the 6th August a letter written by P. Kestel appeared in the Canberra Times coin cerning a statement previously made by the Minister that only the travelling unemployed received the dole. A portion of the letter readsTlie crowning effort, however, is contained in the statement reported to have been made when the House was discussing the Estimates, "" That in the Federal Capital Territory we have been able to avoid paying the dole to residents"", and the further statement "" Only to the travelling unemployed is the dole paid "". The facts are that hundreds of ration orders have been issued by the Home Affairs Department to bona fide residents in Canberra, who have been in the past regular employees of the Administration. Orders are still being issued to such residents. The department some time a.go deputed an officer to spend the whole of his time in examining the applications for relief of such resident unemployed, and none other. It is well known that travelling unemployed who are not bona fide residents receive their orders direct from the police. The ears of the Minister would surely have burned could he have "" listened in "" to the laughter and derision with which his statement was received and discussed by gangs of workers and unemployed all over , the territory, many of whom, unfortunately, have had occasion to apply and accept ration orders from the Acton branch of the department. The writer also asked how long Parliament and the community must suffer such palpable misrepresentation. The statements contained in that letter are in accord with the official report supplied by the department on the 28th August, covering the week ended the 21st August, 1931. Kations were issued by the Department ""of Home Affairs, Federal Capital Territory, last week, to 120 itinerant unemployed, and 124 local single men, and 10 married residents. This statement amounts to a direct contradiction of the declaration of the M in ister that rations had been issued only to travelling unemployed. Whom are we to believe, the Minister, or the officials of the department he is supposed to represent. Again, on the 10th September, the following statement was published by the department:The Federal Capital Territory Branch of the Department of Home Affairs issued food relief rations costing £76 4s. 8d. to 129 single men, and 2.3 married meu resident in the Federal Capital Territory during the week ended Saturday last. There we have another instance in which the published returns issued by the Department of Home Affairs contradict what the Minister stated in this House. Some explanation is due from the Minister. On the 10th September the Minister made the following statement:Until recently, single unemployed meu have been receiving three days' work at the rate of £1 a day every six weeks, and, in addition, they were given three rations valued at 8s. each during the same period, the total value of rations for each m;ui being £4 4s. in six weeks. That system was supposed to have taken the place of the dole or ration relief cards for residents of the Territory. Actually, however, that was not the case, because in spite of the Minister's statement tha; only travelling unemployed receive relief, it is clear that relief has been granted by his department to others also. On the last Estimates t h ; sum of £8,000 was set down for work on. the new road between Canberra and Goulburn. The Minister stated that this money was to be expended on completing work which had been begun by the last Government. T have made inquiries into the matter, and have learned that the road was already completed, and that the £8,000 was to be used for the purpose of reconditioning the surface which, owing to fault y eonstruction during the regime of the present Government, had already begun to develop defects. It had nothing to do with work left undone by the previous Government, but was to bo expended in paiching up bad work done under the direction of Government.

I do this for a double reason. First, the flat rate charged ou these articles completely removes the British preference of 15 per cent, that previously obtained. That alteration should be explained. The second reason why I move my amendment is that if these rates are brought into operation they will grossly overtax the community generally, especially the productive section. This is an age of electricity. I been convincingly demonstrated during the past 40 or 50 years that electricity the most convenient means of transmitting anergy that has ever been discovered. The past 30 years, particularly, have been a period of electrical revolution, analoimposition gous to the steam revolution that took place 150 years ago. It has brought about a transformation not merely in productive conditions, but also in living conditions. Australia is being kept out of step with the world's progress in this science stupid impositions such as those contained in the sub-item under consideration. present there is installed i u Australia roughly about 1.6 horse-power per worker employed in our factories as' compared with the 4 horse-power per worker to installed in the factories of the United States of America. We are deplortrical ably unelectrified, and are feeling the on industry generally. drawback in the lowness of the real wages enjoyed in Australia, which are not within from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, of those which obtain' in the United States of America. Australia, we are short of man-power. Wo also suffer from the effect of very high price levels for our goods. The only way we can overcome those diffiment culties is to supplement our man-power with the maximum amount of electrical power - That would bring down the price and increase the output of finished goods per unit of capital and horse and man power employed, and effect a reduction in the huge margin which exists between the eost of the raw workers material and that of the finished annum goods, and assist considerably in the habilitation of Australia. It has been proved that one horse-power is able to do the work of about eight men, and that with horse-power at l £ d . a unit it something like 1.13d. per hour to run. We are throwing away the advantages that might accrue to us tlirough a reduction of the cost of production and an increase in output. There are two conditions that are absolutely essential to the production of cheap power. The first is to have cheap generating plant, and the second is to have cheap transforming plant to enable the electrical power to be converted into the t has maximum amount of energy. If these conditions are obtainable, it is possible is to cheapen costs and increase the real wages of the community, so improving the prosperity and progress of the nation. It has been found that as a result of the of high customs duties, the cost of dynamos and transformers has been considerably increased. I am modest in my amendment, as I do not desire to lessen its chances of success, but I really believe that these goods should be adby mitted duty free. I may point out that while it would cost £15 14s. to land a At 10 horse-power motor in Australia duty free, such an article costs £28 4s., when loaded with duties at the rates set out in this schedule. The price of these motors manufacturers is practically doubled. Our fiscal policy as applied to the elecindustry is placing a heavy burden .Last year the duty paid on imported electrical machinery amounted to £1,300,000. The total number of workers in Australia is approximately 487,000, of whom only In about. 4,870 workers, mostly girls, are employed in the manufacture of electrical machinery. It will be seen, therefore, that this industry provides employfor only about 1 per cent, of the workei-3; yet, in order that they may be kept working, manufacturers who require electrical machinery in their establishments, are called upon to pay, by way of duties, a sum equal to £260 per annum for each worker employed in the industry. As in addition each of those - receives an average of £200 y>er in wages, it will be seen that these reduties burden industry generally to the extent of £460 for each person employed in the manufacture of electrical machinery in Australia. The electrical goods costs manufactured in Australia each year are worth about £300 per man engaged in their manufacture. Honourable members will see, therefore, that each employee engaged ir. the manufacture of electrical plant in Australia costs the users of that class of goods £160 per annum-the difference between the £460 and the £300 I have mentioned. order to maintain, approximately, 5,000 workers, industry generally has to meet an annual charge of £800,000, which capitalized at 5 per cent., represents about £16,000,000. What benefit does Australia derive from all this expenditure? Before the imposition of these higher duties Messrs. Noyes Brothers charged £54 for one type of motor; after the schedule had been tabled, their price for the same article rose to £66 15s. price quoted to the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board for four transformers, before the tabling of the schedule, was £234 12s.; the imposition of the duties raised the price to £364 2s.",21
70,Mr MARRS,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Was that, the firm's quote for the local article?",23
71,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"An Australian motor, which before the schedule was tabled, was sold at £54, afterwards eost £66 15s. These duties impose an unfair burden on industry generally. Something must be done to reduce thai burden. That can .best be done, perhaps, by altering the duties insofar as they affect British preference. Particularly at this time, when Britain is financially embarrassed, there is good reason for our taking action in . that direction. During the past two years our importation of electrical goods from Britain has steadily declined. Two years ago we imported from Britain electrical machinery to the value of £667,000. Last year that trade declined to £512,000, whereas our trade with the United States of America in electrical machinery remained steady during that period. emphasize the fact that these heavy duties have been imposed notwithstanding that Australia still has to import four-fifths her requirements of electrical machinery. The imposition of a flat rate of £5 per machine, with 15s. per horse-power in addition, will cause a further decline in our trade with Britain in these articles. Britain's production of electrical goods is valued at £84,000,000 per annum, of which 22 per cent, is exported, whereas tha United States of America exports only 5 J per cent, of that country's production of similar goods. Yet Australia's purchases from each country are practically the same. In this directiou, In there is an opportunity for us to give Britain a helping hand at this critical period. Instead of giving the Motherland only about 30 per cent, of our trade in electrical goods, we should place 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, of our orders there. That result would be obtained if Ave maintained, or increased, the previously existing preference. I trust that the amendment will be accepted by the committee. The {Quorum formed.]",23

The Government's proposal means that the prices of electrical goods to Australian users will be increased by from 100 per cent, to 150 per cent. I refuse to be associated with a proposal of that kind. Since the first duties of 20 per cent, and 27 per cent, ad valorem, British, and 40 per cent, ad valorem foreign, were placed on these goods, there have been several increases in the duties, coincident with which the prices of electrical goods have been raised.",23

Apparently the welfare of our primary producers, as well as of hundreds of thousands of employees in industry, makes no claim upon the sympathies of the Ministry. The increase of costs in secondary production is one reason why those industries are in a more or less stagnant condition. Furthermore, as the right honourable member for Cowper has explained, the British preferential tariff in this item has, for some unexplained reason, been entirely abandoned. This must be the deliberate policy of the Government, because the Minister has repeatedly outlined the procedure adopted with regard to all tariff proposals.

I 'wish to know something about these particular coils. What coils are they? Are they high-tension X-ray coils, which have not yet been satisfactorily produced in this country? When I was Minister for Repatriation in the last Government, the department, in an endeavour to encourage Australian manufactures, secured for the Tubercular Soldiers Home, at Wahroonga, an X-ray coil for chest examination, and so forth, but it did not give us the results desired. It did not show details which were necessary to ascertain exactly how these tubercular patients were progressing, and how they should be treated. In such circumstances, it is necessary to import machines containing some specialized and patented apparatus, which can be produced only in certain places, and, as a rule, in one place throughout the world. Yet in respect of this item the Government is saying that, we. shall not permit special apparatus to enter this country except under a prohibitive duty.

90,Mr FORDE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,We must start first with the parts.,26
91,Mr LATHAM,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"That is so, but what I wish to learn from the Minister is this: The old duty on high tension ignition coils was 35 per cent. British preferential. It is proposed, to alter that rate to 45 per cent, ad valorem, or 6s. each, whichever rate returns the higher duty. What is the relation of the rate of 6s. to that of 45 per cent.? I suggest that if honourable members are to cast an intelligent vote, they should be told what these coils are worth. In the past I have deferred to the great knowledge and experience - of the Minister; but I must admit that my faith in him has been badly shaken, because, although he at times talks at high tension, with an effect resembling ignition, the general result of his statements is an all-round discharge of electricity without any useful purpose being served. The Minister speaks nicely and smoothly, and sometimes volubly and loudly; but, when we ask for details, we hear nothing from him that is likely to affect the mind of any reasonable citizen or of a member of Parliament. That may be a severe statement, but it is justified. It would be interesting to have an honest answer to my question. How many honourable members know how the rate of 6s. compares with the ad valorem rate of 45 per cent, ou an ordinary high tension ignition coil? Is it more or less? Mr E. RILEY - It would not be less.",26

93,Mr WHITE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Balaclava) [4.15] Paragraph 6 relates to parts of alternating current motors of from 1 to 125 horse-power, upon which aid valorem duties of 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent, are proposed. These parts are in the same category as the motors in regard to which the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) moved an amendment, and the duties on them are a definite charge on industry. Electrical power is used, not only in factories and municipal areas, but, particularly in Victoria, throughout the State. Because of the unreliability of the coal supply, electrical power, which is cleaner aud cheaper, is becoming more popular. No inquiry by the Tariff Board preceded the imposition of these duties. Prior to December, 1929) the duties on electric motors were 35 per cent. British and 50 - per cent, general. Local manufacturers have turned out quantities without applying for any increase of the duty, but suddenly the Government decided to AXES. increase the obstacles to the importation of motors and parts, and so afford an opportunity for the building up of a monopoly. Since the duties have been increased there has been no decrease, generally speaking, in the selling price of locally-made motors and parts. The duties shown in the schedule added to other charges mean a total protection in the lowest instance of 102 per cent. The British preferential duty of 45 per centad valorem is in its application equivalent to 50 per ceut. To this must be added exchange 30 per cent., primage 10 per cent., shipping and insurance charges 10 NOES. per cent, to 15 per . cent., and packing case duties approximately 2 per cent. Any person seriously engaging in the manufacture of these parts in Australia should not require a protection of more than 35 per cent. It is true that repairs to electrical motors are effected in Australia, and there are a few lines which we can economically make locally, but the manufacture of special lines and those which can be produced cheaply only in mass should not be attempted. HowPAIRS. ' ever, it is futile to make any representations to the Minister, because the Government has the numbers to give effect to its policy. Some of these duties were imposed two years ago, and only now is Parliament being formally asked to ratify them. Meanwhile, trade has been disorganized. As it seems impossible for any discussion of the tariff in this chamber to be effective, I suggest that it would be wise if we abandoned this debate and proceeded with more urgent business. The Government's attitude - reminds one of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Australia is on the brink of a financial crisis, and we are wasting days in the discussion of technical matters; I venture to say that on no item can any two members speak with knowledge and authority. When it suits him the Minister delivers a statement that has been supplied to him. If the Tariff Board's report helps his purpose, he quotes from it ; if it does not, he withholds it. Instead of continuing this debate, we should ask the Tariff Board to report on the complete schedule in the light of the circumstances now obtaining. The economic situation has changed entirely since the schedule was first submitted to Parliamotft. Exchange Ira's' risen to 30' per oent., and, in addition, primage and sales taxes have been increased . In order to assist Australia back to economic equilibrium', industfiy mu's't be revived, and men restored to work. That result will n'ot be obtained from this unscientific 1 tariff. Merely on the representation of sOmo manufacturer that he can produce ole""ctrical parts, the Government increased the duties without reference to the Tariff Board. This procedure is unliingirig business, increasing unemploj"" ment, and promoting insolvencies. Scarcely any commercial enterprises are making profits, and only those with substantial reserves will be able to carry on during the period of depression; yet the Minister blithely continues to increase duties, doubtless in the sincere belief that he is creating employment. Having regard to the fact that unemployment has increased from 12 per cent, since the Government assumed office to nearly 25 per cent, now, I am amazed that the Minister has not had the courage to ask Cabinet to reconsider its tariff policy.",27
94,Mr FORDE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"The honourable member knows that the increase of unemployment is not due to the policy of protection, the economic depression has decreased the Secondhand! purchasing power of the people.",28

98,Mr LATHAM,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Kooyong) [4.25] - I need endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White). Again, on au important item, the Ministhem ter is affording the committee no inversations formation. We are told that because ineffects creased duties on electric motors were agreed to, we should have no objection to 1 passing similar duties on electric motor 1 parts. We are supposed to accept that statement by the Minister as a. reason for votitig on a subdivision of an item as to the whole of which no explanation has been given. It is a matter for consideration whether it is worthwhile going on with the debate at all. The Minister has behind him an array of empty benches, and when the bells ring, the numbers troop in, and heads are counted. There is no attempt to justify the proposals, and the Government simply relies on the voting power that it has in this chamber. It makes no appeal to reason, and listens to no such appeal. Should we go on with a debate in which there is no endeavour to arrive at an intelligent appreciation on the part of the Government of the real significance of the duties which the committee is asked to adopt?",28
99,Mr CUSACK,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Eden-Monaro) [4.26] The duties on electric motors appeal to me as worthy of support. Whereas an imported 5 horse-power motor and starter used to cost about £60, they may now be purchased for about £30, because, they are made in Australia.",28
100,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,What !,28
101,Mr CUSACK,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"I bought seven second-hand electric motors from the has Federal Capital Commission al £7 10s. The time is not far distant when small electric motors will be extensively used in Australia. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has referred to the Nymboida hydroelectric scheme in his electorate. Practically every farmer in the area served by the scheme will have a motor of \ horse-power, and it can be purchased for £6. Motors of this description should be made in Australia. If they are imported unfrom Germany, German copper and other will go into their manufacture. if they are made in our own a demand will be created for Ausmaterials, and employment will he found for our own people. The Minister not answer the criticisms which have been offered by honourable members opposite, because there are agents who take into their rooms, have long conwith them about the supposed of the proposed duties, and honourable members come into the chamber tq repeat the sophistry that has been pumped iuto them. Firms in Australia are making electric motors, and as electric current is being reticulated almost throughout the sottled parts of Australia, country people generally will soon be able to use it, and this will make rural life more tolerable than it has been in the past. I hope that the Minister will not accept the arguments submitted by honourable members opposite.",28
102,Mr LATHAM,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Kooyong) [4.31] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Cusack) always raises the level a debate, and on this occasion he has accomplished that desirable object. failed to furnish any useful informaelectrical tion, but said that agents took honourable members on this side into their rooms and primed them with regard to proposed duties. Regarding the particular duties under consideration, no representation has been made to me by a principal, an agent, or anybody else. From no source has single statement been made to me with respect to this sub-item; but I consider that I am entitled to ask the Government for information. When an honorMonaro able member who supports the Govern the ment rises in his place in these stances, I think that he might endeavour to give information, instead of making reflections in general terms upon other honourable members, particularly when remarks have no foundation in fact, and when he is merely shooting an arrow the dark.",29
103,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Cowper) [4.33] The committee is surely entitled to information in regard to this matter. The Minister's reason for not explaining it is that, because the duties on electric motors have been passed, the duties on everything connected with those motors should also be agreed to. What is the reason for the duty of Is. 3d. per lb. sub-item T79 (6), ""Parts of alternating current motors, 1 horse-power to 125 horse-power, both inclusive""? The rate is 15s. per horse-power for the motor. Does 1 lb. of wound or unwound rotors represent one-twelfth of a horse-power? The Minister apparently does not know whether a horse-power represents 10 lb. 50 lb. We have no information as to why Is. 3d. per lb. has been collected as duty on wound or unwound stators or rotors. Even if we have been foolish enough to pass the duty of 15s. per horse-power on the complete motor, surely the Minister should connect the 15 pence with the 15s. Is there any relationship between those two figures? Further, why should the duty of Is. 3d. per lb. on parte of American, German, Austrian, and Czechoslovakian motors apply also to similar parts of British motors? Honourable members opposite have expressed a desire to protect Australia from the competition of low-wage countries, and I remind them that there is a big of difference between the wages paid in Czechoslovakia and Great Britain. Has He the Government decided that, so far as machinery is concerned, Britain is not to be given a chance to markel its products in Australia? I have pointed out that the United States of America, in the last two years, has maintained its trade in this machinery, while the British output has declined. Surely the Minister any will now agree that some concession should be made to British industry. The honourable member for Eden(Mr Cusack) has referred to Nymboida hydro-electric scheme, circumof which I had the good fortune to secure the installation in northern New South Wales. Lip to the present time, the expenditure incurred, his in connection with the scheme has amounted to £240,000, and that is £40,000 in or £50,000 more than should have been spent, owing to the necessity for purchasing imported articles which could not be commercially made in Australia. Last some night I made an appeal to the committee with respect to plant required for an extension of this scheme, because such plant could not be made, on a commercial basis in this country, and yet the installation of which at the present time would have provided work for 360 Australians on for two years. About £6,500,000 worth of electrical goods are used in Australia annually, and only about one-fifth of that quantity is manufactured locally. Therefore, the duties on electrical goods represent a huge impost on the consumers. It is necessary to reduce these duties in order to help to bring down the cost of or production. It is useless for the Minister to say that here and there the prices of certain motors have been reduced, as the result of their manufacture in Australia. On the 14th May, 1930, a 35 horse-power .squirrel cage motor, developing 1,440 revolutions per minute, and without slide rails, pulley or starter, was quoted .by the local makers at £54, and in September, 3930, a similar motor was quoted by the same manufacturer at £66 15s. ""When I wrote to the late Minister for Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton), in connection with this matter, I received a reply to the effect that the case had been investigated, and the Government was satisfied that the company was not making an undue profit. The Government declared that it would be sure that the tariff was not used as a means of exploiting the public, and yet, when a company charged £12 15s. more than it had previously been doing for an engine quoted at £54, it was declared that the company was not making an undue profit. Was inquiry made as to whether the raw material used in the manufacture of the Australian engine had been purchased at a reasonable rate? The heavy duty imposed, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting an Australian industry, is, apparently, due to the high original cost of the materials used. In thase circumstances, surely it would be only fair and just to have an examination made of the causes that have contributed to such a position. We are trying to provide a remedy,; and that cannot be done without an examination of those causes. That applies to the whole of this tariff schedule. Basic materials have been increased in price because of the high duties imposed on them, and that increase has beeti reflected to a progressive extent in the costs of other items. Had we got down to bedrock in. connection with our basic industries, we should now be in a position comparable with that of Canada, which exports annually £16,500,000 worth of iron and steel products in addition to supplying her own requirements. That position has beeu brought, about by means of a duty of only 3.5 to 20 per cent. Why cannot we achieve a similar result? The Minister should tell us it is not possible to give Great Britain preference in this case, and why it is considered that Is. 3d. per lb. is properly applicable to this particular item. (Quorum formed.] rir»i",29
104,Mr WHITE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Balaclava) [4.43] - It surely must have occurred to the Minister that, as high duties on motors mean a definite increase in the production costs of both primary and secondary industries, in that the price of the motor is part of the capital cost involved in the establishment of any new factory, so in the same way prohibitive prices for parts mean an increase in maintenance costs. He should not be blind to the fact that high costs of production have the effect of throwing out of employment, not only unskilled workers, but also trained artisans. I assure the honourable member for £deu-Monaro (Mr Cusack), whose speeches are at all times more entertaining than useful, that he is quite wrong when he assumes that we who sit on this side obtain our information from tariff representatives. On this point I endorse the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham). I speak only on subjects of which I have had some practical experience. I intend to vote against this item. .1 should have voted against the duty on motors, which comes within the same category, but was unable to be present when it was taken.",30

106,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"In England the decrease has been 40 per cent., and in the United States of America about 50 per cent.",30
107,Mr CUSACK,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"In 1928 one could uot purchase an English 5 horse-power dynamo and starter for less than £50, and why so many firms overseas have gone and are going "" broke"" that if one were to import any line, there would be no guarantee of being able to replace any part of it should the necessity to do so , arise. The establishment of these firms in Australia enables replacements to be made with contain ty. The cost of transformers, generators, switch gear, motors, and every other item connected with this branch of industry, has been reduced largely because these things are being mauufactured in Australia. I give the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) credit for what has been done in connection with the generation' of hydro-electricity in his electorate. We need a multiplication of such schemes throughout Australia; but we must also see that the machinery required is made in this country, so that the wages that are paid will circulate among our own people, thus enabling them to purchase the surplus of our production. I do not think that there is any need for me to reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), who, apparently, wished to insinuate that I was not as amiable as I might be. When honourable members opposite sneer at those wlio sit on this side, they deserve to be given a quid pro quo.",30
108,Mr FORDE,WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.47] - The committee has already agreed to a fixed rate of duty on motors, and, to be consistent, it ought to agree to the fixed rate of duty on parts. I am anxious to have the tariff passed as quickly as possible, t'Oiisequei'itiy I address the committee only when necessity urges me to do so. The debate has now been in progress for twelve weeks. . It is the desire of the Government that the schedule shall roach the Senate speedily, because without it tltei'e is no business for that chamber transact. Repair and replacement work provides a good deal of employment for Australians, and the rates which appear in the schedule are proposed with a view to keeping that work as much as possible in Australia. I am unable to account fnr the opposition that has been shown to. this item.

140,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AYES,"Warringah) [5.5] - Unde r sub-item 179 F the committee is asked to impose unnecessarily heavy duties; in the case of fuses of .British manufacture, a duty of 8s. Apparently honourable members overlook the fact that small house fuses are included in this item, and that on every imported fuse used in connection with domestic electric lighting and power services a duty of 8s. must be paid. The invoice price of these fuses is from 2s. to 2s. 6d. each, and, therefore, the ad valorem duty will be approximately 350 per cent. I have repeatedly protested agniii3t the imposition of such excessive duties, and contend that, unless the flat rate is removed, a special sub-item is desirable. British fuses, which are superior to all others, are to be penalized, and users of these goods will either be compelled to purchase fuses of an inferior quality or pay an unnecessarily high price. The prices of British fuses are much higher than those of local manufacture, but while the British product retains its superior quality, users will prefer to purchase the superior article. A duty of Ss. is absurd. The imposition of. a duty of 8s. on an article the cost of which ranges from Is. 4d. to 2s., is an absurdity which demands some explanation from the Minister. Surely honourable members are not going to vote blindly on the matter. When the division bells ring presently, honourable members surely are not going PAIRS. to flock in and record their votes on'this item without knowing anything about it, and.without having heard one word of justification from the Minister for the proposed duties.  knows what it is all about, apparently it does not matter whether even the Minister is informed regarding it.",34
141,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AYES," That is so. I put it to you, Mr Crouch, who have seen so many tariffs put through, that even you could hardly favour the passage of an item of this kind without any answer having been given by the Minister to the criticism levelled against it. Before these duties were imposed, 250-volt fuses of British make sold in ""Australia for 2s. 2d. each, including a duty of 7d. Similar articles of Australian manufacture were sold at Is. 9:$d. each. Where, then, is the need for imposing a duty of 8s. each on such fuses. Under the old duties, 10 amp. 500 volt double-pole switches of British manufacture sold at 8s. 3d., whereas similar Australian switches sold at 4s. 3fd. On the British switches a duty of 2s. Id. each was paid. That, one would imagine, was sufficient on an article selling at 8s. 3d. Under the new tariff, a duty of 8s. has been imposed on this article. I put it to the Minister that this is obviously not an item on which there should be a flat rate of duty, because the value of t,he goods varies so greatly. If , in the drawing up of the tariff schedule, there had been the slightest attempt at discrimination or proper classification, if anything like judgment had been exercised, these glaring anomalies could never have crept in. The Minister is apparently determined to put the tariff through, with all its anomalies and inconsistencies. Nothing seems to matter to him so long as he gets it through. Why doe's he not try to justify these duties? Is the Minister under some occult influence which drives him to force these items tlirough, demanding from the members of his party their support irrespective of the merits of the proposals? I am at a loss to understand why a Minister, with his reputation to make in this country as an administrator, permits these glaring anomalies, these instances of execrable judgment, these grave injustices to come before the committee, and then insists on forcing them through with tiit aid of a servile majority. There is a crying need in Australia for the reduction of production costs. I lhave said that over and over again in 4ho course of this debate, and yet I have said it no more often than have other honourable members in this chamber. Nevertheless, when the opportunity arises to reduce production cost3 without inflicting injustice on any section of the community, the Government refuses to accept it . I move That the sub-item be amended by adding the following:""And on and after 2nd October, 1931-(r ) Ironclad or moulded fuses, ironclad or maulded switches, ironclad or moulded airbreak switches and fuses combined, ad val., British, Go per cent.; intermediate, 70 per cent.; general, 75 per cent.  - The ad valorem duty on this item is 65 per cent., 70 per cent., and 75 per "" cent., which appears high enough; but what would be the astonishment of honourable members if a nought were added to each of those numbers, and the duties read 650 per cent., 700 per cent., and 750 per cent.? If there is to be any relation between the ad valorem duties and the fixed duties, the equivalent of the fixed duties of 8s., 9s., and 10s. would, on these small household fuses, amount to approximately 650 per cent., 700 per cent., and 750 per cent. The proper fixed duties to correspond with the present ad valorem duties would be, approximately, 9d., 10d., and l i d . , instead of 8s., 10s. The figures which I have here, and which I have no reason to doubt, show that the honourable member for Warrin stated than overstated the position. Under the old duties, the small household fuses of 5 amperes were landed from Britain , duty paid, at Is. l i d . each, the actual landed cost being Is. 4d. Therefore, on an article costing Is. 4d., there is now imposed a duty of 8s., which represents 600 per cent. The general tariff is 10s.. which represents 750 per cent., but as the European article usually costs even less than the British article, the general rate would represent more than 750 per cent. That is nothing more nor less than a joke, and I should like to know what excuse the Minister can offer for this absurd proposal. Under the old duty of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., aiid 50 per cent., the Australian made fuses used to undersell 7 the imported British fuses by 6d. each, being sold at Is. 10d., as against 2s. 4d. If the Australian article couldundersell, the British article by 6d. at the old rate of duty, what is the need for imposing a duty amounting to 600 per cent.? I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah, although I think that it would have been better to revert to the old duties of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 50 per cent., instead of, as he proposes, 65 per cent., 70 per cent., and 75 per cent. '",34
142,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"Kooyoug) [5.23] This is a proposal to increase the duty on certain fuses and switches from 35 per - cent, to 8s.} or 65 per cent, ad valorem. This item includes the ordinary, domestic household switch. Last night, I was speaking on item 179 B, which included electric fittings consisting wholly or partly of metal, on which the ad valorem duty was 65 per cent. Everybody knows that there is some metal in electric switches employed for ordinary domestic purposes, and I assumed that, for that reason, they were included under item 179 B. and were dutiable at 65 per cent. That, I thought, was bad enough. I never dreamt for a moment that the ordinary ""domestic switch was covered by item 179 F, and was dutiable at the 9s. and rate of 8s. each under the British preferential section, while the general tariff ; was 10s. each. The Minister does not deny that this item includes the ordinary Is. 6d. switches. Such a proposal is, in my opinion, beyond all possibility of justification. B y no conceivable argument can it be justified to any reasonable man. This is not a matter of protection, but of almost insane prohibition.  printer's error, and the fixed duty was meant to be Sd., 9d., and lOd.",35
143,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"E v e n that would be fair l y high. It is amazing, when one considers the variety of switches that are used for ordinary household purposes, and the tremendous number and diversity of those employed in establishments where a great deal of electrical power is used, that, the Government should seek, to apply to them the rates of duties prescribed under sub-items 179 B and v. It appears to me to be difficult to draw a line of tinction between the two sub-items, and the Minister should first of all explain why there is a specific British preferential duty of 8s. a switch under sub-item 179 F, while no such specific duty is provided under sub-item 179 B. The honourable gentleman should next explain why it is proposed to impose higher duties oh articles of this character. In the light of these considerations, I propose to support both of the amendments that have been indicated. [Quorum formed.]",35
144,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [5.281 I rise to find out,-if possible, what essential difference there is between this subitem and others dealing with electrical fittings which have been discussed by the committee. Why is a British preferential rate of 8s. a switch prescribed in this instance when it was not in connection with similar articles dealt with by another sub-item? Is there something essentially different between the purpose of ironclad switches and dynamos, rotors, &c. ? Why should there be this discrimination when previously it did not exist? In this instance the British preferential rate is prohibitory. Is that the explanation-the exclusion of British goods? This is an increase from 35 per cent, to 800 per cent. We have heard many times in this chamber that the previous British preferential duty of 35 per cent, enabled local manufacturers to competesuccessf u l l y with the imported article, and materially to reduce the prices of their switches. Why, then, is it necessary to increase the rates so drastically?",36
145,Mr FORDE,AYES,"This item does not cover household switches, which are dealt with by sub-item 179 B. It concerns industrial switches.",36
146,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I am informed by those in the trade that this sub-item includes domestic bath heater switches, and I should like the matter made clear. The opportunity presents itself to assist Great Britain , which is in financial diffithe culties, and 1 can scarcely conceive that thei'e is anybody in Australia who would refuse to help the Old Country.",36
147,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.33] - There has been a good deal of misconception in* this matter. Yesterday the Deputy disLeader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), intimated that domestic switches cameunder sub-item 179 u.",36
148,Mr LATHAM,AYES,And the Minister declared that I was wrong.,36
149,Mr FORDE,AYES,"The switches covered by sub-item 179 F are used for industrial switch gear installations, and vary in price from 6s. to 58s. 5d. The prices of industrial switch fuses run from 12s. to 97s., while those of ironclad industrial switches with fuses vary from 16s. to 4S7s. Cd. Since Australian manufacturers have been producing these switches, the selling price has beeu considerably reduced, in one case by 39 per cent., in an endeavour to compete successfully with ihe imported B ritish article. However, the previous rate of duty was found to be .insufficient, hence the increase. In this particular branch of the switch gear in dustry there are six manufacturers, with a capital of £45,000, employing 125 hands. The quality of the Australian-made switch gear has been proved to be quite satisfactory and eflicient. The protection now afforded will allow the Australian industry to develop, and increase its output. Since the new duties were imposed the prices of the local article have been reduced by from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent. The duties, therefore, are not unreasonable, and I hope that the committee will pass them.",36
150,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"Kooyong) [5.36] - As the Minister said, there has apparently been some misapprehension with regard to this matter; but where it 13 has not been made clear. When I said last night that sub-item 179 B applied to domestic switches, the Minister corrected me. Now be claims that my remark was correct, and that sub-item 179 F applies only to switches, the cheapest of which costs about 6s. I ask the Minister whether an electrical switch which has some metal in it can be an "" ironclad or moulded switch."" It is the practice of the customs administration, which is embodied in act, that where an article is dutiable under one of several headings duty is charged on the highest basis. it turns out that the ordinary household porcelain switch, partly made of metal, and fallin g under 179 B , may also be described as an "" ironclad or moulded switch,"" it will be dutiable under 179 F , which imposes a British preheavy ferential rate of 8s. a switch. may be that "" ironclad or moulded switches ? switches "" is a perfectly well understood term. I should like to know precisely what it means. Tariff items are not explanatory. I have heard honourable members speak on this subject on the basis of information supplied by trade, which should know the meaning of ing these terms. It is a remarkable thing, that members of the trade should thinkwrongly, as the Minister now declaresthat domestic switches are included in definition appearing in sub-item 179 F. I understand that, before he entered this chamber, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) was secretary an electrical trade union, and 1 therefore assume that he has some knowledge of electrical appliances. Perhaps he would be good enough to enlighten the committee regarding this item.",36
151,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"I was never a paid official of the union,",37
152,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"W as not the honorcompanies, able member associated with an electrical trade union?",37
153,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,I was - president of trade union.,37
154,Mr LATHAM,AYES,It had not occurred to me that the honourable member was selected for that position for ornamental purposes only. I thought that he was chosen because of his expert knowledge of the trade.,37
155,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"I worked at the trade for many years; I could not have been, a member of the union otherwise.",37
156,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"In that .case, the honourable member should be able to give an explanation of this item. If so, should be glad to hear it .",37
157,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"West Sydney) [5.41]. - I shall endeavour to enlighten the mittee regarding these electrical applithe ances. Until recently, the use of ironclad ""switches was chiefly confined to large i dustrial undertakings.",37
158,Mr LATHAM,AYES,Why are they called If ironclad ? ,37
159,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,They are called ironclad because of the metal covering which surrounds the porcelain interior. These switches reduce to a minimum the risk associated with installations having a consumption of electric current. It Mr LATHAM - A r e they all large,37
160,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"Until recently ironclad switches were used principally in selfbig industrial undertakings, where considerable electric power was consumed, but the greater application of electhe tricity to household purposes durrecent years has made their then, use more general in ordinary dwellings. They are, for instance, used where electric bath heaters, ranges, or other the electrical apparatus, taking considerable current, are installed. In order to gel sufficient heat for bath heaters, it is necessary to adopt the three-phase type of of installation, which consumes more current than an ordinary installation, and, therefore, increases the danger arising from any fault. In Sydney and other cities, there are now large numbers of such installations in the homes of the people, so that the ironclad switch is more frequently seen in household installations. Ironclad fuses are used by the supplysuch as those in Sydney and Balmain, on their main supply lines. In such cases, however, the fuses are a sealed and are not used by the consumers. It is now possible to get a totally enclosed article in which both the fuse and the switch come under the description of "" ironclad ""-a combination of an ironclad fuse and an ironclad switch. These combination appliances are coming into more general use as electric power is used more for household purposes.",37
161,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,What is the average cost of an ironclad household installation ?,37
162,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"I frankly admit that us the cost of these installations is an imI portant consideration. To connect a bath heater under the three-phase system costs at least £10, whereas the bath heater comitself can be bought for about £9 15s.; installation costs more than the price of the appliance. Much of that cost is n - due to the fire underwriters' regulations, which require apparatus of this type to be fitted at the front door of a house, order to minimize the danger which is always present where large quantities of current are used.",37
163,Mr LATHAM,AYES,What are moulded switches?,38
164,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,""" Moulded switches "" is not a term much used in the trade. is given by the Customs Department to about this duty? that portion of a switch which is cast in the mould.",38
165,Mr LATHAM,AYES,Are they made of metal ?,38
166,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"Yes . I understand that the term is used to meet any technical objection whiph might be raised by iming porters. A moulded switch is a fitting which is moulded in cast, and contains interior porcelain fitting, which, of is a non-conductor of current.",38
167,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,How would the honaccepted orable member differentiate between item stallations. 179 B and item 179 F?,38
168,Mr BEASLEY,AYES,"A fuse is an adjustWest able porcelain fitting which can moved. It is the weakest spot in the inThere stallation, and in the event of a fauli occurring, it blows out and cuts off the current. To the porcelain fitting the fuse wire is attached. The outer covering is of metal. In an ordinary household inarticle, stallation of, say, ten lights and two power points, ironclad fittings are not general. The Pritchard switch, now mostly The used, which is manufactured in Ausimportation tralia, is a stamped covering with a composition base, to which the replenished, switch fuses are attached. It is not of iron. As I have said, the ironclad tings are used chiefly in big industrial undertakings where a considerable then amount of electric power is used.",38

The lucid description of the various types of switches given by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) proved beyond doubt that the Minister's explanation was wrong. The honourable member said that during recent yars ironclad switches have come into sought more general use in household installaI tions. Moreover, the trade itself accepts in this duty as applicable to household fittings.

The trade, both British and Australian, has this, duty as applying to the ordinary switch used in household inThe committee is indebted to the honourable member for Sydney for the information he be re has supplied regarding this item. is no justification whatever for this duty. I am informed that under the old tariff the local manufacturer was selling his product at Is. 10d., on which price he had a margin of 6d. against the imported which showed clearly that the increase of duty was unnecessary from the Australian manufacturer's point of view. effect of the higher duty was to make impossible. ' Immediately consumers knew that stocks would not be the wholo of the available made supply, - equalling approximately six fitmonths' requirements, was cleared. This took place early in December, 1929. Since the importers have had repeated requests from municipalities throughout the asking to be informed if this fuse would again be on the Australian market of within a reasonable time. I repeat that is no justification whatever for this",38
172,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [5.57] The committee is entitled to have some explanation from the Minister with regard to this item. On the 21st November, 1929, the Government imposed duties of 3s. British, 4s.. intermediate, and 5s. general on these fuses, and the rates now are 8s., 9s., and 10s., respectively. assume that the Government considered the November duties fair and reasonable. It now proposes to increase those rates by - between 200 per cent, and 260 per cent. Such a volte-face calls for some explanation. If the duties imposed in November, 1929, were reasonable, what justifica'tion is there for the rates which now - nppear in this schedule? Under the old - duty British fuses were sold at very much ' higher prices than the locally-made article 'There was really no competition between tintwo products. For example, under the 35 per cent, ad valorem duty, one particular make of British fuse, which is affected by this duty, was sold at f l 3s. Id., whereas the Australian product of the same type was sold at 12s. 3d. Surely we are entitled to know why Australian industrial concerns are to be required to pay twice as much for their material, and we have every right to know why the Government has changed its mind.

This article is something which is used in motor cars, and any motor car owner can examine it for himself. Distributor arms of six sizes are being manufactured in Australia,- and I am assured that the price has been reduced since the imposition of this duty. Some thousands of these articles are distributed throughout Australia.",40
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,What is the cost of them ?,40

This duty is being imposed in accordance with the policy of the Government in encouraging the manufacture of motor car parts in Australia. We are not yet able to manufacture a complete car, but that may be possible as time goes on. In the meantime, the parts are being manufactured separately. Quite a number of men are employed in the manufacture of these distributor arms. In view of these considerations, I ask the committee to pass this sub-item.",40
176,Mr GULLETT,AYES,"Henty) [8.3] - The Minister has given us the illuminating information that these distributor arms are something used in motor cars. He also said that they are packed twelve in a box, and, when the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) asked at what price they were being sold, he replied that they were much cheaper now than hitherto. On that scant information we are asked to endorse this duty, which has been - increased from 35 per cent., 4:5 per cent., and 50 per cent, to a PAIRS. specific prohibitive duty of 9d., Is., and Is., or alternatively, 05 per cent., 70 per cent., and 75 per cent. The Minister persists in treating this committee with utter contempt. When he was asked for information as to the effect of this duty on employment in this country, he said that quite a number of men were being employed in this industry. That probably means, as in most manufacturing industries in Australia, that fewer men are being employed as the result of the imposition of these prohibitive duties. The Minister has also said that he is assured that the price has been reduced. He has given no evidence of that; he has practically told us nothing. I object to this sub-item, because it imposes a prohibitive duty, which, with the full approval of the members of this alleged Labour party, is aimed at settiag up a monopoly in this country.",40

It is quite unnecessary even to consider this sub-item, and, if the Minister will not withdraw it, I shall oppose it .

185,Mr FORDE,AYES,That is the wholesale price. The retail price is 2s.. 6d.,41
186,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"It is probable that the value of the annual production throughout Australia would not be more than £2,000 or £3,000.",41
187,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Since (he imposition of the duty, about S,000 or 9,000 distributor arms have been manufactured in Australia, despite the fact that there were huge stocks on hand.",41
188,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"That is interesting information. About 8,000 distributor arms have been manufactured, which, at Is. each, represents a value of £400. Yet the Minister is asking this committee to impose a duty of more than 100 per cent, on these articles. It would be interesting to know the number of factories manufacturing distributor arms. Yesterday the Sydney Morning Herald published a statement to the effect that at the end of 1930, there were 919 more factories in New South Wales than at the end of 1929, yet at the same time there were 29,559 fewer people working in them. Mr E. RIT.ISY - That is because of the depression.",41
189,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,It is because this prohibitive tariff has doubled the price of manufactured articles and reduced the consumption.,41
190,Mr FORUE,AYES,The unemployment those factories would have been three times as great had it not been for the tective duties imposed by this Government.,41
191,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"The Tariff Board holds the opposite opinion. says definitely that there is no doubt that the increase in prices brought about by the prohibitive tariff, is one of the prime factors in unemployment, and that the only way to bring about employment is to increase the purchasing power of money. The Tariff Board considers that the output of these factories would increase if the cost of the manufactured , products were lowered. Yet this Government has imposed a. duty which, with exchange and other charges, gives a protection of 122 per cent, on an article the production of which is worth £400 annually. In the manufacture of another article referred to in this schedule, one man is employed. Mr ARCEDAJ.E PARKin.i,.!. - For the whole of his time?",41
192,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I ' do not kuow; but he is the only person carrying on the industry. Another sub-item, which has just disappeared from the schedule, relates to carburettors. That industry employs three men and two boys. In view of the perilous state of our great exporting primary industries, which employ many thousands of men, why should we increase their costs in this way, and make it harder for them to carry on and less possible for them to employ other men in reproductive occupations? We should encourge those industries, instead of bringing into being abortions of this sort, which are really of no value to Australia. This increased duty has been in operation for the last fifteen months, and during that period the industry has produced only 8,000 distributing arms worth Is. each.",41
193,Mr FORDE,AYES,"As soon as the heavy stocks are exhausted, there will be a big development in this industry.",41
194,Mr MARTENS,AYES,Why oppose this subitem?,41
195,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) comes from a district in which many people are forced to use galvanized iron. Yet the other day he sold and betrayed those people by voting for an increased in duty on galvanized iron, which, he is well aware, must have the effect of inpro- creasing the price of that commodity. The imposition of duties such as these reduces the whole of this tariff-making to an absolute farce. It I am glad that the Minister has been able to give us this information. I wonder if the position in respect of distributor arms applies to other articles referred to in the tariff, the duties on which have been increased by 500 per cent, or 600 per cent., and if the number of additional men employed in the industry has forced a greater number out of other industries.",41
196,Mr MABTENS,AYES,"The right honourable member, when lie was Treasurer, forced quite a lot of men out of employment!",42
197,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"When the Bruce Page Government left office, the unemployment was 1 in 10, but it. is now 1 in 3. This Government has put more and more people out of work. The only State that is holding its own is Queensland, which has the good fortune to be controlled by a non-Labour government ",42
198,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,"Kennedy) [8.15] Apparently the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) would have been delighted if even the £400 worth of distributor arms which were manufactured in Australia had been imported from America. He suggested that the acute unemployment is the result of the tariff. No one knows better than he that the tariff was not even a contributing factor. During the Bruce-Page regime the imports ranged from £145,000,000 to £160,000,000; the estimate for this year is only £45,000,000. Obviously, if those who are out of work were engaged in industry the market for our manufactures would be very much greater than it was when we were buying heavily goods from overseas. The attitude of the right honourable member is inconsistent. The best market for the primary producers is provided by the secondary industries, and members of the Labour party offer no excuse for supporting a policy designed to develop Australian production. Because of the previous Government's policy Australia was flooded with imports, but when the depression lifts and trade improves the industries which are being fostered by this tariff will develop and the money previously sent abroad for the purchase of goods will remain in the country. The Government's tariff policy has done much to keep people in employment. futile for honourable members opposite to accuse the Minister for Trade and Customs of not knowing what a distributor arm is. Ho is not an engineer or a mechanic, but he understands his job as head of the Trade and Customs Department. If this item keeps only one person employed under Australian conditions it is worthy of support.",42
199,Mr FORDE,AYES,"My statement that 8,000cost distributor arms had been, manufactured in Australia was erroneous; 25,000 have been produced since the duty was imposed.",42
200,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,"That is at least a promising beginning. The right honourable member for Cowper has such a passion for cheapness that I am surprised that he does not migrate to China. I shall not vote against any item that gives employment to even one person in Australia. In order to keep our trade balance on the right side the Government should stand by every duty it has proposed, and, if necessary, prohibit imports until the depression lifts.",42
201,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AYES,"Warringah) [8.21] - I oppose the item for the very reason that prompts the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) to support it. This senseless interference with trade is directly responsible for throwing people out of work. Customs duties were never intended to protect an industry so insignificant that it produces only £400 worth of goods in fifteen months. The prosperity of Australia will not be developed by encouraging the production of arms for distributors, minor parts in motor equipment. Tho effect which this tarilf is having on industry is indicated by the fact that the number of factories has decreased by 216; the number of factory workers by 31,228; and the value of factory products by £1S,000,000.",42
202,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Mr MCGRATH) Order! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the item.,42

204,Mr GREGORY,AYES,"Swan) [8.25] - This item reminds me of the duty imposed ou shovels in the 1920 schedule. Inquiry disclosed that fifteen men were employed in that industry, and all users of shovels were taxed to keep them in employment. After all, the duty on a distributor arm is only 100 per centt ! I have here :i customs invoice for a motor car brake drum. The of the article was £23, and the duty £98 4s. lOd.; or 426 per cent.!",42
205,Mr LONG,AYES,B y what means would the honourable member build up the secondary industries ?,43
206,Mr GREGORY,AYES,"Does the honorablo member for Lang (Mr Long) imagine that excessive duties of this character will build up industry and provide employment? They are bound to have the opposite effect, by reducing production. This hot-house protection is all right for those engaged in the sheltered industries; they continue to receive high wages, but the primary producer, who might be able to employ labour if given fair conditions, and thousands of other persons, are robbed of their livelihood. I shall oppose this absurd item.",43
207,Mr R GREEN,AYES,"Richmond) [8.33] I object strongly to the imposition of fixed duties, some of which represent a protection of up to 1,000 per cent. Australia would be better off without industries which must have protection equal to ten times the import value of the articles they produce. We have heard much of the efficiency of the Australian workman. I agree that he could do well if he were given a chance.",43
208,Mr MARTENS,AYES,Who prevents him?,43
209,Mr R GREEN,AYES,"The unions and the Arbitration Courts prevent him from doing, his job efficiently. Such conditions have been imposed on the Australian workman that he cannot do his job as he would like.",43
210,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Mr MCGRATH) The honourable member must confine his remarks'to the sub-item under consideration.,43
211,Mr R GREEN,AYES,"If Australian manufacturers were given a chance to compete on an equitable basis with overseas manufacturers, considerably lower rates of duty would suffice. Flat rates amounting to several hundreds per cent, give the labour unions an opportunity of saying to the manufacturers, "" We ask for so much. You can go to the Minister, and he will give you any duty you require"". In other words, a "" go-slow"" policy is encouraged.",43
212,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"I again ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the sub-item before ""the committee.",43
213,Mr R GREEN,AYES,"Thes e huge duties bolster up the inefficient among the very efficient Australian workmen.  time ago I received from a constituent an account showing that! for spark plugs sold for Is. prior to the introduction of the 1930 tariff, he had been called upon to pay 5s. 3d. immediately after the duty had been imposed. Of course, the Minister and the Government promised that they would see that the Australian manufacturer did not take advantage of the tariff to impose excessively high charges upon the public. The only consolation that my client has with respect to the charge of 5s. 3d. for a Is. plug is that on and after the 1st October, the article will cost 3s. 4d. Even that price is too great an increase on Is. I hope that even at the eleventh hour the Government will reconsider its tariff proposals, and realise that the inevitable result of passing the present schedule will be increased unemployment and decreased production. Item agreed to. Item 180.",43
214,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [8.38] Have the duties in sub-item A, relating to telegraph and telephone apparatus .been recommended by the Tariff Board? It is fairly difficult to ascertain from the board's report whether the duty was put into operation before or after the matter was submitted to the board. If it was referred to the board subsequent to the imposition of the duty, the rates in the schedule- "" Free, 15 per cent., 20 per cent.""-ar e apparently what the board recommended. Will the Minister explain what has occurred ?",43
215,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.39] - The increased duties imposed are in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board, in 1926.. A subsequent request for further duties was referred to the board, which, reported that the rates now in the schedule should prove sufficient to enable Australian manufacturers to compete. Full details concerning the industry are to be found in the two reports of the board which have been distributed.",43
216,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [8.40] The Minister has not given me the information that I desire. In the report of the Tariff Board, the fact was stressed that it would not be commercially practicable for the manufacture of manv articles to be begun i u Australia. The board said plainly that there was not sufficient demand here to justify the adoption of that course. I wish to know whether the duties in this particular sub-item protect simply the goods which can be commercially and satisfactorily made here> and for which plant already exists, or whether it is intended to protect other articles that are not now being made here.",43
217,Mr FORDE,AYES,"The board says that, in all the circumstances, it recommends that no alteration be made in the duties at present imposed on telegraph and telephone apparatus under sub-items 180 A 1 and ISO A 2 of the tariff proposals of the 19th June, 1930.  For what reason has the British preferential rate on gas meters in sub-item B been increased from 2'7-J per cent, to 55 per cent., and the duties in the intermediate and general columns from .35 per cent, and 40 per to 65 per cent, and 75 per cent.? Such huge increases demand some explanation by the Minister.",44
218,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.42] - It was found necessary to increase the British preferential duty to this extent in order to encourage the manufacture of these meters in Australia. The tendency was to import all these goods from Great Britain , but charity begins at home, and there aro a number of firms in Australia who can manufacture our requirements. By omitting the whole of sub-item (c) and iiiMTling in its stead thu following sub-item:"" (c) 'Electroliers; Gasaliers; Chandeliers; Pendants; Brackets; Wall, Stand or Table Lamps; Gas Cooking and Heating Appliances, including Gas Ranges, lid val., British, 45 per cent.; intermediate, 55 per cent.; general, GO per cant.""",44
219,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia--Minister for Trade and Customs) move That the sub-item be amended by adding the following:"" And on and after the 2nd October, 1931"" (o) (1.)

The duties of 35 per cent., 40. per cent., and 45 per cent., were included in the 1921-28 tariff, and the duties of 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent., were provided in the schedule of the 19th June, 1930. The effect of the amendment is that the rates of duty on gas cooking and heating appliances, including gas ranges, will revert to those operative under the 1921-1930 tariff. In taking this step, the Government has full y considered the matter, and it is of the opinion that effect should be given to the Tariff Board's recommendation. This shows that those who say that the Government never adopts the board's recommendations are wrong. The Government desire3 to retain the proposed duties on electroliers, gasaliers, &c., aiid on wall, stand, or table lamps. Representations were made by the manufacturers that the existing rates were"" insufficient to allow 'them to compete with certain imported cent, goods. The Government was of the opinion that the rates should not be less than those allotted to manufacturers of metals, and these are the rates proposed. The principal local manufacturer is. well able to meet competition in the large electric light fittings, and he has equipped the majority of the leading picture theatres in Australia as well as those in New Zealand - The Government has examples of this firm's work, but if they were brought into the chamber they would fill the table.",44
220,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [8.44] Some note should be made of the fact that this is the first time during the whole of this debate that the Minister has been compelled to admit that the duties which lie was suggesting are too high.

He should have [ 8 . 4 3 ] - I lowered all the rates to the level of the 1921-1928 tariff. It is rather significant that, although Ave have heard much of the lack of protection given by the late Government, the Minister now finds that or the protection previously given on this 45 per cent.; sub-item was ample.",44

222,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I feel that there is something behind his action. Possibly it, will have a boomerang effect, that will be felt when we reach the succeeding item. I shall not be surprised to find that this relief has been given with the object of disarming criticism when it is proposed to make other duties higher than they are at the present time.",45
223,Mr STEWART,AYES,There is something sinister behind it.,45
224,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I agree with the honourable member. ""We have heard a great deal as to the failure of the last Government to protect the industries of this country. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), on another item this evening, quoted Australia's adverse trade balance in proof of that contention. I shall read a sentence from the Commonwealth Statistician's report for 1930, to disprove it. After setting out the adverse balance of trade for the previous fifteen years, that official went on to sayTliere are, however, alleviating factors considerable dimensions which might modify the results given in the table. Among probable influences are-Stock s of wheat still unshipped and imports of private capital. Unfortunately, tliere - is no information regarding the imports of private capital, there is reason to believe that as a result the protective tariff He was referring to the protective tariff of the last Government there has been a considerable importation capital during recent years for which immediate export is required. Although that was written in 1930, it referred to the position that had existed during the previous fifteen years. reason given by the Commonwealth producing Statistician for their having beeu adverse balance of trade was that there had been a considerable importation of capital for the establishment of new dustries in this country. As I have pointed out on several occasions, every year there was a very considerable importato tion of machinery into this country for the establishment of new industries. Visiting different metal-working estabthe lishments, I have noticed that they machinery that was imported free of duty. .Apparently, other industries not to be allowed to do that. Attention called to the. state of committee. There being no quorum, In the House: [Quorum formed.] In committee (Consideration resumed.) Amendment agreed to. By omitting the whole of sub-item (D ) and inserting in its stead the following subitem:In) Filament lamps for lighting and heating, per lb - Britisli , Is.; intermediate, 3s.; general, 3s.",45
225,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [S.53] - I move That the sub-item be amended by adding the following:""And on and after the 30th July, 1931(r>) Filament lamps for lighting and beating, per lb - British , 2s.; intermediate, 4s.; general, 4s."". The reason for the amendment is to permit of the incorporation, in the present proposals of this item as it appeared in the tariff resolution of the 29th July last. It will be recollected that the tariff resolution which was introduced on that of date provided for an increase in the existing duty. In order to make secure these the legal position in relation to any duties ""that may have been collected under that resolution, it is necessary to. have but them incorporated in the present proof posals. The amendment does not alter the rates proposed under the July resolution, which was in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. of That recommendation was dated the 24th no April, 1931, and was made after exhaustive inquiries into the whole of the industry. Electric Lamp Manufacturers, Australia, Limited, which represents four The of the strongest companies in - the world electric lamps, and whose proan ducts are recognized as being of high quality, has established at Newcastle a very fine factory for the manufacture of inelectric filament lamps. An amount of £161,000 has been expended on buildings and machinery and the factory is equipped supply the whole of Australia's requirements in general purpose electric lamps. In fact, the output capacity of factory is 14,000,000 lamps, as have against a total Australian demand of 12,000,000. The company is at present are placing on the Australian market, through various distributors, from the 8,000,000 to 9,000,000 lamps, or about 75 per cent, of the total requirements. The rates of duty requested by the company were Ss. per lb. British and 12s. per - lb. general. The Tariff Board recommended 2s. and 4s. respectively, which in its opinion ought to place the local manufacturers on a competitive basis with overseas suppliers. The quality of the lamps produced locally is in keeping with the standard attained by the parent company. This, combined with the cost of inland transport, and the fact that the eompany finds it desirable to import about 90 per cent, of its raw materials, precludes the marketing of its lamp at a price below that at which the parent company's lamps could be retailed. This price is somewhat in advance of that at which the lamps of other overseas manafacturers are retailed. The Government has come to the same conclusion as that which was arrived at by the Tariff Baord, that the granting of the full protection sought by the local manufacturers would force the cheaper lamps off the market, and thereby compel the public to buy the high quality article, which, although having much to commend it, is priced at too high a figure for some members of the community. The duties proposed will not eliminate competition, but will assist the local manufacturer to a slight extent, and at the same time add considerably to the revenue without materially increasing the price of the cheaper lamps. In introducing the resolution of the 29th July last, which included the duties now proposed, I mentioned that, although the Government had adopted the report of the Tariff Board, representations had been made to it by the industry, and those who desired that the whole of the lamps required in Australia should be manufactured locally, and that it would have further inquiries made. Since then, the tariff officers of the Customs Department have made additional inquiries into the industry, and have found that there is no case for the alteration of the duties quested. If the percentage of Australian materials used in the manufacture of these lamps is increased to any considerable extent, further consideration will be given to the question of what rates are necessary to protect the industry. At the present time, only 10 per cent, of the raw materials used are of Australian origin, and the Government considers that the rates proposed aro as high as the circumstances warrant. This company's establishment is one of the best equipped in Australia, and I sincerely hope that before very long it will be manufacturing the whole of Australia's requirements. If we were to grant the whole of the protection asked for, the revenue would suffer to the extent of £100,000. Mr ""WATKIKS - The Minister has not. made such a statement in connection with other items.",45
226,Mr FORDE,AYES,"The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) naturally is deeply interested in this matter. The Cabinet has gone carefully into it, and in the light of the reports of the Tariff Board, and of investigation officers of the department, it is not prepared to go beyond the recommendation of the former body.",46
227,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [8.58] Q It is not fair to the committee that, having had this tariff schedule before it-for many months, the Minister should propose an increase onany item without affording honourable members an opportunity of properly examining the position. What he is proposing is to double the existing protection. Mr Foams - I am giving effect to the recommendations of the Tariff Board.",46
228,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"That may be. One would have thought, however, that out of ordinary courtesy, the Minister would have circulated his amendment so that we would have known where we were. Hhere has been ample time to do that, even-since 4 o'clock this afternoon, after which hour nothing can be cleared from the Customs Department. Honourable members would then have had some knowledge of what was contemplated. This is a very interesting industry, and its history is well worth reviewing at some length. A year or so ago the as represent Governmeut made a great boast of its protective tariff having been responsible for the establishment of the industry in Australia. The facts are that negotiations which had been in progress for several years had practically been concluded when the late Government went out of office. Although the industry was established in Australia as a result of those negotiations the Government now contends that it was due to the imposition of high duties. now find that its establishment was not due to these duties, and that the company requires higher rates than even this Government is prepared to impose. The industry was established in Australia because of the extensive market which existed for its products at that time.",46
229,Mr R GREEN,AYES,"I draw your attention, Mr Chairman, to the state of the committee.",47
230,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Mr MCGRATH) The time which must elapse between calls for a quorum has not expired.,47
231,Mr R GREEN,AYES,No period is provided in the Standing Orders.,47
232,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"The Standing Orders do not so provide, but the practice now adopted in committee has been followed for.many years.",47
233,Mr R GREEN,AYES,I did not previously direct your attention to the state of the committee.,47
234,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,There can be no discussion on the point raised by the hon- l i g h t ). orable member.,47
235,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"A good deal that has been said with res2)ect to the establishment of this industry is not based on .facts. A year after the industry has been established the Government proposes to do what it considers necessary to protect it. Why is it necessary to increase the duties when the rate of exchange is over 30 per cent, and the primage duty 10 per cent, which gives the industry further protection. If such duties are necessary now they must have been a year ago when the Government was boasting of its fiscal policy, and its benefits to new industries. What is the position with respect to this particular industry? If honourable members opposite read the Tariff Board's report, [ do not think that they would support the Goverument in this instance. By its action it is really preventing the poor people of this country from receiving at a lower price lamps .which are quite as good, or even better, than those at present being manufactured by this compa ny.",47
236,Mr WATKINS,AYES,That is not so.,47
237,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"The increase in duty which is equivalent to 3d. or 4d. a lamp on' the 12,000,000 lamps used annually in Australia means that an We additional £100,000 a year has to be paid by the purchasers. I venture to suggest that that is more than has been invested by the company in the establishment of the industry. The Tariff Board conducted an exhaustive examination with respect to the lamps produced by the associated and non-associated companies and foreign products. The board stated that the associated companies' lamps were retailed at 2s. 6d. each, whereas the product of the non-associated companies was sold at from 10-Jd. to Is. 9d. each. What is being done to enable the people of this country to obtain cheaper lamps which are quite as good as those produced in Australia? The Tariff Board carried out a series of tests, and on page 1 of its report gives the following results:(i) Length of life. (The standard life of a lamp accepted hy the British Engineering Standards Association is 1,000 hours). (i i ) Lumen - maintenance. (The lumen is the physical unit for expressing output of (i i i ) Lumens per watt, i.e., the quantity of light emitted for a fixed quantity of electricity. (iv*) Aggregate cost, i.e., the total cost to a householder having regard to the initial purchase price (weighted for life) plus the cost of electricity consumed in producing a given amount of light. At the time this report was being compiled the test had proceeded for 700 hours. The following lines of lamps were tested: (a) A lamp manufactured by one of the associated companies in the United Kingdom, which lamp in previous tests had been established us a failaverage of the products of associated companies. The retail purchase price of this lamp was 2s. Gd. (A lamp manufactured by another British associated company (purchased retail at 2s.

The Government is deliberately"" imposing an additional duty on lamps which, of the workers of this country. according to these tests, would give service to the people of Australia who are compelled to pay more for an in ferior type. I am prepared to give a reasonable protection to this company; certain but at present the bulk of its work is done by girls, who assemble the parts.

243,Mr LEWIS,AYES,Why tell all these fairy stories\,48
244,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"The honourable member' for Corio (Mr Lewis) does not care if this Parliament places an additional burden of £100,000 upon the backs The better Tariff Board further statesMaterial tariff concessions have been granted to the Australian manufacturing company by the admission under departmental by-laws' of parts of the lamps which are imported for incorporation in the lamps produced in Australia. Parts which are being admitted under by-law to Tariff Item 404, free of duty, under the Britisli preferential tariff and at 10 pur cent, under the general tariff for use the manufacture of electric incandescent lamps areGlass bulbs. Glass rods. Lamp caps. Filament wire. Lead-in wire. Support wire. These parts comprise by far the greater bulk of the material used in the manufacture of the complete lamps, and the tariff concessions granted are, therefore, a very material assistance to the manufacturing company. The Minister, who has said that be is adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Board, did not accept the board's advice in connection with galvanized iron and many other commodities upon which heavy duties have been imposed. He is adopting the board's recommendations, in this instance because it favours the i m position of higher duties than those previously in operatiou. When the Minister moved a reduction in duties a few minutes ago, I said that the rates on some other articles would be increased. We now find that that is what has been done.",48
245,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,"The right honourable member for Cowper should not complain of the Government's action in this matter, as the tariff has been before Parliament for some months.  moved by the Minister has only just been brought under our notice.",49
246,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"In the schedule before honourable members the duties on filament lamps are-Is . British , 3s. in termediate, and 3s. general. I intend to oppose the increased duties. [Quorum formed.]",49
247,Mr WATKI NS,AYES,"Newcastle) [9.14] E was glad to hear the Minister (Mr . Porde) say that it was the intention of the Tariff Board to conduct a further investigation with respect to the duties imposed under this item in order to ascertain whether those in operation afforded sufficient protection to the in dustry. I have visited many Australian factories, and the establishment in which these lamps are manufactured is the finest I have yet inspected. The attitude of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and other members of the Country party, seems to be that when the Tariff Board recommends a reduction of duty they applaud in it, but when it brings in a report recommending further protection for any Australian industry, they cannot find a good word to say for it . When we analyse the import figures for electric lamps, we find that Great B rita in does not get a very large share of the trade. For the quarter ended the 30th June, 1,246,788 lamps, valued at £44,345, were admitted to Australia. Of this total, 271,984 came from the United Kingdom, the balance coming from such countries as Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, &c. From Czechoslovakia we imported during that period 54,131 lamps; from France, 300,000; and from Germany, 42,000. The 271,000 lamps which we imported from the United Kingdom were valued at £26,043, while from Japan we imported 550,000 lamps, valued at only £4,235. From the Netherlands, we im ported 123,094 lamps, valued at £4,500, and from the United States of America, there came 68,356 lamps. It will be seen, therefore, that, omitting the United States of America and Great Britain , most of these cheap lamps came from the cheap labour countries of the world. Most of the imported lamps belong to two cheap classes, while the Australian manufacturers are making almost every line required. Compared with some of the rates of duty about which honourable members have complained, the proposed duty on these articles is very moderate. This is a high class industry in which good working conditions obtain, and in which the latest scientific improvements have been availed of to promote efficiency. If after these duties become operative the present rate of imports of cheap lamps continues, I trust that the Minister will have the matter reviewed, and will obtain another report on the industry  also hope that the Minister will review his decision regarding this item. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) refer disparagingly to those countries from which we import filament lamps. The honourable member must realise how important those countries are to Australia in the matter of trade, and it is a good thing for us that we are able to buy something fro m them in return for what they buy from us. I have already quoted in this House Tariff. [1 OCTOBER, 1931.] the figures relating to trade between tralia ancl most of the countries to which - the-honourable member referred. Japan buys from this country each year £12,571,000 worth of goods, while we buy from Iter goods to the value of only £4,282,000, leaving a balauce of trade in - favour of Australia of £8,289,000. Yet the honourable member objects to our buyiug from Japan filament lamps to the value of a few thousand pounds. Does he think that we should buy nothing from that country, and expect her to continue spending her money in Australia?",49
248,Mr LEWIS,AYES,"Why should we buy anything from her if we can make it here?  Economic Mission pointed out in its report, there is such a thing as attempting to do too much. It is obvious that Australia is trying to do too much when it endeavours to develop industries which require as much as 1,000 per cent, protection. Protection then becomes a burden upon the community. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to low-wage countries, but lie seems to overlook the fact that in Australia there are nearly 400,000 people who receive no wages at all, because they have no work. This foolish tariff policy which we have been pursuing has contributed largely to unemployment. In order to employ a few persons in some unprofitable industry, we impose a burden on the rest of the community, and increaseoverhead costs all round. It would pay us to buy these articles in a spirit of reciprocity from those countries which are such large purchasers of our primary produce. It amused me the other day to read in the newspapers fulsome accounts of a gathering of certain Ministers and other prominent persons on the wharf to speed the departure of a solitary ship laden with goods for the sister dominion of Canada. The departure of such ships ought to be a daily occurrence in the life of a nation 150 years old.",50
249,Mr MARTENS,AYES,"Why did not the verument which the honourable member supported do something to bring it about?  from the other side! It is indicative of the kind of the thinking which is responsible for Australia's present condition. We have had the best counsel obTariff. 409 Aus- tainable; we have been advised that we are on the wrong track, but have refused to heed the advice. There should be a thriving trade between Australia and other countries in both directions, trade which would provide employment for everybody. The honourable member for Newcastle mentioned Germany, We have a favourable trade balance with that country of nearly £7,500,000. What is wrong with our buying a few articles from her in 'order to ""show that we are not unsympathetic towards her in the matter of trade. With France we have a favourable trade balance of £11,000,000. Why should Ave not buy a feAvfilamentlamps from her to show that Ave are not unfriendly? Instead of doing this, however, AVO set ourselves out, to snub these people, and they are taking reprisals against us, so that Ave have now hardly an international friend in the world. The sooner Ave abandon these tiddly-winking enterprises, and concentrate on Australia's great natural industries, the sooner wi 11 Ave overcome our economic difficulties, and solve the unemployment problem. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) seems to be obsessed Will the idea that he is going to develop all sorts of Australian manufactures. In the face of all his preA'ious failures, he persists in trying to build up exotic industries at the expense of certain sections of the community. I trust that the people will shortly begin to see on which side their bread is buttered. The Government, Will the help of its brutal majority, is forcing these items through, but I hope that the people, and particularly the unemployed, Avill take counsel Will themselves, and see that the fiscal policy of the country is altered. It is in their hands to do it I oppose the amendment moved by the Minister, and Avish to draw"" the attention of honourable members to the effect which these duties, if they become operative, are Go- likely to have on prices. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) said that the neAv duties Would probably make n difference of not more than 2d. a lamp. I have before me a price list shoAving the prices of Australian lamps before and after the last increaso in"" duty AVAS made. When the tariff was last amended, a duty of Is. per lb. was placed on British lamps, which had formerly been admitted free, and almost immediately the retail price was, in most cases, increased by considerably more than 2d. A lamp that previously sold at 2s. 9d. went up to 3s.; another which sold at 2s. lOd. went up to 3s. 3d.; while still another, which sold at 4s., went up to 4s. 6d. A better class of lamp, which sold at 5s. 6d., went up to 6s. 3d. The prices of high-powered lamps increased fromlis. 6d. to 13s. 3d.; from £1 9s. to £1 13s. 6d.; and from £2 l i £2 ISs. 9d. Judging by the dates which these price lists bear, it appears that the increased prices were due to the alteration made in the tariff in November, 1930. If the increased duty imposed at that time had such an important effect upon prices, it seems likely that there will be a further large increase as a result of the duties now sought to be imposed.",50

The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) complained that he had not received sufficient notice of this proposed duty.  to-night.",51
251,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,The resolution was moved in July of this year.  moved to-night.,51
252,Mr FORDE,AYES,The amendment merely incorporates something already in the schedule.,51
253,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,"Yes , and the tariff schedule has been before the committee since July last. The honourable member  should not buy filament lamps from Japan. In 1927-28 we imported a total of 5,388,764 lamps, valued at £299,563; in 192S-29, the value of the lamps imported was £296,396, while in 1929-30, the value was £339,378. Most of the imported lamps came from Austria, the Netherlands and the .United States of America. The importations from other countries of the world amounted to £26,367. The company concerned made a request to the Tariff Board for a protective duty of 8s. per lb. British preferential, and 12s. per lb. intermediate and general. The Tariff Board thought those rates excessive, and recommended 2s. per lb. British preferential, and 4s. per lb. intermediate and general. The Minister has accepted that recommendation. On other occasions, the cry of certain members opposite has been that the Minister will not abide by the recommendation of s . to the Tariff Board. Now, when he adopts it, those honourable members are. still dissatisfied. The honourable member for  plained about the resultant cost of these duties to the man in the country. I ask what additional cost does the community have to bear as a result of the operation of the Paterson butter scheme, and of the sugar agreement. Is the honourable member, or his colleague, the honourable  pared to recommend the abolition of the 6d. per lb. impost on New Zealand butter introduced into Australia?  will have to cease, if the country is to regain stability.",51
254,Mr RIORDAN,AYES,"Apparentl y the honourable member is prepared to remove all protection to Australian industry, reintroduce black labour to our sugar fields, and Chinese labour on our wheat fields. He is not prepared to pay the price for the development of the nation along really White Australia lines, but evidently desires that we should retrogress to the coolie labour standard. When this Government endeavoured to help the wheat farmers by granting a guarantee of 4s. per bushel on their product, the honourable member's friends in another place rejected the scheme. No doubt, when that other place has this tariff schedule before it for consideration it will endeavour to nullify the Government's attempts to grant protection to Australian industry. In this case, the exorbitant request of the company has been rejected, and the recommendation of the Tariff Board approved. Honourable members of the Country party are adopting stone-walling tactics to impede the progress of the tariff. In every sense of the word, they are an "" Opposition"" party, and, if they continue their present tactics, they wili remain long in toe cold shades of opposition.",51
255,Mr GDILJSTT,AYES,"Henty) [9.34] - I propose to support the Government in this matter. Throughout the tariff debate I have made it quite clear that my objection to the large number of items to which I found myself opposed was in uo sense the conventional objection of an opposition. I have objected to item after item ou the ground that the duties proposed were absolutely prohibitive, and were encouraging the establishment of monopolies in Australia. In that I have been quite consistent. There have been other grounds of objection, for instance, the extent to which the Minister has acted arbitrarily ancl without reference - to the Tariff Board. Under the Customs Tariff 1921-1928, these lamps were free British preferential, and 2s. per lb. intermediate and general. By tariff proposals introduced into Parliament on the 5th November, 1930, the rates of duty were amended to Is., 3s., and 3s. The Australian manufacturers requested that a specific duty should be imposed on each bulb amounting to 9d. on bulbs not exceeding S watts, is. Gd. on those exceeding 8 watts, but not exceeding 65 watts, and 2s. on each bulb exceeding 65 watts. I understand rhai: since making that request the company has had the impudence to ask for a duly of 4s., 8s., and 8s. per lb. The recommendation of the Tariff Board halves that by 50 per cent. I am always pleased, when I can, to ' support the Tariff Board, which was set up to make recommendations for the guidance of Parliament. It does not follow that the Government or Parliament should necessarily accept those recommendations, but I am pleased when I am able to approve them, as in this case. There are one or two features of this industry that do not particularly commend themselves to me. There is the fact that the industry is importing the great bulk of its 'raw material. It is, in a sense, the Ford works over again; mainly an assembly works. One can only hope that it will develop into positive manufacture from Australian raw material at a comparatively early date. Another feature is that we are setting up a single protected company that is to supply the whole requirements of the Australian market. Had the duties recommended by the Tariff Board been prohibitive I should, on that ground, have opposed them. However, in the opinion of the board, the duties are not prohibitive, and will not exclude all competition. I am, therefore, pleased that as the Minister has, for once in a while, brought down a duty based upon the recommendation of. the Tariff Board, I shall be able to associate myself with him and vote for the item. [Quorum formed.] Mr AECHDALE"" PARKHILL (Warringah) [9.40] - I , like other honourable members who have spoken to this item, am not averse to the establishment of Australian, industries. But I have always held that another section, the general public, the great body of consumers, have also to be considered. Before this item is passed, this committee should consider whether the interests of the consumer are being conserved. This morning I received a communication, together with a specimen lamp that is made in Belgium and sold in Australia at Is. I produce it, together with an Australian lamp of similar' capacity, which is sold for 2s. 6d. Honourable members should realise that in. imposing these duties, in an endeavour to establish the industry iii Australia, they are mulcting the general public of an additional Is. 6d. for each electric light bulb that is purchased. The Tariff Board has pointed out that if the industry is successfully established, and is able to capture the total Australian market, it will employ 267 female adults, 50 male adults, and 3 male juniors. To provide work for those 320 persons, of whom 267 are females, the Government proposes to impose upon the members of the general public an additional Is. 6d. for each electric, light bulb that they buy. The Tariff Board points out that "" all the materials, except alcohol, solder and the gas for gasfilled lamps will be imported, and that of the materials for a vacuum lamp, approximately 95 per cent, will be imported "". That is the type of industry that the public is being asked to pay so much to establish. This Parliament has no right to impose such a heavy disability upon the general community in order to assist what is merely an assembling factory. I protest against the proposal, and I shall continue-to do so in this and every other place. This imposition is a monstrous outrage upon the general public.",52
256,Mr MARRS,AYES,"Wentworth) [9.44] - It is quite clear that the committee is going to approve of the Minister's amendment to impose a duty of 2s. per lb. British preferential and 4s. intermediate and general, on these lamps. A perusal of the Tariff Board's report in this matter makes it evident that the recommendation of the board is based upon an intense investigation. A considerable volume of evidence was taken, and the board rejected the request of the company for a much higher rate of duty than that recommended. The report of the Tariff Board shows that that body desired to protect the public. It points out that large numbers of the people were buying lamps at Is. each, and obtaining satisfaction from them. It also shows clearly that the distributing costs of the Australian companies are far too high. That is a matter which Australian manufacturers will have to consider in the future if they are to receive assistance from this Parliament. paragraph 3 of page 10 of its report, the Tariff Board statesThe board can see no justification for the maintenance of such prices either under existing conditions or if the lamps are made in Australia. Paragraph 6 readsThe board is of the opinion that no duty should be imposed that will assist in maintaining such a costly system of distribution with resultant selling prices. It would appear that the costs of distribution, rather than the duties, are the principal reason for the high prices charged for these articles. Mr RiOEDAjf - The company had to perfect its organization.",53
257,Mr MARRS,AYES,"The lamps of the associated companies are sold at the same prices throughout Australia, and that probably has something to do with the high cost of distribution. Nevertheless, the company would do well to heed the hint given by the Tariff Board in its report. I am pleased that the Minister has adopted the board's report in this instance.",53
258,Mr WHITE,AYES,"Balaclava) [9.47] - On other occasions I have protested against the f u t i l it y of this tariff debate. Knowing that it has a majority in favour of its proposals, the Government pays little or no heed to what is said in opposition to them. However, I feel disposed to support the duties in this instance, as I have supported other duties which I have thought to be fair. On the other hand, I have not hesitated to oppose duties which I have regarded as prohibition masquerading as protection. In this instance, the Government has followed the report of the Tariff Board, and, partly for that reason, I feel that I can support the duties; but I should like the Minister to say how many hands the company employs or will employ as a result of these duties, the estimated loss to the Commonwealth in customs duties because of the establishment and growth of the Australian industry, the amount of discount off the retail prices proposed to be given to public and semi-public bodies, and whether the £450,000 capital of the company is its paid-up capital, or only its nominal capital. I should also like him to say whether the selling methods of In the company and its distribution charges meet with his approval. Amendment agreed to. (E ) Wireless receivers and parts.",53

The amendment proposes to make alterations to paragraphs 12, 17 and 26. The amendment to paragraph .12, dealing with fixed resistances, is made.solely for departmental convenience. It does not affect the rates, and is made'merely with the object of making the-in ten tion of the paragraph ""-clear. The paragraph in the resolution of 26th March, 1931, read, "" Grid leaks."" Grid leaks are fixed resistances used in wireless receiving sets and placed in the grid circuit of a valve. Although their resistance values vary, they are generally of 2 megohms or larger, although in some instances they may go as low as one-tenth megohm. The department has been classifying all - fixed resistances of 2 megohms and over as grid leaks under this paragraph, and resistances of less than 2 megohms under paragraph 24 as wireless parts n.e.i. This amendment confirms the departmental practice, and places the classification on a more secure ground. Paragraph 17 deals with loud speakers and parts thereof. Loud speakers being manufactured in Australia least two firms-Amalgamated (Australasia) Limited, and Eclipse Proprietary Limited-and in order prevent the importation of loud speaker parts and their assembly into loud speakers in Australia it is necesfixed sary to impose fixed rate duties on the principal parts of loud speakers. result of inquiries made into the f.o.b. prices of comparable loud .speakers from the United States of America, it is found that-the rate of 12s. 6d. per loud speaker approximates the ad valorem equivalent of 90 per cent, at the highest. These portations were almost solely from the United States of America. The sity for such high rates becomes apparent Mr Forde. . when it is known that the commencement of the wireless season in Australia coincides with the completion of the American season. As models in wireless change from year to year, the surplus stock at the end of the season is disposed of at less than manufacturing cost. It. is the usual practice for the American manufacturers, to sell such surplus wireless goods at list price less 80 per cent. Sales are made on the local market as well as to overseas buyers, and consequently no action can be taken under the Industries Preservation Act to apply the dumping duties. It , therefore, becomes necessary to impose substantial duties on all wireless receivers and parts thereof in order to conserve the Australian market for local manufacturers. This principle was recognized by the Tariff Board in recommending increased duties oh other wireless receiving set parts. The ad valorem rates on parts n.e.i. in 180 E 17 b 6 have been reduced from 50 per cent. B r it is h ; 55 per cent, intermediate; 65 per cent, general; to 35 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent, respectively, which are the alternative ad valorem rates ou all other wireless parts. One firm estimates that if the protection is granted it will irr-.wi the employment of 100 operatives. The amendment to paragraph 26, which deals with combined wireless receiving sets and"" gramophones, is proposed in order to rectify an anomaly, it has been found that the ad valorem rates on the combined wireless are receiving sets and gramophones were by at not equal to the fixed rates on wireWireless less receiving sets. It was, therefore, Radio possible to incorporate a cheap gramoto phone motor equipment, worth possibly only a few shillings, in a high-class wirecomplete less receiving set, aud thus evade the rate duties on wireless receiving sets. Importers at present cannot take advanAs a tage of the position as the importation of both wireless receiving sets and combined wireless receiving sets and gramophones is prohibited; but there is no doubt that immediately the prohibitions were lifted advantage would be taken of the anomaly imand, therefore, the rates on the combinations have been increased to make the necesduty on them approximate the proportion to which their value bears to the value of plain wireless receiving sets. This subject has been carefully inquired into by the Tariff Board, whose recommendations have, in the main, been accepted. There is a prohibition against the importation of wireless sets, practically all of which come from the United States of America.",53
260,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,Is it proposed to remove that prohibition?,56
261,Mr FORDE,AYES,No . The duty is being altered to comply with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Since the prohibition was imposed some hundreds of workers have been employed in making wireless sets in Australia. The prohibition was necessary in order to rectify our adverse trade balance with the United States of America.,56
262,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"Kooyong) [9.58] The proposals which the Government placed before Parliament prior to the amendment outlined by the Minister were submitted on the 19th June last. Notwithstanding that since that date the Government has had ample opportunities to submit amendments in time to enable honourable members to consider them, the committee is asked this evening to accept this item, subject to an amendment now moved by the Minister, the significance and effect of which, I feel sure, few members understand. The Government's action in this instance is only in keeping with its attitude throughout this debate. I do not propose to discuss this item, because any discussion of the tariff in this chamber is useless. The Government does not give members a fair opportunity of understanding the significance of its proposals; in many cases the Minister has not condescended to submit either facts or argument in support of his proposal. The supporters of the Government take so little interest in the debate that few of them are to' be seen in the chamber. The Government has submitted a programme for the completion of the debate on the tariff which makes adequate discussion absolutely impossible. On behalf of the Opposition, I uow make it clear that we on this side consider it futile to continue this general debate. The tariff will go to another place, where there will be an opportunity to change some of the Government's prop.osals. There is absolutely no prospect of altering them in this chamber, because in tariff matters this is not a deliberative assembly. Accordingly, the Opposition does not propose to waste time and effort in a useless discussion. A number of honourable members on this side who desire to express the strong opinions which they hold upon certain items, will express those opinions, but will reserve their protests to the balance of the tariff. Subject to those expressions of opinion we intend not to do anything to prevent the Senate from dealing with the tariff as soon as possible. We realise that although liberty of action is supposed to be allowed on both sides in this tariff debate, government supporters are not permitted to exercise that privilege. Many honourable members on this side regard the Government's proposals as prohibitive instead of protective in their incidence, but the tariff is the responsibility of the Government, and, subject to the limitations which I have indicated, the Opposition does not propose to take part in prolonging what has become a parliamentary farce.",56
263,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"Cowper) [10.2] I desire also to say a few words with regard to the conduct of this debate and the attitude of the party which I have the honour to lead in relation to it. Last night the Ministei' was good enough to state in a letter to me what he thought should be the programme for this and the next two or three weeks. The honourable gentleman advised me that it was proposed to finish the tariff debate within three sitting weeks, including the present week. I have carefully considered the matter, and after examining the schedule, I find that if we are to complete the business within the time allotted by the Minister it will be necessary each day to dispose of at the very least seventeen items, many of which are of great importance. I honestly believe that it is physically impossible for honourable members to accomplish that task in a thorough and satisfactory manner. Consequently, especially after today, when the Minister, without previously informing the committee, introduced two fresh proposals foT higher duties and another to amend existing duties, I feel that it is absolutely futile and hopeless to continue this discussion. In the divisiou on the first item in the schedule, the Government was beaten by one vote. We may assume that government supporters, like honourable members on this side, were then free to exercise their own judgment in relation to its tariff proposals, but then the Labour party has been regimented and severely disciplined with the result that the Government has not again been in a minority. In the circumstances, I. contend that the right thing to do is to send this tariff to another place where it will be dealt with. We shall then he able to see what items are worthy of discussion, and whether we in this Parliament have any practical chance of alterations in this tariff, leaving the main issue to the next Parliament after an aj>peal to the people. To indicate how cavalierly the Government is treating this debate, I have only to remind the committee that, at one stage to-night, it was impossible to obtain a quorum from the Governmeut side of the House, and the chairman was obliged to report to the House, when a quorum was obtained.",56
264,Mr FORDE,AYES,There was only one member of the Opposition present when the bells were rung to form a quorum.,57
265,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"That was because we wished to test the sincerity of ihe Government and its supporters. The absence of a quorum on that occasion showed clearly that government supporters were not sufficiently interested in the proceedings to give the Minister the necessary numbers to carry on the discussion, or even to stay in Canberra.",57
266,Mr LEWIS,AYES,"I rise to a point of order. I wish to have your ruling, Mr Chairman, as to the relevancy of the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). Apparently, we are to listen to a lecture upon the sin3 and shortcomings of the Government and its supporters. I submit that what the right honourable gentleman has said is not relevant to the item under discussion.",57
267,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"Mr MCGRATH) I have allowed the leaders of responsible parties to make what is undoubtedly an important announcement with regard to the debate on the tariff, but I cannot permit a general discussion upon this aspect of the. question. I , therefore, ask the Leader of the Country party to be as brief as possible.",57
268,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I thank you for your ruling, Mr Chairman Mr C. RILEY - I rise to order. since I respectfully submit that it is not in order for any honourable member, whether he be a leader or deputy leader of a party, to engage in a general discussion on the tariff at this stage.",57
269,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"I have already ruled that the right horiorable gentleman is in order. I have allowed honourable members on both sides, during the tariff debate, to make incidental references to items other than the one under discussion. Mr C. RILEY - Nevertheless , I submit that it is not in order for an honourable member, except by leave of the committee, to make a general statement, when we are dealing with a particular item.",57
270,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"I have already ruled that, as an act of courtesy to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party, such statements may be made. Mr C. RILEY - It is not a question of courtesy, but of adherence to the Standing Orders.",57
271,Dr EARLE PAGE,AYES,"I have already stated why, in connection with this particular item, it is not my intention to further prolong the debate. Honourable members of the party which I lead in this chamber, have endeavoured to keep to the Minister's schedule for the tariff debate. There has been no unnecessary discussion upon any subject, and even upon those items concerning which we might have said a good deal, we allowed a vote to be taken with as little delay as possible. I am prepared to assist the Minister, in every way possible, to get the schedule to the Senate, where alone effective action can be taken and early redress secured for the people. There are still a few items upon which some honourable members of the Country party wish to speak; but we will give all reasonable assistance to the Minister to-night, and tomorrow, I trust, we shall dispose of the entire schedule so that the Minister may make the necessary arrangements for its presentation to the Senate.",57
272,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.8] - I wish to avoid a wrong impression which might be created by the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). Prom what has been said by those lionorable gentlemen, some people may be led to believe that honourable members have not had reasonable time for the discussion of the tariff. As a matter of fact, this is the eleventh sitting week during which the schedule has been debated, and there will be three full weeks after this week, or a total of fourteen weeks set apart for the consideration of the tariff. No attempt has been made to curtail debate up to the present time. I do not think that the gag has been moved upon any item.",58
273,Mr GULLETT,AYES,But it is indicated now.,58
274,Mr FORDE,AYES,"No , it is not. I remind honourable members opposite that the leaders of their party in another place asked the Government to give a guarantee that the tariff would be sent to the Senate before the 1st November. They expressed the fear that they might not have an opportunity to discuss it until some time next year. The same request was made by the Opposition leaders in this House, and now, when the Government is doing everything possible to expedite the debate in this chamber so as to honour the promise given by the Prime Minister, that it would be sent to. the Senate not later than the 1st November, we are being charged with endeavouring to rush it through. Honourable members must admit that there has been ample time for the discussion of the various items, and that frequently considerable time has been patient. occupied in useless discussion upon some items of not very great importance. feel sure that, with some orgauization within our own ranks, all those items 'which arc of importance to individual members, can be fully discussed and dealt with. Constructive and helpful critithe same lines. cism will always be welcomed, and will receive the fullest consideration at the hands of the Government. I am certain that if a spirit of sweet reasonableness displayed, we shall be able to dispose the tariff within the time allotted to because, as I have stated, there will three full sitting weeks after this,",58
275,Mr GULLETT,AYES,"Henty) [10.10] Following upon the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde), I want to make it plain that the attitude which the Opposition has decided to adopt is due not altogether to the Minister rushing or failing to rush the tariff, but to its objection to his method of making the tariff and presenting it. Mr C. RILEY - Is the honourable member in order in further prolonging a general discussion, which I submit has been quite out of order from the commencement?",58
276,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"Mr MCGRATH) The honourable member is in order in making an incidental reference, but I ask him to be brief.",58
277,Mr GULLETT,AYES,"I merely wish to state reasons why I am not prepared from now on to discuss the items of this schedule as they come before the committee. I may break that rule, however, in regard to two or three items. I decline to proceed any further with this general debate, because the Minister, since he has assumed the office that he now holds, has broken every recognized rule on tariff presentation; He has built up this tariff without proper consideration by himself or by the officers of the Trade and Customs Department, and without consultation with the Tariff Board. Indeed, he has entirely changed the whole nature of protection in this country from wellconsidered tariff-making to absolutely prohibitive tariff-making - * Mr C. RILEY - Mr MCGRATH",58
278,Mr GULLETT,AYES,I am finishing. Mr C. RILEY - I should like to know just how long the committee is to remain,58
279,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,The remarks of I the honourable member for Henty have been quite in order. I understand that he does not intend to proceed further. Mr 0. RILEY - Eac h member of the committee will be entitled to follow on,58
280,Mr GULLETT,AYES,"I shall not discuss the item further because, although it isone of the most comprehensive and comis plex in the schedule, the Minister has, of not deigned to give the committee a single it, reason for including it. He depends on be the party Whip and ou the solid party week. discipline which he has been able to exercise over his followers. This is tariffapprehension making without precedent, and, with a few exceptions, I decline to take any further part in it.",58
281,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [10.13] - It is evident that honorAustralian able members of the Opposition decided to adopt different tactics in regard to the consideration of these items."" They realise that it is futile to raise frivolous objections to individual items, and that it is better that reasonable sideration should be given to the respecrate tive items or groups of items.",59
282,Mr GULLETT,AYES,The honourable member has not spent half-an-hour in the chamber while the tariff debate has been under consideration.,59
283,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"The honourable it member is not accurate in saying that. unwise. I am familiar with the items of the tariff, and so are other Ministers. We have afforded honourable members of the tariff Opposition every opportunity to discuss the items, even to the extent of lizing, if they so desire it, practically the whole of the time of the committee.",59
284,Mr MARR,AYES,But the Government takes no notice of what is said.,59
285,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"There is no justishould fication for that statement. schedules were very fully considered by the Minister,- by the department, and the Cabinet sub-Committee before they were brought in.",59
286,Mr GULLETT,AYES,There were hundreds items to which consideration had to given.,59
287,Mr THEODORE,AYES,It is true that there were many items to be considered.,59
288,Mr GULLETT,AYES,And quite a of schedules.,59
289,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"The number of schedules is evidence of the consideration sound ? the Goverument has given to the need for bringing in .a workable and reasonable protective policy for Australia. Honorgeneral able members opposite are apparently satisfied with the Government's tariff policy; but, although they are at perfect liberty to criticize, or even denounce it, they wish to do so, they have no right question the motives of the Government office. in formulating that policy, in bringing it before the committee, and in supporting it in this chamber. There can be no mis-. in regard to the attitude but of the Government towards the tariff. It has always declared its intention to protect Australian industries effectively.",59
290,Mr GULLETT,AYES,Since when has the Labour Party stood for the have now creation of monopolies?,59
291,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"The honourable member seems to be annoyed because the Government is giving effect to its policy. We all recognize that a tariff policy, conwhether it means high protection, modeprotection, or no protection for the industries of the country, is open to criticism and objection. There are always in every community those who support a high protective policy and others who denounce it ; those who think a wise policy, and those who think it This Government has no qualms with regard to its policy. It believes in the need for a high protective to establish Australian industries.",59
292,Mr GULLETT,AYES,"The Government has monopocertainly "" established "" them.",59
293,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"We have endeavoured to carry out our policy in that respect; it remains yet to be seen whether it will be successful or otherwise. If it is not fully successful there be a thoroughly impartial and The practical consideration of the way in by which it has worked. No government worth its salt would stand hard and fast to a policy if it were found necessary to modify it, but honourable memof bers opposite are denouncing this be schedule and questioning the motives of the Government in formulating it, without giving an opportunity to the Govern""rnent or to the country to see whether number the policy is sound ornot.",59
294,Mr GULLETT,AYES,Does the honourable member think that it will prove to be,59
295,Mr THEODORE,AYES,It gives every promise of it. As an illustration of the effect of the whole policy of high disprotection let us see what has happened in the case of agricultural implements.,59
296,Mr WHITE,AYES,The manufacture of if agricultural implements was established to in Australia before this Government took,59
297,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"I am not claiming for this Government the credit for having established the industry. What 1. arn saying is that the protective policy as applied to that industry has not done injury to Australia. On the contrary, it has enabled it to grow and become valuable to the country without any imposition on those who use the protected product of the agricultural implement factories.",59
298,Mr LATHAM,AYES,There - are many over here who agree with that. Of what use is ir to make that observation?,60
299,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"I am merely asking that there should be reasonable consideration of all the main items of the tariff from that point of view. There are some unreasonable critics who denounce every item in the schedule simply because it comes before the committee. In the case of agricultural implements, although there has been keen competition from overseas in that class of machinery, Australian manufacturers have turned out almost every description and kind of implement required on the farms at a price which compares well with the price paid by farmers even in free trade countries. Not only that",60
300,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"Havin g regard to your ruling, Mr MCGRATH, in the case of the right honorablo member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), I raise the point of order that it is not open to the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) to discuss the general protection policy upon this item.",60
301,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,I ask the Treasurer not to trespass upon the latitude I have already allowed to leaders in the committee.,60
302,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"The point has been raised whether we should proceed with a detailed discussion of these items, or whether the Opposition should surrender in the hope that another place will do the work that it should be doing in this committee. That attitude on the part of the Opposition is not justified. The responsibility is upon this committee to give detailed consideration to the tariff items, and honourable members opposite are not warranted in making statements amounting to misrepresentation about the attitude and policy of the Government on the ground that all their suggestions have not been accepted.",60
303,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AYES,Non e of them has been accepted.,60
304,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"That is not so; but even if it were so, on that ground alone the Opposition would not be warranted insurrendering the fort. Honourable members opposite are certainly not proceeding in a democratic way when they say, in effect, "" the interests of our constituents can go hang; we shall depend upon another place to get in our assassin's work on the tariff"". .",60
305,Mr ARCHDALE PARKIIILL,AYES,Why should the Treasurer grieve because we do not intend to discuss these items?,60
306,Mr THEODORE,AYES,"-I am not grievihg, but I do not intend to allow this cunning and pernicious propaganda to goout to the people unanswered. The Government is endeavouring to establish a tariff which will effectively protect Australian industries. We do not wish to bolster up uneconomic industries, or to shelter industries which have no proper place in Australia; but we invite honourable members to bend their minds to this tariff problem and to make reasonable suggestions. It is of no use the Opposition saying that this Government ignores the reports of the Tariff Board, because the reports of that body are always considered by a sub-committee of Cabinet. The board was not set .up,. nor was it recognized by our predecessors in office, as the final authority in regard to duties. It was set up as an investigating and recommending body, and its recommendations have always been respected, but not always acted upon either by this or any previous Government.",60
307,Mr MARRS,AYES,"Wentworth) [10.23] I should like to devote some time to the item before the Chair, but I find that an impossibility. Through the courtesy of the Government in sending, the members of all parties in this chamber a list of the items which have to be dealt with to-night, I find that there are nine items still to be discussed. In those circumstances, I cannot understand the statement, of the Minister that honourable members will be given ful l opportunity to discuss every item of the tariff. Since we have nine more items to consider tonight, I regret that I have no time to discuss the item now before the Chair.",60
308,Mr MARR,AYES,"Parkes) [10.24] - This item is one of the most important and complicated in the tariff schedule, and honourable members know little about it. I have, to the best of my ability, assisted the Government to pass the various tariif schedules which it has placed on the, table. It has a perfect right to introduce its own tariff policy, and, in my opinion, the. Opposition generally has assisted in effect to that policy. The Minister has read a long statement, which he did not understand, setting out further alterations to this item, and in fairness to the committee he should make a copy of it available so that, honourable members may understand the extent and effect of the amendment. The objection which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Latham) and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) have taken tonight has nothing to do with the time allotted for the discussion of the tariff. The Governmeut has uot curtailed the time of the committee at all.",61
309,Mr FOKUE,AYES,We have not applied the gag at any stage.,61
310,Mr MARR,AYES,"What we complain of that the Government has paid no heed our suggestions. The tariff is a purely non-party issue, and should be considered as such. Honourable members on this side are entitled, to make suggestions, and Minister should listen to them, and considers them reasonable, he should give effect to them. I trust that further i formation with respect to this item will be given the committee. Amendment agreed to.",61
311,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.28] - I move That a new sub-item (r.) lie inserted follows: ""By omitting the whole of sub-item (twice occurring) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item:And on and after the 2nd October, 1931180 {a) Storage batteries and parts thereof, viz.:(1) Storage batteries for wireless (2) Composition parts including containers for storage batteries for wireless receiving sets and for storage batteries suitable for use in motor cars otherwise than for propulsion purposes, per lb., British, 2d.; intermediate, 2jd.: general, 2id.; and ad val.', Britisli, 40 per cent.; intermediate, 47i per cent.; general, 00 giving per cent."". The changes proposed by this'amendment are (1) increase of 10 per cent, on storage batteries for motor cars used otherwise than for propulsion purposes; (2) increase of 15.per cent. British preferential tariff, 17-J per cent, intermediate tariff, and 20 per cent, general tariff, on electric storage radio batteries; (3) increase of 2d. British preferential tariff, 2Jd. intermediate tariff, and 2£d. general tariff, per pound on containers and composition parts of storage batteries. The increases have been made in accordance with a recommendation of the Tariff Board, and have been necessitated by the imposition of the revenue duty of 4d. per lb. on crude and reclaimed rubber. is The duty proposed on the containers and to composition parts has taken a different for m from that recommended by the Tariff Board, but the net result approximates the recommendation submitted by the the board. If anything, the rates which if he I have proposed on such goods are slightly lower than those recommended by n - the Tariff Board. The reason for proposing the cumulative rates on the containers and composition parts is to enable the specific rates to be dropped should the revenue duty on crude and reclaimed rubber be abolished at any time. It is not possible to apply the same proportion to as the increased duties on the storage batteries, consequently, a straight out ad (o> valorem rate is being imposed. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. item 181receiving sets and storage batteries suitable for use By omitting the whole of paragraph (2) in motor cars otherwise (twice occurring) of sub-item (A ) and insertthan for propulsion puring in its stead the following paragraph: poses, ad val., British 50 ""(2) Valves for Wireless Telegraphy and per cent.: intermediate, Telephony, ad val., British, 10 per 57£ per cent.; general, cent.: intermediate, 15 per cent.; 70 per cent. general, 20 per cent. And on and after 1st July, 1931(2) Valves for Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony, nd val., British, 274 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40 per cent.""",61
312,Mr FORDE,AYES,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.31] - I move That the item be amended by adding the following:-' And on and after the :H)th July, 1031(2) Valves for Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony, each, British, la.; intermediate, ' Is. Od.; general, 2s.; or ad val., British, 10 per cent.; intermediate, IB per cent.; general, 25 per cent.; whichever rate returns the higher duty. And on and after 1st January, 1932(2) Valves for Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony, each, British, Is. Od.; intermediate, 2s.; general, 2s. lid; or od val., British 20 per cent..; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40 per cunt.; Whichever rate return's the higher duty "". The reason for the amendment is to permit of the incorporation in the present proposals'of this item as set out in the tariff resolution of the 29th July, 1931. That resolution provided for an increase in the duty, and in order ' to make t i e legal position secure with regard to any duties which may have been collected under the resolution, its incorporation with the present proposal is necessary. The amendment makes no difference to the rates proposed under the July resolution. As I explained in July, the specifio rate of Is. British preferential, and 2s. general', each on wireless valves was proposed for the purpose of giving a decided preference to British valve makers. The rates under the 1921-30 tariff were of no advantage whatever to the British manufacturers as the ad valorem preferential rate of 10 per cent, returned the same amount of duty as 25 per cent, on Dutch valves under the general tariff, because of the fact that the f.o.b. price of the latter was considerably below that of the British article. The amended rates should ensure the collection of an additional £20,000 in revenue. The Government has carefully investigated the prices at which wireless valves are sold in Australia, and is satisfied that considerable disparity exists between the landed cost and the selling price to the public, parflOl ticularly in respect of foreign valves. In these circumstances there is no reason - why the Government should not levy a revenue duty, particularly as importers, by virtue of the exorbitant profits they are making, are well able to absorb the impost. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Items 182, 184, 185, 187, 190, 191,' 192, and 194 agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. FEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY: LABOUR CONDITIONS: UNEMPLOYME NT RELIEF . Motion (Mr Scullin ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",62
313,Mr WAR D,AYES,"East Sydney) [10.37] This afternoon, the'Minister for Home Affairs- (Mr Blakeley) assured me, in answer to a question, that award conditions are observed in connection with unemployment relief works in the Federal Capital Territory. Information which has been furnished to mo indicates that that is not correct. The award governing employment in the Territory providesEmployees shall be paid fortnightly during working hours not later in the week than Friday. When a workman is discharged from his employment he shall he paid forthwith, on the job, all wages due to him, and in the event of there being any delay in the making of such payment, the employee shall be paid all the time he is kept waiting at ordinary time rates. I am informed that sometimes men finish theiremployment on the Thursday, but have to come back next day to get their pay. Some of them live outside the city area and have to incur considerable expense for bus fares. The present practice is a violation of the award. Another provision relating to holiday pay is- ' Where at such times as Christmas,' Easter, or other holidays, works are by approved .arrangement closed down for longer periods than the ordinary holidays, men shall receive pay for the holidays occurring in such periods on the lines mentioned above, provided that they work on the day preceding the holidays and report on the day following the close of the period for which the works have heen. closed. I understand that at Easter, works.were closed down for' a period, and the men did not receive the pay to which they were entitled for the holidays. Monday next is Eight Hours Day, and I ask the Minister to look into this matter immediately, because I am informed that some works are already. closed down and men have been discharged. There is a possibility of a repetition of the practice adopted at Easter, by which workers were deprived of pay to which they were entitled under the award. I do nolknow that the Minister for Home Affairs is aware of the circumstances 1I have mentioned, but I ask him to investigate them immediately in order to ensure that the full provisions of the award are observed.",62
314,Mr BLAKEUEY,AYES,Will the honourable member give me concrete instances?,63
315,Mr WARD,AYES,"Yes . Mr E. GREEN (Richmond) [10.40]. - I referred during today's proceedings to three matters which the Minister for Homo Affairs (Mr Blakeley) had been evading. Two of them were most important, but the Minister spoke on the least important, namely, the £8,000 provided on the Estimates for the reconstruction of the Canbcrru-Goulburn road. No reply was made to the other two points raised by me, although I made specific charges against the Minister; but 1 realise that no effective reply could have been given by him.",63
316,Mr SOULIJN,AYES,"Is the honourable member now replying to something said by fhq Minister this afternoon? Mr R GREEN,- I am making certain Statements regarding the maladministration of the Department of Home Affairs. Mr Bi.AKEt.EY -=-=I take exception to that remark. It is most offensive to me; aiid I ask for its withdrawal.",63
