10,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Tuesday 7 January 1992, of Ian Alexander Christie Wood, Senator for the State of Queensland from 1949 to 1978, and places on record its appreciation of his public service. Ian Wood was born on 31 January 1901 at Mackay, Queensland. This remarkable gentleman devoted over 50 years of his life to public service in both local and Federal government. Ian's career in government began in his late twenties when he became an alderman. He then went on to become Mayor of Mackay, and was purported to be the youngest mayor in Australia at the time. He was elected Mayor of Mackay no less than five times, serving for 15 years in all. Other achievements in the area of local government included being elected President of the Australian Council of Local Government and President of the Queensland Local Government Association. His election in 1949 as a Liberal senator for HAWKE Queensland began a career in Federal politics which was to last almost 29 years until his retirement in 1978. During that time he served on several committees, the most notable the service being his chairmanship of the is Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Ian that Committee for over 20 years. His enormous contribution to the Committee remains a feature of his time in Federal Parliament. Ian also served as Temporary Chairman of Committees in the Senate for some 25 years few and acted as President of the Senate on several occasions in the unavoidable absence of the elected President. Ian will be remembered as a highly principled man who worked unstintingly for the people of Australia. His capacity to talk with at the grassroots level and his obvious deal honesty and integrity made him a popular choice with the people. His re-election at every poll until his retirement was evidence of this. Wood His ,time in the Senate was not always smooth sailing. Ian was known for his inand outspokenness and I am sure he caused his Party colleagues more than a few anxious moments as a result. Nonetheless, he fought for what he believed was right and was a worthy representative for the State of long and meritorious Queensland. In his last speech to the Senate he said, 'When all is said and done, it is the people whom we represent. If we understand what the people need, we will be successful'. Ian Alexander Christie Wood was successful. On behalf of the Government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his loved ones in their bereavement. I will just record the fact that I got to know him quite well in those years. His death is a blow to us all.",12
11,Dr HEWSON,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to second the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to celebrate the memory of Ian Wood who was a fine Queenslander, a distinguished senator and a long serving member of the Liberal Party of Australia. Ian Wood was something of a rebel and a non-conformist whose life reminds us of how politics has changed. He was elected in the 1949 Menzies landslide and he left Parliament 29 years later at the height of the Fraser era. He was a man of strong and unambiguous views who made few concessions to the changing - times. He never smoked or drank and refused to take a drivers licence. The distinguished senator, well into his se,venties, was a familiar sight cycling around hIS home town-something I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) would no doubt commend to us all. If some of his views now seem quaint, a few of them are particularly relevant. He noted way back in 1971 that the appointment of assistant Ministers-I trust the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) will forgive me for mentioning this-was just a ploy by the Prime Minister to expand his power base. I was particularly struck by an old pr-ss clipping which recorded the senator making a $500 donation to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) in recognition of the courageous attitude of the honourable member in standing up to the Government. There was only one problem with this: the honourable member for Franklin was attacking Senator Wood's own government at the time. If Ian Wood was sometimes the Liberal Party's resident rebel, he could also be a tactician of genius. In 1974 Prime Minister Gough Whitlam desperately needed to secure a majority in the Senate. Gough's brainwave was to appoint the DLP Senator Vince G-ir as Ambassador to Ireland so that SIX Queensland seats would be contested at the forthcoming Senate election. But Ian Wood was too smart for Gough Whitlam. Senator Wood turned out to be more familiar with constitutional law than did E.G. Whitlam, QC. He knew that if the Queensland Government issued its writs before Gair had resigned, Gair's seat would be filled as a casual vacancy by the Queensland Government and Labor would be denied the probability of a third Queensland senator. Senator Wood. immediately phoned the Queensland PremIer to urge him to issue the writs. There was only one problem: how to stop Senator Gair from resigning befor- the process was complete. This is where the teetotal Wood showed his true colours. He knew that Gair, a man who had just ratted on his Party, was feeling pretty lonely so he rang his fellow Queenslander, Senator Ron Maunsell, and had the affable Maunsell detain the gregarious Gair over beer and prawns in Maunsell's room. Hence, the legendary night of the long prawns which derailed Gough's plans to seize control of the Senate and ultimately led to the 1974 double dissolution election. I should also mention that for many years Senator Wood was Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Re-ulations .and Ordinances. The work of thIS CommIttee foreshadowed the establishment of the Senate committee system, which is now such an important part of our democratic accountability. Ian Wood was a man who fiercely defended his independence of mind, who consistent},Y lived up to his own values and who loved hIS State of Queensland. We remember him for those and many other qualities today. Senator Wood never married, but he had many friends and we extend our sympathy to all of them.",12
12,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I support the condolence motion before the House in respect of the death of former Senator Ian Wood and would like to add three other matters to the discussion. Firstly, Ian Wood was one of those people who served in local government both before and during their period in the Federal Parliament, and as such was akin to people such as the former member for Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter, who was a very determined and dedicated servant in the local government area for the Cloncurry township. In the same way, the late Ian Wood served as mayor and as a councillor for the Mackay area for a period alongside the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I think that local government experience in Queensland gave a certain definition and focus to his service in the Senate which prompted him to study those minutes, ordinances and regulations and led him on to his key role as Chainnan of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) points out correctly, he helped to lead the Senate down the path of extending and expanding its committee work. The second thing I would add is that, in many ways, Senator Ian Wood was ahead of his time in respect of building up the tourism industry of north Queensland and of the beautiful Mackay-Proserpine-Bowen area. Just two weeks ago, I had the privilege of travelling with the honourable member for Dawson from Mackay to the Abbot Point coal loading facility to the north and studying some of the tremendous facilities and resources of the and sugar industries and also the tourism industry along that section of the coast. Undeniably, former Senator Ian Wood saw the real potential of the Proserpine area, the Mackay area, the Whitsunday Passage and the islands. He set about doing something about it and I think we should commend and salute that aspect of his work. Finally, I mention that 21 years ago the good Senator Ian Wood saw fit to highlight the then controversial tour of Australia by a South African sporting team and to support that particular team. I am led to believe he had a foreknowledge and was well enough to understand that the South African cricket team was to arrive in Perth later this summer. It of course, now to play tomorrow night in Sydney in an historic match. I think it would be of some joy to former Senator Ian Wood to know that those issues of 21 years ago-when he took a particularly strong stand in relation to that controversial tour-have now gone the full circle and, indeed, that South African team sportsmen are in Australia at this time participating quite properly in the current World Cup cricket carnival. I commend this condolence motion to the House and I extend my sympathy and that of members of the National Party to his family and friends.",13
13,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONDOLENCES,"I wish to pay tribute today to a person who was a family friend, a fellow parliamentarian and somebody with whom I served on a local authority. Probably the sad part about his death is the fact that, although we talk about the visions and feelings he had for the family unit, they cannot now be reflected in his own family, because the death of Ian Wood was the end of a family. His mother, his sister and he were a very close unit and the sadness is really that there is no-one to carry on the legend that Ian Wood created. I give this tribute not only as a colleague in parliament but also on behalf of the citizens of Mackay and all Queenslanders. I also speak for the coalition because, whatever Ian Wood was, he was a coalitionist. He believed coal in those principles and fought for them. He was known as the cycling senator. One of the ironies of his contribution to this place is that in I think 1963 he opposed the then Government's proposal to increase sales tax on motor vehicles. As a result of that he was known in Mackay as the cycling senator. But he was prepared to stick up for principles and, as somebody said-and particularly on that issue-he was always a bit of a pinprick in the side of the Government. Of course, the people who do that are never destined to take ministerial leather and his lot in life was to be a backbencher. But he did make a great contribution through the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, is, where he established some type of landmark which went from Australia right across the Westminster system. Ian Wood was elected in 1949. I understand that the only surviving Senate forty-niner is John Gorton, so we are seeing the passing of an era. In public administration, Ian Wood was an aldennan at the age of 26, mayor at the age of 29, President of the Queensland Local Government Association for six years and also of the Australian Local Government Association. He served on the Mackay Port Authority and was present to open Mackay's first airport in 1930. I believe it would have given him some sense of satisfaction to be present when the new airport was opened last year. He played his part as a parliamentarian, in public administration and also in business. What is remarkable is that he performed these three functions all together. Ian Wood was always interested in Mackay. He promoted tourism when it was a word that nobody else knew. As a result, the Whitsundays, Mackay and surrounding areas became known _on the national and international calendar. He thought very much of Mackay. He used to describe it as the sweetest city in Australia, no doubt reflecting not only on the sugar industry but also on the manner in which Mackay presented itself to the rest of Australia. His interests included the sugar industry, the coal industry and the arts. Out of his own purse he sponsored many artists to come to Mackay. One of his last testimonies to the city was parkland given in his mother's name, the Annie Wood Gardens. He participated in his travel agency until just before he was hospitalised prior to his death. He took an active interest all the way through. Ian Wood was born a Presbyterian and died a Presbyterian. That might be the mark and the calibre of his stubbornness and the principles that he adopted through life. It is sad to reflect that, for his nearly 91-year contribution to this Parliament and to Australia, he was never officially recognised for an Imperial or an Australian award. Just 17 days before the Australia Day announcement that he had been awarded the Australia Medal for member of the General Division, he died. I believe that before that medal is announced there must be the approval of the individual who is to receive it, so perhaps he had the satisfaction of knowing that he had been so rewarded. It could be claimed that, being Mackay born, he was the most successful of the sons that it has reared. While his memory will live on here, there is no public memorial to him in the city of Mackay or the State of Queensland. But his memory will remain in the archives of this Parliament, in the archives of the local government that he served so well and also in the minds of those of us who knew him. To us all, he remains a person who had great ability, great vision for the State and the nation, and great integrity.",14
14,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to add a few words in commendation and memory of a great Australian. I knew Ian Wood in many ways. I knew him perhaps first when I visited Mackay as Minister for Social Services to open a Presbyterian aged persons home. I had known him vaguely in this place, but until that date I had not realised the tremendous effect and impact that his service in local government had had on the development of Mackay. Mackay is a beautiful city in north Queensland. It is a community that owes a great deal to Ian Wood, for there he served not only as a senator but, as has been recorded, as mayor over many years. In every way he was a great contributor to the people and to the place. In this place I came to know him through his membership and long term chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. One of the problems of this place-and we are all beset with it-is the product of time. There is so little opportunity to go through the actual nuance of each of the details of legislation that passes through this or the other chamber, and even less time to pursue the regulations. It was through the work of Ian Wood, Reg Wright and one or two other noble souls in the Senate that it began to be apparent that we were far too casual in the way in which we adopted regulations and legislation-that is, policy aside, without regard to the impact on individuals in the community of the words of those regulations and ordinances. In that sphere, I think Ian Wood played an outstanding role-one which I am pleased to see has been continued to the present day. I would like to pay particular tribute to the way in which he pioneered that work on behalf of the interests of humanity and the rights of Ofdinary Australians in ensuring that legislation did say what was intended. I now talk about Ian as a man. He was a cyclist, a bachelor and a strange individual in so many ways. Yet when one got to know him, one found he was rich, living and a great contributor. As those who preceded me mentioned, he was certainly a pioneer of tourism in north Queensland. His own travel agency, which he maintained throughout the period during which he served in local government and in the Senate, was one which I am sure attracted many of the early visitors to north Queensland. Of course, this was long before north Queensland became a favourite destination. Ian Wood contributed much to the growth of interest in and understanding of north Queensland. I commend him for that. Above all, I commend him as a friend, as a fine Australian, as a wonderful contributor and a man whose memory I admire. His loss should be felt by all Australians.",15
15,Mr SCHOLES,CONDOLENCES,"I want to pay tribute very briefly to former Senator Ian Wood. I knew him for some time. He was one of the characters in this Parliament for the first 10 years or so that I was here. In 1974 I had the privilege of leading a delegation in which he took part. He was a person of independent spirit and a person who contributed in that way. There are legends about Ian, some true and some untrue. It was suggested that he was the person who made Justin O'Byrne President of the Senate. This was vehemently denied by Ian himself but someone on the other side of the Parliament certainly did. My view of history is different from that of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) because I think the credit for the debacle with respect to Gair belongs to Lionel Murphy, not Gough Whitlam. Those who were here at the time would be aware of that, especially if they are on the Labor side of politics. I think the credit for the constitutional wisdom belongs to Odgers rather than to Ian Wood, although Ian Wood was the person who seized on and understood the impOltance of what he was being told. Ian Wood was one of those people who served in this Parliament for a long period. He served well enough to justify re-election on every occasion on which he sought re-election. That in itself is a tribute because it is necessary, if one is going to be a senator under the proportional system or a member in this place, that those people who choose candidates-who decide who will and will not continue-are satisfied with the performance of the person concerned. Ian Wood obviously was a legend in Mackay and justly so. I pay tribute to him. I am just sorry that he does not have anyone to whom we can convey those condolences. '",16
16,Mr JULL,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to associate myself with this condolence motion, albeit briefly. As we have heard, Ian Wood was a most remarkable man. He in fact had very little formal education and left school at the age of 12 to support his mother. For a man with that limited education, he certainly had tremendous vision. We have heard reference today to his association with the development of aviation and tourism in north Queensland. That is very true. He was one of the leading proponents of aviation for the more remote areas of Australia. In 1929, as my colleague has said, as Mayor of Mackay, he opened the first Mackay airport. I last spoke to Ian Wood last year with the opening of the new Mackay terminal. He was still quite lucid for his 91 years and was absolutely delighted that at last Mackay had a decent facility to welcome what he hoped would be international services into that city in the not too distant future. May I also say that Ian Wood should never be underestimated in terms of his development of the Whitsunday islands. Not many people know that he was a confidant of the late Sir Reginald Ansett. It was on the advice of Ian Wood that Ansett bought Hayman Island when it was first developed as a major tourism resort in that particular district. He had at heart the interests of all Queensland, but he had a special place for the Whitsundays, which he often described to me as the most magnificent destination in the world. I am sure that I speak on behalf of not only my Liberal Party colleagues from Queensland, but also many hundreds of people within the tourism industry who would like to pay their respects to Ian Wood, a truly remarkable man.",16
17,Mrs SULLIVAN,CONDOLENCES,"I do not wish to cover the ground that has been covered by so many other speakers today in paying tribute to Ian Wood. I did, of course, serve in the Senate with him as a Queensland senator, as did the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), although he was not a senator for Queensland. I think I knew Ian Wood better than most people here, including those who served with him. I was very saddened to hear oflan's death, although in a sense it was no surprise. I was curious about the fact that I had not received my annual Christmas card from him with its annual homily to me about what the Liberal Party should be doing in Canberra. I worked very closely with Ian Wood for the time that our terms in the Senate overlapped. The great tribute and monument to Ian will always be the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, into which he put so much of himself. I might say that Ian never understood why I chose to transfer to the House of Representatives. When I rang him every January, as was my wont, although I was a bit late this year, I used to get a little lecture about how I had done the wrong thing, that the Senate really was the place to be. But it is horses for courses, and I could never convince him of the wisdom of, and the reasons for, my decision. I want to say very briefly to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that Ian Wood would not have been pleased to be paid the so-called compliment today of taking credit for the election of Justin O'Byrne to the presidency of the Senate. I have my own affection for Justin O'Byrne, who was a very good senator in his own way, but that is an action that I know Ian Wood did not take, despite his views of the personalities at that time. The interesting thing about Ian is that he was Senator Wood until his death. He gave many years to the Senate and to public life. Whenever I would ring him at his travel agency in Mackay, where he worked until close to his death, his staff still referred to him as Senator Wood. Everyone in Mackay still called him Senator Wood. He was seen almost as the epitome of a senator. I think he deserved that because he contributed so much to that parliamentary institution. I, too, feel the sadness concerning somebody who dies without surviving family, but I think the reactions of many people at the funeral, and particularly those he worked with and those who worked for him, showed that in his own way Ian had built up his own family. His passing certainly was cause for grief for a number and a feeling of a sense of loss for many Queenslanders. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Former Senator Geoffrey Thomas MCLaren",16
18,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on 30 January of Mr Geoffrey Thomas MCLaren, a former senator. Geoff MCLaren represented the State of South Australia from 1971 to 1983.

Yet the stock market crash of 1987 was greater than that of 1929, and there was an expectation we could come out of it and that we could do so without much damage to product or to employment.

Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, the wording used by the honourable member for Parramatta clearly breaches standing order 144(b), where secondly occurring, which relates to announcing the Government's policy. He is specifically asking for that in the context of the forthcoming economic statement. The honourable member for Parramatta should be asked to rephrase that question accordingly.",19
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Would the honourable member for Parramatta like to rephrase his question?,19
51,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Resulting from his consultations with the Australian community, are any measures being considered so far as the economic statement is concerned? Mr MCGauran-It is the same question.",19
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,19
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The purpose of the statement is twofold: to induce a recovery and to increase employment, to produce jobs in Australia-to produce an economic statement which focuses not just simply upon recovery and jobs but at the same time underlines and improves the long term productive basis of the economy. The consultations that the Government, I and other Ministers had were very useful and some specific things did emerge from them. As a result we saw the business community, trade unions, community organisations, the States and Territories, and it was of value. I must say that the Leader of the Opposition would have no truck with talking to the business community. Under the headline 'Hewson bags business chiefs', an article said: Dr Hewson condemned Mr Keating's consultative program, which moves to Sydney next week, and accused the Government of not understanding the economic problem. 'And you aren't going to understand it by talking to a few business leaders and a few Labor leaders in plush Government offices in Victoria'. That was his view of it. Then Mr Kroger, Mr Kennett's campaign director, was reported as follows: 'Employer organisations have been condemned for failing to support and promote the policies of the Coalition. ' Mr Kroger accused some groups of sitting on the fence when the interests of their members demanded they back the Coalition against the union-dominated ALP. They were not seeking to induce a recovery, to lift the profit of their business and their employment; they were sitting on the political fence. The article continued: 'I think some employer organisations have lost credibility in the community by merging their own views with the views of Labor governments of the day'. His attack, made in an interview with the Australian, exposes deep dissatisfaction at senior levels of the organisational and parliamentary Liberal Party with the key role business groups have played in the political and economic debate. Then follows the earlier attack by the Leader of the Opposition. In terms of other paranoia, Mr Andrew Robh, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, attacked the business community for failing to put sufficient pressure on the Prime Minister. He said: They cannot agree that they articulate the interests of the wealth creators if, in fact, they envelop themselves in the bosom of socialism. Mr Downer-This is part of the visionary statement, is it? This is the Keating vision, is it?",19
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,20
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australians are interested to get on with the job, to get a recovery going. When people of substance and goodwill in the business community, in the States, in the farming sector, and in all the other sectors of this country sit down to discuss policies and priorities, what do we get? We get an attack from the coalition on the basis that it is a handout to business and the business community should not be talking to the Government; an attack from the Federal Director of the Liberal Party who says they should not envelop themselves in the bosom of socialism; and Mr Kroger saying that they should get off the fence and support the coalition. Those opposite are smarting at the fact that the business community is prepared to talk to the Government about Australia's long term issues and is prepared to face the real problems we have with the recession and coming out of it. They want them simply to go mouthing political slogans from the Liberal Party. If this is how the Leader of the Opposition thinks policy should be made, without consultation, without regard for the people who create wealth or run employment in this country, then I think he is very sadly mistaken. He simply tries to push the business community into being lackeys of a partisan political organisation. Unemployment",20
56,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I preface my question to the Prime Minist-r by reminding him of his recent commitment to tell the truth. The Prime Minister would not have forgotten another statement he made just prior to the 1990 election when he said, 'We won't let there be a recession'. I therefore ask Mr Recession: with one million unemployed, how can anybody believe anything you say tomorrow night?",20
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make the point that in the years this Government has been in office it has done more to change and remodel Australia to give Australians hope than any government in the post-war years. We had the debt and credit binge of the 1980s. What did the Government do? It gave the private sector of Australia 7 per cent of gross domestic product by cuts in government spending. We handed that to the private sector of Australia and said, 'Here is $30 billion a year; go and spend that on investment'. That is what we did. It was often spent on investments which were not productive; it led to a call in overseas savings that we could not abide; imports spiralled to levels which the current account could not tolerate; and there was pressure on the inflation rate-nonetheless, we did the correct thing and tried to pull the nation's living standardsOpposition members-Down, down, down!",20
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,20
59,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"back to that which could be afforded within our national savings. That, compounded by a withdrawal of credit around the world, not just in Australia, and a recession and a slowdown in the economies of the United States, Japan, France, Britain and Canada, amongst others, produced for us lower prices and lower national wealth. As a result, we have had a greater consequence in terms of a recession. But we will do with this recovery what we did with the recovery left from the recession you left us; that is, we will get on with the growth. I do not remember any contrition from the honourable member for Bennelong when he went into opposition in 1983, leaving us with a massive structural Budget deficit, 10'/2 per cent inflation-not 1'12 per cent-just on 11 per cent unemployment, a smashed profit share and smashed investment. I do not remember any acts of contrition by the then member for Wentworth in any of the columns he was writing. No, he slunk off back to private life and left us with the wreckage, which we then turned into 1.5 million jobs; we pulled the structural Budget deficit into surplus; we pulled the inflation rate down for the first time in two decades; and we preserved from 1983 to this day 1.5 million jobs against the paltry 350,000 in your period. They ask what they can expect from us. What they can expect from us is the kind of recovery, growth and employment that they had in the 1980s coming out of the wreckage that we were left with.

65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for Gippsland interjects again I will deal with him.,21
66,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw the Treasurer's attention to recent data showing that credit provided to the private sector by financial institutions fell by 1.3 per cent in 1991. Will the Treasurer advise the House of what action, if any, the Government has taken which will improve the availability of finance for the private sector and so assist the process of economic recovery?",21
67,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The Government has, of course, been monitoring the supply of credit in Australia and, of course, this has been done in the context of a deregulated financial system where the measures of credit have changed significantly and the ability to affect the supply of credit has also changed significantly. Whereas in the regulated financial system, with which our opponents are much more familiar, the Government can more directly affect the supply of credit, in the deregulated system it cannot do so nearly as directly. The Government has been concerned about ensuring that in the context of an emerging recovery-a recovery which the Government intends to further encouragethere is an appropriate response from the financial system to ensure that there is sufficient credit available to support that recovery. In the consultations which the Government undertook earlier this year there were a number of points put to us by companies, both large and small, about the availability of credit in Australia, and some observations were made about the conduct of the banks. During that process the Government also discussed these issues with the leading banks that came to see us. The banks had their own stories to tell about the problems which they had to confront in the context of a deregulated system and getting used to that, the other events during the 1980s and the excesses which occurred during that time. They gave their own explanation for what had been happening and what was happening now. They also suggested some measures to the Government which might ease the situation. In this general regard I sat down with the representatives of the four leading banks together with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury and had further discussions with them last week. I am delighted to say that the banks have, the context of those discussions, welcomed the Government's plans to provide some stimulus to the economy to promote economic activity, and they have said that their lending policies will be fully consistent with the Government's objective of trying to encourage such a recovery. They have reafslowdown firmed their keenness to lend for sound commercial propositions. The chief executives went on to say that they would reinforce this policy with their lending staff. Later today will be issuing a statement which contains sentiments endorsed by the executives of four major banks who came to see us. The Government very much welcomes the response of the banks. We recognise that they have been going through some difficult times, but with an emerging recovery-a recovery we wish to bring on and promote-this is not the time for us to continue to criticise the banks and their conduct; rather we should ensure that the banks have t1w capacity to provide the credit necessary to encourage the recovery of the Australian economy.

70,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, and I again remind him of his promise to tell the truth to the Australian people. I ask: why did he fail to tell the truth back in November 1990 when, in admitting to the recession, he said, 'I knew there had to be one, but I didn't want to tell you'.",22
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is always a play on words between 'slowdown' and 'recession'. As the House will remember, we had demand running at twice the production of the economy. We had demand running at 9 per cent and we had product at 4112 per cent. In other words, 4 11z per cent was being taken as imports. What we were seeking to do was to bring down the 41fz per cent to meet GOP; that is, to cut demand back and not to slice into production. The fact is that for a number in of reasons we could not fine tune that process. But we have had a cut in production. We have lost about $12 billion in production.",22

74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The aim was to induce a and not produce a recession. When I became Treasurer in 1983, GOP was $171 billion, when I resigned as Treasurer it was about $405 billion, and we lost $12 billion I from $405 billion. We went from $171 billion the to $405 billion minus $12 billion. But what the sort of growth did you have? There was no doubling of nominal GOP in your time. You gave us a permanent recession, the most miserable rates of growth. Of course, do not mention that. You can mention that we chopped into GOP after we crossed the $400 billion barrier, but never mention the fact that you only got up very slowly to $170 billion by 1983. The fact is you were grossly incompetent and had no idea how to manage the place. The slowdown did tum into a recession, and that is very much to be regretted. The only thing to do now is simply move it back to recovery as quickly as possible. Goods and Services Tax",22

79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-There was a most interesting conference this week on the goods and services tax, with headlines such as 'GST gets a bad report' and 'Academics are a bit crook on the GST'. I tell you what-by God they are. But what really let the cat out of the bag at this conference was Or Chris Murphy-the econometrician who put together the model on which the GST was based and testedof saying in a paper that GDP would be reduced for at least five years as a result of the sumption tax and that unemployment would be higher for at least five years. He went to say that if the price surge was completely locked out of wages, GDP would be 4 per cent lower after five years unemployment would be increased by over 2 per cent. So, after having laboured for a year to out the accountancy of the GST, we find that the econometrician most associated with says that it will actually reduce GDP. Well done Professor! The recession has cost us 3 per cent GDP. Dr Murphy says that GDP would be reduced by 4 per cent as a result of the Hewson consumption tax; in other words, a reduction greater than the impact of the recession on the GDP. This is the product of the Liberal Party-a package which actually makes the economy smaller; it reduces GDP over the period. The journalist writing this said: But perhaps most ominously, Murphy finds that GST would retard economic growth for the first five years but contribute slightly to growth end of the decade. Oh beauty! In 2001 we see a blip on the GDP scale! And then, of course embarrassed-and why would you not be?-a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Opposition pointed out: . . . the coalition's proposed micro-economic reforms-to make waterfront, roads, and other infrastructure more efficient-might generate substantial economic growth. But when you look at the Opposition's micropolicy you see that it is micro by name and micro by nature; you would need a looking glass to find it. In fact, those opposite will make the Rail Corporation more efficient by reducing it by $15m. They will leave road funding at the same level as that of 1991-92. Of course, as the GST is collected from travellers as they book out of hotels in the morning, and the great collections hit the register, the train line from Sydney to Melbourne will miraculously straighten as it goes round the curve. When course the dry-cleaning bills are paid, the bridges will lift to take double stack concontainers as they go along. We will have a Cecil B. De Mille transition of the infrastructure as on the GST is paid over the cOlmters of this not country, actually reducing GDP-but a spokeswoman says, 'Oh yes, but wait till you and get on to our infrastructure policy'. What a damning proposition from a person of substance-the econometrician that actually bring put the Fightback model together and tested it-that there will be a reduction in GDP as it a result of the GST. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition proposes this as the way forward. This is the plan for Australia-a plan to go of backwards. What else is there to say!",22

Whether you tax expenditure or income is a tenth order matter. For those people on $20,000 or $25,000, who spend everything they earnand more-whether you tax expenditure or income is immaterial; if they spend the lot it is immaterial. But basically you have this proposition. If you are on $20,000, you spend everything you earn. So whether it is taxed as you earn it or whether you spend it is immaterial.

The fact is that we had to do your dirty work, to clean up after you, in the 1980s. We will fix this recession and bring it into a recovery. We will not be relying on some accountancy operation to belt some low income earners and try to transfer some of their wealth to the highly paid while trying to pretend-a spokeswoman says, 'If you read our infrastructure policy' - that you can do anything about the real issues. When the heads of BHP, the ANZ Bank, the N ationa! Australia Bank, Westpac or the industrial companies come to see us, those opposite blackguard them as being businessmen looking for handouts.

102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some of us, Mr Speaker, have both content and weight. In this case, the Opposition '8 document misses out on the content side. The GST package envisagesthough none of the dancing claquers on the back bench of the Liberal Party comprehend it-a period of sustained high levels of unemployment. The Opposition sits there and hypocritically questions us about our attitude to the question of unemployment, when it is understood by those who devised that package that it contemplates-and relies upon for its success-sustained unemployment. Falling real living standards will result from its implementation. That is a feature of it. When Opposition members comprehend that, they will know the genuine hypocrisy that has been forthcoming in their questions. But there are some interesting features of the document, nevertheless. In circumstances where the Opposition contemplates continuing unemployment, it has to deal with the problems of the unemployed. What is there to deal with in the problems of the unemployed? Not an understanding that many of those are out of work because of structural changes, many of which the Opposition may well want to implement or expand on, were it to get into office; not a comprehension that unemployed persons are breadwinners. It is a sort of 1980s moronic attitude that says the unemployed are essentially undeserving. Therefore, after six months, the unemployed will be required to obtain from businessmen certification that they are actively seeking work. In this package two sets of people are monumentally persecuted: one is small business and the other is the unemployed. In this element of the package they both get hit. In requiring approximately 500,000 job seekers to have written certification from two employers each fortnight, a total of 26 million written certifications from small businessmen and others will be required each year in order for this element of the package to be implemented. Let me say this: if things go wrong for this side of the House some time next April, or May, or June, or whenever this election is held, my strong advice to anybody who is silly enough to have opened an office anywhere near a CES establishment will be to get that business at least a couple of miles away from the CES office because they will receive some visitations. Those businessmen will be required to provide two certificates each person who comes in seeking work. Of course, one assumes that this certification does not take place by some automatic process. One assumes that the process involves some level of interview, discussion or whatever it is. Let us take a conservative estimate that a six-minute discussion takes place between the person seeking certification that he asked for a job and the person writing the letter to say, 'Yes, indeed, this fellow asked for a job'. That means that some 1,824 person years per annum would be provided by employers for this process. My Department estimates the cost of this process for employers-not for the Government or taxpayers-to be $72m each year. Presumably, not all people are in a situation where they can actually walk to the employer to get that certification; they might have to take a bus ride. So let us take an estimate of $1.50 per trip-a concessional metropolitan transport cost. The estimated cost to job seekers comes out at about $39m each year. This is the cost that would be imposed on the unemployed and then on the businesses to be persecuted by the unemployed as they seek certification under the wonderful proposals put forward by the Opposition. It is no accident that a New Zealand accountant, John Morine, has recently written in an Australian small business and investing magazine the following warning to Australia's small businessmen: If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive. Unemployment",24
103,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In asking this question, I refer to the last two answers by two Government Ministers that dwelt on the issue of unemployment, and I remind the Prime Minister of his pledge to tell the truth to the people of Australia. I ask the Prime Minister: is it true that the unemployment rate in December reached 10.6 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms and 11.2 per cent in unadjusted for terms-by far the worse numbers since the Great Depression? In short, I ask Mr Recession: with one million unemployed, how did you get it so wrong?",25
104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, there are 886,000 people unemployed. The Unemployment rate was estimated at 10.3 per cent seasonally adjusted in December 1991 and the number of employed persons was estimated at 7.7 million-an increase of 46,900 persons since December 1991. I might also add that that increase of 46,000 in the employed work force corresponds with some continuing improvement in the job vacancy series indexes, which have been at least some indication that there appears, at least for the moment, to be some improvement in the labour market. The fact is that, again, it is growth, and only growth, that can do these things. It is growth that can change the pattern of the labour market, and that growth has to be built upon competitiveness. That is what the Government will be about and that is very much what tomorrow night's statement will be about: inducing a recovery and producing employment-jobs-to actually get on with the task of getting those numbers down and building on the numbers we have seen in the period since December. Superannuation",26
105,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Will he advise the House of the progress of the Government's initiatives to extend superannuation coverage for Australian workers and also of the prospects for further extension of superannuation coverage? I ask this in view of the alternative policies being advanced which would undermine the incentives to save for one's own retirement in the future, which would heavily tax superannuation funds and place restrictions on lump sums and roll-overs, and which would also increase the age of retirement from 55 years to 60 years.",26

107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Forrest will cease interjecting.,26
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the many quality structural changes which the Government has brought to Australia over the last nine years has been that relating to superannuation. One has to acknowledge that when we came to office, only 40 per cent of the work force had any superannuation coverage. Many of those workers, of course, were in the public sector. Those who were in the private sector were overwhelmingly in management or other executive positions. This did not concern the Liberal Party of the 1970s or the early 1980s. It saw the superannuation arrangements and its preferred treatment through the tax system as the legitimate right of those people who were on high incomes and not something which should be accessible to those on lower incomes, the overwhelming majority of the work force. The Government set about the task of trying to produce a change which not only had an important social dimension but also had an important structural change, in terms of providing an incentive to add to savings, and also of trying to encourage people to provide more for their own retirement. Therefore, the Government, with the trade union movement, set about the extension of award superannuation by making changes to the taxation system, which focused superannuation benefits on retirement provision, and, of course, by making the system fairer to extend the access of Australian workers to superannuation. We now can reveal that by July of last year nearly 80 per cent of working men and women in this country had some superannuation coverage-that is, from 40 per cent, highly skewed towards the public sector and higher income groups, to 80 per cent, which is a much more general coverage of Australian working men and women. We intend, of course, to continue our progress and the extension of superannuation generally, partially through the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy, which will ensure that those who have an award requirement actually comply with it and will also ensure that over time superannuation provision is extended. We will also look, as my predecessor announced at the time of the last Budget, at a review of some of the taxation provisions, particularly in the context of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee. We are also looking at prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. It is in that context that one has to view the proposals of the Opposition in relation to superannuation. Firstly, it should be recalled that the Liberal Party has never liked the idea of superannuation-has never liked the idea of extending superannuation to ordinary working men and women in Australia. This was something which was not supposed to be available to them. Mr Connolly interjecting-",26
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,OrderI The honourable member for Bradfield!,27
110,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is why the Opposition has gone to such lengths to introduce a policy which will confound the basic objectives of the extension of superannuation to ordinary working men and women. The Liberal Party has promised simplicity, yet its proposals involve enormous complexity, which would be an administrative nightmare, particularly for those who are involved in defined benefit schemes. Its proposal would increase the cost of running superannuation schemes, thereby reducing the benefits that would flow to employees in retirement. It would increase the tax on superannuation funds. It would increase the risks carried by employers, especially those who have defined benefit schemes. It would drastically curtail, and do so retrospectively, an individual's freedom to choose to take a lump sum benefit. Once this proposal was made available, of course, not surprisingly it met with significant criticism from the superannuation industry. So we are seeing a process of scuttling, a process of duckshoving on the part of the Opposition, as it tries to work out what it is going to do with this crazy mess that it has created after months, if not years, of agonising. Last Friday the Leader of the Opposition announced in an interview with the Australian Financial Review that he had set up a consultative group of four or five superannuation and actuarial experts to review the details of the policy. On the basis of the evidence produced by the Minister for Finance, not only have we seen that there is a $4 billion hole punched right through the middle of the Opposition's proposals, but we are also now seeing the wheels fall off this particular part of the Opposition's proposals relating to superannuation. Mr Speaker, have you observed how sensitive members of the Opposition have become to any criticism and to any suggestion of a review of their policies? Those who criticise their proposals are accused of simply representing vested interests, as the Opposition leader said in response to some criticism from the superannuation industry in this regard; they are dismissed as being ignorant; or, in the case of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they are accused of being liars if they suggest in any way that members of the Opposition are about to review their policies. But review they will and review they must because the policies which they have proposed are terribly complicated and would have entirely contradictory outcomes if they were to be pursued. What we are seeing here is the beginning of a process which will continue over time as more and more of the Opposition's proposals are SUbjected to greater and greater scrutiny and as more and more of the weaknesses are revealed. Little by little, bit by bit we will see this policy fray. We will see the wheels fall off until we are left with only one thing-a central piece of irrationality; that is, a tax on the clothing and food of every Australian in this country. Economy",27

135,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The nation has succeeded in breaking the back of the most pernicious economic disease in a quarter of a centurywe have achieved low inflation-which brought the uncompetitiveness, which brought the current account problem and which brought a lot of the slow growth and unemployment of years gone by. And now, with a 1.5 per cent inflation rate, we are enjoined by the Leader of the Opposition to adopt his tax package when the author of the model which produced it, Dr Murphy, has issued this warning about it: If wages were to blowout badly, a GST could stimulate inflation of up to 10 per cent within five years. The report says: Murphy stipulates that the wage setting arrangements would have to guarantee that a wages blow-out will not occur. ",28
136,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. The author of your econometric model says that you would have to stipulate that the wage arrangements would be guaranteed. The fact is that not only are you not guaranteeing wage arrangements, but to this week the Leader of the Opposition said that he will oppose any national wage adjustment. In fact, he is in dispute with the honourable member for Bennelong over the matter. Members of the Opposition have no wage arrangement between themselves, much less between themselves and the work force. The result is this: although given tax cuts which are worth half of the proceeds of the consumption tax - and if one is on the low end, of course, one gets much less than people on the higher end of the income scale':'-why would the workers who have been belted with a consumption tax accept such an impost and say, 'Yes, that is all right; we will give you a wage discount. We will keep the inflation rate at 2 or 3 per cent'? Of course they will claim it in wages! And what will you do about it? Put out a press release? Poke your tongue out outside your office? What will you do about it as inflation starts whirring up to 10 per cent? Yet after labouring for a year to bring forward this mouse which will actually reduce GDP and put our inflation gains at risk, you are on about 1988 and the outcome of that Budget and the Budget forecasts then. This is 1992. We are about moving into a recovery; we are about preserving low inflation. Yet you produce a proposition which reduces GDP and risks blowing inflation back into double digits. God! Social Security M5 CRAWFORD-I ask the Minister for Social Security: has his attention been drawn to reports that one in four Australians is dependent on the social welfare system? Can the Minister advise the House of the proportion of the Australian population who are currently receiving social security payments and have been doing so since 1983?",28
137,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of some newspaper reports which I think clearly must be put in the category of beat-ups on this matter. Yesterday's front page story in the Herald-Sun had the headline: 4.5 million Aussies on welfare. Anyone who read that story would be forgiven for believing that my Department had simply embarked on a client recruitment campaign. Now let us have the facts. The first point to make is that the proportion of the population today dependent on welfare is less than it was in 1983. Despite the great growth of the aged population in this country and despite the difficulties of the recession, the proportion of the population on welfare today is less than what we inherited from the present Opposition. Let me just give the figures. Mr Dobie-Prove it!",29
138,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the noisy interjector over there who wants the facts, we have over four million people getting some form of security help at the moment. But the proportion of the labour force who are recipients of social security today has declined from 41. 9 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent in June 1991. Now let us take the population. The proportion of DSS recipients has fallen, if we take the population figure, from 19 per cent in 1983 to 17.4 per cent in June 1991. I stress that that has occurred despite the severity of the present recession and despite great growth in the aged population. Why has it been achieved? We inherited from the Opposition a loose, overpopulated, untargeted social welfare system and my predecessors have produced a structured and targeted system in this country, correcting the inept controls over fraud that characterised the Opposition's period. We have been able to tum those arrangements around. Again today we spend approximately 7 per cent of GDPgross domestic product, for the member for Franklin-on social welfare. 1\11' Good luck-You were a Launceston Tech fellow, so I would be quiet if I were you. You could be a 'Rhodes' scholar; you would be better on the roads.",29
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Franklin will cease interjecting.,29
140,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is approximately the same as was spent in 1983. That is despite the severity of the recession, the growth in the aged population and the fact that we have been able to make very significant increases in the rates of pay to the less well off in this society. Let me exemplify some of the real increases that have taken place under this Government because we have managed to have a targeted welfare system: payments for children in low income families have increased in real terms in the nine years of this Government per cent for children under 13 and by 121 per cent for teenage children; payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by ;iround 16 per cent in real terms, and if one takes in our increases in rent assistance by about 24 per cent. The basic pension rate has increased in real terms by almost 12 per cent under this Government, and rent assistance has increased by between 78 per cent and 137 per cent. We have created real living standards for those need social security payments, but because we have targeted it, we have been able within much the same budget in proportion to GDP as in 1983. In conclusion, the quite absurd proposals in relation to social security in the Fightback document threaten to tear great holes in that carefully designed, properly targeted safety net. NA",29

147,Mr SINCLAIR,FEDERAL PARLIAMENT,"I refer you, Mr Speaker, to chapter 1, part 1, section 1 of the Australian Constitution in which the legislative power of the Commonwealth is described as being vested in a Federal parliament, but shall: ... consist of the Queen. a Senate and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called 'The Parliament' or 'The Parliament of the Commonwealth. ' In view of the highly successful joint meeting of the two Houses of this Parliament on 2 January which enjoyed bipartisan support when we had the head of state of the United States of America address the Parliament, I ask: what efforts did you make to secure an address by the head of the Australian state to this Parliament?

149,Mr HOWARD,LENGTH OF QUESTIONS,"I have a question to ask you, Mr Speaker. I was wondering whether, for my guidance and the guidance of members of the House, you might explain to the House the basis of your having twice upbraided the Leader of the Opposition for allegedly inserting lengthy preambles in questions yet failing in any way to abjure the honourable member for Capricornia, who had a preamble longer than War and Peace in the question that he asked. Perhaps you could explain to us the difference between the standard applied to the Leader of the Opposition and the totally permissive standard to the honourable member for Capricornia.",32

151,Mr SPEAKER,LENGTH OF QUESTIONS,"Order! The honourable member for Bennelong might just listen and he will hear the answer to his question, and I might treat his answer in the same manner in which the question was asked. I might say to the honourable member that he obviously was not listening all that well to the honourable member for Capricornia. because what I was drawing his attention to was the fact that he asked his question and then continued afterwards. Over recent times I have allowed honourable members on both sides to ask questions that tend not to be in accord with the Standing Orders. If the honourable member for Bennelong is suggesting to me that I should draw his Leader's attention to the succinctness of the Standing Orders, I think the honourable member is asking a bit much.",32

The honourable member for Bennelong might cease interjecting or I will also outline to him the Standing Orders that relate to that, which has caused some members of this House to be suspended from the House. I think I recall that that happened to the honourable member for Bennelong once. I think it is up to the Chair to determine when some questions are getting a bit out of bounds. The questions from the Leader of the Opposition in the main are probably a little long, but it does not worry me that that is so. When I think they are too long, I will draw his attention to it, as I will with other honourable members. I would think that the honourable member for Bennelong had been here long enough not to need any advice from me. NA NA",32
158,Mr FIFE,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,"Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to ask through you some for advice from the Leader of the House regarding the program of Parliament, not just for my own benefit but for the benefit of other members. First, in relation to Question Time, the former Prime Minister put into place an arrangement whereby, if his Ministers took an inordinate amount of time to answer questions, he would extend Question Time to allow at least seven questions from the Opposition and seven questions from Government members. I seek advice through you, Mr Speaker, as to whether the Government, and particularly the new Prime Minister, propose to extend that same courtesy to the House that his predecessor did. I remind the Leader of the House that today there was an opportunity to ask only six questions from both sides of the House. My other question is in relation to the official program that has been circulated for the week. The program indicates that at 7.30 p.m. tomorrow the Prime Minister will deliver an economic statement, but there is no reference to an opportunity being afforded to the Leader of the Opposition to respond on Thursday. I understand that that matter has now been reconsidered. I seek an assurance from the Leader of the House that an amended program will be circulated to indicate that time has been set aside on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. for the Leader of the Opposition to reply.",33
159,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,"I do not mean any disrespect to the honourable member for Hume but, before I call the Minister, I wish to advise that I have to leave the chair pany the Prime Minister and the President to Adelaide to say farewell to the Queen. I ask my colleague the Deputy Speaker to take the chair. I am sure the Deputy Speaker will grant indulgence to the Minister. Mr BEAZLEYI think what I ought to do, Mr Deputy Speaker, is ask your indulgence to answer the questions from the Manager of Opposition Business, because they are pretty irregular questions.",33
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,Indulgence granted.,33
161,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,"On the first point, as the Manager of Opposition Business would be well aware, the previous Prime Minister took it upon himself to try to secure as an informal guide about 14 questions per Question Time. It was not a hard and fast rule. On a number of occasions we fell well below that and sometimes we went above it. I imagine that the same situation will continue to apply. There were 12 questions today and we did go about five or 10 minutes past the allotted time for Question Time. On the second point, the Government has decided that time will be made available at 7.30 on Thursday night for the Leader of the Opposition, if he wishes, to reply to the statement made tomorrow by the Prime Minister.",33
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,"I should also point out to the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the House that the efficiency of Question Time, as the Chair has already pointed out, will be improved if there are fewer interjections and fewer points of order. ",33
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM,There is no call for a comment from the honourable member for Kooyong. NA Unemployment,33
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the to accom- House for discussion, namely: Australia's tragically high level of unemployment I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",33
165,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is perfectly obvious, both from the statements that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made outside the Parliament and from his demeanour inside the Parliament today, that tomorrow night will represent an attempt by the Prime Minister to provide not only some kind of economic circuit-breaker for the Government, but also, perhaps more importantly and more significantly, a political circuit-breaker for the Government. Tomorrow night the propaganda machine of the Government and the Prime Minister's office will be presenting to the Australian public a very simple message. It will be saying to the Australian people, 'No matter what you may have thought of the honourable member for Blaxland for what he did to this country as Treasurer, no matter what you may have thought of the state of the country prior to the delivery of tomorrow night's statement, as from tomorrow night you are dealing with a new Paul Keating, you are dealing with an entirely new government, with an entirely new vista, an entirely new vision, an entirely new set of policies, all designed to chloroform the Australian people into forgetting about what has happened to this country over the last 8t h years'. We in this Parliament, and particularly we on this side of the House, owe it to ourselves and to the people of Australia not only to remind ourselves of what the current Prime Minister did to this country through his wilful and boastful mismanagement of the Australian economy over the last eight years, but also by the example of that mismanagement to demonstrate that what he offers tomorrow night is not a vision, is not an alternative of running the Australian economy, is not a glide path of economic growth out of the worse recession we have had in 60 yearsrather, it is a rewrapped repetition of the failed policies of the last 8 t h years. No man wears the mantle of failure and no man deserves a heavier indictment of failure than the man who now sits in this House as Prime Minister of Australia. He may fulminate and bluster, he may abuse and cajole and shout at Question Time, but nothing can alter the fact that the present Prime Minister of this country, when Treasurer, quite unparalleled in the experience of any person who has occupied the position of Treasurer, actually boasted about his own economic handiwork. No man was prouder of the recession that he created than the present Prime Minister. It is without parallel in the history of any Western industrialised country that somebody who sends a nation into recession should actually boast about the achievement of creating that recession. Yet that is fundamentally what this man did. Not only in 1988 and 1989, but all through his long stewardship as Treasurer of this country the present Prime Minister boasted about everything that he did. Therefore it passed very strange, and indeed it passed very poorly to us, and I am sure to the Australian people, that when the Prime Minister was first asked a very important and fundamental question in Question Time today by the Leader of the Opposition-if you got it so wrong in the past, why should the Australian people believe you tomorrow night?-he replied, 'Yes, we are in a recession, but it is all the fault of the rest of the world. Every other country is in recession. We are not alone. We are just part of the mob. We are no better, we are no worse, than anybody else'. Of course, that was not the boastful honourable member for Blaxland way back in September 1985 when he was Treasurer of this country and he was boasting about his achievements as Treasurer. He said, 'If we were providing these policy settings and outcomes in western Europe they would be lighting candles to us in cathedrals'; in other words, they would be honouring his hanway diwork by lighting candles in cathedrals. That was the measure of the man's truculence. Of course, we all remember what happened on 23 August 1988 when he said that this was the Budget that was going to bring home the bacon. I think I can almost predict what the Prime Minister is going to say tomorrow night by way of rhetorical encouragement to those who sit rather falteringly, unhappily and hesitatingly behind him. Mr Beazley interjecting",33
166,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the House interjects. I would not be happy about his chances of holding Swan at the next election. The businessmen ought to get a long way from the CES in his electorate, otherwise he will be haunting them after the next election. Let me try to predict what the Prime Minister is going to say. I think he might well say, 'I can report to the people of Australia that the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation'. It will be quite surprising if he does not say that. He will go on and say, 'Australia has continued to grow and we are now well on the way back to prosperity. are now systematically restructuring economy, making Australia a much more dynamic place'. He likes that word, 'place'. He keeps using it time and time again. He says, 'I want to get the place cracking. I want to make it a far more dynamic place, more able to compete in the world. The evidence there for all of us to see'. Then he will go and talk about how the balance of payments is improving. I think I can predict that they are the of things he is going to say tomorrow night. The only problem with using that kind of rhetoric is that that was basically the rhetoric he used on 23 August 1988; in fact, in his Budget Speech he said, 'I can report to people of Australia that the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation'. He said that in August 1988. Yet he knew that lying before us was the worse recession that this country has had for 60 years. This man craves acceptance as the reformed, born again believer in employment, as a man who this believes in sustained economic growth, and somebody who, despite all the accumulated evidence of his prime complicity in the destruction of jobs in this country, would have us believe tomorrow night that he born again and that he now understands things that somehow or other escaped him over the last 81J2 years. Therefore I invite the Parliament and the Australian people to look at the contribution of tomorrow night's statement to tragic legacy of all of the current recession, and that is our very high rate of unemployment. We have the highest rate of unemployment since the great recession, the worse level of jobless for 60 years-in other words, the worse level of jobless probably in the living memory of anybody in this Parliament without exception. That, uniquely, is the sort of legacy that the honourable member for Blaxland, the man who tomorrow night will ask us to accept him as the saviour of the Australian economy, has delivered to the Australian community. If there is one issue that will haunt the Australian Labor Party until the next election, We it is the issue of unemployment because, if the ever there was an issue on which those opposite claimed uniquely and specially to have a compassionate concern for their own constituency, it is the issue of unemployment. It has been an issue on which a Labor man or woman could be ignited into indignation, fury is and self-righteousness. One can look back on through the speeches of Labor Party leaders over the years, be it Hawke or Whitlam. I remember Whitlam saying that 2 per cent sorts unemployment was a national crime-the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) nods in assent-when he campaigned in 1972. 1\vo pel' cent unemployment was a national crime, according to the former member for the Werriwa who was a Labor Party leader. I remember the former Prime Minister, the former member for Wills, saying that any party that was responsible for the levels of unemployment that obtained in the early 1980s did not deserve to be in office. Yet we have watched those levels of unemployment climb. We have seen youth unemployment in country go to 34 per cent despite the fact as that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), in a press statement that he made a few weeks ago, would have us believe-incredibly-that is the level of unemployment amongst young people was only 8.8 per cent. That claim was made by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and, despite the invitations from a number of my colleagues, he has done absolutely nothing to explain that the most extraordinary proposition. The real test of tomorrow night's statement will undoubtedly be the contribution that it will make to a lasting reduction in the level of unemployment in this country. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can now be done about the unemployment levels that obtained in this country up to this moment. What can be done as from tomorrow night is to adopt a set of policies which over a period of time will bring down unemployment and keep it down in a sustainable fashion. That is where the Fightback program of the coalition comes in. It is a program which is dedicated to a sustainable reduction in the number of unemployed in our community-a program which through, for example, its abolition of the payroll tax, is designed to remove impediments to job creation. It contains a commitment to micro-economic reform; a commitment to freeing up the industrial relations system; a commitment to a genuine reform of Australia's waterfront and Australia's transport system; a commitment to the introduction of a good and services tax which is exporter friendly and which is designed to place Australian exporters on a competitive footing, so far as taxation is concerned, with the exporters of other caught nations-and to do something that I have doubt that every businessman who saw the the Prime Minister in his consultations over past few weeks told him ought to be done, which is to give to the Australian business community an indirect tax system that does not automatically place us at a disadvantage compared with exporters of other incence dustrialised countries. The only way one can really do that is by mickey mouse fiddling at the edges that was a function of the taxation changes made in the Government's March industry statement of last year. The only way one can really that is by the full-blooded reform introducing a goods and services tax which totally relieves exports of any kind of indirect taxation liability. That is the fundamental reform. I hear Ministers on the Government front bench baying, ranting and carrying on about how we have to be more competitive and more productive and how we have to charge forth into the Asia-Pacific region and grab all of those markets emerging in that part of the world. Our competitors are laughing themselves to death at this nation because of its hopelessly uncompetitive indirect tax system. There is only one side of politics in this nation and in this Parliament that has had the courage to embrace the fundamental restructuring of the taxation system that is necessary to put our exporters on a competitive footing with the rest of the world. Those on the other side of the Parliament may criticise and nitpick, and between now and the next election they may try to wage, as they undoubtedly will, the most dishonest, disreputable fear campaign about the goods and services tax, just as they waged a fear campaign on the privatisation of Qantas and Australian Airlines-only to find five years after they could have sold them for an absolute bonanza that they are trying to unload them in a market that does not want to buy them. Because of their contemptible political expediency on that issue, they have cost this nation very dearlyand they will try to do it again. I suspect that the Australian public has up with those opposite. I suspect that no members of the Australian public remember truculent, boastful rhetoric of the current the Prime Minister. They remember that he was the bloke who wanted a broad based consumption tax in 1985. They remember that he was the bloke who boasted about how it was . necessary to do something about the effervesthat was flowing over the glass. He was the bloke who said that the Australian economy was like a bucking bronco and had not to be subdued-subdued by the bludgeon of massively high interest rates. He was the man who through 1988 and 1989 boasted about the pain that he was inflicting upon the Australian do economy. We have the outrage of the man of now posing as some sort of born again saviour of the Australian economy, yet he will go down in history as the only Treasurer this nation has ever had who actually enjoyed inflicting pain on the Australian people.",34
167,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has this to his credit: he is one of the very few members of the Opposition who admit that the package which it has brought down will not bring down the high levels of unemployment at any time in the calculable future. In hope, he saysthrough his assertions about what might take place on micro-economic reform-that maybe in four or five years from now, the GST package will have some sort of impact. But how, we do not know; it is magical. Maybe it will have some sort of impact on the levels of employment, but it will not, within a normal parliamentary term, have any impact on high levels of unemployment. That was an honest statement from him, and he deserves credit for it. But it ill behoves somebody who acknowledges that that is a consequence of the policy that, for whatever reasons, the Opposition feels it must pursue to come into this Parliament and offer criticism of the Government on the question of high levels of unemployment. It also ill behoves anybody to come into this Parliament and make that attack on the basis of the record from which he argues. At the outset let me concede that the levels of unemployment are too high. The consequences of high levels of unemployment on the lives of individual Australians are unacceptable. We have a very deep concern for those families in which the breadwinner cannot find work. At least our public policies deal with problems that families confront when the breadwinners are unemployed. None of that was said by the honourable member who just spoke. I believe that he omitted to say it not because he lacks compassion-he is a man of very considerable compassionbut because in this particular instance, whether by virtue of his own fault or that of his colleagues, he is a man without policies. As far as the living standard or the life of the average person who is unemployed is concerned-it is anticipated that were the Opposition to be elected to office, under its policies a large number of people would continue to be unemployed-all there is in the Fightback package is a reduction in the level of benefits, making benefits harder to obtain and setting utterly absurd tests with an enormous potential impact on businesses that are approached by unemployed members of the work force. That is all there is in the Opposition's contribution. In the Opposition's package all the training programs that have been put in place by this Government have been removed for the purpose of attempting to make the taxation figures in the package add up. One of the problems of the advocacy of the honourable member for Bennelong, as he pursued it for 10 or 15 minutes, and of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when they say that what will improve this country is a program of micro-economic reform, be it on the waterfront, in transport, in the labour market or wherever, is that they say that if we are to avoid the sorts of situations which the Prime Minister referred to in Question Time in dealing with the assessment of the fellow who did the figuring for the goods and services tax and in which he predicted about four years of falling growth, or four years of recession, and if we are to have a turnaround, microeconomic reform and changes in the structure of the labour market are critical. Unfortunately, we know nothing-or, at least, very little-of what the Opposition would intend from this in the Fightback package that it is pursuing. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, that package is about taxation. It is not about growth, productivity or jobs; it is fundamentally about taxation. The second reason-this will be very difficult for the Opposition to handle-is that there are certain things that can be improved in the micro-economic reform area by changes in work practices and changes are going through. Those opposite can argue about the speed at which they are going through, but they cannot argue that they are not going through. They are. That is attested to not simply by Government Ministers but by those who are responsible for the operation of those enterprises. The problem is that eventually those Opposite will come up against an unbreakable barrier in the micro-economic reform area. That unbreakable barrier is that element of our infrastructure-be it transportation, waterfront reform or wherever-which is required to be addressed by expenditure. Various estimates have been put out from time to time of the shortfall in the developrate ment of Australia's national infrastructure; but they are all in substantial dollars. The cent. simple fact of the matter is that substantial dollars cannot be fitted into the propositions of the Liberal Party. One great area of confusion in that Liberal Party document is what will be done about road taxation and consequent road funding. Those opposite have various propositions. One can read into them, in a subterranean way, that they intend that the States make the shortfalls that will occur in road funding under their propositions, the States to make up the shortfalls through extreme registration fees, in some instances upwards of $2,000 annum for a person to put the average car the road. Under the Fightback package that what it will cost to proceed with the road program that the Government now has in place. It is an area which the Opposition has keep opaque. The honourable member for sidered Bennelong really knows-as he ought to since know, as he presided over the implementation of many of the petroleum taxation measuresto that, by and large, many useful objectives are served by the operation of that taxation. It foolishly in the totality of the package; it must sit there, at least in obfuscation, if Liberal Party is to be able to keep Party colleagues on board. As a result of that, the Opposition produces irrational policy. Let us look at the current situation as far unemployment is concerned in historical terms. When the honourable member for Bennelong went out of office as Treasurer, March or April 1983, I think it was, unemployment rate was 10.1 per cent. In amounted January 1992 the unemployment rate was 10.3 per cent. It is true; it is 0.2 per cent higher. Of course, the inflation rate, as the Prime Minister said, is about 1.5 per cent and about 2 per cent or 3 per cent over the year, whereas during the period when honourable member for Bennelong presided over it, it was in double digit figures. Another comparison is worthwhile here. The participation rate in the work force is now 63.4 per cent, compared with 60.4 cent in April 1983. If the present participation fell back to the April 1983 level, the unemployment rate would be as low as 6 per In contrast, under Fraser the labour force participation rate fell from 62.7 per cent in November 1975 to 60.4 per cent in March 1983. The highest it ever reached in the so called resources boom was 61.5 per cent. We do not make too much of this. When I am obliged to comment on the unemployment statistics-as I am from month to month-I up try not to make too much of the participation rate. It would not be a bad defence for someone in our position who wished to make a point about that to point out the fact that we per are sustaining a very much higher level of on employment for a larger number of people is who want to participate in the work force. The reason why we do not is that there is no sense in doing a simple comparison of statistics. If people want to work and cannot to get work then they are entitled to be conas being unemployed. So the fact that we have been in office more people, as a percentage of the community, have wanted work is in no small measure a product of the success of our other policies, not least that sits of job creation. Since we have been in office but we have encouraged people into the work the force by the very fact that there are opporits National tunities to enter it. Since we have been in office, some 1.5 million people have joined the work forceas an increase of 23 per cent. These figures have not been knocked back by the period in which we now find ourselves. Over the same period in of time when the Opposition was in the government the level of job creation to a bit more than a quarter of that. So it was not an era in which people were being encouraged to join the work force by a government's success in job creation. Of course, we have been a government successful in job creation and we have created a much the higher level of participation. We have also been successful in other areas. We have produced a work force more attuned to the idea of participation in the work force through the success of our training per programs, labour market programs and education programs. The reason why the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is sitting next to me now, said that 8.8 per cent of young people are out of work is that it is 8.8 per cent of that age cohort to which he referred who are out of work. If one took the same percentage of the work force in the time that the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer, the figure would not have been an unemployment level of, say, 25 per cent or the level it got to under the honourable member; it would have been 12.3 per cent. The challenge of bringing it down from 12.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent is the product of two things: firstly, the very substantial success that we have enjoyed in encouraging young people to continue their schooling; and, secondly, the enormous increases that have taken place in the provision of places in post-secondary out education. We have reached a point where we will have to do something about people's expecposition, tations in that area. Their expectations been driven by the fact that since we have been in office we have been prepared to provide for 190,000 extra students in the system, which means, effectively, the creation of 19 medium-sized universities. The figure which was quoted by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services was product of a very much lower number of people in that age cohort being work. When the honourable member was in office-I would not stand by this figure, but it was something of this order-about 450,000 people in that age bracket were available work. I think the figure is now about or 290,000. The thing that worries and concerns about the current level of unemployment is not only its impact on youth-we will fix with the training and education programs are putting in place. Many of those young people, whether or not they particularly want to, for the good of this nation ought to spending their later teen years in training programs, be it vocational education, higher education or whatever. They ought to be there and we ought to be providing them with the opportunities to be there. The problem that we and this nation confront irivolves those in an older age bracket who are finding themselves out of work for many reasons-some of them reasons such as successful implementation of micro-economic reform programs. There is no question at all that when the work force is restructured and multi-skilled employers need fewer employees, those whom they do not need find themselves out of work. That is a very substantial problem and it is not an easy one to solve. It means that one of the things we will have to watch very carefully when coming out of this recession is the situation of the long term unemployed. They will be of a different character. The long term unemployed at the time of the last recession tended to be youngish people. The long term unemployed coming of this recession will tend increasinglybut not exclusively-to be people of middle age. They will be supporting kids. The Opin putting up a proposition that they have should effectively be taken off the unemployment benefit after nine months, that a family man who has worked all of his life and who wants employment has to go through the disgrace of turning up at an employer's office every couple of weeks to get a certificate from an employer saying that he has the sought work, will be demeaning and humiliating for a lot of people who will be available for badly hurt anyway. Mr Bradford-That happens now. Mr BEAZLEy-It does not happen now. for We do not oblige people to go through that 280,000 process now; do not be silly. The simple fact of the matter is that the me programs we have put in place are programs which genuinely protect the existing living that conditions of the unemployed and, through we training, offer them opportunities' to get themselves back earlier into the work force, thereby eliminating some gluts and blockages be that may well occur as the recovery gets under way. Above all-and this will be evident tomorrow night-we are committed not to leaving unemployment at high levels for the foreseeable future but to bringing unemployment down and, at the same time, advancing the micro-economic reform agenda of the Government.",36
168,Dr KEMP,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The very poor defence that has been put up on behalf of the Government will not impress the electors of this country. The failure of these bungling Ministers has cut a swathe of devastation through this country. It has affected people of all age categories; it has affected people in all regions of this country. It has particularly affected those in traditional Labor seats; the constituents of these Ministers have suffered almost more than any other group in this country. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) saw unemployment in areas of his electorate rise by 70 per cent between September 1990 and January this year. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), the Minister for increasingly explaining away unemployment, saw the number of jobless in the Haymarket area of his electorate increase by some 116 per cent between September 1990 and January 1992. I suppose there will be some awareness on the other side of the House that in the former Prime Minister's electorate in the suburb of Coburg we saw the number of jobless increase by 126 per cent over that same period. The failure of this Government has been quite devastating to enormous numbers of Australians-young, middle-aged and elderly-who, as the Minister conceded, are increasingly seeking work to ease the enormous financial pressures which this recession has placed upon them. Amid the personal tragedies of the Keating unemployment disaster, none is more tragic than the unemployment amongst young people. I think Australians will be disgusted by the efforts of the Government to manipulate statistics in an attempt to explain away what they see with their very own eyes and, increasingly, what they fear will happen to them. It does the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services no credit whatever to say that an unemployment rate of 34 per cent amongst 15to 19-year-olds looking for work is not so serious because it is really only 8 per cent when we look at the age cohort as a whole. I will move on to the responsibilities that this Minister has for education and training as well, because young people have been badly let down on both sides of this Minister's portfolio. For the last two years young people in this country, finding that it is very difficult to get employment, have been forced back into the schools, the universities and the TAFE colleges. I will not in any way question the judgment they make that what they need if they are to have secure jobs through this decade are skills and knowledge which are of world-class standard. That is a sound judgment on their part. They need those. It is tragic that they have come to this recognition because of the disastrous failure of the economic policies of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The young people in Australia, however, have been badly let down by the education and training policies. When they go back into the educational institutions, what do they find there? Are they going to get the skills? Will they be able to obtain the knowledge that they will need to give them jobs in internationally competitive industries through this decade? The mismanagement of education and training by this Government has been one of its greatest failings. At every level, Labor has failed to do what is necessary to provide young Australians with the opportunities they need. Over one million Australians, many of them young Australians straight out of education, do not have the basic skills needed for long term employment or even to function effectively as citizens. The levels of attainment of Australian students in key areas such as science have declined over the term of this Government relative to those countries with which we have to compete internationally. Successful export industries increasingly depend on the ability to speak fluently the languages of the countries to which we export. Language skills amongst Australians have declined dramatically from the 1960s to the present time. This Government has adopted no strategy to deal with that. I will comment firstly on the school situation, because that is where the retention rates have exploded. Labor's agenda for schools has had precious little to do with making sure that young Australians have the ces. knowledge and the skills that will give them jobs through this decade. Throughout this Government's term in office, it has education capitulated to its mates in the radical teacher unions and refused to undertake any syslucky tematicmonitoring of standards, while give employers have been appalled year after year by the lack of basic skills too many bad students-not all, but too many-are bringing out of the schools. The Ministers have denied that there is a problem at all. They do want to know about it because they know that they will tread on a few corns of people too close to the inner circles of the Labor if they try. The Government's a lot more to do with creating powerful megaunions than it has with the ability of the schools to pass on to students the skills that they need. The Government has never had a proper of policies to raise the standards and status of teaching in the schools. On the contrary, its whole industrial relations approach has underproach. mined the status of teaching in the community. What happens when these students leave the schools and try to get places in higher education or in TAFE? The those Government tells us, 'Oh, well, we have created a lot more places'. This Minister, as a result of deliberate these reforms. ideological decision-making, has locked the doors on 50,000 qualified young Australians who want to get places in universities. What does he say to them? He has become almost the Marie Antoinette of Australian politics. 'Let them go to TAFE', he says. There are, course, no places in TAPE. There are 100,000 qualified people trying to get into TAPE cannot find places. The Minister says, 'Well, of course, you should not worry about That is all right because the higher education sector has now reached its optimum size'. How does he know? How can he and his bureaucrats possibly know whether this is the optimum size for Australia? This is the central planning mentality which has failed so agree: disastrously to provide an open and flexible system of education and training in which the universities and TAFE colleges have the freedom to cr-ate places and to get the resourThis Minister will not even give Australian students the same right to get places in higher as he gives to overseas students. What a gross inequity. He says, 'If you are enough to get the right score, we will you tens of thousands of dollars worth of subsidies, but if you are not lucky enough, luck, fellows, you are out, because we are not going to allow you in and we are not going to allow the institutions to let you in'. not That is a serious problem not just at the higher education end of the scale but also in TAPE. I think this Government has denigrated Party TAFE throughout this whole process of agenda has had educational upheaval. Mr Fife-Deliberately so.",40
169,Dr KEMP,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has deliberately denigrated TAFE, as the honourable member for Hume says. We have seen a constant focus on the set universities and higher education",41
170,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They have an elitist ap,41
171,Dr KEMP,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This Government has a very elitist approach, as the honourable member for Bennelong says, and it has disadvantaged all people who are not looking for the traditional university-type education but are seeking skills that TAPE can give. There has never been any effort to integrate TAFE into The Fightback package will give the young people of this country enormous opportunities. It is going to open the doors to higher education. It is going to open the doors to of TAFE. It is a package which will create jobs, and across this decade some two million jobs, who which will give young people the opportunities to work in internationally competitive that. industries, opportunities which this Government has denied them by its failure, bungling and ideologies. (Time expired)",41
172,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is one thing throughout this debate on which I would expect all honourable members to that unemployment is too high and that none of us in this place take any comfort from that. Having come to agreement on that point, I dare say that beyond that there are no other points of agreement in this debate as I have heard it. When one looks at policy and performance, there are major differences between the Government and the Liberal Opposition. Throughout today's Question Time, and in some of this debate, those opposite have been referring to various aspects of this Government's performance since 1983. I will do that also, but I think we should look at the starting point. I refer honourable members to the employment rate, the number of jobs that were actually in existence, when this Government came to office, following the last year of office of a previous Liberal-National Government with the mover of this motion as its Treasurer. In 1982-83 there were approximately 6.3 million people in work in this country. In the four years prior to that, the last four years in which the Liberal-National Government had the opportunity to create some jobs in this country, in global economic circumstances that were nowhere near as difficult as they are now, it managed to create a total of 300,000 additional jobs. In the immediate four years after we came to office, the number of jobs was increased by 700,000, more than double the previous Government's record. In this Government's period of office since 1983 we have maintained that stirling performance of job creation to the current time. Even with the losses that have regrettably occurred over the last year or so, there has been an increase in jobs, the total number of people in Australia able to work, of 1.4 million. That is a record of performance which those opposite were unable to attain in government when they had the opportunity and one which, quite frankly, their policies would not realise in the current climate. Another thing that is important to those who are unemployed is the number of job vacancies. It is one thing to talk about how many people are looking for jobs; it is another thing to say how many jobs there are for those who are out there hunting for a job. Looking at the unemployed to vacancy ratio we find that in the Opposition's last year in office-1982-83-there were 34 people looking for every job advertised. In the last financial year there were 20, which is a marked difference. Those figures condemn the Opposition's record as being inadequate in almost every year it was in government on the last occasion. The Opposition did not create the jobs and it certainly did not create an economic climate in which there were vacancies for people who were unfortunate enough to be unemployed. Even in the depths of the problem confronting us now, the unemployed have a better chance of finding a job. There are more vacancies now than there were when the Opposition was in office. It is worth making some reference to the predicament of unemployed youth, given that it has been raised in this debate. Fairly free journalistic licence has been given to some of these figures, with talk of 40 per cent of the youth of Australia being unemployed. In broad terms, that figure refers to youth in the full time labour force. As the Opposition knows but refuses to recognise, despite the protestations of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) a moment ago, the number of young Australians now staying on in education has doubled in the life of this Government. We now have a situation where the majority of the youth of this country-lSto 19-year-olds-are not in the full time labour market; they are in the education and training system. As the Min is t e r for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) mentioned earlier on, the unemployment rate of 15to 19-year-olds is in the order of 8.8 per cent. If we translate the same formula to the Opposition's record in office, we find that it was around 12 per cent.",41
173,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the reverse of your participation rate argument, is it not? I agree with what you are saying, but it is the reverse of what you are saying about the participation rate. If someone is not looking for a job it should not be counted.",42
174,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Not at all. There is a major difference with somebody staying in the education and training system gaining those skills. The honourable member for Bennelong made great play about the need for people to stay in the education and training system. He cannot argue that someone staying in the education and training system is not fulfilling a useful purpose. He has lauded that and he has to accept that as a legitimate alternative course to follow. When we start talking about youth unemployment, we should be comparing realistic figures. Some 190,000 new tertiary places have been created in the education and training sector, which stands in stark contrast to the sorts of policies which those opposite have been promulgating. I will not go on about the participation rate because the Minister has covered that point, although it is a valid point and does deserve recognition in the debate. The record of the last Liberal Government does not stand those opposite in good stead in this debate, or in any other debate for that matter. During the life of this Government we have been at pains to boost job training schemes. I have made some reference to that, as did the Minister. We have also embarked upon a program of removing inefficient work practices and job restructuring, the likes of which have not been seen in this nation before. That fact has been recognised by industry, which is going through that process, but it is not recognised in this place although it is known and understood by those opposite. Reference has been made on a number of occasions to the reforms which have gone on in the shipping industry. In summary, when we came to office ships in Australian waters under 2,000 deadweight tonnage and tonnage in excess of that were being crewed with 32 to 34 seamen. They are now being crewed with around 21 seamen. In fact, for the first time in a long time these levels are lower than the OECD average. Those sorts of structural changes which have occurred inevitably create some dislocation in the workplace, which inevitably creates unemployment. Members of the Opposition are dishonest in that they complain about unemployment, but at the same time they go out to business conferences around the country and preach a faster rate of job restructure and a faster rate of structural dislocation. Having dislocated a larger number of people in a shorter space of time, they then turn around and close down the social welfare systems which are designed to assist those people. Worse than that, the social welfare system that is left in place is just that-soc;ial welfare and not job training. The programs which have been outlined in the Opposition's so-called Fightback package do not provide any training component for Austudy. That package involves a payment; it does not involve any requirement on the part of employers to train the people who are displaced. The Opposition will increase the dislocation and at the same time will not provide the training to enable those people to acquire the skills which they will need. Some useful material has been written on the Opposition's performance in government compared with the current Government's performance. Time does not allow me to go into that, but I commend some of the writings of Austin DonneUy, a finance writer of some note in Queensland. He is well worth reading. I am sure the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) would have appreciated his contributions in many daily papers in Brisbane. Mr Jull-Oh, Austin!",42
175,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You ought to read Milton Friedman.,43
176,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have read that too. As a result of the changes to which I have referred, the export of manufactured goods has increased by over 100 per cent in real terms since we came to office. That is an increase in manufactured goods as well as an increase in our export of manufactured goods. Australia's performance in this area outstrips most of our trading partners. In real terms annual growth of manufactured goods has averaged over 15 per cent in Australia, which compares more than favourably with an OECD average of 6 per cent over the same period. This Government's performance has been about job restructuring, identifying the problems of the economy, and recognising the difficulties confronted by individuals who are the subject of that job restructuring. We have put in place the retraining programs and the social welfare system that provides these people and their families with support. None of those things are contained in the Opposition's argument or its policies today. In the end they will fail.",43

178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETIREMENT," I wish to advise the House of the retirement on 31 January this year of Mr Hillas MACLean, Parliamentary Librarian since December 1982, and to extend to him the Parliament's appreciation of his services. Mr MACLean joined the Parliamentary Library in 1979 as Deputy Parliamentary Librarian after distinguished service in New Zealand, which included the position of Chief Librarian in the General Assembly Library in Wellington. He was promoted to Head Librarian in the Parliamentary Library in 1980 and Acting Parliamentary Librarian in 1981. He was appointed Parliamentary Librarian, the head of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, in 1982. During his career with the Parliamentary Library, Mr MACLean presided over a number of important initiatives. These included: the 1983 proposal that the Library provide, on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliament, assistance to parliamentary libraries of the developing nations of the South West Pacific; the introduction, following the general election in 1984, of detailed library specific orientation sessions for senators, members and their staff-these sessions have been of great value to very many senators and members as well as being of considerable benefit to the Library itself; the development and implementation of the Parliament's information, storage and retrieval-ISR-system which is used extensively by members of both sides of the House; and the formation in 1986 of a departmental council, through which management and staff could exchange views and information on a wide range of matters. During Mr MACLean's term of office, the Library responded to a number of changes and developments which added to its workload and responsibilities. The increased number of senators and members following the 1984 election led to greater demand for the Library's services and required a rearrangement of resources to ensure that the Library's high level of client service was maintained. A particularly complex and difficult project during this period was the planning and implementation of the Library's move from the provisional Parliament House to the new building in 1988. That year also saw the culmination of a very successful aspect of Australia's Bicentenary celebrations: the Parliament's bicentenary publications project. The Library was involved with both book publishing and an oral history project. Mr MACLean served under three Presidents and four Speakers and represented the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library at national and international conferences and on visits to overseas legislative libraries and research services. On behalf of all honourable members, I wish Mr MACLean an enjoyable and productive retirement. The President and Mr Speaker have decided not to make an early substantive appointment to replace Mr MACLean. The Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, Mr Templeton, will continue to head the Library Implementation Group and will, from time to time, act as Parliamentary Librarian to handle matters requiring head of department attention.",44
179,Mr LLOYD,RETIREMENT,"I seek your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, to add my and personal best wishes to Hillas MACLean. I sure I am speaking on behalf of many other members as you have done, Mr Deputy time Speaker, with your comments. I first met Mr MACLean when he was still with the New Zealand Parliament. many years he has been in Australia found him to be a fine person to deal well as a very efficient administrator of the Capital Parliamentary Library. Therefore, seek to add those comments and express my best wishes for his future.

NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 [COGNATE BILL: NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991] Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 November 1991, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate this order of the day concurrently with the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",47
182,Mr LLOYD,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (4.33 p.m.)The Opposition has no objection to putting together the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill in the sense that a more general discussion or debate on primary industry matters can be allowed. In the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), three aspects of primary industry are involved: wheat, meat and national water resources. When one looks at the farm situation generally in Australia and at the recession that the rest of Australia is suffering, one has to use the word 'depression' for the farm sector. This financial year, which still has several months to go, will see the worse or lowest income ever recorded by the farm sector in the history of this country. We are not just talking about something that occurred back in the 1930s; we are talking about the worse financial situation ever. According to the recent forecasts of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the best performing agricultural sector will be the dairy sector, which will record a loss of $8,300 per dairy farmer on a farm business basis. For broad acre farming generally, it will be minus $32,000. If one happens to be an unfortunate wool grower, it will be minus $46,000. Those negative levels of income in agriculture are unprecedented, and I would suggest they are unprecedented generally for the rest of the Australian community at the present time. The Bureau indicated that there will be some pick-up in those average incomes in the next financial year. We have seen some signs already that that will occur, and that is very good as I think everybody would want to see it happen as much as possible. But I make the point that although there is talk about a pickup, for some, particularly grain growers, it could be December before any positive cash flow will be seen. In other words, a farmer would have to plant a crop, have the weather for it to grow and then harvest it before there would be any positive income. In the meantime, the farmer will need to borrow even more than he has already to plant that crop. For an individual producer this could mean $80,000 or $100,000. The matter has been discussed and debated considerably by the wheat industry in particular. The banks, the Government, and the coalition parties, on behalf of those hardpressed farmers, have been involved in these discussions. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has rejected the wheat industry's request for a particular form of underwriting which would give banks the necessary confidence to lend that extra money. Tomorrow night we will hear whether there will be any type of crop loan provision within the economic statement through part B of the rural adjustment scheme, whether it will be a just sum in relation to the Minister's promise that something will be done to assist farm credit through the banking sector or whether there will just be some manipulating with respect to the banks and their taxation calculations, having regard to requirements for tax and losses, et cetera, in their farm business loans. The banks have indicated that they will certainly do their best to meet those additional requests. The banks say that the level of debt on their loans to farmers over the next two to three months will be up 20 to 25 per cent on any previous level of credit extended to the rural sector in the history of the relationship between banks and farmers in this country. I do not share the Minister's criticism of the banks. He was only trying to deflect the legitimate criticism of the industry directed at the Government's own inaction. I certainly say to the banks, as I have said in discussions on a number of occasions with them, that for their own sakes as bankers, with regard to the assets that are mortgaged by them on lending for farms, it is to their advantage, as well as to the advantage of farmers. to ensure that those farmers are allowed to survive. The banks keep saying that they are very much aware of that. I hope that in the next few weeks it will be shown that the banks are playing their part. I suggest it is about time the Government played its part because, as is mentioned in today's paper, it is projected that the price of wheat for this season-wheat being one of the aspects of the Bill we are referring to-is now up another $10 a tonne to $180. That is certainly a good indicator for the future, although one has to acknowledge that the Northern Hemisphere crop is still to come, in the middle of the season, before the final price of the Australian crop is determined at the end of the year. I reiterate the coalition's policy with regard to the wheat industry, which is a continuing and a stable policy: part of our policy is a single year underwriting for the wheat crop, determined at the harvest time at 95 per cent of whatever that harvest price per tonne is determined by the usual procedure. Had that been in place earlier, the industry would now have greater confidence and had it been in place with regard to the wheat industry'S own continuing policy and requests, instead of jumping from one year to the next for different policies, it would have carried greater weight with the Government in that it is the policy of the alternative government. It is also a consistent policy, which is market-related. was worked out with the grains industry some years ago and would still be of considerable value to the industry at the present time.",47
183,Mr COBB,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The Government should look to adopting our policy. Mr LLOYDI agree and I think it would be good if the grains industry itself became a little more consistent in that matter too with what has been and continues to be a very sensible policy. With the debate now unfortunately warming up on the Wheat Board's position to maintain the export power-that is, the sale export or monopoly power for wheat exports from this country-I remind everybody, whether in the Parliament or in the industry, that the coalition's policy once again is to retain that power for the Wheat Board. It is not only wheat that is looking up; wool is also. In the statement tomorrow night it would be of considerable value to the wool industry if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were able to announce a flexible repayment arrangement following significant sales from the stockpile, which in turn would allow a reduction in the wool tax. That would allow about $300m-in other words, virtually next year's requirement of repayment for the Government's loan for wool sold from the stockpile-to be rolled over and to be utilised next year against the repayment schedule. At the same time that would allow a considerable reduction in the wool tax, while allowing a necessary increase in the percentage for promotion from 2 1/z per cent to 4112 per cent in total for both promotion and research and development, but still have a reduction in total to somewhere below 10 per cent. I remind everybody again that in the debate we had in this place in June last year the coalition stated quite clearly that 10 per cent was the maximum necessary for the industry to meet its commitments and to help wool growers to stay in business in that very difficult time. The Government started with 15 per cent and finally came down to 12 per cent. I think the figuring of the Government in relation to the wool industry bears considerable comparison with its figures with regard to its overall budgetary provisions, or statements, for this year. The Government gave a certain figure about what the Budget deficit would be this year and now we find that the Budget deficit is going to be about twice as much. Mr Jull-The wool figures have been way out.",48
184,Mr LLOYD,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"There has been some pretty woolly thinking on both issues. I hope the Government will be sensible, and tomorrow night is an appropriate time to make that announcement so that there can be better planning. I certainly commend the policy of the Wool Realisation Commission; I think it has been a sensible and successful one, and it looks like well over half a million bales-possibly 600,000-could be sold by the end of the current season. Another part of this Bill refers to the meat inspectors and imposes penalties on meat inspectors who receive goods or services from the proprietor or owner of the abattoir; in general terms, that means meat. I commend the Government for making that a specific offence, but it is only one of the many problems confronting the meat inspection service at the present time. That service is too expensive. I do not blame AQIS necessarily or the individual meat inspectors for that because it has been imposed on the industry as government policy but, as it has been imposed, the Government and AQIS have been too slow to respond to the need to become cost efficient. For example, only in the past few weeks has it become obvious that in Victoria, as part of this too expensive system, seven surplus senior meat inspectors are in abattoirs where there is no longer a need to have that additional level of inspection. We are told they are kept there because they may be needed and it does not cost the individual abattoir any money. It might be true that it is not costing the individual abattoir any money, but some of the other abattoirs are complaining that they are getting a special benefit because of that. Even on the basis of $68,000 to $70,000 costed out to abattoirs per inspector, it is costing the industry seven times $70,000. That is about $500,000 of unnecessary additional cost. Those seven inspectors are supposedly surplus, but we are told there are 62 other meat inspectors in towns where there is no longer an abattoir who were not required to move to a place where there was an abattoir. We are told they were kept because they 'may' be needed in some abattoir somewhere else. That is separate to the seven senior inspectors, but on top of that, in answers to a questions, it has been admitted that there are 150 surplus meat inspectors, if one goes on the Governrri.ent's figures. If one goes on the industry'S figures, 400 meat inspectors are surplus. That is over 25 per cent when one adds the other extra inspectors that keep coming out of the woodwork at these abattoirs, or perhaps I should say stainless steel if it was an abattoir. Over 25 per cent of the total meat inspection service is unnecessary and is costing the meat exporters of this country $70,000 a time.",49
185,Mr COBB,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What a ridiculous situation.,49
186,Mr LLOYD,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes, what a ridiculous question. It comes at a time when, if one looks at prices for mutton or beef, one sees they are certainly not selling at luxury prices for the meat producers of this country. That is just another example of the additional costs this Government imposes on primary industries, export industries and anybody in business generally. In supporting this legislation, that is fine with regard to the meat inspectors, but let us get on with sorting out the major problems in the meat inspection service. Looking at the part of the Bill dealing with the water resources, I think what has been done with regard to better accountability is sensible. I note that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is one of the major organisations for water resources and quality in this country. It is a very worthwhile organisation and it has recently released a report on the nutrient situation in the Murray-Darling river system. That release was timely because of the algal bloom outbreak, particularly in the Darling River. One has to note that at the time of the outbreak there was a drought and dry weather exacerbates the likelihood of algal outbreaks because the river drops to a lower level, and because of that the water is warmer. That encourages the development of the algal bloom. We all acknowledge and understand that this is a serious situation particularly if it is the toxic type of algal bloom. I want to make a couple of points in relation to it. First, algal bloom is not unique to Australia. In the United Kingdom it is very common in farm dams. The farmers there have their own method of fixing it; they put in bales of straw. It is also not unique to modem agriculture in Australia because the first recorded outbreak of algal bloom in the Darling River was in 1870. Those who know the Darling River generally know that it is certainly not an area of intense agriculture. It is not an area where fertiliser is applied along the great length of the river. Certainly right at the top of the river this could be so, although I think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bmce Scott) would want to say that the area is so naturally fertile that there is no need for any to be applied anyway. That is one of the points about the Darling and the phosphate level in it. With nutrients we are talking of both phosphates and nitrates and there is that natural occurrence in the Darling River. To put some balance and accountability into this debate, I acknowledge that it is a very complex situation because phosphates can occur naturally, as I have said. Agriculture, particularly when there is a mn-off situation either through irrigation, for example, or a wet season, adds to the problem. I make the point that we have had a drought in that area; in a drought there is no run-off. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission in its consultant's report acknowledges that agriculture's contribution to the recent outbreak would be lower than usual because of the dry situation with no run-off. In addition to the natural factor and agriculture, there are what are called single point entries, meaning regional sewerage authorities. That is where the Darling Downs does come in because Toowoomba and a tremendous number of regional cities such as Canberra, Dubbo, Shepparton and Albury, are along the river. To be fair to the regional sewerage authorities-I have had a number of discussions with them because they feel that they have been accused unfairly-there is a lot of industrial discharge into rivers from the regional cities as well as the ordinary town water run-off. So we have a complex situation. I am pleased we are getting a better balance in the debate and acknowledgment that agriculture is not the only cause. At the present time it is not the major cause. Agricultural practices as well as tertiary treatment for regional sewerage authorities and so forth have to be taken into account. Some people, in their reporting of this matter in the media, should have known better when they made some of their initial comments. Hopefully they have read that report and will now make more sensible comments. This brings me to the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, which allows the Commonwealth to obtain costs for court action against 11 New South Wales egg producers who owe $1.7m for the non-payment of hen levies. This came about when there were levies, but levies ceased in 1987. The action has been dragging on for some time. In the Poultry Industry Trust Fund at the present time there is $670,000. This would allow the Commonwealth to take from that presumably something less than-certainly no more than-$170,OOO for the pursuit of those non-paying egg producers through the courts because $500,000 has been transferred to the Egg Industry Research and Development Council for essential or very beneficial industry research and development. I note the commitment of the Government to pay into the trust fund any money that is successfully recovered, and presumably from that trust fund to the research and development fund so that the poultry industry trust fund can then be closed as was the original requirement when the whole hen levy legislation was terminated. So the coalition parties will not be opposing this legislation. I believe that in the context of the very serious situation facing agriculture today there are some positive things that the Government should be doing to lessen that cost burden on agriculture.",49
187,Mr COURTICE,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Hinkler) (4.54 p.m.)The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is an omnibus Bill. It amends the Meat Inspection Act 1983, the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. It is being debated cognately with the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) covered quite clearly the full gamut of the Bills. It is a minor set of Bills with administrative amendments to the ones I have mentioned. Several amendments are proposed to the Meat Inspection Act 1983. The first amendment to the Act provides for the definition of 'authorised officer' to limit the number of such officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. Currently, the definition of 'authorised officer' extends to all officers within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in addition to those appointed by the Secretary. Secondly, the Bill makes the Act consistent with current criminal law policy of omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. The Bill also incorporates into the Meat Inspection Act a new offence of authorised oftlcers receiving goods or services from the owner of a prescribed premises without the written approval of the Secretary. In 1991, this offence was introduced into the Export Control Act 1982. Section 35 of the Meat Inspection Act 1983 currently prohibits the owner of a prescribed premises from providing goods or services to an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers, and domestic meat inspection legislation must demonstrate the importance of integrity of inspection staff. That goes without saying. We have certainly come a long way over the last 10 years with regard to cleaning up the meat industry. We well remember the beef substitution scandals and the important role that AQIS has played. I would like to compliment AQIS for the role it has played with regard to quarantine and in ensuring that we have integrity that is recognised worldwide. The point is that, if we wish to get access to markets and wish to expand those markets, we have to demonstrate total integrity on the world stage. Number one quality is required and expected by the international community. I believe AQIS has played an important role, in conjunction with the Government, in ensuring that that is the case. Consequently, I think it deserves to be complimented. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said recently in Bowen that there can be no compromise on quarantine. Yet, when those opposite were in government, they had a very shabby record with regard to quarantine. They have attacked AQIS continually. I think they ought to make up their minds and if they do not want to compromise on quarantine, they should put fOlward some constructive policies. I recognise that in the past the honourable member for Murray has been constructive in some of his inputs on inspection. However, I think that the Leader of the National Party ought to make up his mind. If he speaks to his constituency with one view, he ought to be consistent here as well. The first amendment to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act from the Minister for Financerightfully, I believe-to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This will certainly simplify administration. The second amendment permits acquittal of program expenditures by the senior executive officer of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds. The third amendment makes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory eligible to receive assistance under the Act. Certainly there is a concern with regard to our water resources in this nation. It is the life blood of agriculture and we have to work very hard as a society to restrict the amount of pollution from all levels. The honourable member for Murray touched on this. It is not just agriculture that has to improve its act; it is also industry and the provincial cities. Many of the ingredients occur naturally in the land. If we do not have decent rains then we do not get decent run-offs and that is when we get a lot of the problems; but it is a big problem. I found that in Europe the problem has been exacerbated by the subsidies and the way in which the Europeans have flooded their land with synthetic or artificial fertilisers. Pollution has become a big headache in Europe. Cerbursed tainly it will eventually have an effect Europe's productive capacity. It is ironic Europe's subsidy system of massive handouts will work against it in the long run. artificial structure is now polluting Europe's environment. Through necessity, it is going reduce the way in which it can have a producEgg tive output. It is important when we discuss pollution that we recognise that it is problem. I would like to see many of the people in the extreme conservation movement who focus on negative aspects focus on the world problems and not just those here Australia. The amendment to the Petroleum (Sumade bmerged Lands) Act 1967 extends section 8H to enable delegation of routine joint authority powers under subsidiary acts such as the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) have (Registration Fees) Act 1967 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1967. It also corrects a drafting oversight the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) economies Amendment Act 1991. The last of those Acts in the omnibus is the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. This criticising amendment will extend by two months, to September, the date by which the Australian Wheat Board is required to submit its porate plan to the Minister for Primary dustries and Energy (Mr Crean) for approval. The sections concerning ministerial approval of the AWB annual operation plans will amended to remove the requirement for ministerial approval of the AWB's annual disappointed. operational plan in line with the recommendations of the Davis review of Commonwealth primary industry statutory marketing authorities. None of the proposed amendments affect government expenditure. They will have any staffing implications for the Department of Primary Industries Finally, I tum to the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill 1991. In his second reading speech the Minister stated: This Bill provides for amendments to the Industry Assistance Act 1965 to allow the ComThat monwealth to recover costs incurred in collecting and disbursing outstanding Commonwealth Hen Levies and for those costs incurred to be reimfrom the Poultry Industry Trust Fund. on Specifically, the New South Wales Egg that Corporation, the statutory egg marketing authority in that State, signed the agency The agreement with the Commonwealth and, following deregulation in the New South to Wales egg industry and the termination of the Corporation in October 1990, the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for colleca global ting all outstanding hen levies. Deregulating the egg industry in New South Wales is of concern to me. It is certainly of concern to growers in my State because of the in effect it will have in Queensland. Many people who have bought quotas and have a good living in Queensland are now under threat because of the deregulation in one State. When we have six States with differing views, it highlights the problems we of improving efficiency in this country. Over the weekend Queensland failed in a referendum to vote for daylight saving. We in failed to synchronise efficiencies and of scale on the eastern seaboard. We squibbed it by one hour. Many of the people who advocated the view of opposing Bill daylight saving have been consistently the waterfront and micro-economic 1 reform for being too slow, but when it comes to synchronising watches on the eastern corseaboard for tourism and commerce and to Inhave one linkage from the top end of Cape York to Melbourne, we squibbed it. As a consequence, that shows how much effort and be cooperation we are going to need to get through further restructuring. I am very I know that Queensland State politicians from all sides were prepared to back popular opinion. If I had been running a book I would not have been laying the No vote at 3 to 1 on, because we knew it was not going to get up. and Energy. But it is disappointing. Mr Bruce Scott-Why didn't you vote no?",50
188,Mr COURTICE,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I voted yes. It is disappointing because we failed to improve a little Poultry micro-economic reform in regard to time. is the sort of problem we have in trying to fix the transport system or any infrastructure when we have six State governments all with their own agendas and all looking inwardly instead of outwardly as one nation. The effect of deregulation on the poultry industry in New South Wales has had a dramatic effect on Queensland producers and producers in my area. I am not necessarily saying that deregulation is a bad thing, but when one State does it out of sequence we have a problem. Of course, that goes back to the 1890s when we saw the stitching up of the Commonwealth through factional agreements. We can still see the consequent effects of that today. As the honourable member for Murray said, we have the opportunity to be a little more optimistic with outcomes and prices this year. Wheat prices look as though they will improve. Weather, of course, has a big effect, and there is a crunch. I am sure the next speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), understands even better than I, coming from a bigger wheat belt, the effect of the crunch on credit and finances over the last two years. Growers will have difficulty finding enough money to plant a crop in order to get through the next 12 months. I pay tribute to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, for the rural adjustment scheme. There has been a lot of criticism of RAS. From the end of November, in Queensland alone, there have been 606 applications for part A of RAS and 427 have been approved. In part B there have been 120 applications and 101 have been approved. In part C, the area where farmers are helped to leave the industry with dignity, there have been 32 applications and 27 have been approved. That indicates the commitment of the Government to the rural adjustment scheme and certainly the commitment of the rural counsellors and the officers who work in the QIDC in my home State to help primary producers. There is no doubt, though, that some farmers have lost their equity. Many farmers are trying to hang on. It is tough. We have to make sure that we get the broader economic position right and try to minimise the effect of a world recession. It has often been said those on the other side that we have been blamed for the world recession. If Australia, with its 18 million people, created the world recession in the United States and Europe, it has much more power and influence in Zurich and Europe than I know of. The fact is that we are in a world recession. Commodity prices are bad because of corrupted trade markets. The world does not owe us a living. The world is a tough place. Aussies are good fighters and I think that agriculture in Australia is going to take on a bigger and better role. The good news is that Australia now exports $19.1 billion worth of products into Asia and the Pacific, a large proportion of which are agricultural products. We export $6.3 billion worth of processed and semiprocessed food products a year. That is growing and will continue to grow provided we keep on improving our efficiency and quality, we keep pushing the reforms we started in 1983 and will continue to make and we are successful in the GATT talks. Of course, in April everyone will be waiting to see the outcome of the Dunkel papers. I recognise that the leaders of the two Opposition parties now concur with our position on liberalised trade. It makes our fight a lot easier. It is unfortunate that in Queensland those in the National Party are still protectionists and for short term advantage at every farm rally run out the old voodoo economy stuff over and over again. They are still structured on the 1920s and 1930s and do it just to get a cheap vote. That is unfortunate, because it keeps farmers in ignorance. Farmers are entitled to know the truth. It is a pity that some of the National Party senators from Queensland-particularly Laurel and Hardy; I mean Senators Boswell and O'Chee-do not put the true point across. The other problem that concerns me in regard to agriculture is the goods and services tax and the effect it will have on agriculture. It is interesting that the Leader of the National Party went to Bowen the other day. He was a bit worried about the seat of Dawson because we are going to win it at the next election. He stood up and told the tomato by growers in Bowen how great the horticultural industry is, and it is. In Queensland it is an industry worth $700m per annum. The National Party is going to put a OST of 15 per cent on our domestic fruit and vegetable industry. That is a $101m tax. That is what it will do for farmers in Queensland. The National Party is also skiting that it will abolish the fuel excise. I would like the honourable member for Maranoa to go to his councils and tell them how they are going to fund roads. He should also tell the truck drivers what they will pay for registration, because one or two things are going to happen: they are either going to be taxed into the ground through road charges or the roads are going to fall apart. They cannot have it both ways. It is unfortunate that Jim Pennell, the head of the LOA in Queensland, who is a country bumpkin, a dill and a National Party lackey, has not had the courage to stand up and demand to know what the National Party is doing. He sat back for 32 years and watched the National Party rort local government, rip it off with transfer charges of $400m, and he never said a thing. I challenge him now to come out and say to people like the honourable member for Maranoa, 'What are you going to do with roads?'. We hear the LOA legitimately say, 'We want more money for roads', and that is a fair point. What are the members of the National Party going to do with roads? If they are going to abolish excise, where are they going to get the money from? They have already said it is going to come through registration fees. Tell us how much. How much are they going to put on the motorists, on the primary producers who have to drive hundreds of miles from the west, and on the trucking companies? Tell us now. The Opposition has had 12 months to put out what it considers is a good package. If it is so good, tell us how much is going to be levied on those trucking companies and motorists. I am interested to know. We all know what the OST will do to inflation. It will push inflation up through 10 per cent. What will that do to our competitive capacity? What will that do to us as an exporting nation? We have to sell 80 per cent of our farm product overseas. What it will do is limit and diminish our ability to do so. The other interesting thing is the story still doing the run by the League of Rights and some of the National Party supporters, who are one and the same, to maintain tariffs. This is at a time when we are almost to the point of success in the Uruguay Round. In Queensland the Nationals are still saying, 'Hold up tariffs'. That is putting at risk everything we have worked for since 1986. It is about time that the hillbillies in the National Party in Queensland understood that this country's future and its agricultural future are more important than theirs. They have their rallies in their little hamlets tucked away in their gerrymandered areas, and it is about time that they told the growers the truth, that if we put up tariffs we will see our beef, our wheat, our wool and our sugar sitting on the wharf because no one will buy it. We do not have the capacity to take on competitors such as Europe, Canada and the United States in a trade war. I do not know how long it is going to take to get that simple message through. It disappoints me. In closing I would just like to demonstrate the intellectual capacity we have to argue against in regard to getting information across in the bush. I refer to an interview on radio station 4LM between Mr Edward Knowles and Mr Bob Katter, who last weekend was endorsed as the National Party candidate for the seat of Kennedy. I am sure the honourable member for Kennedy did cartwheels down the street when he found out that one of the leading intellectual lights in the National Party has been selected to stand against him. The interview ran as follows: Ed: 'I wanted to talk to you because you actually stated some while back on our program that you didn't believe a GST tax was the way to go, but at that stage you didn't see the package. You've changed your mind?' Katter: 'Urn, I never changed my mind on it, Ed, in the sense that I was most certainly never going to buy a pig in a poke and, err,! think the expression I used was my Daddy told me was, never sign a cheque before the particulars were, err, filled in.' On the GST fuel price package: Katter: ' ... if we stay with the Labor Government next year our petrol tax will be over 70 cents.' Ed: 'Mmm... ' Katter: 'I'm sorry, the cost of a litre of fuel will be another 10 plus, err, three is 13 on top of what we pay now is 67, is 13, is 80 cents... ' Ed: 'Mm... yes.' Katter: '. . . 80 cents it would be.' Ed: 'Well, we're paying 74 out here, so we're looking at closer to a dollar.' Katter: 'err . . . sorry, it's more than that. .. err... it's been a while since I've been at the bowsers, obviously, but 74 you would be paying, err, that's err, 80 no 90 cents you would be paying.' It is funny, but the sad thing is that this is one of the leading lights in the National Party. That is the sort of rhetoric that goes across at rural meetings in the bush. When the country task force goes out there, the people get the truth, and sometimes they do not like it because it is hard to cop. That rhetoric is the sort of thing we have to overcome. Until we can improve the intellectual debate it is going to be much harder for people to understand the complexities of world trade.",52
189,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I listened with a fair amount of disgust to the temporary honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), and know I am going to be followed by the temporary honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) after my speech. As we are talking about leading lights in political parties, I thought the honourable member for Hinkler might have had a higher standard of debate in this House, being the Chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force. I thought he might have brought a higher standard of debate into this House, but if that is all he can contribute, I suggest he chairs a farce force, not a task force. I was interested in his comments on daylight saving because quite clearly he does not understand the issue in Queensland. I would hope the honourable member for Kennedy would have voted quite differently from the honourable member for Hinkler. I would like to let the honourable member for Hinkler know that west of the Great Dividing Range, Queensland is a vast State. In fact, it takes an hour for the sun to pass across my electorate. Mr Courtice-Do you know Cairns is west of Charleville?",55
190,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes, I do know that. If the honourable member for Hinkler had been in touch with his constituents and if he had looked at the 'no' vote in his electorate, he would have found he was wide of the mark anp was not representing his electorate. All I would ask him to do as chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force is to ensure that the Government's National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill, which is on today's Senate Notice Paper, is struck off, because whilst ever that hangs over the rest of Australia, and particularly in the light of the referendum that is to be held in Western Australia in the next few weeks, it threatens to override and make inoperative any legislation which States may introduce. Mr Hulls-Kick the waterside workers and tum the clock back. That is your attitude.",55
191,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I would hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable members for Hinkler and Kennedy would listen in silence and give me the same level of consideration as I gave the honourable member for Hinkler.",55
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I am sure they are listening, and whether they do so in silence is up to them, for a little while. If they decide not to do it totally in silence, as somebody else has said from this position, I will deal with them.",55
193,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to touch on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, which are largely housekeeping Bills. The first Bill makes amendments relating to the unauthorised receipt of goods for services by authorised officers under the Meat Inspection Act 1983, the eligibility of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to receive assistance under the National Water Resources Act 1978, and the corporate and annual operational plan requirement of the Australian Wheat Board. However, I believe the Bill does beg criticism, particularly in the area of some government policy and the areas it has still failed to address in the matter of AQIS. I know that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) did refer to this earlier in his speech. Only two years ago this Government moved for full cost recovery within the meat inspection industry and it has imposed an added burden on our export industry. It has failed to reform the work practices within AQIS-the sort of work practices that we see widely practised across Australia. We need to talk more about voluntary employment agreements because this country can no longer live by regulation or live by work practices which allow 35 hours of work per week, nine-day fortnights and 17 11z per cent leave loading. The impact of that sort of work practice on the meat industry means that even if one gave sheep to an abattoir, by the time they were processed and the meat inspection charges were imposed, they are still not competitive on the international market. By the failure of the Government to address the reforms necessary in AQIS to make our meat industry competitive we are losing valuable export opportunities, and I will highlight a couple of them as I go through what I have to say this afternoon. What the Government has done is add costs on an industry through moving to 100 per cent cost recovery, over which the industry still has no control. I would have thought we would have seen a reform of the inspection regime in AQIS, and we would have seen a lowering of the number of staff required to run AQIS. As we sit here in this Parliament today, six Australian farmers will leave. the land. I suggest to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that if we had that number leaving AQIS each day, we might move somewhere towards getting AQIS efficient. I would probably go a bit further and say that if we had that number leaving the bureaucracy in Canberra each day-I acknowledge that we need public servants; but do we need the number that we have?we might start to reduce the tax burden on all Australians because it is really taxpayers' money that is used to pay our public servants. There is an urgent need for something to be done. Unfortunately, this Government does not have the will to implement the work practices that are necessary to make us internationally competitive in this area; this is apparent from the deals that it has done constantly with the ACTU. In my electorate there is a producer of game birds-quail and pheasants. It is a small family owned and run business, with an abattoir. I will give an example of how government regulations make his operation almost totally uncompetitive. He has to pay a veterinary inspection fee of $65 per halfhour when he gets the vet into inspect the birds being processed. One can get the picture of a small quail, which would fit into the palm of one's hand, costing $65 per half-hour to inspect. Then there is a meat inspection charge of $322 per day and a registration fee of $395 per month. The best that that producer can expect for a quail on the open market, whether in Australia or elsewhere-he wants to access the Asian market and the European market-is about $1.30 per bird. The cost of inspection alone is 37c per bird. Almost 30 per cent of what he could expect on the open market for a quail is taken up in inspection charges. That gives some idea of the level of inefficiency in our meat inspection area. I believe that small abattoirs should be responsible for their own quality control, and subject only to random checks by government inspectors. It is a sensible approach. The market would drive it. If a producer were not meeting health requirements, his product would be removed. It would be a case of selfregulation. I saw an example of such an operation last year on the Atherton Tablelands. The honourable member for Kennedy should listen to this. There is a mango grower up there who has accessed the Hong Kong mango market. Inspection is self-regulated. If the product does not meet that country's rigid inspection standards, the whole container is taken off and that grower no longer has access to that market. It is a case of selfregulation, and the penalty is that an entire consignment-not just a carton or one or two mangoes in a case, but the entire consignment-is taken off. That is an example of how self-regulation can work. That producer has accessed very successfully the Hong Kong fresh mango market-so successfully that he really cannot supply sufficient quantity. He knows that on the export market it is quality that will sell first; then people will start to talk about price. Let us look at the charges imposed on the industry by AQIS. Apparently, a meat inspector earns about $28,000 a year. But the Government, through AQIS, charges the meat works $65,000 a year for that service. A veterinarian gets about $35,000, but the abattoirs must pay $93,000 for that service. As I said earlier, when the Government moved to full cost recovery it imposed all of those inefficiencies on our export industries. I hope that the Minister is listening to what I have to say and will try to do all in his power to reform this area as quickly as possible. It is the industry that is now paying the bill. I believe that, if you pay the bill, you have a right to a sayan work practices and to hire and fire. We need these reforms quickly as they are a matter of urgency. I mention also the pork industry. I have a lot of pork producers in my electorate. We have never really had an adequate answer from AQIS as to why it did not accept the Australian Veterinary Association's warning that, as far as it was concerned, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that there was not a disease threat to the Australian pork industry from the importation of pork from Canada. Not only is there insufficient evidence; I believe the question has not been adequately answered. If the Minister has the answer, I would be very happy to have it this afternoon. The Australian Veterinary Association is a body of professional people whose opinion should be respected. We need an answer on this from the Minister. We do not have adequate anti-dumping laws to ensure that this pork from Canada has a countervailing duty applied to it. It has been well documentedMr Crean-Has the industry put a case in yet?",55
194,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes, the industry has a case in. But, of course, the anti-dumping laws of this Government take so long to apply. It can often take six months or longer. We are going to speed up the process of anti-dumping and countervailing duties; otherwise, by the time action were taken, the industry would be decimated. That is exactly what is happening right now. Even the Americans apply a countervailing duty on pigs going from Canada to the US. I have to ask: what do we gain by allowing this pork into Australia? Have we gained access to the Canadian market? A meat processor in my electorate gained access to Canada for some product, but the consignment was rejected because of a lower case 'g' instead of a capital 'G' in the word 'kilogram' on the consignment. That is how petty people can be on the other side of the world. I commend the recent actions of a large supermarket chain in Australia, Woolworths. It has woken up to the fact that, if it does not support Australian industries, it will not have a domestic industry to supply some of the food products that it puts through its supermarkets around Australia. It has advised the suppliers of pork to Woolworths that it will buy only Australian pork. I commend Woolworths for that initiative. It has woken up to that fact. The Government has not woken up to it, but certainly a commercial enterprise has done so. Another aspect I wish to touch upon this afternoon is the innovative agricultural marketing program. I commend the Minister at the table for this program because it has been successful. However, we have to do a lot more. We do have a competitive advantage in that our agricultural sector, the farmers of Australia, are considered by world standards to be the most efficient. I am sure that the Minister acknowledges that. I know that he has been talking with many of these farmers to try to better understand their problems. In my electorate I have a very good example of this program working extremely well. Matilda Farms on the Darling Downs is accessing the fresh broccoli market in Japan. It is a niche market. While the northern hemisphere freezes over in winter, we have summer; it is an ideal opportunity for us to exploit the market. Producers can send food to the Asian market which has been grown in our summer when it cannot be grown there. Matilda Farms has accessed that niche market: it sends broccoli to Japan at a time when it cannot be grown there. It was with the help of the innovative agricultural marketing program that the company was able to access that market, and I know that it has appreciated the support that it has had under that program. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, we have always referred to the electorate of Maranoa as being very fertile. Some of the finest agricultural land in the Southern Hemisphere is in the electorate of Maranoa; I refer particularly to the Darling Downs area. What is more, it is only six hours flying time to where 60 per cent of the world's population lives, in that Asian area. I mention the example of a Darling Downs feedlotter who wants to access some assistance under the innovative agricultural marketing program. His is an exciting proposal because he wants to access the beef markets of Thailand and Indonesia. The producer is not after the very high quality beef market; he wants the middle market, the bulk market. The way that he sees of accessing that market and overcoming some of the infrastructure problems that we have in Australia - the inspection services, the taxes on many of the inputs, the fuel taxes on the transport of beef and the processed products and the wholesale taxes on the transport industry--is to go and set up an integrated beef feeding and processing operation in Indonesia and Thailand. Those in the processing operation will go to the breeder in Australia and say, 'We want a specific type of genetically engineered animal that can cope with the tropics, that will be lean in output and quantity of meat'. It will also mean that these feeder beef cattle producers will be able to sign a contract that in 18 months time they will produce the feeder cattle that will be sent to Indonesia Thailand to be fattened in those countries. The product that would be produced in Indonesia and Thailand will access the middle market, not the market for the high quality Japanese ox type of animal which Australia is noted for. There will be obvious advantages in this project. It is certainly innovative because it goes from the breeder who produces the cattle through to the consumer and marketing the product under the 'Darling Downs' beef label, which is well recognised in the Asian area in an expanding market. One of the problems of accessing the markets in Indonesia and Thailand is the level of tariffs to get into those countries. To get feeder stock into Indonesia, a 25 per cent duty is payable. To access that market with middle market meat, a duty of 65 per cent is payable. On top of that a sales tax is payable. All that amounts to about an 80 per cent tax on top of the landed cost of the processed product. The best way these people can see to be competitive and to access the market is to produce the live cattle in Australia, take them to the Asian area, to Indonesia and Thailand, and to feed them there. The meat works operations would be integrated with the feedlot in these countries and the locally produced Australian beef-a tremendous advantage-would be placed on the local markets in Indonesia and Thailand. It would give access to that market which, as we all know, is an ever-expanding market, without these high tariff levels. Once this market is accessed, there will be huge opportunities to expand the Australian beef herd and to get more risk management into the cattleman's enterprise. The cattleman would be able to sign a contract for the product to be sold eventually in the Asian area even before the calf is born in Australia. It is very innovative. I believe it is a proposal which deserves support from the innovative agricultural marketing program which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I am sure, will be looking at. I hope that he sees fit to support this project, which would be another success for the Darling Downs. However, in closing, I must say that, whilst this is very much a housekeeping Bill, I or would like to see a speeded up reform in the area of AQIS because the inefficiencies within AQIS are taxes on businesses. Inefficiencies are always taxes on businesses. If we are to get Australia's export perfonnance up and running much better than it is, we need to get taxes off businesses. The inefficiencies within our meat inspection services are just that: a tax on an export industry.",57
195,Mr WALKER,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Robertson) (5.34 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, as someone who was raised in your electorate and represents, as I do, a thriving farming community, I am pleased to direct my remarks this afternoon exclusively to the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. This amending legislation enables the Commonwealth Government, pursuant to a strategy evolved after consultation with the Australian egg industry, to make claims against the poultry industry trust fund and so recover its costs in collecting outstanding hen levies. I rise to speak to the Bill because the electorate of Robertson is proud of its thriving poultry industry, which boasts 65 large chicken growing sheds, servicing Australia's largest chicken meat processing factory, Chickadee Chickens at Lisarow, as well as a smaller processing plant owned by Inghams at Mangrove Mountain. Let me give the House some indication of the size of the industry. Chickadee employs 550 of my constituents, who process 156,000 birds each week, in turn producing annual sales exceeding $70m. The local fanners benefit from live bird purchases worth $450,000 each week from Chickadee alone. A great deal more are sold to Inghams and other processors. All in all, over 1,000 central coast residents have jobs in the industry, which makes an important contribution to our local economy. Honourable members will have noted from that description that my constituents are far more concerned about the production of chicken meat than of eggs. However, the economic arguments that have been applied in arriving at the hen levy when fonnulating the Poultry Assistance Act are no less contentious when it comes to chicken meat. The New South Wales privatisation-obsessed Greiner Government in 1989 deregulated the egg market in New South Wales, tenninating the Egg Corporation and throwing the egg producers in New South Wales to the mercy-and not so tender mercy at that-of .the major grocery chains. The industry has recently been under further attack by the dumping of imported dried egg white from the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Thailand. Similarly, the chicken meat industry is under attack from international dumpers. This crisis has been precipitated by the decision of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to consider an approach by the governments of the United States of America, New Zealand, Thailand and Denmark to allow the importation of poultry products to Australia whether they be in fresh, frozen or cooked meat fonn. I might say that the industry has not had the benefit of a full explanation of the nature of that approach and the reasons given to AQIS for it; nevertheless, that approach is being considered by the Service, which produced a discussion paper. That paper has been responded to in rather serious tenns, in concerned tenns, by the industry as a whole. The industry also commissioned a substantial economic study which was carried out on the possible effect on the poultry and related industries of the suggested importations. That study is entitled the Larkin report and, amongst other things, points out: No economic or social benefits to Australia would arise from the revaluation of quarantine restrictions on imported chicken apart from some temporary reduction in retail prices as subsidised foreign suppliers position themselves quickly to gain market share and destroy the base of the domestic industry. The report goes on to predict a rapid market penetration initially of 20 per cent, and obviously more in due course, by those imports. Many of the foreign producers are huge by Australian standards and are propped up by large government subsidies, particularly in the European Community. Fast food operators such as Hungry Jacks, MCDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which are international concerns and which have very large chicken producing facilities in their own countries, particularly in the United States of America, would no doubt take tremendous advantage of any lifting of the import restrictions to exclude local producers and to introduce their own product from their own country into those huge chains. The effect of the lifting of such restrictions-the industry tells me and I am sure it is right-would be catastrophic for Australia. Perhaps the real arguments that should be put before this House today so far as the Australian public generally is concerned do not relate to the catastrophe that would occur to the industry and to the many thousands of people employed in it, but to health considerations for the general public in Australia. The fact of the matter is that a wide range of avian diseases are dangerous not only to the Australian chicken industry but also to the health of Australians themselves. The costs of putting down an outbreak of an avian disease which affects the human population would be counted in hundreds of millions of dollars. It has occurred in other countries, not only in the poultry industry but also in other industries, at huge costs with the destruction of millions of animals and with the subsidies, levies and the like associated with such disasters. I make the point that disease controls are invariably looser in foreign countries than they are in Australia. Australia has always maintained the very highest of standards when it comes to public health. Many debates in this place revolve around whether our standards are too high, but no-one would disagree that our standards are not high at the moment-except perhaps the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). The chicken industry is deeply concerned that mycoplasma, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, avian influenza and bursal disease could be imported into Australia. For example, an outbreak of Newcastle disease for the first time in our modern history-although there was an outbreak during the Depression--would have a devastating effect on the industry. The last outbreak occurred in the 1930s and that resulted from the introduction of uncooked infected poultry carcasses. The import of chicken, even in a frozen or cooked state, could still produce that sort of disease in this country if it is evident in the country of origin. The diseases are present in the nations that are now seeking to ask Australia, through AQIS, to lift our restrictions. For example, Newcastle disease broke out in a large way in poultry flocks in California in 1971. It also broke out in the parrot population of California in 1991. That disease has also been evident in the United States of America in other states such as Nevada. Perhaps of more concern to Australian citizens is the disease salmonella and the variant of it---there are many variants-called pullorium. Outbreaks have occurred in the United States of America in commercial chicken breeding flocks over the last two years. The pathogens involved in that disease can travel in cooked meat. Salmonella pullotium is also present in Thailand, as are virulent strains of the disease IBDV. Manek's disease is a big problem in New Zealand and is costing that industry about 6c per bird to protect against its effects. If there was an outbreak in Australia that would be one of the continuing costs to the Australian economy and the Australian people because once the problem is in the country we must continue to protect against it. That would be a very significant cost to the industry. The AQIS discussion paper superficially, in my view, deals with the implications for human health of importation. It does consider salmonella enteritis, but seems to be taking the attitude that restrictions need be imposed only if and when a problem arises. That was not the approach taken in the United States of America. It has imposed a total ban on the impOltation of poultry products from countries which are not free from salmonella enteritis and its variants, as I have already described. The fact is that in all four countries seeking to enter our market classifications of the salmonella strain are evident. Another big worry is the antibiotic, antimicrobial and pesticide residue problem which comes from imports. Many drugs, such as chloramphenicol, which are banned in Australia are widely used in the countries which seek to export to our country. The point needs to be made here that poultry from countries which permit the use of any agricultural chemicals that are banned in Australia should not be allowed into our country. If the experts in our industry see fit to recommend to the Government the barming of, and have banned, chemicals that are used in the production of poultry, surely we should not be importing meat from countries where those chemicals are used. In talking about AQIS, I suppose I should comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa who wanted to return to the good old days of self-regulation in the meat industry. I think he was talking particularly about pork and game birds, but he obviously meant the meat industry generally. I find that very surprising coming from a member of the National Party. Surely the memory of the honourable member for Maranoa is not so dim that he cannot recall the scandal that erupted in this country not so long ago over kangaroo meat, which nearly destroyed our meat export industry. The whole industry, which is a very important industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Australian economy, nearly went down the drain because of irresponsible self-regulation--it was not even selfregulation; there were regulations in that area. But any suggestion that we go back to selfregulation in. that industry is really quite ridiculous. It may well be that some of the regulations are too oppressive or are unnecessary and can be cleaned up. But any suggestion that we should go back to the days when people could substitute other forms of meat and export dangerous meat overseas I think is quite outrageous. I am glad the honourable member for Maranoa praised the Minister for his innovative program in agricultural marketing. There is a similar marketing outlook in the egg industry. It might be relevant if I conclude by mentioning the egg industry, which this Bill is all about. I praise the Minister. Not only has he been innovative; he has also shown great courage and interest as an advocate of the farming community. He showed tremendous talents in his other career as an advocate of working people in this country and I think the farming community will look upon his time as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy as a time when it had a very fine advocate indeed. These highly intelligent programs are now coming forth to the great benefit of the industry. I am sure that the marketing outlook for eggs in this country-with the possible exception of New South Wales, because the New South Wales Government, in its mad rush to total deregulation and privatisation, has practically destroyed the egg industry in our State-will be very good indeed.",59
196,Mr ANDREW,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Wakefield) (5.47 p.m.)While we debate the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, which are currently before the House, we have on the forecourt of Parliament House a gathering of Australians who would protest at the direction this nation is taking. It is significant that we should have these Bills in the House while there are protesters outside it because many of the protesters are representatives of rural Australia who have been called here to protest because of what they see happening to rural Australia as a result of the policies of this Government. It is fair to say that, whether they are protesters outside this building, people in the gallery or people listening to this broadcast on their radios, we have currently in the community a higher level of cynicism about government programs than we have seen for some time. What was once a healthy scepticism reflected by Australians as part of the Australian norm has become a deep-rooted cynicism about anything that anyone of us proposes. While this legislation is supported by the Opposition and makes necessary changes, nonetheless it is true that we are all seen as being out of touch with what is happening in urban Australia and particularly out of touch with what is happening in rural Australia. I think there is a certain irony that we should be in this Parliament this afternoon debating an omnibus Bill which proposes amendments to a number of Bills, including the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act. That legislation deals specifically with the way in which the ACT and the Northern Territory will be made eligible to receive assistance under the Act, just as the rest of Australia thinks the ACT-and Canberra particularly-is more out of touch than it has ever been with precisely what is happening beyond its borders. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made much of the fact that this legislation focuses on what is happening to the River Murray and the Murray-Darling Basin. The irony that I want to highlight is that the dilemma that was being felt in the Murray-Darling Basin in my electorate, even by me as a Murray-Darling Basin irrigator, over the blue-green algal bloom was largely being fuelled by what was happening here in the ACT. Much of the problem being faced in the Murray-Darling Basin is not the result, as was popularly imagined, of what farmers or fruit growers do to irrigation water, and not even the result of the fertiliser load of that irrigation water where it runs down tile drains back into the river carrying phosphorous with it, but the result of sewage ponds located along the river and of Canberra's sewage itself as it flows down the Murray-Darling Basin. So we have a situation where we, the residents of this House, alleged to be out of touch, but even more pertinently, the residents of this city, equally alleged by the rest of Australia to be out of touch, are ourselves making a major contribution to a problem facing urban Australia, and we are doing it as a result, ironically, of the sewage that flows down the Molonglo River. I will quote the result of a recent report commissioned by the Murray Valley League. That report indicated that much of the problem currently being experienced by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, and much of the problem of pollution currently affecting the Murray-Darling Basin-the very essence of the legislation before the House which allows the ACT to become part of the funding of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission-is sewage related and some of it is ACT related. The report by the Murray Valley League has already been handed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), so he is familiar with its contents. What is really significant is that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, in its report, has found that much of the algae in the river system is caused by the pollution of the waterways and reduced flows in rivers because of increasing industrial uses. I quote from the South Australian Advertiser of Friday, 31 January this year: It says sewage treatment plants make up about 70 per cent of the pollution input. It says that plants at Wagga Wagga, Albury Wodonga and Shepparton are a major source of problem for South Australian irrigators and South Australian residents. It continues: The report says NSW sewage treatment plants pour more than 1330 tonnes of phosphorous and nitrogen a year into the river system. That is New South Wales alone. While you sit there, Mr Deputy Speaker, with a certain air of innocence, given the side of the range on which your seat is located",61
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Mr Nehl)Which seat is that?,62
198,Mr ANDREW,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. New South Wales residents generally have to recognise that it has not been agriculture in New South Wales, Victoria or in the southern parts of Queensland, but the location of sewage treatment plants, including the absence of an adequate sewage treatment plant in Canberra, that has fuelled much of the problem causing the blue-green algal bloom in the Murray system. The Advertiser further reported: The ACT disposes of about 850 tonnes a year, followed by Victoria and Queensland. While not in any sense opposing this measure to involve both the ACT and the Northern Territory in the opportunity for funding that is provided for national water resources, I stress that the location of inadequate sewage treatment plants and oxidation plants along the river basin is largely responsible for the environmental degradation we are currently experiencing. It is not only in New South Wales; there are plants in South Australia that similarly make a contribution to the phosphorous load of the river, but much of that load is coming from the population centres located along the river, particularly in New South Wales. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prepares to hand down his economic statement, he would do well to consider the contribution he would make to South Australia and also to the total irrigation system of the most important water resource in Australia if he were to allocate funds for the relocation of inadequate sewage treatment plants away from the river basin, particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. Before I entered Federal Parliament I was a fruit grower at Waikerie. Even the residents of Waikerie have a less than adequate sewage treatment plant located on the river flats. I think the existence of those plants and the continued support for them by State governments-and I say 'continued support' because the State governments are not prepared to adequately fund alternative locations-are an indictment on those governments, regardless of what their political colour may be. A responsibility rests now with the Federal Parliament, as it looks to major employment generation schemes, to consider what it could do for the River Murray flow if it were to relocate these sewage plants. It has been too easy to fall for the line that the farmers are the ones who have polluted the river basin. The reality, as this report shows, is that the population centres inappropriately located along the river basin have been a major source of pollution and ought to be addressed by the government of the day. My experience-and some people have heard me say this before-has been that farmers along the river basin, particularly in times of rural crisis, are inclined to use a minimum amount of fertiliser and use it assiduously and astutely so as to minimise the pollution flow they provide. My experience has also been that the application of organic pesticides is at a lower level in horticulture on the Riverland than it has ever been at any other time in the last 20 years. With the possible exception of use on apple and pear home fruit crops, the use of organic pesticides is now almost unknown. The contribution of sewage plants inappropriately located along the river adding to the pollution flow of the river is significant and ought to be addressed by the Government. There are a number of other aspects of the legislation before the House. One of them is the Wheat Marketing Act. I want to take up a point or two made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), because he was very anxious to score a cheap political point about what he saw as the Opposition's attitude to rural Australia. He said, 'After all, the Government has reform in hand and wheat growers ought to be celebrating what is clearly now a light at the end of the tunnel because the price of wheat is rising'. What he failed to address was the fact that farmers around Australia are still bearing interest rates of somewhere between 14 and 17 per cent, and some even higher. Those interest rates reflect the fact that the Australian economy is not well and we only attract investment in this country if we are prepared to offer high interest rates. Currently we have a situation in which farmers are bearing the brunt of what has been the historic policy of the Government. More than that, the honourable member for Hinkler wanted to simply suggest that there was something wrong with the way the Opposition was preparing to reduce farm costs by introducing a goods and services tax. He said that his experience had been that he had told the tomato growers of Bowen that every case of tomatoes they grew would be significantly dearer as a result of the GST. What he has not been honest enough to admit in this place is the intention of the Opposition, in introducing a GST, to effectively reduce the taxation load borne by every farmer and every Australian. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has boldly declared that he will prune $10 billion from Commonwealth expenditure, thereby guaranteeing all Australian taxpayers not that they will not have to reach into their pockets but that they will not be reaching into their pockets as deeply as Treasurer Dawkins clearly intends to do and as ex-Treasurer Keating has already done. The honourable member for Hinkler was also not honourable enough to point out to every tomato grower in Bowen that every farm input cost that that grower has which hears a GST will he rebated back to the grower. So every business cost is effectively tax neutral. But did we find that simple statement of fact emanating from the lips of the honourable member for Hinkler? Of course not. He did not let the facts get in the way of what he thought would be a good argument. The honourable member for Hinkler then said, 'If the Opposition rubs out the fuel excise, which it clearly intends to do, where will it find the money to fund roads?'. But did he not tell us that $2.6 billion of the money currently being generated by this Government never finds its way anywhere near roads? That is the money specifically taken from fuel excise, presumably for roads, which never gets there. The honourable member for Hinkler was ungracious enough to accuse my colleagues in the House, particularly those belonging to the National Party in Queensland, of being less than honourable in the way they were representing the tariff argument. It just happens that I was late into the House this afternoon because I had just returned from the electorate of Dawson-referred to by the honourable member for Hinkler-where I have been speaking not exclusively to members of the Liberal Party but to members of the Liberal and National parties about our attitude to tariff reform in the sugar industry. I would like to inform the honourable member for Hinkler that, far from opposition, I found the leaders of the sugar industry in Mackay clearly uncomfortable with both the Government's and the Opposition's attitude to tariff reform but not critical of it-as the Minister would know-if we are prepared to be as diligent about anti-dumping legislation as the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) says we will be, and if we are prepared to deliver industrial relations reform and waterfront reform simultaneously with tariff reform. I want to inject a little honesty into the contribution made by the honourable member for Hinkler. He suggested that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and his colleagues were less than happy with the coalition's-and, by the way, the Government's-attitude to tariff reform. Let me make a comment or two about where I stand on tariff reform as a citrus grower who faces the threat of imported Brazilian juice. Ten days ago in South Australia. I had the Democrats declaring what a dreadful crime had been committed by the Government and the Opposition because Californian navel oranges were appearing on the shelves in South Australia. As a citrus grower, I have no doubt that there were other citrus growers who wanted to know why I was not similarly outspoken in my criticism. But what is the reality? I know what the short term political mileage is-that is the course taken by the Democrats-but the truth is that I do not mind how many cases of Californian navels the Minister allows into Australia in February and March of any year as long as that technique allows me to send Australian navels into California in October and November. I happen to think that the Minister agrees with that point of view. Uncomfortable as it is, I have to recognise that if I lock out the Californians there is no way that this Minister or anyone else will get me into California. I want to inject a little sense of reality into this debate and particularly in relation to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Hinkler. I want in my closing remarks to refer to the contribution to the debate by the honourable member for Maranoa. He focused his remarks almost entirely on meat inspection. I thought the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) rather misrepresented what the honourable member for Maranoa was about. I did not hear the honourable member for Maranoa calling exclusively for selfregulation. I heard him mention selfregulation, I thought, as a technique for pointing out ways in which the present excessive cost recovery of AQIS could be reduced; that is, it was not put as a monopolised view but rather as a technique for saving expenditure and so reducing the costs borne by every Australian primary producer. In the context of the legislation before the House I thought that was a very sensible contribution to make. Finally, I turn to the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill 1991. As we are all aware, and as other speakers have said, under this legislation we propose to give the Commonwealth the power to recover costs incurred in collecting the outstanding hen levies from 11 New South Wales egg producers who owe $1.7m. This is not opposed by anyone in this House or any of the parties represented in this House. But, since we are reflecting on the poultry industry and on AQIS, I want briefly to relate to the House an experience I had right on Christmas 1991 where a word or two of commendation of AQIS would be in order. I had a situation where one of my constituents came to me representing a company responsible for the importation of fertile eggs for the hen egg and poultry meat industry in Australia. Clearly, as some hens in Ireland had shown some reaction to the inoculation that had been used, it could have been argued that one of the protocols had not been entirely met. That argument was taken up by one of the major competitors of this constituent of mine. Despite all the confusion of Christmas and all the lethargy that generally goes through the Christmas-New Year period, I had nothing but cooperation from AQIS as it endeavoured to work its way through this exercise in order to be sure of two things: first, that there was no threat at all to the egg industlY or the chicken meat industry in Australia; and, secondly, that what my constituent was seeking was in fact a perfectly reasonable request that it was able to meet. I end with that note of commendation of AQIS for its flexibility but nonetheless its concern and caution for Australia's quarantine standards. I pay AQIS a tribute in light of the many criticisms that frequently come its way as a result of the efforts it makes in exercising its difficult task",62
199,Mr HULLS,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I want to speak briefly on the Primary Industries and Energy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech, this Bill is an omnibus Bill containing minor administrative amendments to a number of pieces of legislation under the primary industries portfolio. I want to talk specifically about the amendments to the Meat Inspection Act 1983 and the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978. I have chosen not to talk about poultry because there are not many chooks in my electorate-not of the feathered variety, anyway. In fact, one of those chooks is Bob Katter Jr, whom we have heard has just won National Party preselection for the seat of Kennedy. But, feathers or not, I think that Mr Katter will have to do a lot of featherbedding in his attempt to win the seat of Kennedy. He will also have to upgrade his accounting skills, as can be seen by the quotation read to this House this afternoon by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). The Primary Industries and Energy Amendment Bill (No.2) makes a number of minor but nonetheless important changes to the Meat Inspection Act 1983. As the honourable member for Hinkler said, the Bill amends the definition of an authorised officer. The intention is to limit the number of these officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. As it stands, along with those officers appointed by the Secretary, any officer within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy can be described as an authorised officer. The current amendment will also mean that the Secretary can deauthorise officers. Currently, officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy cannot be de-authorised. Since the formation of the Deprutment of Primary Industries and Energy in 1987 this wide definition has not really been necessary. Importantly, this Bill adds a new offence provision to the Meat Inspection Act 1983. It means that it will now be an offence for authorised officers to receive goods or services from the owners of premises they are inspecting without the written approval of the Secretary. This complements section 35 of the Act, which makes it an offence to provide goods and services to an authorised officer. But the meaty part of this change to domestic meat inspection, if honourable members can excuse the pun, is that it ensures the integrity of the inspection staff in this important industry. No longer can they simply get in for their chop with immunity. It also brings the authorisation of domestic inspectors in line with those authorised under the Export Control Act 1982. If we do not have adequate domestic inspection ensuring local standards, we cannot expect to maintain and indeed to develop the full export potential of this significant industry. Exports of quality beef and veal to the Japanese and Korean markets is a growth area of real importance to this country and to the cattlemen of my electorate. ABARE estimates show that in 1990-91 Australia exported 733,000 tonnes of beef-veal with a value of $2,50Om. All meat exports accounted for $3.2 billion out of a total of $14.2 billion for all rural exports. Whilst our largest trading partner is currently the USA, which imported 367,000 tonnes in 1990-91, it is our northern neighbours, Korea and Japan, who are presenting us with the best prospects for growth. ABARE estimates here show that we already provide Japan with 196,000 tonnes of its 481,000 tonnes of imports in 1990. It is estimated that that will grow to 260,000 tonnes by 1996-97. Of course, that should make a lot of the cattlemen in my electorate happy, especially when one adds to that the projected growth in the Korean market from 81,000 tonnes to 115,000 tonnes in 1996-97. I think it also supports my argument, which I have presented in this House before, for improved all-weather roads servicing these isolated beef cattle grazing areas which are vital to our economy. This omnibus Bill also includes changes to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act that are designed to improve efficiency of administration. The first amendment transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The second amendment permits the acquittal of program expenditures by senior executives of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds rather than the State Auditor-General. This I think will expedite programs as well as acknowledge the independence of State Auditors-General. The third amendment makes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Ten·itory eligible to receive assistance under the Act. When the Act was drafted the Territories were administered by the Commonwealth and of course they are now self-governing. It is important, I think, that they have the same eligibility for funding as the States. I have spoken before in this House about the importance of the sound use of water resources in my vast and varied electorate. As I have said, the extremes of rainfall in Kennedy certainly reflect the Australian diversity. The Federal water resources assistance program was introduced by this Government in 1984-85 and, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it provides financial assistance to the States and Territories for water resource projects and related activities of national significance or, where special circumstances warrant, Commonwealth support. "" The allocation to the program this year is $26.4m to the States and Territories and a further $l1.3m to the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. A further $1O.8m has been provided for land and water research through the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation. As I have said before, I hope that some of this research funding can be used to develop appropriate systems to transport water over long distances by way of solar energy. This enhances a huge and, in the main, wasted natural resource in north-western Queensland. The establishment of the Corporation in July 1990 underlines the Government's commitment to the sustainable utilisation and management of Australia's land, water and related vegetation resources. The Corporation uses an intelligent, multidisciplinary and integrated approach to address this natural resource management issue that is experienced in a real way every day by the people in the electorate of Kennedy and, I am sure, in the electorate of Maranoa as well. This Government is apportioning funds constructively and intelligently with an eye clearly to the future; by that I mean an environmentally healthy future. These amendments to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act, with the emphasis finnly on efficiency and streamlining, prove that. It is a stark contrast to the pie-in-the-sky nonsense being spouted by the aforementioned Bob Katter Jr. It was a real source of concern to me to hear that the out-of-touch Mr Katter is running around parts of my electorate spreading his fairy stories about a Bradfield scheme to divert the Tully and Herbert Rivers inland. It seems just about everyone else in the world, including the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I am pleased to see, is able to understand the big picture-some, of course, better than others. Fanners and graziers in my electorate are addressing the problems of land management, the problems of salinity and soil erosion in an educated and, again, intelligent way. I think they are too smart to be conned by the unaffordable, unworkable and ultimately ludicrous idea of an inland sea. Farmers work smart and understand the foibles of inappropriate water resource management. After all, some of them are now paying the price for some inappropriate schemes from the past. In conclusion, I certainly support the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and I commend the Minister for in effect cutting back on some bureaucratic red tape and for increasing accountability at a local level. I might finally say that the honourable member for Maranoa seems to be caught betwixt and between somewhat. On the one hand he seems to be advocating a hands-off approach by government, especially in the inspection service. He has advocated selfregulation and, of course, such self-regulation in the past, especially in Queensland, has been flagrantly and crudely abused, as has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker). In this regard, of course, he refers to the mango grower from the Tablelands. That very same mango grower, a friend of mine I might say, has been greatly assisted by the Government's innovative agricultural marketing program. There is an essential place for government programs, not only to ensure the quality of produce grown in this country, but also to ensure the ongoing viability and expansion of rural enterprise. Mr Bruce ScoU-Self-regulating.",65
200,Mr HULLS,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I notice the honourable member for Maranoa interjecting. He may have voted No to saving daylight, but the way I hear he is travelling in Maranoa he may find it hard to save his own seat at the next election. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said there is a high level of cynicism about government programs in this country. Of course, the answer to this charge of cynicism about government programs which is put by the Opposition comes in the coalition's Fightback package: it simply gets rid of government programs. The harsh and crass expenditure cuts in that package would inevitably mean the slashing of most programs now in place to assist rural Australians. It would be a very harsh and unacceptable answer indeed. Finally, like the other speakers, I congratulate the Minister for introducing these Bills to the House. Mr CREAN CHotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (6.19 p.m.)in reply-I should say that, whilst the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is an omnibus Bill and covers a lot of the areas that have been touched on, the reality is that few of the issues that have been raised in debate actually relate to the issues in it and in the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. I am pleased to see that there is no opposition to the Bills themselves. Given that a number of issues have been raised, I think, given the time, it might be appropriate to respond to a number of them. n seems to me that three areas have been constantly raised in this chamber. The first area concerned issues associated with AQISnot the amendments to the Bill in relation to meat inspectors so much, but AQIS's role in tenns of ensuring that we do not allow any exotic diseases into this country and the question then of the efficiencies in AQIS. The second area raised relates to anti-dumping and the third broad area to receive mention was the amendments associated with the water authorities and the implications of them to algal blooms. I will just take the opportunity to try to make these points very clear. I think we need to differentiate properly the role of AQIS and anti-dumping measures. AQIS was established to ensure that the standards by which a product is imported into this country meets standards we consider appropriate and at the same time establishes a rigour so that this country, which has been free and continues to remain free from disease, does not unwittingly expose itself to some form of outbreak of disease for whatever reason. I think that the success of the quarantine side of the AQIS operations is not questioned in this place in ensuring that we do not have outbreaks that effectively could wipe out much of our rural industries if they were to take off. I think it is very important that we do not try to see or promote AQIS as a defacto antidumper. I note that members on the other side of the chamber are nodding approval, but it is still of concern that in their contributions the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and my colleague the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) both expressed concern about implications for the pork and the poultry industries. While AQIS is not under my direct authority in the portfolio-it resides with the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths)-by a previous carve-up of responsibility that I inherited I am fully aware of the concerns raised by both poultry growers and pig producers. I have had meetings with representatives from both those industries and I have undertaken to ensure that I will look carefully at the recommendations that come from AQIS. However, the reality is that, if imports the standards and if scientific evidence is available that establishes the means by which we can say that it is safe to import them, we cannot tum around and say, having established the rig our, that they should not be imported. I accept the point made by the honourable member for Maranoa concerning the view of the Veterinary Association in relation to the pork industry. I have undertaken to find out from AQIS why it still holds to its position despite knowing what the Veterinary Association asserts. I am still to receive that report, but it goes to underline my point: the pig producers cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say they want the integrity, the authority and the rigour established by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and then, on the other hand, not like the outcome and try to argue that despite the outcome we should impose some sort of requirement over AQIS not to import. If in fact the argument is about dumping, the appropriate mechanism to prevent that is not through the quarantine service, but through the anti-dumping authorities and the Customs Service. By way of interjection I asked the honourable member for Maranoa whether the pork industry had in fact lodged a claim with the Anti-Dumping Authority and he responded, by way of interjection to me, that it had; in fact the pork industry has not. I make that point because I often hear the Opposition trumpet along about the Government's anti-dumping provisions being deficient because it takes too long. However, if the industry has not even commenced a case, one cannot complain about the time associated with the procedures. I think a lot of misinformation is spread around the bush, with respect, concerning the Government's anti-dumping provisions because with two amendments made by this Government to hasten the pace of proceedings-the time scales in anti-dumping provisions-the reality is that we are now the fastest of all the countries that have anti-dumping measures. A Senate select committee on which Senator Boswell participated-and he goes around the country saying we should do it immediatelycame to the conclusion that getting to that meet preliminary stage could not effectively be done in less time than the 55-day time scale. My point is twofold: first, one cannot complain about the time dimension if a case has not even been commenced because that goes to the question of establishing the case, not commencing it, and that is fundamental to any anti-dumping provisions; secondly, one cannot just magically say, 'Let's shorten the period' and expect to have better anti-dumping provisions because they require, by the laws of natural justice and by our commitments in tenus of GATT, the case to be proven. That infonuation in relation to that case has to be gathered. I met with the pork producers as far back as December and they told me then that they were going to put a case in; they have not yet done so. I reiterate here what I have said often in the bush: so far as anti-dumping provisions are concerned, I take the stance that I would take the toughest line possible against dumpers because I think we should ensure that the people who are using corrupted production and exporting practices should not be encouraged. I stand firmly by that view but one has to make the distinction between product which enters and is cheap and product which enters and is dumped. Simply because a product costs less is not a basis in itself for keeping it out, whether it be through anti-dumping procedures or any other procedures. As a nation of exporters, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) acknowledged, we simply cannot afford to stop imports because they threaten. If they threaten because they are not fairly priced and do not reflect the cost of their production, I say we should take a tough stance on that. I have consistently argued that both in the Cabinet and in forums of my own Party, quite apart from the commitment I have made to the rural constituency. To correct the honourable member for Maranoa, who said that the United States has established a countervailing duty on pig meat, I should add that it has not. Mr Bruce Scott-I said 'pigs'.",67
201,Mr CREAN,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"On pigs, but not on pig meat. Mr Bruce Scott-I said 'pigs' only.",69
202,Mr CREAN,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Well, if the honourable member did say that, I missed it, because I understood that he said pig meat. If that is the case, I acknowledge that point. However, the honourable member is expecting the Government to take action against pig meat and therefore the comparison with the United States position, vis a vis Canada, is not as appropriate. In relation to the citrus industry, in the past week or so I had the opportunity to visit part of the honourable member for Wakefield's electorate-or what is currently his electorate; it might change after the carve-up-and I accept the thrust of what he argues about the reciprocity associated with what we accept and what we cannot get into other countries. That is an issue we need to pursue. The fact is that the citrus industry and the processors I met-and I also met with the citrus growers while I was in Berri-indicated that going on current trends of demand, because of the significant success of fresh orange juice promotion, they are going to face serious threats unless imports are allowed in, when it comes to being able to make the other, nonfresh citrus drinks. The reality is that imports are not all bad if in fact they are going to underpin the future viability of that industry. I think that point is acknowledged and I am pleased about that. Just on AQIS changes, I appreciate the comments made congratulating AQIS. We have introduced two measures: one is on domestic changes, which the States and industry need to implement, that will produce 25 to 30 per cent savings, while the other involves a reorganisation of AQIS and is expected to add another 25 per cent cost saving.",69
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I would not naturally wish to curtail the Minister's remarks, but could he advise the Chair whether he intends to continue after the dinner break? Mr CREAN I do not intend to continue after the dinner break; I will only take a few more minutes. Those two measures do hold significant promise in terms of reduced inspection charges. I am concerned about ensuring that those benefits are passed on to growers. What particularly concerns me in this country is that this Government has embarked upon significant programs of micro-economic reform that have driven efficiencies-this is just one example-only to find that those benefits are not passed on to the people who should be entitled to reap the benefits. Therefore, I have argued consistently in this Government for the need for effective competition policy to ensure that the benefits of micro-economic refonn, amongst other things, are passed on. In relation to the watelfront, for example, the Prices Surveillance Authority has a monitoring role to ensure that the benefits are passed on. I would be concerned in relation to meat inspection that efficiencies are being achieved and cost savings are being passed on from AQIS, but they are not necessarily translated to growers. It is of particular concern to me if all AQIS is going to do is build the profit in the process. It is for that reason I have argued-we had this discussion at the most recent meeting of the Agricultural Council-that AQIS has to do more to promote what the real savings and benefits have been. We then have to look seriously at where those charges are being passed on. I have undertaken to do that. That point should be noted here. The final point relates to the algal bloom. I acknowledge the comments that have been made that agriculture is not the sole cause of the problems associated with the algal bloom. I happen to believe that we really need to improve the waterways not just because it has a social dimension to it, but if this country really is to promote itself as the clean, quality food producer for the world-I think that forthwith. there is particular significant potential for that-the last thing we can afford to have is time. green sludge floating down one of our major waterways because I know what our competitors would be showing on television screens around the world as the effective counter to any promotion campaign. Therefore I take a very strong view about the need to improve water quality not only because of the domestic perspective but also because it has international ramifications, particularly on the trade side. The difficulty for the Commonwealth is a lot of the cause of the nutrients in waterways is, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and previous Minister's speakers have indicated, sewerage plants dotted along them. The fact of the matter is that they are not under Commonwealth control; they are under State Government control. I join with the honourable member for Wakefield in saying that the States need to do more. It is because I believe they need to do more that I have also been very active in promoting the need for us to get our waste management technology well and truly implemented. In my view the State authorities need to play their part in ensuring that technology is picked up to solve the problem. Question resolved in the afflnnative. Bill read a second time.

205,Mr NUGENT,PRIVILEGE,"I rise on a matter of privilege. In October of last year I made representations to the former Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on behalf  the matters Mr Radisich asked me to represent that to the Minister was a complaint about the the behaviour of a public servant, Mrs Lana Spearing. I subsequently learned from the office that my letter had been passed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) for action. I have received no further communication from either Minister. On the afternoon of Tuesday of last week, 18 February, in my electorate office in Melbourne I received a letter by facsimile from a firm of solicitors, Dwyer and Co. of Melbourne, who stated that they were acting on behalf of Mrs Spearing. Their letter stated that Mrs Spearing had been cleared of any impropriety by an internal departmental investigation in the matter concerning Mr Radisich. In their letter the solicitors stated that they required a written apology from me, together with clarification to be sent by me to both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training within seven days, failing which they were instructed to commence proceedings for libel. The letter was dated 13 February, albeit that I did not receive it by facsimile unti118 February, and therefore the implication was that I had 48 hours in which to respond. Attached to the solicitors' letter was a photocopy of my original letter to the Minister. I believe that the letter from Dwyer and Co. amounts to an attempt to intimidate me as a member of the Parliament and is an attempt to impair my independence in the future performance of my duties in representing constituents and corresponding with Ministers. This is also the type of situation in which other members might find themselves in the normal course of their duties when representing constituents and it could be considered that such action could have wider implications. I ask, therefore, that this matter be referred to the Speaker to establish whether a prima facie case of privilege exists so that a motion to refer the matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges could be given priority. I am able to submit herewith copies of the correspondence from the solicitors concerned.",70

207,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1991 is an omnibus Bill covering a wide range of taxation matters, mostly technical, but including some substantial policy issues. Amendments are proposed to be made to depreciation allowances, anti-avoidance provisions relating to deduction recoupment, balancing adjustment and partnership roll-over relief under capital gains tax, dividend rebates and defelTal of deductions for pre-payments of trading stock. It is also proposed to amend the tax file number system, the taxation of foreign source income and substantiation discretion in relation to fringe benefits tax. I move the amendment circulated in my name, as follows: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""while not opposing the passage of the Bill, the House strongly criticises the Government: (1) for its action in bringing on debate on the depreciation aspects of the Bill when the Prime Minister proposes to make a major economic statement tomorrow, one aspect of which will deal with new depreciation arrangements; and (2) for its failure to adopt a comprehensive approach to much needed taxation reform"". The proposed depreciation amendments are designed to give effect to announcements made in the March 1991 industry policy statement. It is indicative of the policy paralysis of this Government that we are debating these changes to tax law, not only nearly a year after they were first announced, but the very day before the Government makes another allegedly major economic statement which will be forced to address this very question because of the inadequacy of the Government's measures announced in the original industry policy statement last year. Of course, that policy statement was only one of many non-event statements made by the Hawke-Keating Government, and it remains to be seen whether the Keating Government can improve on that record, It will be very interesting to see whether the likely changes to depreciation arrangements in tomorrow's statement actually complement those contained in this legislation or whether they will supersede them to an important degree. It would not be surprising, given the Government's past record in these matters, to find that the depreciation measures we are considering today will have effect only from 12 March 1991 until 26 February 1992, only to be replaced by a whole new set of arrangements tomorrow which will add confusion and uncertainty to the tax laws affecting depreciation arrangements. It is accordingly highly appropriate and necessary that this House strongly criticise the Government for its handling of legislation in relation to depreciation arrangements, as is provided for in our second reading amendment. Unfortunately, many areas of the Bill pose problems for taxpayers and tax practitioners. The Bill as a whole threatens to introduce more confusion and uncertainty into parts of taxation law. I hope to highlight these difficulties in the committee stage of the Bill and obtain some sort of response from the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), so that these issues might be addressed before we forward the Bill to the Senate, where such matters are increasingly dealt with to the detriment of this chamber. Clearly, this Bill has not been adequately drafted and it reflects the way in which the Government introduces Bills in a mad rush at the end of a sitting year for the convenience of its legislative program rather than with a view to sound law making. It is reasonable to suppose that the Government's legislative program for 1992 will be largely determined by tomorrow's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We have been informed via leaks to the press that this is to be followed or accompanied by the release of a Treasury Department assessment of the impact of the coalition's Fightback proposals on Australian households. Needless to say, this assessment will be built on the assumptions deemed necessary to give the desired result, which of course will be one unfavourable to the coalition's policy proposals. Such a modelling exercise is an affront to the taxpayers who will foot the bill for this partisan political propaganda. It is also a gross affront to the professionalism and integrity of the Treasury officers forced to churn out this stuff. There is no doubt that this affront to the integrity of the Treasury officers has led to some of the leaking from Treasury as to the nature of the project. The Public Service is clearly embarrassed by the role it has been forced to perform under this Government. In any event, we have every reason to take any such assessment with a grain of salt, because even when the Treasury is making Budget forecasts it is inclined to get things dreadfully wrong, with perhaps the overbearing influence of the Government attempting to fiddle the figures. If the Treasury, under the direction of the now Prime Minister, could not be relied upon to produce even ballpark figures on the state of the macro economy, it would seem unlikely that it could generate meaningful conclusions about the micro economy, particularly on the basis of the dubious and intrusive household expenditure survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I remind honourable members of the following 1990-91 Budget forecasts and subsequent 1990-91 Budget outcomes under this Government and the considerable discrepancy between the two. For example, projected gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent for 1990-91 turned into a contraction over the 1990-91 year of minus 0.9 per cent. One could not be much farther out than that. The forecast unemployment rate of 7.25 per cent actually reached 8.4 per cent. The forecast Budget surplus of $8.1 billion for 1990-91 deteriorated into a surplus of a mere $1.896 billion-$6 billion and more out. So we can be excused for treating with indifference the analysis of our Fightback package, made in the name of the Treasury, when that analysis surfaces later this week, next week or sometime in the future. According to some private sector studies the Budget deficit for this financial year, 1991-92, could blowout to as much as $9 billion, even before making any allowance for the new spending initiatives that will be announced in tomorrow's statement. A major contributor to this outcome will be an expected fall of 8.1 per cent in real terms-that is, $5.4 billionin tax collections due to the recession-induced collapse in the Federal Government's revenue base. Tomorrow's statement will regrettably be a pump-priming exercise with a great deal of window dressing substituting for substance and with doubtful value and benefit in the longer term. However, any such stimulus will come too late to make much difference to the breadth and depth of the current recession which is now the most protracted as well as the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The additional fiscal stimulus will ensure that we have increasing interest and inflation rates if and when we ever come out of the recession, thereby putting in jeopardy the prospective recovery and the sustenance of any recovery. In fact, the Government will be paving the way for another recession, all for the sake of being seen to do too little too late. We run the great risk of finding ourselves in that rolling recession that we have experienced over the last almost two years continuing well into the future. Some economists describe it as a dead cat bounce. The Government and, in particular, the Prime Minister have an appalling track record in the area of economic forecasting and we should be asking how the Government and the Prime Minister have been able to get away with getting it so wrong over such a long period. If the Government has not learned from its mistakes over the past nine years, it would seem most unlikely that it will get things right in tomorrow's statement-at least not on the presently available indicators. The politicisation of Treasury in these matters extends to the Australian Taxation Office, which is, of course, responsible for the administration of the Bill we have before us today. Last week we were treated to the results of the Australian Taxation Office audit of the top 100 companies in Australia and the news that the program may be extended to include a further 500 companies, thereby extending this audit operation to the top 600 Australian companies. The Tax Office now claims that it has raked in an additional $1.3 billion in additional tax and penalty payments as a result of this particular audit program since it began in 1988. It is very interesting to note that out of this $1.3 billion in claimed extra tax collections, only one case of tax evasion was uncovered, tax evasion being illegal, as all honourable members would understand. Clearly, most companies are complying with the terms of the tax law, and this has been recognised in the Tax Office report announcing the results of the program so far. More than half of the revenue collected from the large case audit program has come from companies which have taken positions in grey areas of the tax law which are entirely legitimate, but subject to dispute at a later date. Indeed, it is reported only today that BHP is to take to court a dispute with the Tax Office over some $185m as a result of one of these audits. This is the bulk of the $193m that the Tax Office contends is owed by BHP in back taxes and, who knows, it is probably included in that figure of overall collections to which I referred earlier. A total of over $550m is currently under dispute in this way, with the Tax Office expected to collect about half of that amount. It is also noteworthy that only one per cent of the liabilities emerging from the large case tax audit program from grey areas of the law had a relevant ruling to guide the taxpayer at the time that the relevant transaction took place. The results of the large case audit program have been hailed as something of a great success, principally by the Tax Office itself in self-justification, but by few if any other commentators, even the Government. The results of the program are in reality merely symptomatic of a massive failure in the making and administration of tax laws in this country. The size of these belated revenue collections is indicative of an extremely complicated tax law with high compliance and collection costs, and makes adherence to the law a luxury even for the largest corporations, let alone individuals and those owning and operating small businesses. Many companies are clearly unable to comply with the tax law without the assistance of an audit team from the Australian Taxation Office over a period of weeks and sometimes months. But whatever the merits of the large case audit program, it is outrageous that so much effort is being poured into such audit activity, which may now be extended, when the tax law simplification program is being starved of adequate resources. This Parliament and the Australian people have been promised a major tax law simplification exercise since the then Treasurer Keating's statement in February 1990. Yet almost nothing of note has emerged from the Tax Office on this front. The large case - udit program is purely revenue driven and has little value in clarifying the law for other taxpayers and does little to help the targets of the audit. What value it does have lies in allowing the Tax Office, and by extension the Government, to be seen to be cracking down on the tax affairs of Australia's larger companies. There is a widespread perception that these companies do not pull their weight in tax matters, and the Government seeks to capitalise on this perception through the audit activities of the Australian Taxation Office and, I might add, the well-publicised activities of the Tax Office. However, the Australian Taxation Office's own audit program has revealed this perception to be unfounded and it is not helped by the misleading way in which the preliminary outcome of the large case audit program has been reported in the media. n is about time the Government got its priorities right and got on with the job of simplifying the tax law instead of devoting the better part of its resources to harassing corporate taxpayers into impossible compliance responsibilities. We will not see the end of large revenue takes from the large case audits until we sort out the current mess in tax laws. I hope we can make some progress in this regard in the committee stage of this Bill. In the light of all this, it is not surprising to find that the head of group taxation at the National Australia Bank, Mr Martin Crowe, in a speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, recently called for a major review of Australian Taxation Office powers. Under our self-assessment system, taxpayers are required to self-assess complicated aspects of our confusing tax laws but are then faced with a penalty system which is still built largely around the old system whereby the Tax Office was responsible for calculating tax liability. There is a pressing need not just for the simplification of tax law but also for a complete overhaul of the penalties regime, to better reflect the advent of self-assessment in the tax system. Not only is our tax system an administrative nightmare; it introduces some major disincentives to investment and damages the international competitiveness of our exports. These disincentives have been highlighted recently in a number of reviews of business taxation by the Industry Commission and, of course, by business groups. While the Government ignores these fundamental problems with the taxation system, the coalition has tackled them head-on in its Fightback package. I refer the House to chapter 9 of the main Fightback! document which sets out in great detail our proposals for the reform of the administration of the Australian tax system. Of course, the coalition also plans to remove a whole raft of business taxes, including the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax. The removal of these taxes will be not just a major boost to business and consumers; some of the great complexity in the tax system, particularly in the case of wholesale sales tax, and the compliance costs associated with this complexity, will be removed. The country can simply no longer afford to make the mistakes with its tax system that are now enshrined in taxation law. The cost in terms of economic growth, jobs and export performance is simply too high. Many of the nearly one million unemployed people in this country owe their plight to the current state of the taxation system and the disincentives built into it for the wealth creating business sector. Those include the 100,000 unemployed people in my own State of Western Australia, which my colleague the honourable member for  well. Currently, incidentally, that State has the highest level of unemployment",71
208,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Indeed; it is the highest in the nation. In this regard I would like to bring to the attention of the House the submission to the Federal Government, prior to the drafting of its economic statement, from the Taxation Institute of Australia entitled Possible Tax Measures to Stimulate Employment in Australian Industry Generally. It should be noted that neither the tax institute nor the Federal coalition endorse all of the proposals contained in that submission. Some of them are noteworthy, however, for being in accord with the coalition's policies and they provide a useful reference point against the actual contents of tomorrow's statement. The Institute's No. 1 submission calls on the Federal Government to provide funds to the States by way of State grants to provide relief from payroll tax. Of course, this is perfectly consistent with our proposal to abolish payroll tax and is absolutely essential to any pro-jobs growth strategy. The Institute suggests introducing partial relief from wholesale sales tax and the delayed introduction of a modest goods and services tax. Of course, these suggestions are half-measures, but they do at least point the Government in the right direction, which is the direction taken by the Fightback package. The Institute suggests a complete redrafting of the Income Tax Assessment Act, to be completed in six to 12 months. This redrafting would renumber the existing provisions, remove dead wood and rationalise definitions and anti-avoidance provisions. The aim would be to reduce the enormous compliance costs imposed by the current tax system to which I have already referred. The Institute has previously suggested that the Government extend concessional tax treatment for savings income up to $2,000 per annum through the introduction of a resident withholding tax, which is clearly analogous with the coalition's tax free saving proposals. The Institute's recommendations in its earlier report on taxation and the environment, providing write-offs for environmentally related expenditure, could also be looked at seriously. The Institute suggests deferring the introduction on 1 July 1992 of the proposed superannuation levy, which, of course, the coalition has opposed from the outset. Similarly, the Institute has called for release from the training guarantee levy, which we identified from the beginning as a de facto payroll tax which would have negative implications for employment in this country. The coalition is accordingly committed to aholish the training guarantee levy. The Institute suggests extending capital gains tax roll-over relief to the owners of existing businesses wishing to sell those businesses and who purchase or establish a new business. This is completely in accord with our proposals for a modified capital gains tax which recognises the need to provide roll-over relief to small businesssomething we have supported since the release of the Government's own Beddall report but which has been ignored by that very same Government. Other useful proposals include allowing companies to elect to make quarterly cash payments to improve cash flows and predicaments associated with contracting cash flows-to avoid the regular spectacle of hundreds of businesses going to the wall because they simply cannot meet the terms of new company tax payment requirements. Greater flexibility with substituted accounting periods for business and the deferral of the introduction of the foreign investment funds legislation are other possible job creating tax reform proposals. What these proposals indicate is the extent to which the coalition has been putting forward a pro-jobs taxation policy, both in our Fightback package and in policy debates prior to the release of that document on 21 November last year. They also show the extent to which we have been ahead of the Government in recognising the fundamental problems confronting the Australian taxation system, with particular regard to job creation and economic growth. It is thus quite likely that the Government will lift significant elements of tomorrow's statement from the coalition's tax refonn proposals contained in the Pightback package.  own.",75
209,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I think it is quite likely that the Government will do a bit of stealing, but that is one of the great forms of flattery and we would welcome it. But that will not be as successful as it would be if the Government were prepared to adopt the whole package-swallow its pride, adopt the package and let the Prime Minister go back to where he was in 1985, in wholehearted support of a goods and services tax of the kind that we propose. We do not begrudge the Government for pinching our ideas as those ideas that it is likely to pinch are very good ideas. But we do begrudge the fact that this Government has been in office for nearly nine years and has failed to deliver across the board in the area of taxation reform despite a number of abortive attempts, such as the 1985 tax summit. Por the Government to embark on these reforms now would be to admit to ninefor going on lO-years of policy failure in the area of taxation reform alone. The implemenopposite tation of these tax reform measures would the coalition far more credit than it would the Government, and we would welcome such a development accordingly. That is an offer bipartisanship which will be spurned. Even to the extent that the Government lifts our ideas, of course, it will not acknowledge that we led it and actually forced it in that direction. It is entirely appropriate that this House should condemn the Government for its failure to adopt a comprehensive approach to much needed tax reform. Even were such reform, miraculously, to appear tomorrow or at some other time in the life of this Government, it would be far too little, far too late.",76
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded?  ment.,76
211,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has decided to tum this into a wide-ranging debate on taxation law, so I hope you will allow me to make some general comments of the kind he made. Let me begin by stating that we are not about to impose on the Australian people a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services. The reality is that, if we were to do anything like that, we would justifiably be thrown out of government. Indeed, if by some miracle the Opposition ever did get into government and was able to implement such a measureassuming that it could pass through the Senate-the whole of the Australian nation would rebel against it. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you imagine what it means to the average person to have a 15 per cent tax imposed on every good and service: on food, on clothing, on the basic necessities of life? That is what the Opposition is talking about. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, the reason the Opposition wants to impose this tax is that it does not have any solutions in the economic arena. It has not had any solutions the past 10 years. It does not even know how the economy operates. Therefore, those come up with this nonsense that do somehow a goods and services tax will miraculously transform the economy, create jobs. In what way would a goods and services of tax create jobs? I would give a PhD to anybody who could explain how that in itself, without investment, creates jobs. Mr Rocher-He has already got one-the Leader of the Opposition.",76
212,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"He has got a PhD, but it does not apply in this particular area, I can tell the honourable member. The reality is that the goods and services tax is a con trick on the Australian people, an attempt to persuade them that this is something new that will do something for the economy. It avoids the big questions about how employment will be created. As the Prime Minister mentioned today at Question Time, it appears that the Opposition feels that it can create lots of jobs without spending a penny; that it can get all of this reform-new infrastructure projects, the building of roads and rail-without spending a penny. That is what the Opposition seems to think is the reality. When the Government discussed with the private sector the possibility that we may have to spend some money in infrastructure development, the private sector, including business leaders, said to the Government, 'You had better spend some money on infrastructure'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith)-another of the really brilliant economic geniuses in the Opposition-said, 'You have to do all these things but you cannot extend the Budget deficit. You can do these things but you cannot spend any money'. How the hell will we do that? One has heard of Houdini, but this is ridiculous. The situation is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition then had the officials in his office produce a report which, according to this genius, says that, if we spend $3 billion, it will cost $40 billion on the current account. This is Jhat he said. When one asks for an explanatlOn for the calculation that the expenditure of $3 billion would increase the current account deficit by $40 billion, of course, one cannot get one. The journalist who wrote the article in the Australian newspaper does not either. I am still waiting for an explanation as to this nonsense, this scaremongering-and scaremongering is what it is. Opposition members are saying to us, 'You have to do something about the economy'. They are saying to us, 'You have to expand the economy, expand growth'. But when it is proposed that some money be spent on this matter they say, 'The expenditure of $3 billion will cost us $40 billion on the current account, and therefore you should not do it'. What sort of nonsensical economic explanations are these people into? We have to be able to do something in the area with which this Bill is concerned. I have been talking about depreciation allowances for some time, and we have to do more in that area. The honourable member for Curtin, who has just spoken, was saying that the Government has to do this, it has to do that and it has to do the next thing. To do all these things costs money. It might not have occurred to him that it will cost money. If it costs money, it means that the deficit will be increased. If there is to be an increase in the deficit, does that then mean that we will have to face the problem that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has come up with? Is it only when we spend the money that there will be a cost to the current account of $40 billion, and that when those opposite spend the money it does not matter? What an absurdity! The reality is that those opposite are very good at putting forward in this House spending proposals in all sorts of areas but, when we put forward concrete, serious proposals that will get this economy moving in the areas of infrastructure and private investment in manufacturing, they get up and attack those proposals on macro-economic grounds on some foolish moral. This House will have a very big debate in the next few months. The issues are very clear. The debate will be on an economic recovery based on serious economic proposals that will, indeed, cost some money; but they will be clearly funded and they will be funded in such a way as to make sense, not by taking money from people through this vicious new tax, the goods and services tax. It is my intention-and I am sure it is the intention of every member of this House on the Labor side-to point out that we do have proposals, concrete ways of going forward in terms of investment, especially in manufacturing, while at the same time creating jobs, which we are all concerned with. The mere idea of imposing the tax proposed by the Opposition and hoping that somehow this will change things and lead to investment is absurd. I have talked to businessmen, small and large, about the GST. They have said to me, 'We do not know what to make of this GST. We cannot work out how it will lead to a situation where we can invest more money and make more profits'. They do not know. Of course they do not know. It is not explained in the so-called thick document. We do not see any explanation as to how investment will get going; as to how production will get going; as to how manufacturing will get going. This is the real difficulty with the Opposition's proposals. Its proposals are, as I said before, a con trick, a Houdini trick. They do not seriously address the questions facing the economy. If we are to be serious about these questions, we have to look at the depreciation regime. The fact is that the Government put down proposals last March to give additional incentives for investment in plant and equipment. It then revised those proposals, as is recognised in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), on the basis of serious discussions with the business sector in September. Even after those two revisions, we are dissatisfied with the level of investment in depreciable items. I am very hopeful and moderately confident that in tomorrow's statement we will see even further measures in relation to the stimulation of private sector investment in productive enterprises, especially in the areas I have mentioned: manufacturing industries and export oriented manufacturing industries in particular. That is what this country needs. This country does not need some transformation of a tax regime from income to expenditure. That will not solve any problem. This country needs a way forward to get people investing in new plant, in new equipment, in jobs, in building and developing the nation. That is what is required. Nothing the Opposition is putting forward will get that going. In fact, if anything, its proposals are regressive. They will attack the average worker and they will attack poor people who will pay more proportionately as a result of this dreaded GST-15 per cent on everything. A poor family may be spending most of its income on the basic necessities of life-which are not taxed today, but they will be taxed. That is the reality of what will happen with this new goods and services tax. If those opposite ever get into government, we will have the most regressive reactionary tax ever imposed on the Australian people. That is truth of the matter. The Australian people are very fair-minded and when they understand the real meaning of the Hewson proposals they will reject them. They will also recognise that the proposals themselves do nothing to help them in terms of employment and creating jobs. What extraordinary mythology it is to think that the extreme Right policies of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), which have been discredited in Britain, the United States and Canada, will help to create employment. All of those countries have tried these proposals and have found them to be discredited. But what do we get from the Leader of the Opposition? We get these proposals which have failed already in other countries. In November last year the British Tory Government recognised the failure of the Thatcher proposals and put forward a $25 billion spending package to help stimulate the economy and create employment. Those opposite tell us that if the Australian Government puts forward $3 billion in expenditure proposals, that will bring down the economy and lead to a $40 billion current account blow-out and other such nonsense. It did not happen with the British economy. If anything, the problem was that the spending package in Britain was too little too late. It looks as though the Tories will be in some bother in the forthcoming election because unemployment has not gone down significantly. They came in with their package far too late. It is not too late for the Australian nation. The Australian nation needs very important proposals that are constructive, that will stimulate the economy and get it onto a growth path. It needs real proposals, not the nonsense we have been getting from the Opposition. It seems to me that this longawaited statement, this statement which has taken a lot of effort on the part of many people-particularly the Prime Minister himself-will put together a plan that will not merely work in the short teon to kick-start the economy, but will direct us towards goals that will establish this country into the future and really build our infrastructure base. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, knows what I am talking about when I speak of the infrastructure base that is necessary in this country. We need to upgrade our roads, our rail system and our ports. We need also to carry out capital works programs in a whole range of areas. Mr Bradford-More money for roads; we support that.",76
213,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The honourable member supports more money for roads; but how will he pay for it? He will pay for it by imposing a 15 per cent tax on food. That is what the Opposition will do. But it does not have to do that. It can work it out in a much better way if it is prepared to listen to proper economic theory instead of the Thatcherite nonsense which has been rejected overseas. But of course nobody wins preselection for the Opposition if he or she dares to talk about any expansionary program. One now has to be on the extreme Right to get preselection for the Opposition. The Opposition has lost all of the small '1' liberals. Anybody who does not agree with Thatcherite policies is dumped to the back of the back bench. Mr Robert Brown-And gets thrown out of the Parliament.,79
214,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Or is thrown out of the Parliament altogether, as happened with Ian Macphee. Can you believe this? The Thatcherite theories have been rejected by all the conservative parties throughout the world, except one: the Liberal Party of Australia, which is dominated by a front bench of so called economic gurus who are living in the past. They do not understand history. It is really amazing that after what happened in New Zealand and in so many other countries, they are proposing to impose this 15 per cent tax and to have no other concrete proposals to get the economy going in tenns of investment and jobs. How can anyone take those opposite seriously? Of course, the Australian people will not take them seriously. The days are gone when those opposite thought they could get away with this GST proposal without its being challenged because we had to sort out a few internal problems in the Australian Labor Party. They do not need to worry about that; those problems have been sorted out. Those opposite now have to face the reality of the full force of the Labor Party thrown against their foolish proposals. Let me tell them, it is a pretty fonnidable force and one which will certainly deal with those proposals. They are absolute rubbish, they are absolute nonsense, and they have nothing to do with refonning the taxation system or getting a complete depreciation regime in place. I have put proposals to the Prime Minister about accelerating the depreciation regime. That is the sort of thing we ought to be looking at: an accelerated depreciation regime that can get people investing right now in plant and equipment. But the Opposition does not have any such proposals. Its proposals are all based on this nonsense of the GST. But there will be no GST. Do honourable members know why there will be no GST? It is because the Australian people will not accept it. There is no chance whatsoever of those opposite winning the election if they go to the polls with such a proposal. I can assure those opposite that when the Labor Party is able to put its concrete proposals forward as to what we are doing in real tenns to get the economy going, to get growth, production and infrastructure development going and to get our people back to work, they will have very little to say. Anyone putting forward a proposal to impose a 15 per cent tax on food, clothing and the basic necessities of life in such a way that a poor person will pay a lot more than a rich person-and that is what is involved herewill end up being defeated. I can assure honourable members that in the next few months we are looking at a horror time for the Leader of the Opposition. It started here today. Last year he had a fun time. He was able to float his proposals and he thought there was no intellectual challenge to them. But we see that there is even an intellectual challenge to them from the very people who drafted the proposals. They at least have the honesty to say, 'This proposal will result in negative growth'. Can anyone imagine putting forward a proposal which not only does not create new production and new jobs, but also actually promotes negative growth so that we have a situation which is worse than having a recession? The Opposition will bring this on by putting in this 15 per cent tax. What an extraordinary phenomenon. As the Prime Minister pointed out today, Murphy himself has said that inflation is a big danger-it may go out to 10 per cent. So we will have very little growth, inflation andworst of all-increased unemployment. I remind people that when Margaret Thatcher was elected she promised to reduce unemployment through this formula. But what did she do? Unemployment tripled, not doubled, in Britain under million unemployed-that is a great record.",79
215,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Our record is that we are in a temporary recession. We will get this nation out of the recession because we have created 1.5 million jobs in the last 10 years and we will go back to the normal Labor tradition of creating more jobs and more production. That is the normal Labor cycle and we will return to that. This recession is an aberration from the point of view of the Labor Party, and we will be back into growth, jobs and support for industry through these measures.",80
216,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has revealed to us tonight the full extent of his economic illiteracy. We are talking, I take it, about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), though one could sit here for 20 minutes and not get any inkling of that from listening to what the honourable member for Calwell had to say. I must observe that the Government has its big economic guns trained on us tonight with the honourable member for Calwell talking about economic genius and economic gurus. I do not know what he has his PhD in, but I am sure it is not economics. He says he does not understand or know much about what a value added tax is or what its economic benefits are. I suggest to him that he can do no better than to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because back in 1985 he was one of the great advocates of a broad based consumption tax for this country. After the honourable member for Calwell leaves the chamber he might go around to the Prime Minister's office and get a quick lesson on how the GST works. As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said, leading the debate for the Opposition earlier tonight, the Opposition is in general agreement with the broad thrust of the legislation which is before us tonight and which amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. Some of the proposed measures are certainly complex and I doubt, with the greatest respect to the former Minister Assisting the Treasurer, whether in making the second reading speech he understood entirely what he was talking about. The 193-page explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Minister's second reading speech is in itself something like an accounting textbook. I suspect that even accountants would have great difficulty understanding this document. The legislation itself extends to 86 pages. The taxation Act and its regulations have grown over the last 30 years from a few hundred pages to thousands of pages of law and regulations. People in the accounting profession, in particular, and many other people, know just how difficult it is. We only have to ask any accountant how difficult it is to keep up with changes in taxation law. It has become extraordinary complex, yet the legislation continues to be patched. We have another example here tonight, with the legislation having another 86 pages patched onto it. The Opposition, as is reflected in our amendment, is somewhat bemused by the timing of the introduction of this legislation. We hope that tomorrow night the Prime Minister will seriously address the issue of taxation reform. I am very happy to support the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Curtin, which condemns and strongly criticises the Government for its failure so far to adopt a comprehensive approach to much needed taxation reform. I think that should be on the top of the Prime Minister's agenda tomorrow night. I look forward to seeing whether, after nine years, he has finally come to grips with the need for comprehensive taxation reform in this country. I remind the Prime Minister of the report of the small business inquiry, the so-called Beddall report, which my colleague alluded to in his address. It states: The area of Commonwealth Government regulation which emerged as of greatest concern to small business during the inquiry was clearly taxation. Concerns were raised and recommendations made about almost every aspect of Commonwealth taxation income, company and provisional tax, sales tax, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation and trading stock evaluation. However, the most pervasive, and the Committee believes most important, complaint has been about the rapid growth in size and complexity of taxation law. Two years down the track since the comprehensive report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was tabled in parliament, there has been no serious attempt to address these issues. The report and, with respect, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) have been a great disappointment to the small business community in this country. I suspect that, with the very real prospect of the coalition winning the seat of Rankin at the next election, the Minister will not be back here in any case. As I have said, and as the shadow Minister for small business, housing and customs, the  has said, the. Committee made some very clear and sensible recommendations in respect of taxation reform and capital gains tax. Recommendation 34 says: Given the existing capital gains tax regime, capital gains tax should be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. That is very sensible. Nothing has happened. The Committee said of wholesale sales tax: Wholesale sales tax has been one of the areas of Commonwealth taxation subject to extensive criticism in evidence in the inquiry. It has been described as one of the most complex, contradictory, administratively difficult and costly of all taxes, particularly for the small business community. The Committee recommended as follows: The Government initiate a public and comprehensive review of the wholesale sales tax system including sales tax law and its administration. What happened to that recommendation? Nothing. The Government has sat on its collective hands for two years and it has fallen to the Opposition to come up with an alternative taxation system for Australia, a system which addresses the problem of the wholesale sales tax by simply abolishing it, wiping it out and recognising it for what it is-inequitable, unfair, complicated and everything else that has been said about it, not only by the Beddall report but by others-and at the same time abolishes six other taxes which are equally counterproductive. The Opposition has addressed the concerns of small business in respect of capital gains tax as well. The Government has had two years to do something about it. Perhaps we will see the Prime Minister finally addressing this issue tomorrow night. I challenge him to do so. The most counterproductive aspects of the capital gains tax as it affects small business include: firstly, 80 per cent of the goodwill value of a business up to a ceiling of $lm is liable to capital gains tax, which is a significant deterrent to anyone who works hard to build up a business; secondly, the application of capital gains tax to the nest egg assets of Australians who sell their business on retirement, as many people do, which is legitimate. They work for many years to build up a small business asset, which they liquidate as their retirement package. We address that· issue as well. Thirdly, the application of capital gains tax to assets sold in the process of expanding a business, a major disincentive to growth and employment; and, fourthly, the application of capital gains tax, and its administrative burden, especially to very small investors. Very small investors and many individuals are quite innocently caught up in the capital gains tax net. The coalition has recognised, and for some reason the Government has not, that these things can be addressed fairly simply. Each of those matters that I just mentioned have been addressed in the Fightback package. We have made a commitment to addressing the wrongs which are imposed on small business by virtue of Labor's capital gains tax. We recognise. and this is something of a change from our position of some years back, that there is a legitimate place in the income tax system for a tax on capital gain derived as income. However, in government we will remove the worse aspects of Labor's capital gains tax, which is penalising Australians who are 50 prepared to work hard on their own account. The coalition has decided to adopt certain changes to Labor's capital gains tax arranless. gements. Firstly, the tax payable on a capital gain will continue to be calculated according to the existing formula using the marginal rates of tax applying under our taxation policy. These rates will be significantly lower than they currently are under Labor. Secondly, an exemption will be introduced on small net capital gains made by individuals. An ail ... t individual taxpayer who in any year has made net gains which they assess to be under $3,000 may simply specify the year of acquisition of the assets concerned, their nominal purchase price and their nominal sales price. Subject to normal audit provisions, these taxpayers will then pay no tax on relevant capital gains. Thirdly, under our proposal for capital gains tax relief for small business, there will be a Marginal rate Average 1982-83 schedule for tax brackets 1982-83 (a) 0 30.67 4462 35.33 17894 46 19500 60 35788 (a) The marginal rates were changed during 1982-83. This scheme shows the",80
217,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The message from this table is clear: due to the impact of inflation since 1982-83, tax brackets ought to have been approximately doubled to avoid the arbitrary impact of bracket creep. When they were not increased, taxpayers were shunted into higher brackets and therefore into higher marginal rates. Although that might sound a little bit technical, everyone out there knows what I am talking about. One is simply being penalised through bracket creep for earning more money. per cent relief on the part of a capital gain attributable to the sale of goodwill where the sale price for the goodwill is $500,000 or However, the worse feature of the present tax system is the way in which it has systematically ripped off Australian workers. This Government, in the time it has been in office, has increased its revenue by billions of dollars through stealth; that is, by hanging onto revenue generated from bracket creep. Taxpayers have crept into higher income tax brackets as nominal incomes have been increased because tax brackets have not been indexed. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table from the Opposition's Fightback package which demonstrates the effect of bracket creep. Leave granted. The table read as followsTHE 1982-83 TAX BRACKETS-ACTUAL AND INDEXED 1982-83 tax brackets indexed for inflation to 1991-92 dollars not less than not more than not less than not more than I 4462 1 8607 17894 8607 34517 19500 34517 37615 35788 37615 69035 + 69035 + average which applied in 1982-83. Also in reference to that table, if the tax brackets that had applied in 1982-83 had been indexed, average earners would face lower marginal rates than they do at present. The table shows quite clearly that if the brackets had been indexed a person on average weekly earnings would now face a marginal rate of 30.67 per cent instead of 38 per cent; a person on twice the average income would face a marginal tax rate of 46 per cent. According to the Business Council of Australia, most individuals on middle incomes in 1990-1991 paid a higher rate than on the same real income in 1985-86. Indeed, Access Economics found in 1990 that: In all the years since 1982-83 the total personal income tax burden ... has been higher than would have been the case under tax bracket indexation. The additional tax burdenthis is probably the bottom line, the most important aspect of that table, and why I described it as ripping off the Australian workercumulated over the period from 1983-84 to 1990-91 is over $22 billion. In other words, $22 billion has been ripped off Australian taxpayers simply through bracket creep. That is why I described this as being taxation by stealth and the Government is guilty of that. The burden of bracket creep has been borne predominantly by lower and middle income earners rather than those on high incomes. Although the Government has attempted to paint its tax cuts-given, as we have observed, to buy wage restraint - as being of significant benefit to taxpayers, in reality these tax cuts are now shown for what they are; that is, they have done nothing more than simply repay just a small part of the proceeds of bracket creep. Bracket creep is just another example of this Government's ineptitude in the administration of taxation. In the time remaining, I want to tum briefly to that part of the Bill before us which deals with depreciation amendments. There is no doubt in my mind, and I am sure the Opposition shares this view, that Australia's taxation system must give adequate incentives to business investment. I am sure that the effective life basis for assessing depreciation which is addressed in the legislation will be welcomed. The Opposition will, however, maintain its commitment to a further review of depreciation arrangements when we come to government. That commitment is spelt out in the Fightback package and I believe it is a significant indication of our intentions in respect of depreciation policy. Because of the location of my electorate and the committees that I serve on in this place, I have a particular interest in tourism. There is no doubt that some of the proposed changes in this Bill will be beneficial to people in the tourism industry, but I hope we will be able to go further and provide incentives for people to invest, particularly to enable Australian companies, corporations and individuals to invest in tourism. Although particularly on the Gold Coast we have had fantastic development over the last 10 years, largely financed externally, it is a matter for regret that Australian financial institutions, individuals and corporations have failed to recognise the potential that the tourism industry has within Australia. I hope that will be changed. One way that it may be changed-it may have to be changed-is through greater recognition of the possibility of providing incentives for Australians to invest in tourism. I was interested to observe, in respect of the Government's approach to depreciation, the recent VFT debacle. That, more than anything, illustrated how inadequate our existing tax laws are in that they do not contemplate projects crossing State boundaries or financing structures necessary for a project such as the VFT. I think many of us saw great benefits in the very fast train proposal. Certainly, if it had ever come north from Sydney through the Gold Coast to Brisbane it would have given enormous benefits to my electorate. But, without arguing those, I wonder what the Prime Minister might say tomorrow night about that particular project or similar projects. Here we had a $6.5 billion project, the largest investment project under consideration in Australia at the time. The consortium sought agreement in principle for a change in the tax law to enable the tax deductions generated within the project to be set off against profits in the hands of the shareholders to achieve the same impact that would occur for virtually all other investments in this country. The consortium's request to the Government for lO-year depreciation and changes to law to enable the issue of long term zero convertibles were made in the expectation that the Government would find these measures reasonable. The consortium never envisaged, and I must say I did not envisage, the opposition that the consortium received to every proposal that it put forward. I am not going to argue the benefits, because it is not relevant to this legislation. I am simply talking about the effect of the tax law on that particular proposal. The consortium was proposing to provide infrastructure of great value to the nation entirely at private sector cost. The essential issue is that the new company and its shareholders are capable of achieving comparable tax impact, as occurs with other structures within which virtually all other private sector investment in this country takes place. That did not seem to me to be an unreasonable request. The difference with this project is that it was so large that the existing tax law was unable to cope with it. The Governrnent was not proposing to change the law in that particular situation. As I said, the legislation we are dealing with is largely acceptable to the Opposition, although we are somewhat confused or bemused about the timing as we look forward to what the Prime Minister might say tomorrow night to seriously address the issue of the need for taxation reform. I support the Opposition's amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin that we criticise the Governrnent for bringing on this debate on depreciation aspects tonight, in view of the Prime Minister's intentions to make a major economic statement tomorrow. We certainly strongly criticise the Government for its failure to adopt a comprehensive approach to much needed taxation reform.",82
218,Mr MCGAURAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1991 has a number of purposes. It makes 16 amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In the time available to me I wish to concentrate my remarks on that part of the Bill which involves research and development taxation concessional allowances. As honourable members would know, by 30 June 1993 the tax concession available for research and development falls from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. I wish to speak about the changes to the taxation laws affecting the research and development tax concession. The proposed changes in the Bill before the House this evening have three effects. Firstly, there is a maximum deduction of up to 150 per cent for expenditure on eligible plant written off over three subsequent years from when that plant was first eligible for concessional R&D treatment prior to 30 June 1993. This will have a number of effects. It will meet obligations incurred by the Government in signalling the availability of the concession to industry and the change in the deduction threshold. This is considered important as plant constitutes the heavier end of R&D expenditures. The scheme, which was commenced in 1985, was to finish in June 1991 but was extended in the May 1991 science and technology statement to June 1993, with a further phasing down to 125 per cent to 1995. The scheme was then to be terminated. However, the 12 March 1991 industry statement extended its life indefinitely at 125 per cent. There can be no argument that industry investment was guided by the belief that the scheme would be operating at the 150 per cent level. If anything, government vacillation on the scheme has distorted investment. I would contend that the proposed measures before the House discriminate between large and smaller companies in respect of their degree of capitalisation in a recession. Better placed companies can bring on investment and avail themselves of higher deduction rates while those trying to clear the recession and invest later will attract only the lower level of deduction. This is an initiative which will benefit a small number of big companies. The whole scheme, for all intents and purposes, is designed to benefit larger companies with taxation liabilities. It is more likely that the Governrnent in truth has allowed this extension as part of a political strategy to bring forward as much investment as possible before June 1993. Plant is an investment which can be brought forward with ease because, unlike other R&D activities, it does not require a developmental or incubation period. Undoubtedly the Governrnent strategy in this regard will form part of its wider ploy to offset the real nature of the fall in private investment and artificially inflate the numbers. Let me tum to the second major effect that the proposed changes will have. This relates to deductions for core technology which will be limited by the Australian Taxation Office to arm's length amount. This phrase, 'arm's length amount', according to other references in the Bill, means 'not artificially inflated'. So the object of the Bill is to extend the existing provisions containing claims for deductions by drawing in core technology deductions as well. 'Core technology' refers to intellectual property, the idea from which a development project proceeds. Under the existing criteria, the scheme allows companies to deduct expenditures incurred in acquiring or developing such property or core technology at 100 per cent since May 1990. Obviously there has been a problem and companies are utilising the definition of core technology to inflate valuations thereof. No further information is provided in the Bill about this matter. There is a history of problems arising from the way in which companies manipulate core technology for taxable purposes. In May 1990 the Government moved to halt companies utilising these provisions for purposes other than those intended, but it seems that further changes are needed. This amendment to the principal Act suggests that the administration of the Act has met with continuing difficulties and that some companies have been subverting its intended objectives. I tum to the third major effect of the proposed changes in the Bill before the House. This relates to the core technology expenditures being deducted from the fonnula determining the amount of deduction to be allowed in cases where there are guaranteed returns for investors. The Government introduced provisions for syndicated research proposals to attract tax deductions at the rate of 150 per cent in November 1987. This action was taken to ensure that projects too big or too risky for a single company could be pursued by one or more investors. These syndicated research groups became a vehicle for contrived schemes offering guaranteed returns to investors. The concerns were repOlted on in the 1988-89 financial year, and in September 1989 the Government tried to plug the holes. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the legislation was debated in May 1990. As it is, tIle Act now reduces the level of the deduction available in accord with the degree of risk or exposure taken on by a company. The amendment in the Bill before the House subtracts the value of core technology from the formula used to calculate the amount by which a deduction will be reduced when part of the R&D investment is deemed not to be at risk. The intention of the exercise is to ensure that where an investment is not at risk it attracts only a 100 per cent deduction, as is usually the case. Given this, it would seem that the Government is still having problems managing the scheme in regard to companies using it to derive undeserved advantages. Given the high risk of R&D, the 100 per cent plus concession is deemed necessary, but a company which incurs limited risks does not deserve the concession. They are the three major effects of the changes under the Bill being considered. I would make some further points. The concession is more than just an extension of the 100 per cent standard business tax deduction. This is why the argument that it is only 25 per cent more than the 100 per cent deduction is wrong. Many in the science community are dissatisfied that the tax concession is 125 per cent as from June 1993 and not 150 per cent. They argue, in my view erroneously, that it is only 25 per cent more than what would be a normal business deduction. But it is not just a question of giving businesses another 25 per cent of 39c in the dollar. This is not much. What is important about this scheme is that it allows other activities to be drawn under the deduction umbrella that are not allowable deductions under the standard 100 per cent business deduction. That is, it allows tax deferral advantages such as accelerated depreciation of R&D plant and equipment over three years at the premium level, which is still 150 per cent under this Bill; 100 per cent deductibility for core technology for R&D purposes; and advance payments and accelerated provisions for certain contracted R&D. It is more than likely that these could not have been claimed under the taxation Act prior to the introduction of the concession. I would like to give the House some figures for the estimates of forgone revenue under the tax concessional system for the period 198591, so that the House understands that this concessional tax for R&D comes at some price to the revenue. The figures do not account for recoupment from the effects of dividend imputation, so the actual amount forgone could be much less. As they stand, these are our best estimates: for 1985-86, nil; for the 1986-87 financial year, $105m; for the 1987-88 financial year, $145m; for the 198889 financial year, $215m; for the 1989-90 financial year, $230m; and for the 1990-91 financial year, $225m. In'summary in regard to this aspect of the legislation, the Opposition does not oppose the extension of the 150 per cent beyond June 1993 for those who are already investing in plant. Nonetheless, the Opposition makes the point that the Government continues to experience severe difficulties in proper administration of this scheme and on any reckoning it is an expensive scheme for the Government. I should stress that under the Opposition's Fightback package, so well known to members of this House and to a growing admiring public outside this chamber, we will continue with the 125 per cent tax concession for R&D. However, the whole problem of the Government's approach to science and technology is exemplified by the Bill before the House. It does not face up to the major impediment to the commercialisation of R&D. We will keep that for another day. Moreover the Government does not appreciate that artificial schemes at taxpayers' expense are no answers in comparison to the removal of the high costs which deter manufacturing in Australia from taking advantage of so much of the very good research undeltaken in this country. The problem is not the quality of the research done in this country; it is simply the manufacturing sector does not operate in the right investment settings to take advantage of it. An example of this is, of course, the Government's national procurement and deVelopment program, which the Industry Commission has recently reported on. The NPDP is a scheme by which the Government will fund the bringing together of high tech development with the Public Service so that the Public Service is made more aware of the computer opportunities, for example, that a small Australian company is offering. While those sorts of schemes almost always seem impressive at first blush, on further examination we find that schemes like the NPDP are faintly flawed. The Industry Commission found that the NPDP had been unable to meet its basic program objectives of meeting the procurement needs of government or industry. The program had a heavy cost, amounting to some $25m. This public money had been virtually a direct transfer of funds to a selective band of industries. There was a finding that only 10 out of 24 grant recipients had reported sales from the projects given support. These sales amounted to $12m, while some claim that they amounted to $50m, so there is an accounting dispute there. The Industry Commission said that projects yet to come on stream did not hold great promise in turning around the IC's findings. Accordingly the IC argued that the NPDP would hardly even pay its own way. The report went on further to find that there were no real or substantive links between user agencies, government departments and industries receiving support. It also found that agencies were more or less conned into feigning interest in the NPDP projects, but never had any intention of buying the trial products. Moreover, the all up cost of administering the program absorbed 20 per cent of the total cost of the program. This led the Sydney Morning Herald to offer an editorial today which said, among other things, regarding the NPDP: The politicians and bureaucrats who designed and administered the program have not been using their own money; they have faced no penalty for poor commercial judgment. They have not been subject that to the most basic discipline of the market. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial gave further reminder: For politicians who want to be seen to be doing something there is a long list of interventionist schemes, the stupidity of which is already well established. These schemes, which include special industry plans and tax concessions for favoured activities ... are pushed enthusiastically by the ACTU and by sections of industry. The NPDP is just another small attempt by the politicians and bureaucrats to pick winners. And from the early evidence gathered by the IC, it has been executed with the usual lack of success. As a major purchaser of goods and services, Australia's departments of the Public Service have it in their power to exert considerable influence over the development of local markets. As such there is good reason to give a close eye to the potential role for such purchasing power in regard to industry strategy, but such a broad policy objective gives rise to an important question concerning the extent to which governments should coopt the commercial activities of the public sector and direct it to serve an extraneous objective. Whenever governments intervene in this way, it means that the community ultimately pays an additional price for meeting that objective. Furthermore those resources required to meet the objective have had to be redirected from somewhere else in the economy. These are the economic implications of any strategic purchasing policy, be it as applied to the Public Service or the private sector. In the case of the Public Service, it means a greater call on Government outlays and contributes to higher levels of taxation than would otherwise be the case. In the case of the private sector it means higher prices for the consumer and a loss of international competitiveness. It should never be assumed, therefore, that these activities revolving around procurement policies are cost neutral. If the purpose of government's policies is to bring greater efficiencies into the conduct of the economy, it is not hard to see how manipulating what should be straight out commercial decisions on the basis of price and performance would be counter-productive to that end. There is a commonly held assumption that small, undercapitalised companies would instantly become efficient and internationally competitive. if they were provided with preferential treatment in respect of government procurement policies. Unfortunately the development of greater efficiencies and a higher level of competitiveness in small Australian companies are dependent on a number of other crucial issues that are not affected by size. The Ie report found that the NPDP never helped small scale industries or companies or firms, despite the myth; it helped established medium sized companies. The areas the Government should be tackling relate to input costs, level of government costs and charges and taxation. The Fightback package addresses those fundamental and crucial elements to a business's viability, not least of all in the area of high technology manufacturing. The Opposition does not believe that artificial schemes brought about by government intervention will solve the problem of research and development any more than it will solve the problems of the automotive industry, the textile, clothing and footwear industry or primary industries, for that matter. Unless this Government tackles the cost inputs of industry in this country, we will always have to resort to artificial schemes that are doomed to failure because we have governments picking winners.",84
219,Mr MCLACHLAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to discuss one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), the aspect of the depreciation arrangements that are mooted in the Bill. As we know, the concept of the Bill was first brought forward during the 12 March 1991 statement by the previous Prime Minister. He announced essentially the arrangements that now appear in the Bill. They are not considered to be appropriate by business, or at least they are not considered to be any great improvement on the arrangements that were in place before. I suppose that if one has to make a judgment about the intention of this Bill, which is to simplify and perhaps to make life a little easier for these people wishing to depreciate plant, one has to remember that the former Minister Assisting the Treasurer has stated that the cost to the Government will be $lOOm, a measly sum, and one can see that after all the work that has gone into the Bill, it has probably saved manufacturers very little. As I said, these arrangements were mooted on 12 March 1991 when the first of the four great economic statements in the last 12 months or so-the culmination of which will be tomorrow night, I am sure-came forward. Earlier I heard the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) talk about the cynicism of the public which is racing through the community. That is understandable when one realises that the arrangements in this Bill were announced on 12 March 1991; it was reviewed and explained by the then Treasurer and Senator Button in September; it was introduced on the eve of Christmas; it is being debated tonight; and it will be changed tomorrow night. That is a very unsatisfactory set of arrangements. I referred to the fact that it was explained by those two honourable gentlemen. Included in a rather long sixor seven-page dissertation were some examples. I presume those honourable gentlemen thought it was appropriate to give some examples because nothing had been done, the Bill had not come forward and it was being discussed by government and business in great detail. But we can understand the confusion of the public and business when one of the examples set out that a wheat farmer might be expected to do 100,000 hours of work with a tractor in five years, at which point it explained quite simply that it would no longer be useful for income production. It sure would not be, because that works out to be 20,000 hours a year. I know that some of the gentlemen devising this Bill come from Queensland and other places where daylight saving is much debated, but it has been a long time since there have been 20,000 hours in a year. Those examples were perpetuated all the way down the page and right through, so it was little wonder that it took until the eve of Christmas or thereabouts to produce the Bill. But, as we all know, these arrangements are retrospective; they have been in place since 1 July 1991 and in some cases prior to that where arrangements were made after 12 March 1991. So to that extent I suppose we have to legitimise them. Why on earth they are being brought forward tonight when tomorrow night-as we understand it from the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who talked about everything but this Bill but did mention the words 'accelerated depreciation' and said that he was very keen on it, as are many other honourable members, we have come to understand, on the Government side-there will be some changes along those lines I do not know. Will those changes be accelerated depreciation? Will they be a furthering of the loading? Will we go from 20 per cent to 40 per cent or from 20 per cent to 60 per cent? What will the arrangements be for the changes to the depreciation arrangements in this country? We do not know what they will be. lt is most extraordinary that we should be asked to debate a Bill where this area of it has caused the Government much agony. To announce something in March and then to finally get it up, after much consultation with business, in December, makes one wonder why it is so important to debate it tonight. Obviously it would have made a fool of the Government if it had withdrawn it and put up whatever proposition it is going to put up tomorrow night. In mooting this Bill back in March, the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), after explaining a number of the arrangements in the Bill, said that the Government does not believe that assets should be written off faster even at a higher budgetary cost. This was after an explanation of the arrangements that were mooted in this Bill. But tomorrow night we understand there will be some other arrangements. So already those arrangements outlined in a very definitive statement by the current Prime Minister when putting the arrangements in the Bill forward on 12 March look as though they are going to be changed yet again. We can understand why the taxpaying public is not only cynical but confused when we have a series of arrangements starting March, coming through with some extraorimplemented. dinary explanations in September, which obviously wrong, finally getting through December, coming up now, and being capital changed even after the current Prime Minister has quite definitively said that the goes Government does not believe that these assets should be written off at a faster pace. doubt tomorrow night we will see that assets can be written off at a faster pace, and we will look forward to seeing what those gements are. With those few words, and with that criticism, I support the amendment moved by my colleague on this side of House.",87
220,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have just a few words in response. Firstly, with regard to the delay, is true that a significant time has elapsed between the announcement of these measures and the actual debating of the legislation the House. However, I would point out that that delay has permitted a fairly extensive process of consultation with business and tax professionals to try to iron out potential glitches in the legislation. Hopefully, what have ended up with is legislation which more effective in achieving its purposes and better from the point of view of all who have to deal with it. I might also say that, in terms of what is happening tomorrow, this is an omnibus piece of legislation which deals with a range of issues to do with the tax system and not simply depreciation arrangements. There is reason to suppose that the great bulk of the measures introduced as part of this legislation are going to be effectively undermined or superseded by any announcements that might to job growth. be made in the context of the economic statement tomorrow. The second reading amendment moved by the Opposition bemoans. firstly, the delay which I have already commented on briefly, but it also then goes on to bemoan Government's failure to tackle the problem of tax reform in a comprehensive way. I would simply say that in the record of this general Government there is a massive program of in reform which has been introduced and In 1985, of course, we had a were very wide range of measures arising out of to the tax summit. There was the introduction of gains tax, fringe benefits tax, dividend imputation and substantiation, and the list on and on. It is not my intention to bore the House by giving a full rendition of No everything that has been done by way of tax reform. I would simply observe that those opposite really cannot argue that there has not arranbeen a major program of tax reform. Opposition members would, no doubt, disagree with the content of that program of tax the reform, nonetheless they cannot deny the substance of what has been done. The Opposition, of course, says that the Government ought to introduce a broad-based consumption tax. We reject that proposition. it Going by the international experience, if we look at the consequence of the introduction of a set of measures of the kind favoured by the in Opposition, there is absolutely no reason to suppose that that set of measures will lead to an improvement in our economic circumstanwith ces. To the contrary, if we look across the Tasman Sea at New Zealand where there is we something similar in the sense of the introducis tion of a broad-based consumption tax substituting for income tax to some extent, what do we find? We find an effective five year recession in that country. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out today, the very econometrician who was responsible for developing the Opposition's package forecast that it would lead to a 4 per no cent reduction in gross domestic product. So it is utterly laughable for the Opposition to claim that the measures that it favours would improve the economic circumstances and lead Dr Bob Woods-Did you support this?",89
221,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I did not support it. We had quite a debate about all that. The fact is that the measures favoured by members of the Opposition would make things worse. There the is no question about that. The Opposition does not seem to be opposing any of the specific provisions or the thrust of the legislation. On the whole tax it seems to welcome it although it reckons that it is inadequate. The Government, as a result of consultations, particularly with business groups, is prepared to look at some technical amendments to the legislation for movement in the Senate. A couple of points in particular have come to our attention, but I might leave those to the committee stage because I know that the Opposition wants to raise some points which mayor may not coincide with the ones we intend to deal with. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 9-by leave-taken together.",89
222,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Before I get to the first group of clauses I wish to discuss I simply want to make the point that, whilst the explanatory memorandum presented is in a much improved format and enables us to follow exactly what the Government intends by bridging clauses in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), and having indeed in some cases clauses common to more than one proposition in the Bill, there are difficulties for treatment in committee. I am sure that no-one is really in the mood to take a point of order in that I might be sing a group of clauses other than the main clauses I wish to discuss. I am sure the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) would understand that, whilst technically he might be able to claim that I am not speaking strictly to the clauses before the Committee, I wish to assure him I am talking about the bulk of the matters being dealt with group by group. Incidentally, it is something that the House might like to consider at some stage, particularly in committee. The first group I want to talk about comprises, in the main, clauses 3, 4 and 5, dealing with fringe benefits tax substantiation and discretion provisions in the Bill. Clauses 3, 4 and 5 seek to amend the fringe benefits tax law to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to accept a lower level of substantiation than is currently allowable. Proposed new section 123B in the principal Act, the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986, is designed to soften the requirement to comply with substantiation rules by providing the Commissioner with a discretion to ignore an absence of compliance. The requirement introduced with proposed section 123B(1)(a) is that the Commissioner be: . . . satisfied that. .. a benefit has been provided in, or in respect of, a year of tax in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer... In this connection the Taxation Institute has commented as follows: It is difficult to understand why the Commissioner needs to reach a state of satisfaction as to the provision of a benefit. If no benefit has been provided there would be no need to consider the application of the substantiation rules and therefore no need to ameliorate their impact. It also appears that the discretion will not apply to a request for amendment made after the date of royal assent. This seems to be designed to reduce the administrative workload of the Commissioner and really has no basis in policy. It almost goes without saying that, if there are grounds for exercising the discretion, review should be allowed across the board with retrospective effect to the date of commencement of the original FBT legislation. If the Commissioner has acted to disallow an objection or determine an discusamendment request before the date of commencement of the amendment, the taxpayer will not, as it presently stands, be afforded relief. However, if the Commission has been slow about reaching a conclusion, the taxpayer will be able to seek relief. That seems to me to be reverse justice and quite unfair. The legislation should not provide relief based merely on the level of activity or the lack of it by the Commissioner, but that is the effect of the proposed amendments under clauses 3, 4 and 5 and associated clauses.",90
223,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I must admit, I had not thought that those particular provisions provided an area of potential contention. I will take that matter on notice. I might say that it is the Government's intention to move some amendments in the Senate. We may choose to take up some of the points that the honourable member has raised. Clauses agreed to. Clauses 10 to 13-by leave-taken together.",90
224,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I specifically wanted to speak to clauses 10, 11, 12 and 13, but clauses 25, 31, 32, 33 and 49 also have relevance, and this is part of the difficulty of which I spoke earlier. I hope I will be granted some latitude. The Bill proposes in these clauses to change the requirements concerning dividend rebates where company beneficiaries and partners are involved. It sets out to extend the scope of the inter-company dividend rebate to allow the rebate to companies that are not shareholders. The amendment is designed to overcome the effect of the High Court decision in the Patcorp case whereby only the registered shareholder was entitled to the inter-company dividend rebate. Even though a company was absolutely entitled to the shares as against the trustee, and was taxed on the dividend as trust income, it was not entitled to the rebate. The entitlement of the beneficial owner or partner-that is, a company-to the rebate will be determined as if it were a shareholder and had received a dividend equal to its share of the income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividend. The amendment we are discussing applies to dividends paid after the High Court handed down the decision in Patcorp. The assessment of any company that was not allowed the rebate in an assessment that issued before today will not be able to have that assessment amended to allow the rebate. There have been some instances, I understand, where corporate beneficiaries who have not technically been absolutely entitled to the share as against the trustee, such as in the case of a discretionary trust, have been allowed the dividend rebate. According to my informed information, to the extent that what I have said is so, there is an inconsistency between the Commissioner's past practice and the proposed amendments contained in this Bill, particularly given that the amendments proposed in section 45Z(1) are to be retrospective to give effect to the Commissioner's past practice. The Taxation Institute argues in this case that the proposed new section should apply to all instances where dividend rebates have been allowed in the past. The coalition tends to support that, for want of better knowledge, as I think I read in an Australian poem once, and for want of any case in the matter put by the Government. To do as the Institute proposes would reflect the administrative practice of the Commissioner and it would overcome potential anomalies where the Commissioner would be entitled under the provision as now drafted to disallow a dividend rebate claimed by a taxpayer in reliance upon the Commissioner;s administrative practice as understood by the taxpayer. It would appear that private rulings have been issued which allow a dividend rebate to be claimed in cases where a corporate beneficiary under a discretionary trust' has received past distributions. The effect of the proposed amendment in not extending to distributions under discretionary trusts occurring after the date of operation of the provision is consistent with a limited view of the Commissioner's administrative practice, But this fails to take into account the fact that under the imputation system introduced in 1987 the flow through of franking credits in a trust structure is permitted. In a case where a corporate beneficiary under a discretionary trust has received trust distributions, which include dividend payments, franking credits automatically flow through to that taxpayer, and ultimately to the individual shareholders in that taxpayer. In this case it is strange, to say the least, to deny the dividend rebate where franking credits are available to a corporate beneficiary, The Tax Institute has raised with the coalition a matter of criticism about the application of proposed section 66(1) which effectively prohibits any taxpayer who has received an assessment in which the Commissioner has disallowed the dividend rebate from objecting to that assessment. The Institute stated: Such a disallowance has only occurred in one well publicised situation and it seems totally inequitable to fetter one particular taxpayer (or group of taxpayers) from exercising nonnal objection and appeal rights under the assessment act. This view is expressed regardless of any settlement which may have been reached between the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Such express prohibitions on the rights of particular taxpayers creates a dangerous precedent which should be discouraged at all costs. That is the view of the Taxation Institute. I put it to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), that such limitations to appeal rights are inconsistent with the rule of law, which should underpin the administration of our tax laws.",91
225,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), is obviously raising a series of points of very great detail and obviously it is not possible to respond here and now. Apparently he does not have specific amendments to move at this stage. If there is a series of these points he wishes to raise in connection with the legislation I will undertake that, as he raises these points, we will have them looked at with some care. If the Government considers it appropriate, we may be prepared to make some amendments to the legislation when it goes to the Senate. It is obviously not possible to respond here and now to that sort of very detailed point based on what is obviously a detailed submission from the Taxation Institute. That comment will go to subsequent points of that nature. Clauses agreed to. Clause 14.",92
226,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Chairman, I am tempted to do as my friend the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has suggested; that is, to move that progress be reported to give the Government time to do what this very process is designed to allow it to do. The reason we have provision for the committee stage, and the mere fact that we have indicated that we want it to go into committee, should be enough for the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to have advisers here. I admit that it is a rare occurrence that we get to look at complex legislation in this place, and I have often commented on the fact that anything of any complexity which affects the well-being of the taxpayers of Australia is rarely debated in this place. So I went to great pains to put my mouth where my rhetoric was this time, because for once the legislation is not under the guillotine, to discuss the actual provisions in the legislation. After all, that is what we are here for. We are going about this in a strange way. The legislation is going to go to the Senate. I accept the Minister's statement that the Government will look at what I have had to say. It is by no means a catalogue of all the things I would have wished to query. On behalf of the coalition, I have simply tried to raise those matters of immediate importance. Because of the fact that the Minister is not capable of replying to them, I simply repeat that I am very tempted to do as the honourable member for Pearce has suggested. The only trouble is that it would prevent him from getting around to debating another very important piece of government legislation. Given that I am not confident that the Government really intends in this place to treat its legislation seriously in the way that we and all responsible members of this House would prefer, such a course of action tonight would be unproductive. As far as clause 14 is concerned, it surrounds the deferral of deductions for trading stock purchases involving prepayments. In relation to the deferral of deductions for prepayment of trading stock, the Bill in this clause affirms the principle of matching tax deductions for expenditure on trading stock against income from selling that stock in the appropriate tax year. Currently, expenditure on trading stock is initially deductible under section 51 in the year in which it is incurred. To match deductions against appropriate income, section 28 writes back as income the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the year so that deductions are deferred until the stock is sold. The Raymor case exposed a weakness in the interaction of sections 51 and 28. In that case, the taxpayer was able to achieve a tax timing advantage by prepaying the cost of certain trading stock that was not delivered or made by the end of the tax year. Because the stock was not on hand at year end, section 28 could not operate to defer the deduction allowable under section 51 for the expenditure incurred in that year. As I have said, the amendment is designed to ensure that a deduction under section 51 for expenditure on stock is not available until the stock becomes trading stock on hand. However, a possible defect in the proposed new provision is that, if the goods never come on hand because they are dealt with by the purchaser between the time of ordering them and the time of their delivery, when they would ordinarily constitute trading stock, no deduction will ever be allowed under section 51 as the clause is currently drafted. In other words, in my opinion, the clause as it is currently drafted will not meet the stated intention of the Government in this connection. The proposed legislation seeks to correct a technical deficiency in the existing provisions with regard to tax deductions for capital expenditure incurred in income producing activities. I will discuss that at a later stage. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 to 33-by leave--taken together, and agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",92
227,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"What I have to say concerns provisions dealing with capital gains tax roll-over relief for partnerships. Various capital allowance recoupment rules are amended by the Bill in clause 51 to treat disposals of relevant property under nonarm's length arrangements or under arrangements that involve some continuity of ownership of property so that they occur at market value. It is questionable whether these amendments can be justified solely as an antiavoidance measure, as is claimed, given that most of the opportunities for such avoidance no longer exist with the advent of the capital gains tax legislation. The effect of the amendments is to limit recoupment to those few situations where rollover relief has been afforded under the capital gains tax provisions. Again, the Taxation Institute of Australia cites an example of how restrictive this can be in the case of a father passing over a farm to his son for a consideration which may not be a full consideration, in which case the father will be deemed to have disposed of all the plant and equipment at its market value, to the detriment of the business to be conducted by the son. There are other examples which could be conceived to be non-arm's length transactions where roll-over relief is not currently afforded under the capital gains tax provisions but where relief has been afforded from recoupment of depreciation by the operation of section 59(4) and without great loss to the revenue. There are difficulties with a number of other aspects of this Bill. The balancing adjustment of roll-over relief provisions has proved to be a debacle for tax practitioners due to a mishap in the distribution of the press release announcing these provisions. As if that were not problem enough, we now find that the legislation does not follow the expectations generated by the initial press release, at least for those fortunate enough to have seen a copy before the legislation was released. Mr Chaney-The lucky ones didn't get it.",93
228,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Perhaps, but surely the Government should have learned by now the difficulties generated by legislation by press release. Of course, it seems that the Government has learned nothing from its mistakes; it continues with this extremely damaging practice. Remainder of Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Baldwin)-by leave-read a third time. ARTS, SPORT, ENVIRONMENT AND NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 November 1991, on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the Bill be now read a second time.",93
229,Mr CHANEY,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"The Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is one number of Bills before the Parliament at the moment which deal with a range of Bills and provide for relatively minor amendments to each of them. In this case there are seven Bills involved. The Opposition oppose any of the amendments, although we do intend at the committee stage to move amendment with respect to one of provisions. That provision, which I will mention briefly at this second reading stage, is the amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 which will introduce a ministerial power of direction in relation to the Draft Territory Plan where the Territory planning authority continues to object the draft plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority. This ministerial power is one which the Opposition is prepared to see put into the Act but in view, given the self-governing nature of Territory, there should at least be obligation for consultation with the relevant Territory Minister. We will, therefore, seek make that relatively minor amendment to the These proposed new section of the principal Act. Self-government in the ACT has come in for its share of ridicule in recent years. both Liberal and Labor administrations I have heard very harsh things said about the structures that have been put in place. In debating this Bill, I would like to take the opportunity to record my personal satisfaction with the evident change that has occurred here where one hears now in the ACT debate among residents of the ACT about the priorities that will apply in their government-about whether schools should be opened or closed, hospitals opened or closed and so on. Notwithstanding the teething problems and notwithstanding that a Labor government has been re-elected, which is not a matter of great satisfaction to me, the real point of substance with respect to self-government in this Territory is that the residents of the ACT have for the first time been forced to face, deal with and take responsibility for the issues which affect them as a community. I believe that any community of Australian adults ought to do that. I express my personal of a satisfaction that those vexed issues of priorities have to be dealt with by the people who live in the ACT, as they have to be dealt with by the people who live in the States, in the areas of Australia that we represent does not around the country. There are some other minor amendments an which relate to the recovery of costs, and I these have no comment to make on those. The Bill also proposes to make amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. I do not intend to deal with that aspect of the Bill at all because the next speaker on the legislation for the Opposition will deal with that. Therefore I make no comment other than that we do not oppose the amendments to any aspect of being put forward. In this legislation there are also amendments to both the Environment Protection our (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the Wildlife the Protection (Regulation of Exports and Iman ports) Act 1982. In her second reading speech, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the to Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said: amendments ... will facilitate the giving of evidence by expert analysts and overcome any gaps in evidence in judicial proceedings. Under I remember once having the pleasure of appearing for a defendant in a prosecution under the Quarantine Act. It was the first contact I had had with that Act and, somewhat to my surprise, I found that all that seemed to be necessary to prove the guilt of the defendant was to produce a certificate, say that the defendant was the defendant and had been identified as such, and to sit down, because the Act provided that all of the elements of the offence were proved just by averment of the facts. I may be faintly misremembering that very distant case, but I mention it to make a point that our legislative provisions, both State and Federal, are littered with provisions which enable facts to be proved at least to the point of being prima facie established, as they are under these provisions, without the need to produce what might be called hard evidence. In this case the certificate of the analyst is proof of a series of matters in the absence of some proof to the contrary. As a Parliament, we need to be very careful in continually limiting, in a sense, the freedom of the subject that we are not making it more difficult for people to defend themselcapacity ves. The Opposition, on its examination these provisions, does not believe that they unduly trespass on individual rights and liberties. As an ex-senator I take some constrong solation from the fact that in the Senate legislation will receive scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of where it will be given professional assessment against a series of tests as to whether it this House. trespasses on individual rights and liberties in a way which is undue. I think that is important. I make this ment in part because of the debate which listened to in the committee stage of previous Bill. I thought that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), in leading and for the Opposition, made a series of very well pertinent points about the taxation legislation of that was being dealt with, raised questions about the efficacy of the legislation and so in an area where there is near universal complaint about the state of the law, which in a state of confusion and complexity that virtually guarantees that no honest person be sure that he or she is complying with the taxation laws of this country. They are at such a level of complexity that it is impossible any honest person to be really certain that he or she is meeting all the requirements of taxation legislation. I think it is a very sorry day for this liament when serious issues are raised at the committee stage, as they were by the honourable member for Curtin, and where there is an expectation by the Government that it simply does not have to deal with those matters. In fairness to the Minister in charge of the previous Bill, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), I say that he said that these matters would examined. I express the view that we are entitled to something better than that and where significant issues arise in committee, is an abrogation of the responsibilities of House and a downgrading of its status as a legislative chamber when the Government is not prepared to give immediate consideration to the issues raised in committee. If the Government is incapable, because of either the capacity of its advisers or the of the responsible Minister, to deal of with those issues, the Government should do postpone the treatment of the legislation until they can be dealt with. I express that as a personal view. I suppose the test will the be when we are in government, as to whether we are prepared to proceed in this place in a Bills, slightly more sensible way which acknowledges the legislative responsibilities of Further amendments are made in the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation comAmendment Bill to the National Parks and I Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, which, again the to quote the second reading speech: ... will enable the Norfolk Island botanical garden the Australian national botanical gardens, as as any other park or reserve created in future, to be managed as a botanic garden through a plan management under the Act. did It seems to me that it is self-evidently desirable that there should be that flexibility is with respect to the management of our national parks which fall under the jurisdiccan tion of the Commonwealth, and we warmly support that very sensible change to the law. However, there is an amendment of greater for general significance which is important because it illustrates the positive way that we the should be proceeding to improve environmental management in Australia as against the Parrather shambolic approach which has been a feature of recent years. Here I refer to the three international agreements which are added to the schedule of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 in respect of which the Governor General will be who was empowered to make regulations. We have here an amendment which will must widen the regulation making power of the be Commonwealth. It does so in a fairly modest way. The three conventions which are being that added to the schedule to the Act are in a it sense supplementary and complementary to the the five conventions which are already in the Act and which deal with related issues. Already in the Act is the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as to waterfowl habitat, known as the Ramsar Convention because it was entered into at Ramsar in Iran in 1971. This convention has the explicit support of the Opposition and it is a matter where, as in so many elements of environment policy, there is no partisan difference or dispute but common support for that convention. There is also a convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage. There is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. There is an agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan for the protection of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction, which was signed in Tokyo in February 1974. The new international agreements which are being added are the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific, which was signed at Apia in Western Samoa in 1976, the Convention on the Migratory Species of Wild Animals signed at Bonn in 1979 and the agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the protection of migratory birds and their environment, signed at Canben'a in October 1986. I linger for a moment on that element of the legislation. Here we have a clear assumption of responsibility by the national Government, the acceptance of which goes back many years, to periods of Liberal government and, indeed, of previous Labor governments. It is a nice example of a set of environmental issues which, of necessity, cannot be dealt with just by local action. We hear a lot about thinking globally and acting locally, but when we are dealing with species of birds which travel from, perhaps, Siberia to Western Australia, clearly local action in Siberia alone is not sufficient to look after the long term welfare and survival of that species. It requires action right down the chain of communication, if you like, the whole area through which these birds travel and ultimately nest and feed. It is simply necessary for the international community to take action. Therefore, it is important that Australia, as a nation, participates in these international activities and, in tum, translates the responsibilities which are internationally negotiated into local action at home. I raise this because we are going through a period of some perturbation within Australia about the division of responsibilities between State and Commonwealth and about the impact of international agreements and responsibilities on Commonwealth jurisdiction. I think that, in a sense, there is an unhealthy level of disputation and disagreement. I describe it as unhealthy because I think it is at a level which sometimes obscures and clouds dealing with the substance of issues. We become locked into what I have described elsewhere as arid jurisdictional disputes, rather than focusing on the need for specific action to achieve the desired environmental outcome. What is very positive about the example we are dealing with here is that, whereas you have currently a scene of conflict about some areas of World Heritage listing and the long term implications of that and you have conflict about heritage listing and the long term implications of that, with respect to these agreements we have a history of constructive and cooperative responses on the part of the States and the Commonwealth and, with I think only one exception, a reliance upon the normal administering authorities-namely, the States--to take the substantive action which is required in order to meet Australia's domestic and international obligations. If all of this sounds like gobbledegook, I am sorry; but I do think a very important issue of substance with respect to environmental policy is tied up in all of this. There is in the community a broad acceptance of the need to preserve environmental amenity and to preserve environmental values. I think there is virtually universal support for that in the community, but there is often unnecessary conflict about how that should be brought about. It has been the settled view of the Opposition over a very long period that to deal successfully with these environmental issues requires an approach which brings together the quite different skills, aptitudes and responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth and achieves, on a cooperative basis, the desired outcome. We are strongly of the view that it is by pursuing that path that we will achieve the environmental outcomes that we generally seek. These conventions and their implementation over a period of many years is a very precise example of the sort of approach that we have advocated. We are at one of those points in Australian history where real progress is possible. Under the previous Prime Minister, there was the initiative to establish special premiers conferences which would do something to rationalise and remove some of the disputes in Commonwealth-State relations which bedevilled the environmental areas as well as other areas of government. I think there appears to be-and I must say I have to be a touch tentative about this because much of the work has been done privately and I have had to rely on various briefings from public servants and politicians who are part of the process; little formal documentation has actually been produced-reasonably clear evidence that the Commonwealth and the States between them have moved to a point where they have an agreement about environmental administration which holds out the promise of removing much of the past conflict. For example, in this chamber the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories-I am sorry she cannot be here for the debate on this Bill-said during the last sittings of Parliament that the latest draft of that agreement, which I think she described as the eleventh draft, had her strong support. Apparently that contrasted with her earlier concern with what I think she described as draft No.2. The reality is that an agreement which provides that the States and the Commonwealth between them agree on standards and on means of meeting those standards and then agree to give full faith and credit to each other's standards and procedures provides a route by which we can escape the extraordinarily expensive conflict of the past. When I say 'expensive', I think it has been expensive for Australia in an emotional, political and economic sense. I do not care whether one is looking at it socially, economically or environmentally; I think the past period of conflict has been very destructive. Here we are poised at the point of agreement. The States met without the Prime Minister. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the States met in a state of pique; they excluded the Commonwealth from their meeting because of the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from what they thought was the undertaking about the financial arrangements that they had been negotiating. The States reaffirmed their support for this approach to environmental management. The Commonwealth indicated, through the mouth of the Minister in this chamber, that there was support for it. We are here waiting to know whether we will progress down the sort of path which is represented by this amendment and the way in which these laws have been used to date; or will we go back to the days of Senator Richardson, where the environment is treated as a political football and the only thing that matters is whether the decisions will impact on the voting patterns in key seats in Sydney and Melbourne. Here we have a country with one million people unemployed. There is some quibbling about that; the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with some satisfaction I thought, said today that it was only 850,000 or so. But whatever view one takes of the number of unemployed, whatever view one takes of the volume of small businesses which have gone bankrupt, and whatever view one takes of Australian society, unless one is totally insulated from the realities of Australian society one would have to say there are many people in misery and difficulty. For us to be wasting our national effort on unnecessary jurisdictional disputes is a disgrace. If we get a continuance of the total cynicism which has been adopted towards environmental politics by this Government, then I say that is part of a national disgrace which these people should wear. I will paraphrase the words of the Prime Minister: they carry around their necks hundreds of thousands of unemployed. They have put on the trash heap hundreds of thousands of Australians, including nearly one-third of those young Australians who are seeking employment. This is not an issue which touches only upon the vitally important question of having working rules which will achieve desired environmental outcomes. I express the unequivocal support of the Opposition, not just for this technical amendment, but for the way that these amendments and conventions have been used by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to achieve a cooperative and successful set of outcomes. That is the sort of behaviour that we look for in the national interest. It contrasts very sharply with much of the decision making in this area. If the Prime Minister discards the proposed Commonwealth-State agreement with respect to the environment, we will have the clearest possible signal that what the Prime Minister is about is the narrow political interests of the ALP and that the kids of this country can go hang. It is a nice simple illustration of bona fides. Are we interested in solutions-in things which work-or are we interested in running up another green totem which might enable the Labor Party to wring a preference out of some dopey person who has not con-' sidered the actual substance of these issues? I think that is one of the large questions we face. I think this legislation, in giving us such a positive example, is a timely opportunity to debate some of these issues. I now move to the remaining parts of this Bill. We have amendments to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. The National Cultural Heritage Committee will be given the power to approve a recommendation without the need to convene a meeting. I understand that this simply ratifies past practice. In a very sensible way and no doubt in order to conserve public funds, the practice has arisen of trying to meet by telephone. In a country the size of Australia, when dealing with many issues I would have thought that was a very sensible provision to have in insulated place. However, I take the 0PP011unity to say that, whilst I think there is bipartisan support for the protection of movable cultural heritage-I speak personally here; it is not a matter we have discussed in the party room or in shadow Cabinet-it does seem to me that there is room for some concern if this group adopts too restrictive a view of the sale of Australian art objects abroad. I must say that I am responding to some recent controversy over a decision which was taken to restrict the export of an Australian painting. I say to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), who is at the table and with whom I shared a very pleasant evening at the University of Western Australia just last week, that I think there are some important counter considerations in terms of Australia being part of the international art world and, indeed, there being a market for Australian art. I think many of the restrictions which are placed on the movement and employment of actors or sometimes on the sale of these things can have quite unintended consequences. I simply raise that as a matter which I think needs serious consideration on both sides of this chamber. I think there are some keyDebate interrupted. NA",94

231,Mr CHANEY,TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"I wish to use this debate to put the item I have referred to on the agenda, because I believe that it is important that Australia not become from international cultural activities. Part of that involves Australian cultural objects being available to people in other countries. So I express some personal concern about whether unduly restrictive approaches are being adopted. The final amendment to which I want to refer is the amendment to the Norfolk Island Act. It again seems to be self-evidently sensible that there should be a power for a deputy administrator to exercise the powers of the Administrator when he is absent from duty. People on this side of the chamber seem to get a dreamy look on their faces when we mention the role of the Administrator of Norfolk Island. It seems to be thought to be akin to being an administrator of heaven, or at least a small part of heaven, but I am sure it carries very onerous responsibilities. It is necessary for the Administrator to be away from time to time and it is necessary that there should be a capacity to do the duties of that job in his absence. In a general sense, I commend the Bill to the House, but I trust that the Governmentunlike its treatment of the matters which were raised on the previous Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), which were matters of substance-and the Minister for the Arts and Territories, who is at the table, will consider the amendment which I will ask the Clerks to circulate and which we will be moving during the committee stage. I would have thought that the Government, having supported self-government in the ACT, should not ignore local government when the Minister is being given a necessary power to break a situation where a decision is not able to be taken. We do not seek any capacity for local govenunent to override the Commonwealth Minister, but simply an obligation to consult. I would have thought that it would not be beyond the authority of this chamber to make a simple change of that sort, which is completely in line with the whole notion of self-government-which after all was brought into this place by the Government of which the Minister at the table is a part. Debate (on motion by Mr Johns) adjourned. NA Motion (by Ms Fatin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Tim Neville",98
232,Mr NUGENT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to pay tribute this evening to Mr Tim Neville, the former chief executive of the City of Knox. The City of Knox comprises some 85 per cent of my electorate in Melbourne. Tim Neville was the Town Clerk and chief executive of Knox for 17 years, until his tragic accidental death on Tuesday, 28 January this year-a man in the prime of life, still in his forties, and at the very peak of his activities and his career. He began his career in local government in his home town of Birboo North at the age of 17. He then moved to the City of Doncaster on Templestowe. In 1973 he was appointed the Town Clerk of the City of Hamilton, the youngest town clerk in Victoria. Tim became the second chief executive of Knox in March 1975. He was a past Victorian President and Federal Council member of the Institute of Municipal Management and chaired the William Angliss Hospital's $l.5m golden anniversary fundraising appeal last year. His time at Knox saw the city grow from a relatively small town of 60,000 into his vision of the most livable city in Australia, a title which the City of Knox won in 1986. Today Knox is the largest and richest municipality in Victoria, with a population of more than 130,000. Those people have lost a leader dedicated to their welfare. He will be remembered as an outstanding servant of the City of Knox and its citizens, a man whose dedication and enthusiasm knew no bounds. I knew Tim on a working basis for nearly 10 years. In the last two years, since I came to this place, I had frequent dealings with him. He was first and foremost a City of Knox man. Whatever he did or said, it was with the welfare of Knox citizens uppermost in his mind. Since his untimely death, innumerable tributes have been made to his leadership, vision, warmth and courage. There is no mistaking the respect and affection which he engendered in those with whom he dealt and worked, and his strong commitment to his family was legendary. He dealt in the same way, the same downto-earth manner, with everyone he encountered. An obituary by the local depot staff demonstrates some of Tim's special qualities: Tim never forgot the people working at the coalface. He knew their laughter, their doubts and their fears. He was able to identify with them. I wish to place on record in this place the appreciation of the people of Knox for Tim Neville's tireless pursuit of excellence on behalf of the people of Knox and the deep sadness and loss felt by all of us because of his tragic death. A very visible demonstration of the impact he made on his fellow man was shown at his funeral, which was attended by thousands. Mourners included family and friends, Cabinet Ministers and MPs, professional colleagues and council staff, and many ordinary citizens whose lives had been enriched by Tim Neville and what he was able to do for them. On behalf of all who knew him, I extend my deepest sympathies to his family in their most grievous and tragic loss. The people of Knox will never forget Tim Neville. Peanut Industry",99
233,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,Hinkler) (10.37 p.m.)Agriculture has been going through some tough times. Members on both sides of the House recognise that. Mr Truss-That's a welcome change.,100
234,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has interjected, because I am discussing an editor of his paper, John Cameron, from the South Burnett Times. It is important that the facts be stated. John Cameron has been short on facts and has misrepresented the facts. It is typical of people who rely on National Party endorsement and National Party advertisements in National Party areas that they print things that are unfactual and untrue, particularly in Queensland, in the heart of the National Party, in the heart of the League of Rights. The League of Rights will get them, too, if they are not careful. Unfortunately, the editor has said that loss of peanut production in the last decade through non-viability of the peanut industry in the face of imported and depressed peanut prices would account for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of jobs on the land in country towns and in the cities, where most processing and packaging plants are sited. He criticises me and the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) for not stopping the importation of Chinese peanuts. It is unfortunate that the full facts are not put fOlward. The full facts are that in 1988 and 1989 the Peanut Marketing Board in that same area imported peanuts because there was a shOtifall. There have been applications before the ADA in regard to dumping. From January to September 1991, only 18 tonnes out of 2,447 tonnes were dumped. The dumping margin was found to be less than 7 per cent. The dumped peanuts represented less than one per cent of imports from China and about 0.1 per cent of total market supply. The other important thing is that the total Australian production of peanuts was sold in both 1990 and 1991. It needs to be understood that at present $6.3 billion of processed primary products are sold overseas per annum. The complexity of world trade and the fact that we need to sell 80 per cent of our fmm product overseas seems to be beyond the intelligence of the National Party and the hillbillies in the National Party in Queensland. That is disappointing. Over the last few months we have seen a campaign in Queensland by the editor of the CourierMailMr Truss--One of your mates.",100
235,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"He is not a mate of mine. This campaign was opposing the importation of pineapples from overseas. What is interesting is that Golden Circle has been opposing the importation of pineapples, but Golden Circle just recently imported passion fruit concentrate from Brazil and strawberries from Mexico because there was a shortfall. What that is called is bilateral trade. It is unfortunate that the National Party does not understand that when one sends a shipload of beef over to the United States one brings back a shipload of oranges. That is called bilateral trade. One does not bring back an empty ship from overseas because that is not efficient. That is the problem with the hillbilly attitude that exists in the League of Rights, in the National Party and in South Burnett because they seem to think that we can ban the importation of products, put a wall around us-as we did in the 1950s-and simply sell overseas the products that farmers produce. It is a pity that they do not go overseas in order to understand the complexities of world trade. However, to his credit the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has been overseas on two occasions with me. It is also to the credit of the National and Liberal parties that there is bipartisan support at the Federal level. I acknowledge that; I think it is important. But that is not the case back in Kingaroy, in the Queensland electorate of the honourable member for Wide Bay. I sympathise with the honourable member for having Kingaroy in his electorate because with Bjelke-Petersen there I would not want to have it in my electorate. However, the honourable member has it and is stuck with it. Thank goodness that he has it! The fact is that the editor of the South Burnett TImes cannot get his facts right. When I was asked to respond, I pointed out that we were working towards establishing food labelling across the board so that people can have a consumer choice. In his next editorial he suggested that consumers and primary producers do it because the Government is doing nothing about it. But what this editor did was simply edit out that part of my press release. That is his right, but he should tell the truth. (TIme expired) Flooding in Queensland",100
236,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"I will take the opportunity some time shortly to respond to the nonsense of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), but at present I have a more important subject to speak about. Tonight the floodwaters are receding from the Mary River, which will hopefully bring to a close a tragic week of flooding in much of my electorate. However, unfortunately it is again raining heavily in Maryborough tonight and last night there was a storm of up to five inches in Gympie which again brought heavy flood run-off into the central city area. The flooding began quite unexpectedly last Thursday night when a low pressure area developed and dumped inches on the little mining town of Howard. The small rural residential area of Pacific Haven was inundated and many people spent the night on their roofs while waiting for helicopters to rescue them. The rain moved south and, with more than a metre falling in much of the headwaters of the Mary River south of Gympie, it was not long before the cities of Gympie and Maryborough-which both span the Mary River-were covered in floodwaters. The central city areas in particular were badly affected. In Gympie, the flood height reached 21.4 metres which was equivalent to the 1955 flood, which was previously regarded as the worse flood this century. In Maryborough, the levels were not quite so high but it was the worse flood since 1974. With parts of the central city business area covered in both cities, there was obviously considerable damage done in each instance. As I went from place to place over the weekend looking at those areas that I could reach, I was enormously impressed with how organised the local people were and how well they were coping with the circumstances. It was a disaster but people were getting together to help one another, as Australians do in times of trouble. The police were fantastic; the orange uniforms of the SES were present everywhere; the radio stations provided a great deal of information; and the employees were there to help unpack the stores and try to move things to higher ground. In general, there was an enormous degree of cooperation. All who were involved are to be commended on the tremendous community spirit that was shown. After the flood some relief was quickly available. We had the routine visits from Premiers, Ministers and so forth. Sadly, when they came they had no information to convey and many people are still anxious to know whether there is going to be any assistance available under the national and State disaster arrangements to assist those who are in such tragic need. I would hope that shortly those arrangements can be sorted out. The Gympie Zonta Club and some others have organised a public appeal. I would encourage those noisy members opposite, who seem to think this is a frivolous matter, to put their hands in their pockets to assist the people of Gympie in their hour of need. Perhaps the Zonta Club appeal is worthy of nationwide support because enormous damage has been done to the city, particularly to small business. Gympie, Maryborough and Howard have all suffered more than most during the current recession: they have had very high unemployment; depressed rural sectors; the young have been forced to leave to seek employment elsewhere; and the World Heritage listing of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region threatened some of the existing industries and cost many jobs. But the people have maintained an optimistic spirit. In Gympie, a lot of work has been done to develop a new and bright city centre. I hope these floodwaters are not going to damage the landscaping and advanced trees that have been planted in the central city area. In Maryborough, the city markets have created a tremendous spirit. Now the flooding has come to dash all of that renewed optimism. Many people are concerned about what the future will bring. John Yuille, a Gympie chemist, was quoted as saying that perhaps 100 Gympie businesses would not be able to survive the flood. Ian Campbell-Wilson, a local taxi owner, said that a few simply would not be able to get back into business because it all came so very quickly. The cleaning up is now to be done and the smells and the heartaches are still there. In a week's time perhaps some of despair and the tragedy of it all will really home to the affected communities. I hope that the same kind of interest and support from governments, both Federal and State, that there has been over the last few days will also be present in the future when the communities will need their help. (Time expired) Goods and Services Tax: Effect on Small Business",101
237,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (10.47 p.m.)Last Friday I had the pleasure of having an interview with a very important small business within my electorate, although I was not applying for a particular job with this enterprise. The proprietors of this business were concerned to relate to me their experience in attending a seminar hosted by a local chamber of commerce and addressed by the accountancy firm Peat Marwick about the possible implications to their business if a consumption tax were introduced in this country. This particular business is a small craft shop. The two proprietors prepare pottery and other craft items and have been operating in the area of Lawnton within my electorate for the last 15 years. It has been an extremely successful business and, despite the competition which has grown out of the large number of country markets and flea markets which have developed and proved to be very popular over the weekends and which also specialise in these craft goods, the business has survived and indeed has thrived. However, the constituents were so concerned, having listened to the explanation of what a consumption tax would mean to their business and what would be the imposts on their business, that they came and saw me a few days later. Of course, I was quickly able to reassure them that the Labor Government had no intention of imposing a consumption tax and that this would occur only if the Liberal and National parties were elected to office. They quickly agreed that this was a very unlikely event. However, what they are particularly concerned about is that the threshold levels afforded to the GST in having to register the under the coalition's proposal would mean hit that their competitors in the flea markets and the country markets would be able to operate in such a way that they would not be bound to complete all the requirements which follow from trying to get the tax back from the GST, whereas they as an established business would have to do that. That is just one example of the growing concern which is starting to come through to my office about the impact of the GST on small business. It is probably the most important part of this tax package in tenns of its impact on business. Currently under the wholesale sales tax arrangements we have a large number of tax collectors in this country. Businesses which are paying wholesale sales tax are in effect tax collectors. But that number is very small in proportion to the one million-odd businesses that will be affected in this country if the GST is introduced. It is absolutely incredible that we will have all these people collecting tax. Every fanner will be a tax collector; every small business will be a tax collector. The amount of paperwork that will have to go into this is absolutely incredible. Today the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) indicated to the House the experience in New Zealand. He said that if small business is to look after itself it must rise up to make sure that its voice is heard. It is small business that will carry the burden of the administration of the GST in this country. Not only will this palticular tax be collected by business; its overall economic outcome is quite incredible. One only has to look at the document itself to see that the tax in fact will create more unemployment. That is the consequence. That is borne out by the figures in the document itself. The GST will actually lead to a reduction in the size of the Australian economy. Our economy will shrink. Even on the best scenario advanced by the Opposition it will not begin to show an improvement until five or six years down the track. That is incredible, especially combined with the fact that the tax will increase inflation. What is the solution offered by the GST? It will mean a reduced and declining economy, higher inflation and higher unemployment. That is what will flow from this package. Yet the Opposition has the temerity to go to the Australian people and say, 'You know, here it is; here is the great plan for Australia's future'. (Time expired) Bremer Woll-Kammerei",102
238,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"The Government's own Economic Planning Advisory Council in 1988 released a report inquiring into the processing of raw materials in Australia which cautioned against the use of government grants to establish or assist any new ventures. Yet in Geelong the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is presently considering whether to bow to the demands of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to grant $25m to the Gennan company Bremer Woll-Kammerei to establish a greenfields wool tops processing plant at Lara near Geelong. Let me make it absolutely clear: the Geelong region is deserving of more investment by private finns wi'th its large skilled work force, the availability of a port and established wool selling facilities, all of which make it an attractive location for an early stage wool processor. The coalition would strongly welcome the prospect of BWK coming to Geelong. However, the company must not arrive in the city through a 30 per cent subsidy to its capital cost, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) seems to be proposing. Labor calls this sectoral assistance, but it is really picking winners. BWK aims ultimately to export 15,000 tonnes of wool tops per year. Victoria has a labour cost advantage over Bremen in Germany, where BWK has 1,000 employees. A natural geographic advantage is also enjoyed by Victoria, as BWK's products have as their destination China and Singapore. Why has BWK not located here anyway since it first floated the idea in 19877 Would its seeming reluctance to make a decision have anything to do with the $36m in sectoral assistance that Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd received in 1989? Will we see Kodak revisited through a pacesetter for the wool industry? Kodak actually imports about 20 per cent more by value than it exports; hence it does not contribute to Australia's surplus on the merchandise account. Far worse, the apparent result of this assistance by the Hawke-Keating Government has been that small independents at the retail end are now complaining that their supplier has become their competitor. Kodak is now processing rolls of film for an unsustainable $4.25unsustainable, that is, if the Government money tree had not dropped so many leaves in Kodak's direction. BWK's proposal could create similar difficulties. The effect on other Australian wool processors would be dramatic. Would they all put their hands out for similar deals, irrespective of their capital costs in the past? Even worse, this sectoral interference by government stands in stark contrast to the lack of a general pro-business environment for Geelong's small businesses, the forgotten players in this deliberately engineered recession of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is now the Prime Minister. The Government should be looking towards helping business by reducing the severity of taxes. What about helping a medium sized employer in the Geelong region, such as Classweave Industries, which has to contend with paying out an extra 45c in every wages dollar for such items as the training guarantee levy, payroll tax, superannuation, WorkCare, holiday pay loading, sick and annual leave, rostered days off, penalty rates and termination payments? Geelong's small and medium sized businesses would welcome three steps tomorrow night: the training guarantee levy must cease; the mooted 1 July increase in compulsory employer funded superannuation must be replaced by voluntary schemes with more of an emphasis on employee contributions; and, in consultation with the States, payroll taxes must be abolished. These moves are far preferable to sectoral assistance, which treats business investors unequally. We should focus on how less government interference can help the thousands of smaller and medium sized enterprises in Geelong. We should get Australia back to prosperity and take the vital step of job creation. Environment",103
239,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"In the time remaining I will attempt to read the prize winning essay from my environmental essay competition last year. Unfortunately, due to the leadership challenge on the Government side of the chamber, we did not have too many sittings last year so I was unable to read the winning entries. I thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) for taking the trouble to judge the entries. The winning entry in the primary school category was from Trent Kirk of the Heathridge Primary School in my electorate. His essay was entitled 'Improving and protecting our environment'. It reads: I am going to write about my ideas on how I think we could improve and protect our environment, assuming that the Government had the money to change these things. Pollution has increased more and more over the years and is obviously one of the biggest problems. Nature can help to break down a certain amount of pollution but man has put too much demand on nature so it is up to us to help nature cope. Water pollution is created by industrial waste being let into the waterways, fertilizers and pesticides being used by farmers leak into waterways, untreated sewage could contain disease and litter items are often thrown into waterways as means of thoughtless disposal. Other forms of pollution are air pollution such as gases made by carbon monoxide produced from cars, carbon dioxide produced from burning of coal, wood, oil, etc. and by human respiration. Litter pollution and land pollution is a major problem with over 1 million tonnes of waste being produced in WA. each year. We are all polluters but we can try to minimise this by recycling products such as cans, bottles, plastic and paper. Most communities have a local recycling collection area. When shopping buy environmentally safe products and always think RECYCLE! Stronger laws should be made about protecting our sealife and wildlife. Cars that are running badly should be put off the road by the police until the owners have fixed their cars so that they don't pollute. Industries should start making things by hand again. This stops lots of pollution from factories and would also help to increase jobs for people who are unemployed. In Australia a lot of industries grow their own trees to use for furniture and paper. These should be the only trees that are chopped down and all other forests should be left the way they are. Australia should help to educate less advanced countries about what is happening to the environment. The worse enemy against the environment is man. We should all think a bit more about what we are doing to the environment and not so much about ourselves. That essay was by Trent Kirk of Heathridge Primary School in my electorate. I February 1992. congratulate him on winning the primary school category in the essay competition 'Improving and protecting our environment'. Question resolved in the affirmative.

240,Mr BEAZLEY,NOTICES,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Ratification of the UNESCO Convention on Technical and Vocational Education requires consultation with the States and the Territories. The Commonwealth and the States and Territories are currently co-operating in wide-ranging reforms of the vocational education and training system to achieve more effective delivery and national consistency in approach. These and related issues have been the subject of review in the context of the Special Premiers' Conference on FederaljState responsibilities. Ratification of the Convention would be appropriate when the review process has concluded. Immigration (Question No. 655),109
241,Mr RUDDOCK,NOTICES,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 March 1991: How many applicants within all classes, including visitor/temporary entry and permanent residence, have been accepted for entry to Australia, subject to final checking on health and character, since first of January 1991 (a) generally and (b) under the Lebanese Concession. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In exceptional cases, the Migration Regulations make provision for applicants to be approved for entry before health and/or character checking has been completed. These provisions are detailed in Regulation 113 and 114 in the Migration Regulations as follows: Emergency (temporary entry) visa NA 113. (1) Where: (a) an applicant for a visa with respect to travelling to Australia for the purposes of obtaining temporary entry to Australia not being an Australian permanent resident, has satisfied all the prescribed criteria in relation to the relevant class of visas, other than any applicable public interest criteria or prescribed health criteria, or any prescribed criterion that can be satisfied only after the applicant has entered Australia (in this regulation called ""the remaining criteria""); and (b) the applicant seeks to travel to Australia before the remaining criteria have been satisfied; the applicant is entitled, on satisfying the criteria described under subregulation (2), to be granted an emergency (temporary entry) visa. (2) The following criteria are prescribed in relation to an emergency (temporary entry) visa: (a) the Minister, on consideration of a written statement by the applicant, is satisfied that the applicant has urgent and compelling reasons for travelling to Australia before the remaining criteria are satisfied: (b) the Minister is satisfied that the entry to Australia, before the remaining criteria have been satisfied, of the person who has applied for the visa would not be contrary to the interests of Australia. (3) A visa granted in accordance with this regulation is to be granted subject to the condition that this visa ceases to have effect on a specified day if the remaining criteria are not satisfied before that day. (4) In this regulation, ""satisfied"", in relation to prescribed criteria, means determined to be satisfied for the purposes of granting the relevant visa. Emergency (permanent entry) visa 114. (2) The following criteria are prescribed in relation to an emergency (permanent entry) visa: (a) the Minister is satisfied that the entry to Australia, before the remaining criteria have been satisfied, of the person who has applied for the visa would not be contrary to the interests of Australia; (b) the Minister is satisfied that the remaining criteria will be satisfied by the applicant after entry into Australia. The following figures provide available details of total visas issued from January 1991 for those applicants granted Emergency visas under visa classes 302 (permanent residence) and 303 (temporary entry). As there were no visas in these classes registered as being issued from the posts that receive applications under the Lebanese concessionary arrangements we can assume that no Emergency visas were issued to people applying under that category. Visa issues from 1 January 1991 to 31 August 1991 Number of visas visa class 303 329 visa class 302 329 Immigration: Permanent Residency (Question No. 819)",109
242,Mr RUDDOCK,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 May 1991: (1) Does Australia encourage prospective residents not to take up permanent residence on entering Australia. (2) Did the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade advise Hong Kong residents who held migration visas and who worked for Australian companies to remain in Hong Kong provided they visited Australia once in three years and thereafter once in five years. (3) Is there sufficient flexibility migration regulations to assist Hong Kong residents to obtain permanent residence in Australia on a basis not available to other overseas residents; if not, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade misled nonresidents about Australia's non-discriminatory migration principles. (4) If the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has been misrepresented, will he arrange for a correct statement of Australian immigration policy to be given to the Chinese Australian and Hong Kong media. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A comer stone of Australia's Migration Program is the long standing commitment to accepting migrants for permanent residence in Australia. Prospective migrants are required to comply with the requirements of any visa which may be issued to them. Migrant visas contain a return facility which allows multiple re-entry to Australia for a period of three years. This facility is activated on migrant entry to Australia and is intended to provide sufficient flexibility for migrants to settle successfully in the first few years of residence. This facility was introduced in 1987 and replaced earlier provisions which were less flexible. It is the responsibility of every permanent resident no matter how long they may have resided in Australia to comply with the requirements of the resident return visa regulations. Failure to do so may result in the loss of permanent resident status. (2) The following text from Senator Evans' all posts address to the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club on 22 April 1991 clearly shows that he referred to people who are employees of Australian firms and have entered Australia as migrants and are required to work overseas by their Australian employer. ""Secondly, under one aspect of our resident return policy employees of Australian firms who qualify under standard criteria for migration to Australia, and their families, are permitted to continue to reside in their country of origin-for up to five years at a time-after they have obtained permanent residence in Australia"". This provision is contained in Migration regulation 95 which allows for the grant of a multiple reentry visa for up to five years or the life of the passport whichever expires first. Regulation 95 covers three types of situations, two of which are in Australian relevant to this question) Regulation 95(b) requires the applicant to have resided in Australia as a resident for at least two of the three years immediately preceding the application. This is considered to demonstrate successful settlement. Regulation 95(c) was specifically framed to meet the needs of those residents who have special circumstances for which they require a five year return visa but cannot satisfy the two year in three requirement. The three groups covered by this concession are: residents employed overseas, or to be employed overseas by the Commonwealth or a State or Territory Government or a company or other organisation which has its principal office in Australia (members of the family unit are also eligible for this visa); residents who have or are going to accompany an Australian citizen overseas as a member of their family unit; residents who came to Australia as BMP migrants or were granted a permanent entry permit as a business migrant and who are required to travel overseas in the interests of their business which meets specific criteria. Residents who seek a visa on these grounds are required to have resided in Australia for some time in the five years immediately preceding application for the visa. This concession is offered in recognition of the fact that many such residents are absent from Australia on a frequent or lengthy basis due to their employment with an Australian governmental agency or business, family commitments or business commitments. (3) Applicants for migration to Australia from Hong Kong have access to the same provisions as all other applicants, regardless of their country of origin. This is a reflection of Principle 5 of the guiding Immigration Principles which underpin policy: ""Immigration policy will be non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, sex and religion"". Senator Evans in his speech quite clearly indicated that there will be no special ""right of abode"" scheme along the lines of the British nationality package. I quote: ""We will not introduce a right of abode scheme for Hong Kong residents along the lines of the British nationality package, because that would compromise our universal non-discriminatory policy; we have spent almost 20 years trying to erase the slur of previously discriminatory policies and we are not about to tar ourselves with that brush again"". (4) I am not aware of any cases of misrepresentation and therefore don't believe it necessary to provide any further statements. The local and overseas press are welcome to make inquiries on this issue. The Department has an extensive and informative series of leaflets covering the various migration categories as well as a leaflet which provides information on resident return visas for Australian permanent residents. These are widely available to both residents, prospective migrants and the press alike. Multiculturalism (Question No. 831) Mr Campbell asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 16 May 1991: (1) What is the estimated total sum spent on Government programs (a) devoted solely to maintaining the policy of multiculturalism and (b) which have a substantial multicultural component. (2) Does duplication of funding of multiculturalism occur between government bodies or different levels of government; if so, why. (3) As budget papers detailing Government expenditures on women and Aboriginal affairs are provided, why is there no budget paper detailing expenditure on multiculturalism. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth's multicultural policies and programs are identified by the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia. They have been estimated to cost less than $300 million in 1990-1991, of which the largest components comprised English language programs administered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment Education and Training at around $192 million. (2) No. All Commonwealth agencies are required to provide services consistent with multicultural policy principles, but each according to its functional responsibilities. State and local government bodies also apply multicultural policies to matters within their respective jurisdictions. (3) Annual expenditures on programs identified in the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia can be found in the annual budget papers against respective program and portfolio descriptions. Number of Commonwealth Public Servants Seconded to Queensland Government (Question No. 906) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 5 June 1991: (1) How many Commonwealth public servants were (a) seconded or (b) loaned to the Queensland Government in (i) 1990 and (ii) 1991. (2) With respect to the public servants referred to in part (1), (a) to which State departments were they seconded or loaned, (b) how many were seconded or loaned to each department, (c) how many remain with the department and (d) for how long have they served the department. (3) Is there any legislative authority for the Commonwealth to provide this assistance to a State; if so, what is it.",110
243,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The information sought by the honourable member is not available centrally and the following response has been compiled by the Public Service Commission using input provided by Australian Public Service departments and major agencies. This is set out in the table below. The distinction intended between 'seconded' and 'loaned' is unclear. The terms have been interpreted here as representing staff continuing to be funded by the Commonwealth as distinct from the Queensland Government. Most of the staff identified by agencies have been engaged directly and funded by the Queensland Government in 1990 and 1991, and are, or were, on leave from the Australian Public Service, under the provisions of Public Service Board Determination 1983/10. These staff (23) are listed in column 1(a). Four staff listed in column l(b) have been identified as being funded by the Commonwealth. One was on interchange from the Department of Transport and Communications and the other three were on loan from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to assist with the process of devolving data processing and compilation. (3) Secondments of this nature are undertaken with a variety of public and private organisations as the need arises, and do not require specific legislative authority.

246,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has functions under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act in respect of ILO Convention 111. Pursuant to those functions, the Commission receives complaints of discrimination in employment. The Commission has provided the following information: Detailed statistics in relation to ILO complaints in the years 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 are not available. The Annual Reports of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) for those years provide information about ILO complaints in conjunction with information about complaints received under the other international instruments annexed to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The only information in those Annual Reports that is specific to ILO 111 complaints for the period 1986-89 is the number of complaints received. The numbers of complaints were as follows: 1986-87 22 complaints 1987-88 6 complaints 1988-89 1 complaint. 1989-1990 The following information is available in relation to 1989-1990 complaints: There were 74 complaints under ILO 111: 48 in the Central Office, 17 from Queensland, 6 from the Northern Territory and 3 from Tasmania. The breakdown of grounds of complaint is at Table 1. 1990-1991 In relation to the 1990-1991 complaints the following information is available: There were 202 complaints under ILO 111: 122 in Central Office, 58 in Queensland, 4 in the Northern Territory and 18 in Tasmania. The breakdown of grounds of complaint is at Table 2. There was a substantial increase in the number of complaints received under ILO 111 when the grounds were extended by Regulation, effective from 1 January 1990, to include the following proscribed bases of discrimination: Age, medical record, criminal record, impairment, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, psychiatric disability, intellectual disability, nationality, sexual preference and trade union activity. Also in January 1990, HREOC's Regional Offices began dealing with ILO complaints.

Other information in relation to complaints (eg. whether made by males for females, the category of respondent etc.) is still amalgamatedfor reporting purposes-with that relevant to complaints lodged pursuant to other instruments annexed to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. A new complaints database is presently being installed. It will have the capacity to provide more detailed analysis of information in relation to complaints than has been available in the past. Discrimination (Question No. 1094) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 October 1991: (1) What forms of discrimination are prohibited (a) by Commonwealth laws and (b) in each State and Territory by the laws of that State and Territory. (2) When were the differences between State and Commonwealth laws on discrimination last considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys General (SCAG). (3) When will SCAG discuss those differences again.",115
247,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The relevant Commonwealth laws are the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The Racial Discrimination Act prohibits acts involving a distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. Indirect racial discrimination is also prohibited. In addition to the general prohibition on racial discrimination, the Racial Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination in specific areas, namely: access to places and facilities, land, housing and accommodation, provision of goods and services, employment and trade union membership. Advertisements indicating an intention to discriminate and incitement to racial discrimination are unlawful. The Act provides for equality before the law by striking down or removing discrimination from laws of the Commonwealth, States or Territories. The Sex Discrimination Act prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas of work, education, goods, services and facilities, accommodation, land, club membership and benefits, and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. Advertisements indicating an intention to discriminate are prohibited. The Act also makes unlawful sexual harassment in employment and education. There are a number of exemptions to the prohibitions on discrimination. (b) The New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, physical impairment, intellectual impairment and homosexuality in the areas of work, education, provision of goods and services, accommodation and registered clubs. The Act prohibits racial vilification. Serious racial vilification is an offence under the Act. It is also an offence to publish an advertisement indicating an intention to discriminate. The Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, race, impairment, parental status, and lawful religious and political beliefs and activities in the areas of work, education, provision of goods and services, accommodation, clubs and community service organisations and local government. Advertisements indicating an intention to discriminate are prohibited. The Act also prohibits sexual harassment in employment, accommodation, and the provision of goods and services. The South Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexuality, marital status, pregnancy, race, impairment and age, in the areas of employment, education, land, accommodation, and provision of goods and services. The Act also prohibits sexual harassment in employment, education and the provision of goods, services and accommodation. The Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy, race, the areas of work, education, access to places and vehicles, provision of goods, services and facilities, accommodation and clubs. The Act also prohibits sexual harassment in employment, education and accommodation. (2) and (3) Human rights matters first became an agenda item at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) in 1987. Since that time, SCAG has not undertaken a comparative analysis of discrimination laws, as no jurisdiction has requested that this matter be placed on the SCAG agenda. A matter can only be placed on the SCAG agenda with the agreement of the Attorneys-General. Austrade: Mr R. Evans (Question No. 1099) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, upon notice, on 10 October 1991: (1) Was Mr Ralph Evans' first overseas trip as Managing Director of Austrade to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Toronto, New York and Mexico City. (2) Is Austrade downgrading its emphasis on North America; if so, why did Mr Evans choose North America as his first overseas destination. (3) Has Austrade closed its office in San Francisco; if so, why did Mr Evans visit that city. (4) What were Mr Evans' engagements in San Francisco. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The itinerary also included Seattle, Washington and Ottawa. (2) Austrade is shifting its resources to markets where the types of services Austrade offers can be of significant assistance to Australian exporters. This shift in focus has resulted in the closure of some of Austrade's North American offices but has not diminished the importance of the North American market to Australia. Austrade still maintains a presence in North America and the Executive General Manager for the whole of the Americas is based in Los Angeles. Austrade has Executive General Managers covering six overseas regions of approximately equal importance: Americas, Europe, Special Markets, Oceania! South East Asia, Japan/Korea and East Asia; that three of these are in Asia reflects the priority Austrade gives to this part of the world. The specific timing of the North American trip was due to the readiness of the new Executive General Manager for Mr Evans to visit the region (some newly appointed Executive General Managers having not or only recently taken up duties) and to enable Mr Evans to promote trade and investment opportunities by speaking at two conferences: the Pacific Rim Advisory Council in Seattle on 30 September 1991. the MCIntosh Australian and New Zealand Investment Conference in New York on 8 October 1991 (which was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 9 October 1991). (3) and (4) Yes. Austrade advises that San Francisco was Mr Evans' landfall in the USA, where he met with the Executive General Manager for the Americas Region on Sunday 29 September to discuss management matters and plans for the regional visit.

Marriage Act: Brochure (Question No. 1102) Mr Andrews asked the Attorney-General, $ p.a upon notice, on 10 October 1991: 14,102 (1) Pursuant to subsection 42(5A) of the Mar5,670 riage Act 1961, are couples intending to marry 200 provided with a copy of the brochure entitled 3,000 'Marriage and You'. 13,000 (2) Was a new draft of the brochure circulated for comment to marriage agencies and marriage counselling agencies in 1989; if so, what comments were received. (3) Has the revised brochure been published; if not, why has there been a delay of two years.",118
249,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, it is a legislative requirement that couples intending to marry are provided with a copy of the brochure 'Marriage and You' by celebrants. (2) Yes. Associations of Marriage Celebrants, Marriage Education bodies and Marriage Counselling organisations were all consulted during the re-draft of the brochure. Comments received are as follows: Australian Association for Marriage Education, Catholic Society for Marriage Education and Marriage Guidance Australia suggested that it should be attractive in design and that the AAME pamphlet would provide a good model. This was adopted and the new Departmental pamphlet complements the style of the AAME pamphlet. Those organisations also commented that a proposed draft was generally negative, problem focused and patronising in tone. The Association of Civil Celebrants of Victoria felt that the new draft was a vast improvement, generally positive in tone but could be improved further. The Western Australian Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants (Inc) were happy to pass on information casually about where to seek help if asked. Also they believed that the difference between marriage counselling and marriage education should be stressed. They thought that the pamphlet and of organisations should be contained in one document rather than as two documents. However, this was not adopted because it is cheaper to produce them separately to ensure address lists of service providing agencies are current. The Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants of South Australia made many comments on the draft, some of which were adopted. They questioned the need for the re-draft and whether couples appreciated receiving a document of this type. Comments were also received from a number of individual marriage celebrants including doubt that couples felt the document was not necessary, although the celebrant supported the use of marriage education and counselling services. One celebrant from a rural area felt the pamphlets would not assist couples in rural areas with less access to marriage education/counselling services. A general comment was that the language used was too formal. (3) No. A number of factors have contributed to the delay in release of this document. These included: Protracted and difficult negotiation with the chosen graphic designer concerning the layout and text content of the proposed pamphlet design. The Australian National Council on AIDS entered into a lengthy negotiation with the Department concerning their interest in having a segment of the pamphlet dedicated to the issue of AIDs and other serious diseases which may be transmitted between partners. Before the revised pamphlet now entitled, Happily Ever, Before and After, could be released, it was necessary for the appropriate amendments to be made to the Regulations of the Marriage Act 1961. The changes to the Regulations received assent at the Executive Council meeting of 22 October 1991 and the new Regulations commenced on 1 November 1991. The pamphlets were made available at the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages in each State and Territory, in early November.

(2) Which new projects has the Office of Family the Multi- Services funded for 1991-92.",121
251,Mr DUFFY,AUTHORITY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no such organisation as the Office of Family Services. The Family Services Program is administered by the Family Services Section which is part of the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services (OLAFS). (a) OLAFS did not appoint a consultative committee in 1989 or 1990 to advise the Office about the funding of family services programs. Five peak organisations are funded under the Family Services Program to co-ordinate the activities of their affiliates and to represent them in dealings with my Department. These five organisations are: Marriage Guidance Australia; Centacare Australia; The Catholic Society for Marriage Education; The Australian Association of Marriage Education; and The Australian Council of Marriage Counselling Organisations. Meetings of the peak bodies are attended by one representative from each organisation. These representatives are elected by the members of their respective organisations. My Department does not appoint them or have any say in who occupies .the relevant positions in these organisations. Meetings of peak body representatives were not established for the purpose of discussing new policy submissions. Individual member organisations have been in existence and have been funded by my department for several years. They meet on an ad hoc basis to discuss matters of importance to the Family Services Program which affect the operation of their affiliated organisations. (b), (c), (d), (e) and (t) To date, there have been seven meetings of the peak body representatives. Details of those meetings are as follows: Year Month Location 1991 October Canberra May Melbourne March Sydney January Canberra 1990 December Canberra November Canberra October Canberra * Estimates of staff hours will be overstated for (g) The amount of ongoing funding to be granted to family services organisations was never discussed at meetings with peak body representatives. There were two meetings during the 1991-92 financial year which were convened partly to discuss new policy funding. The first was held in December 1990. to discuss submissions for new policy funding for four new family skills training projects arising from a 1990-91 Budget initiative. The four successful projects were chosen in consultation with the representatives and funded from the second half of the 1990-91 financial year. The second was held in May 1991 and this was the only occasion on which the peak body representatives met to discuss submissions for new policy funding in the 1991 -92 Budget context. (h) Yes. The peak body representatives voted on 35 submissions for new policy funding from a wide range of organisations across Australia.

(i) Yes. 1\venty-one of the 35 submissions voted on by the peak body representatives were funded, and 12 of those received five or more votes from those in attendance at the meeting. Of the remaining nine, two received four votes, one received three votes, three received two votes and three received one vote. The new policy submissions were subjected to further scrutiny by both clinical and administrative members of the Family Services Section. Recommendations for funding were subsequently made to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs for approval. Priority was accorded to those submissions which related to the provision of services to areas of unmet need, particularly in rural and remote Australia. projects voted on by the peak body representatives but not funded were as follows: Purpose of funding Amount of funding requested $ Fund West Sydney marriage education service 7,500 Establish Gold Coast marriage counselling service 24,780 Establish Strathpine marriage counselling service 54,500 Establish Geelong marriage counselling service 28,800 Establish marriage education services 19,500 Establish 2 marriage education services in isolated locations 10,000 Expand Liverpool marriage counselling service 128,523 Establish Gold Coast family mediation service 26,910 Expand Wagga branch 15,050 Expand marriage counselling services 47,250 Organisation Marriage Guidance Queensland Centacare Canberra and Region Marriage Guidance Queensland Marriage Guidance WA New policy initiatives were funded in the 1991-92 Budget context within the new policy funds available.

(2) Does the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 provide for the deregulation of the domestic carriage of grain which is the subject of a contn-ct involving interstate or export trade; if so, what procedures exist for growers to state the destination of their wheat. (3) Is he able to say whether any contracts have been let for the carriage of grain by road in Victoria. (4) Is he able to say what proportion of the Victorian wheat crop is (a) exported or (b) transported interstate. Mr Robert Brown-)'he answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not able to estimate the precise proportion of the Victorian wheat crop carried by rail due to reservation of intrastate wheat transport to rail by regulation. However, during the past three years, Victoria's average wheat production has been around 1.9 million tonnes, of which an average of 05 million tonnes has been used within Victoria. Purpose of funding Amount of funding $ Establish Orana and Far West NSW marriagt< 103,000 counselling service Relocation expenses 17,000 Relocation expenses and additional rent 26,000 Allocation for one off expenses 4,000 Establish Family Skills Training Program 90,000 Allocation for one off expenses 4,000 Allocation for one off expenses 4,000 Expand existing service 14,000 Part time administrative officer 35,900 Marriage Education Research and Development 57,600 Officer Allocation for one off expenses 2,500 Allocation for one off expenses 4,000 Extension of Family Skills Training Program 265,000 This 0.5 million tonnes of wheat used within Victoria is regulated to rail unless it is carried by the grower's own vehicle, carried by commercial road carrier for distances under 60 kilometres, or exempt from carriage by rail by Ministerial permit. The Federal Government is not aware of the volume of wheat used within Victoria which is subject to these exemptions. Federal Government Ministers have, on several occasions, written to relevant Victorian Ministers urging them to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, which reported in 1988. One of these recommendations was the deregulation of grain transport. Now that Victoria has removed restrictions .on the use of B-Doubles for the transport of grain, I hope that the Victorian Government will see the sense in removing outdated and inefficient regulations such as reservation to rail, and work to create a more efficient system for grain storage, handling and transport system for the benefit of its grain growers. \ ' (2) The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 provides for the deregulation of domestic carriage of wheat where the grain is destined for export or interstate trade. I am not aware of any procedures or requirements in Victoria for growers to nominate end destinations for wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) or to private traders. It is a matter of discretion for the AWB or private grain traders as to where they market the wheat delivered to them by growers, whether it be exported, sold interstate, or sold within Victoria. (3) Contracts have been ,let for the carriage of grain by road in victoria. The AWB has taken advantage of the opportunities offered by the deregulation of the transport of domestic wheat to enter into a contract with VicRail to cart a minimum nominated percentage of export wheat in order to minimise the transport costs to wheat growers and maximise growers' returns from the sale of their wheat. The AWB also lets contracts for the road transport of wheat for export and for sale on the domestic market. I presume that private grain traders also make use of the least cost paths for the transport of their grain, whether it be by road or rail. . (4) During the seasons 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91, an annual average of around 70 per cent of th- Victorian wheat crop was exported. Durmg this same period, an annual average of around 3 per cent of the Victorian wheat crop was transported interstate. Second-hand Vehicles: Importation (Question No. 1123) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 14 October 1991: (1) How many second-hand (a) cars and (b) other vehicles were imported into Australia in each year since 1986. (2) From which countries were the vehicles referred to in part (1) exported. (3) What was the average age of the vehicles. (4) What standards must the vehicles meet before being (a) sold and (b) registered. (5) Do the standards referred to in part (4) differ from those applying to new vehicles sold in Australia; if so, in what way. (6) Is there any mechanism for buyers of imported second-hand vehicles to be party to recalls by the manufacturer in the country of origin. Mr Robert Brown - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The honourable member requested statistics for each year since 1986. The Australia Bureau of Statistics, in providing the statistical information to 1991 (Aug) the Department of Transport and Communications, was unable to supply data on vehicles imported pre 1988 in the detail required to answer the question in full. The following therefore applies only to vehicles imported post 1988. Statistics for import of used vehicles pre 1988 are not readily available. (a) SECOND-HAND CARS IMPORTED INTO NA NA 1988 5446 1989 17638 1990 4363 1991 (Jan-Aug) 1693 (b) OTHER SECOND-HAND VEHICLES NA NA 1988 24 1989 46 1990 29 1991 (Jan-Aug) 4 (2) The above vehicles were exported from the following countries:Belgium; Canada; New Zealand; France; Japan; United Kingdom; Germany; Italy; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Sweden; USA; Brunei; Botswana; Greece; Philippines; Swaziland; Argentina; Austria; Fiji; Hong Kong; Lebanon; Malaysia; Mexico; Singapore; Saudi Arabia; Switzerland; Taiwan; Yugoslavia; Kuwait; Netherlands; Oman; Indonesia; Spain; Czechoslovakia; PNG; Zimbabwe. (3) The average age of imported used vehicles is not readily available. The following is the percentage of imported used vehicles which were more than 5 years old. NA Percentage over Year 5 years old 1988 88 1989 88 1990 84 81 NA Year 1988 1989 1990 1991 (Aug) (4) There are two categories of imported used vehicles that may be supplied to the market for use in transport. They are: vehicles which are fitted with a compliance plate vehicles which are eligible as a personal import i.e. where the person importing the vehicle has owned and used it overseas for a period of at least three months, and has not imported a vehicle in the previous 12 months. (a) Vehicles which are fitted with a compliance plate must comply with ·the Australian Design Rules applicable to that class of vehicle when presented for registration. Personally imported vehicles are required to provide a level of safety similar to vehicles normally marketed in Australia. In general this involves areas such as fitting of child restraint anchorages, appropriate seat belts in each seating position, head restraints and indicator/stop lights according to Australian colour requirements. Left hand drive vehicles are required to be converted to right hand drive. (b) Registering authorities apply as a condition of registration the same requirements as those outlined in (4)(a) with the additional requirement that vehicles must be roadworthy. (5) The Australian Design Rules which apply for compliance plate approval are the same for new and second hand vehicles. Current policy is for second hand cars to comply with the Design Rules which applied at the time the vehicle was manufactured. This policy is currently under review. (6) Australia exchanges recall information with USA, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom so that overseas recalls are brought to attention in Australia. Safety related recalls in Australia are carried under codes within the ambit of the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I am advised that the first supplier of vehicles to the Australian market would be responsible for any Percentage Over safety related recalls on vehicles supplied by them. 5 Years Old For vehicles imported by individuals or where the supplier is no longer in business, there is 4 provision for· State and Territory Governments to 13 order rectifications at the owners expense under the 52 Australian Transport Advisory Council ""Procedures 33 for the Rectification of Safety Related Defects in Vehicles"". I understand that this provision has seldom, if ever, been needed. Family Service Organisations: Expenditure (Question No. 1127) Mr Andrews asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 15 October 1991: (1) Did the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services write to family service organisations on 6 August 1991 seeking applications for one-off expenditure in 1991-92; if so, was approximately $500 000 available for distribution by the Office. (2) Did the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs warn agencies in 1990 not to budget for and incur deficits, to expand services or to purchase property without departmental or ministerial authority. (3) Did some of the agencies referred to in part (2) overcommit expenditure in 1990-91; if so, (a) which agencies, (b) by what sums and (c) for which projects. (4) Were any of the overcommitments referred to in part (3) subsequently funded; if so, (a) which overcommitments and (b) what funds are available for one-off expenditure as a consequence of the funding of overcommitments.

253,Mr DUFFY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 3,900 (a) Visits to agencies have been in operation 4,000 since 1960. The clinical team was expanded in 4,000 March 1990 to a team of 4 (a principal 1,300 psychologist and 3 psychologists/social workers) 4,000 and monitoring visits increased as a result of $15m ·4,000 expansion in family services funding for Marriage 4,000 Counselling, Marriage Education and two new 4,000 programs, Family Mediation and Youth Mediation 4,000 and Family Therapy. 4,000 4,000 (b) The number of agencies visited from March 4,000 1990 to present was 59.

Date: 12-13 August 1991 Agencies: Anglican Marriage Guidance Council Victoria (M Couns) (c) The total cost to my Department of the fiftynine visits including the annual salaries of the clinical team, travel, meal and other allowances, during the period of March 1990 to August 1991, was $245,675. (d) Yes. Three formal complaints have been received. (i) The Centre for Personal Encounter, South Australia objected in May 1990 to members of the clinical team observing marriage education sessions conducted by the agency. (ii) The Anglican Marriage Education and Counselling Services, Victoria, objected to the assessment of Departmental officers who made clinical monitoring visits to this agency on 9 May 1990 and 12 November 1990. A subsequent monitoring visit was arranged with Departmental officers and a consultant who prepared an independent assessment. This has resolved the situation to the satisfacwas tion of all parties. (iii) The President, Marriage Guidance Queensland, wrote to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs on 9 October 1990 concerning the proposed protocol for clinical monitoring visits to agencies. Mr Kelly objected to the need for the Department to conduct monitoring visits and in particular the supervisory and observation functions. The protocol for monitoring of visits was being developed as a collaborative effort of both Departmental staff and the Peak Bodies for family service organisations, including the Marriage Guidance Australia. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs wrote to the President, Marriage Guidance Queensland, affirming his support for the consultative process that had led to the development of the protocol, in particular the co-operative nature development process and the input of the Peak Bodies. (e) Yes. Agencies from time to time have suggested that they can monitor their own quality. Only Marriage Guidance Australia has put forward and implemented a self-monitoring process. This takes a similar form to Departmental monitoring in that services are observed and commented upon. However the process is infrequent, agencies being visited about once every four years and internal only being conducted by Marriage Guidance personnel. (f) Yes. The Attorney-General has responsibilities pursuant to section 12 of the Family Law Act. The Attorney-General may, at any time, revoke the approval of an organisation where(i) the organisation has not complied with a condition of the approval of the organisation; (ii) the organisation has not furnished, in accordance with section 13 a statement or report that the organisation was required by that section to furnish; or (iii) the Attorney-General is satisfied that the organisation is not adequately carrying out marriage counselling. With the substantive increase in funding for agencies it is important that the Department has in place appropriate quality control mechanisms. It is not possible therefore to transfer the monitoring function to a national organisation. For these reasons a protocol for monitoring visits developed via a consultative process involving Departmental officers and the Peak Bodies of all family service organisations. The protocol outlines the parameters of monitoring visits which are made by the Departmental officers to service provision agencies. It clearly defines the role of the Department and the Agency in all phases of the monitoring process, which are the preparatory, on-site and feedback/implementation of recommendations phase. The protocol was accepted by all Peak Body representatives in May 1991. It is the Departments intention to review and update the protocol annually. Fraser Island and Great Sandy Region (Question No. 1162) Mr Truss asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territorof the ies, upon notice, on 17 October 1991: (1) Did the federal Government consult with the Fraser Coast Co-ordinating Committee in the preparation of its nomination documents for World Heritage listing of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region; if so, (a) when and (b) where. (2) Did the federal Government take any action to ensure that the condition attached to Recommendation 7 of the report of the Queensland Commission of Inquiry into the Conservation, Management and Use of Fraser Island was satisfied before nominating Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region for World Heritage listing; if so, what action. (3) Was any action taken to implement Recommendation 76 of the Commission's report before the nomination was lodged; if so, what action.",149
254,Mrs KELLY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. (3) This is a matter for the Queensland Government. Fraser Island and Great Sandy Region (Question No. 1163) Mr Truss asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 October 1991: (1) Does the area of Fraser Island and Great Sandy Region nominated for World Heritage listing include the boat harbour at Urangan, Queensland. (2) Is the mainland coastal boundary of the area nominated in the listing (a) the low water mark, (b) the high water mark, (c) the king tide level or (d) some other level. (3) How many privately owned properties have been included in the area nominated for World Heritage listing. (4) Is she able to provide a complete list of the owners of properties included in the area nominated for World Heritage listing. (5) Were private landholders consulted before their properties were included in the area nominated for World Heritage listing.",152
255,Mrs KELLY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It includes those parts of the boat harbour below the high water mark not subject to leases. (2) The mainland coastal boundary of the area nominated in the listing is the high water mark. (3) and (4) The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage has advised that they are compiling a list of all real property descriptions within the World Heritage nomination area, and this information will be provided to the Commonwealth in due course. (5) The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage advised that the proposed boundaries were widely published within and adjoining the region and property owners were invited to comment. Wide Bay Military Training Reserve (Question No. 1164) Mr Truss asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 October 1991: (1) Did the Queensland Commission of Inquiry into the Conservation, Management and Use of Fraser Island recommend the inclusion of Camp Kerr and the Wide Bay Military Training Reserve at Tin Can Bay, Queensland, in the area of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region to be nominated for World Heritage listing. (2) Did the Commission of Inquiry recommend that any Commonwealth property other than that referred to in part (1) be included in the listing. (3) Does she support the continued use of the facility referred to in part (1) as a firing range. (4) Is the use of the facility for firing mortars, anti-tank weapons, grenades and heavy artillery consistent with World Heritage management obligations. (5) Is the continuation of carefully managed timber harvesting permissible in a World Heritage listed area. (6) Is she able to say whether the Queensland Government made repeated assurances to the local community that they would be consulted during the preparation of the boundaries of the area to be nominated for World Heritage listing. (7) Is she able to say what consultation took place with the (a) local community and (b) Fraser Coast Co-ordinating Committee before the federal Government decided to include the Camp Kerr military training area in the nomination for World Heritage listing.",152
256,Mrs KELLY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. However Mr Fitzgerald did recommend that the Commonwealth be requested to co-operate in respect of land owned by it in the regional park (including the sites of lighthouses at Double Island Point and Sandy Cape). (3) Yes, subject to an appropriate plan of management. (4) and (5) Activities are pennissible within a World Heritage Area if they are not inconsistent with the protection of the values for which the area was listed. (6) This is a matter for the Queensland Government. (7) No consultation took place by the Commonwealth Government with either body. World Heritage Committee Meetings (Question No. 1166) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 5 November 1991: (1) When Australia was a member state of the World Heritage Committee did it attend the first 12 ordinary sessions and the first extraordinary session of the committee. (2) When Australia was no longer a member state of the committee was it represented by an observer (a) at the 13th ordinary session of the committee in December 1989 but not (b) at the 14th ordinary session in December 1990. (3) Will Australia be represented by an observer at the 15th ordinary session of the committee in December 1991. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia attended the first 12 ordinary sessions of the World Heritage Committee and the first extraordinary session of the Committee. (2) (a) Australia was represented by an observer at the 13th ordinary session of the Committee in December 1989. (b) Australia was not represented at the 14th ordinary session of the committee in December 1990. (3) Australia will be represented by an observer at the 15th ordinary session of the committee in December 1991. Bacillus Thuringiensis (Question No. 1168) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Small Business and Customs, upon notice, on 5 November 1991: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the role of the biological insecticide, Bacillus thurillgiensis, otherwise known as BT, in lowering reliance on synthetic organic insecticides in the cotton industry. (2) Is a duty of 15 per cent imposed upon the importation of BT. (3) Does Australia lack the appropriate fennentation capacity to produce BT. (4) Will he remove the import duty on BT. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, BT is used in integrated pest management programs. The BT based products do not appear to be confined to the cotton industry although it is a major customer for the product. (2) Yes. (3) It has been claimed by applicants for Tariff Concession Orders that there is no local manufacture. It does not follow from the evidence provided that there is no capacity to produce the product in Australia. Local manufacturers of diagnostic reagents have the ability to grow various organisms and have done so very successfully. There seems to be no technical reason why they could not produce an organism such as BT. (4) Provision exists under the Customs legislation for duty to be removed when there is no competition between locally produced and imported products. Applications have been lodged for Tariff Concession Orders. If successful, the applications will result in the duty currently payable on these products being removed. United Nations Report on Economic Developments in the Occupied Territories (Question No. 1172) Mr Courtice asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 5 November 1991: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether a UN economic study of the West Bank was recently completed. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether a 40 page report concerning the economic situation in the occupied territories was prepared; if so, (a) has the report been released and (b) did the report indicate a significant positive change in Israeli economic policy towards the residents in the occupied territories. (3) If the report referred to in part (2) has not been released, is the Minister able to say whether the report has been withheld by UN authorities; if so, why. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) completed on 9 August a report on recent economic developments in the Occupied Territories. The report examined economic developments in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the period July 1990 to June 1991. (2) The 39-page report was provided to the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD on 23 September 1991 and has been given general distribution. A copy has been forwarded to Mr Courtice. In summary, the report concluded that: (a) The economic impact of the Gulf crisis had a disastrous effect on the Occupied Territories, resulting in reduced remittances from Palestinian workers who were previously employed in the Gulf region, a strained labour market and a cessation in trade with traditional markets. (b) New restrictive measures imposed by the Israeli authorities, induding a blanket curfew throughout the Occupied Territories from January to March 1991, had further complicated and aggravated an already precarious economic situation in the Occupied Territories. The main consequences had been immediate production losses in all economic and social service sectors, a halt to imports of vital agricultural products, the total of income from work in Israel and diversion of savings to consumption rather than investment At the same time, the range of restrictive measures which had operated throughout much of the occupation period continued to be enforced-collective punishments, expropriation of Palestinian land and expansion of Israeli settlements. The introduction of a new system of security passes limited the number of Palestinians working in Israel, further contributing to massive unemployment among the population. (c) The Palestinian people implemented new measures to encourage economic self-sufficiency during the period covered by the report. This and other factors prompted the Israeli authorities to re-evaluate some of their policies towards the Palestinian economy and introduce some new measures. These included the approval of licences for a number of small-scale manufacturing, agricultural and commercial projects, steps towards granting permission to local businessmen to set up banking facilities in the Territories for the first time since 1967, and easing the restrictions on the flow of external financial resources into the Territories. Israel's willingness to move towards a liberalisation of its economic policies towards the Territories was also influenced by the involvement of international aid agencies in ensuring the smooth operation of local Palestinian development programs and by internal pressure within Israel to favour less dependence on Palestinian labour and the corresponding need to encourage job-creation within the Occupied Territories. (d) The report commented that, though relatively modest in the context of a harsh policy environment, these changes appeared as encouraging signs of an Israeli willingness to take steps towards a more liberal economic environment in the Territories. (3) See (2) above. Racial Discrimination (Question No. 1177) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 6 November 1991: Further to his answer to question No. 981 (Hansard, 16 October 1991, page 2095), did consultation conclude with the States and Territories in the forum of the Standing Committee of loss Attorneys-General in Melbourne on 25 October 1991 concerning declarations under (a) Article 14 of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and (b) Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",152
257,Mr DUFFY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The matter was raised with the Attorneys General. The process of consultation on these issues is ongoing. Japanese Investment: Crime Links (Question No. 1181) Mr Bradford asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 6 November 1991: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the Four Comers program broadcast on the ABC on 30 September 1991. (2) If so, will the Government take action to protect the credibility of reputable Japanese investors in Australia; if so, what action. (3) Will the Government ensure adequate resources are allocated to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to enable proper checking of Japanese corporations and their directors intending to invest in Australia to ensure they have no connections with organised crime. (4) Does the Foreign Investment Review Board consult the AFP in respect of all applications by Japanese corporations and individuals proposing to invest in Australia; if not, why not. (5) Will the Government seek the full cooperation of the Japanese Government to ensure that Australia is not infiltrated by Japanese organised crime and that Australian gambling institutions are not used to launder money gained through illegal or corrupt activity.",154
258,Mr DUFFY,CSME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) It is not the responsibility of the Australian Government to enhance the reputation of any class of foreign investors. (3) The Government will continue to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to the AFP to enable the effective performance of its functions, including undertaking checks of potential foreign investors, as requested by the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs recently issued a general policy Direction to the AFP under s.13 (2) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (tabled in the Senate on 12 December 1991). The Direction places emphasis on the AFP enhancing its co-operation with other areas of the Commonwealth administration which exercise law enforcement responsibilities, particularly in an ongoing assessment of needs and in developing strategies to meet these. (4) Australia's foreign investment policy is designed and ad.rnitllstered with a view to encouraging direct foreign investment. The investment screening requirements are directed towards ensuring that opportunity exists for the Government to exercise its prerogative to examine major investment proposals to establish whether national interest considerations arise. I am advised that in the administration of the policy. the Executive to the Foreign Investment Review Board consults with State and Commonwealth Government Departments and authorities as relevant, and always on major or more significant proposals. As part of these processes, the Executive may be in contact with the Australian Federal Police and always consults in relation to sensitive investment areas, such as casinos, and in cases suspected to involve criminal elements. The processing time delays that would result from undertaking more extensive police investigations would penalise the vast majority of legitimate foreign investors, represent an unwarranted intrusion on privacy for most of those investors, tend to discourage direct investment from overseas and add significantly to regulatory costs. Any criminal activities which are uncovered during the screening processes are, of course, referred to the appropriate authorities for investigation and initiation of proceedings, as appropriate. (5) Australia seeks to pursue close law enforcement co-operative arrangements with Japan and liaison arrangements are already in place between the respective law enforcement agencies. However, we cannot expect Japan to 'ensure' that Japanese criminal organisations do not operate in other countries. The Commonwealth has enacted an elaborate set of measures, including the recently extensively amended Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, to help ensure that financial institutions, including gambling institutions, are not used for money laundering. Marriage Education Programs (Question No. 1183) Mr Andrews asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 6 November 1991: How many couples did (a) Marriage Guidance New South Wales, (b) Marriage Guidance Victoria, (c) Marriage Guidance Queensland, (d) Marriage Guidance South Australia, (e) Marriage Guidance Western Australia, (t) Marriage Guidance Tasmania, (g) Centacare Catholic Family Welfare New South Wales, (h) Catholic Family Welfare Bureau Victoria, (i) Centacare Catholic Family Services Queensland, (j) Catholic Family Services South Australia. (k) Catholic Marriage Preparation and Education Western Australia, (1) Centacare Tasmania, (m) Centacare Australian Capital Territory, (n) Anglican Counselling Centre New South Wales, (0) Anglican Marriage Guidance Council Victoria, (p) Anglican Family Care Queensland, (q) Anglican Community Services South Australia, (r) Anglican Marriage and Family Counselling Services Western Australia, (s) Anglicare Tasmania, (t) Family Life Movement New South Wales, (u) Unifam Marriage and Family Counselling Service New South Wales, (v) Centre of Personal Encounter South Australia, (w) Family Relationships Institute Victoria and (x) Wesley Central Mission Western Australia state in their annual reports to his Department as attending marriage education programs conducted by them in (i) 1989-90 and (ii) 1990-91.",155
259,Mr DUFFY,CSME,"lam advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As I stated in my answer to your Question No. 1066 of 11 September 1991 regarding marriage education, the statistics on the delivery of marriage education programs provided to my Department in the annual reports of individual organisations are neither consistent nor complete for the 1989-90 and 1990-91 financial years or previous years. The information below, which has been extracted from the annual reports, illustrates this fact. Couples attending marriage education programs (a) MGNSW not available (b)MGV not available (c) MGQ not available (d) MGSA not available (e) MGWA not available (f) MGTas not available (g) CFW NSW not available (h) CFW Vic not available (i) CFW Qld 1,132 couples (j) CFW SA not available (k) CMP&E WA not available (1) CFW Tas not available (m) CFW ACT not available (n) ANGNSW 452 couples (0) ANG Vic not available (P) ANG Qld not available (q) ANG SA not available (r) ANG WA not available (s) ANG 129 couples (t) FLM NSW 652 couples (u) Unifam NSW not available (v) COPE SA not available (w) FRI Vic not available not available (x)WCMWA not available not available The reason why so little of the information is specifically related to the number of couples participating in marriage education programs is that organisations measure their levels of service delivery differently. Some examples of measures used are participants, individuals, programs, courses, interviews and sessions. Additionally, some organisations provide service delivery statistics, but do not differentiate between marriage education and, for example, marriage counselling. A problem which occurs to a lesser extent is that a small number of organisations provide information on a calendar year basis which is not directly comparable to financial year funding. However, in 1990-91, my Department introduced a standard financial reporting format which included a section on levels of services provision. This source indicates that, in the 1990-91 financial year, 9,434 couples attended marriage education programs conducted by organisations who receive Commonwealth funding for that purpose. This figure was also provided to you in response to Question No. 1066. The breakup of this figure is as follows: 1989 1990 Couples attending marriage education programs in 1990-91 not available not available (a) MGNSW 144 not available (b) MGV 12 not available (c) MGQ 400 not available (d) MGSA 120 not available (e) MGWA 112 1,242 couples (f) MGTas 72 596 couples (g) CFW Sydney 1,158 1,158 couples (h) CFW Melbourne 500 not available CFW Ballarat 111 not available CFW Geelong 138 not available (i) CFW Brisbane 1,082 not available CFW Cairns 98 484 couples CFW Townsville 197 283 couples CFW Rockhampton 325 193 couples (j) CFWSA 584 not available (k) CMP&E WA 840 not available (I) CFW Tas 31 151 couples (m) CFW ACT 352 not available en) ANGNSW 497 not available (0) ANG Vic 311 not available (P) ANG Qld 464 (q) ANGSA (r) ANGWA (s) ANG (t) FLMNSW (u) Unifam NSW (v) COPE SA (w) FRI Vic (x) WCMWA You should note that these figures were estimated by the organisations prior to the end of the 1990-91 financial year and may vary from those in annual reports. The method of using couples as a measure rather than individuals, participants, program, interviews or other measures will also cause variation. In this case, Marriage Guidance New South Wales and Marriage Guidance Queensland have used individuals as a measure of service provision. Australian Tourist Commission (Question No. 1191) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: (1) How many directors are serving on the Board of the Australian Tourist Commission.

(5) What would be the effective tax rate on the road transport industry if all the charges referred to in part (3) were taken into account. (6) Is the revenue from the proposed road user charges to be directed to expenditure on roads or to general revenue. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the 30 July 1991 Special Premiers' Conference, Heads of Government agreed to establish a National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) to develop and implement national arrangements for registration, regulation and charging of vehicles over 4.5 tonnes. On 4 September I sent a letter to road transport operators around Australia informing them of developments in the road transport reform process and explaining the objectives and timetable for the reforms. (a) Approximately 3000 letters were sent to operators. (b) The total cost was approximately $1028. (c) A copy of the mailing list and letter have been provided separately to the honourable member. (2) The letter sent to operators stated that""Road use charges, including the fuel charge, will be clearly distinguished from taxes and vary with road expenditure rather than budget decisions. The latest research available to the Government indicates that when a realistic level of road use charges is taken into account the tax rate on the industry is 5.5 per cent, compared to the average for all industries of 5.3 per cent."" (a) This research simply updated work by the Inter-State Commission (lSC) on the incidence of tax on inputs to road transport for 1986-87. The basis of the research is the National lnputOutput Tables for 1986-87 published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The level of road charges taken into account was $353 million, representing a component of the excise on fuel used by the road transport industry in 1986-87, the year to which the research relates. The rate of excise regarded as a road use charge in the calculations was 12.72 cents per litre. This rate was derived from the lSC recommended rate for 1989-90 of 15.63 cents and adjusted for the lower level of road expenditure in 1986-87. (b) The ISC's recommended road charges were used in this research because they arc the only comprehensive charging recommendations to have been published in recent years. Other charging approaches would yield similar results. This is because the aggregate payments by the industry would not differ greatly, ie the difference is largely in the distribution of costs, and therefore charges, between vehicles, rather than the size of the overall payments which is determined by the level of road expenditure. This work could be readily applied to charging recommendations developed by the National Road Transport Commission. The Commission will be recommending heavy vehicle charges by March 1992 to be phased in gradually from 1 January 1993. (3)(a) to Cf) The ABS Input-Output Tables referred to and the tax level estimated using this data include all the taxes and charges mentioned. (4) Information for the years 1988-89 to 1990-91 is incomplete. The available information is as follows: (a) Revenue from sales tax on trucks, parts, oils, tyres, ropes and other industry requirements is not available from published sources. The Department of the Treasury has estimated such revenue in 1990-91 from trucks, prime movers, trailers, spare parts, tyres (other than retreaded tyres), batteries and lubricants to be between $510 and $790 million. (b) Information on revenue from total vehicle registration fees and taxes published by ABS was $1282 million in 1988-89, and $1368 million in 1989-90, but a figure is not available for 1990-91. No separate details are published by ABS for revenues from the road transport industry. Registration revenues in 1990-91 have been estimated by the Commonwealth-State Overarching Group on Land Transport at $1349.9 million for all vehicles and $340.9 million for heavy vehicles. (c) No infom1ation is available on revenues from payroll tax paid by the road transport industry. (d) ABS information on revenue from total stamp duties on all vehicle registrations was $651 million in 1988-89, and $728 million in 1989-90, but a figure for 1990-91 is not available. Separate details are not available for the road transport industry. (e) Information on revenues from import duties on trucks, parts and tyres used in the road transport industry is not available. (f) Information necessary to calculate estimates for 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91 is not available. (5) The effective tax rate in 1986-87, with all taxes and charges referred to in part (3) taken into account, is 5.5 per cent of the value of production of the road transport industry. (6) Under the arrangements agreed by Heads of Government at the July 1991 Special Premiers' Conference for a national registration, regulation and charging system for heavy vehicles, revenues will not be dedicated to road expenditure. It was considered that as this system could only fund 25 per cent of road expenditure this would not be a practical arrangement. This issue will be considered in work on the feasibility and desirability of a comprehensive road use charging system covering all vehicles. This work commenced under the Special Premiers' Conference process in 1991, and will continue in 1992. Under the Agreement reached by Heads of Government the Commission is initially to use the , system of expenditure recovery known as PAYGO in determining charges. Under PAYGO charges are set to recover actual road expenditure. Whether the revenue from these charges is then hypothecated to road expenditure or not will not affect the level of charges. The States and Territories will collect mass distance charges, and it will be a matter for their individual judgment whether this revenue is hypothecated. As noted above, hypothecation would not affect the level of charges and would not be likely to affect the level of road expenditure. Geelong Area: TAFE Funding (Question No. 1211) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 11 November 1991: Has the Government approved support funding for the re-organisation of Technical and Further Education in the Geelong area; if so, (a) what sum is involved, (b) when will the funds be provided, (c) has expenditure commenced; if not, why not and (d) with respect to what specific projects has funding been provided. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) The sum involved is $100,000. (b) Funds will be provided during the 1991 and 1992 calendar years. (c) Yes. $60,000 will be provided in 1991 with the remainder in 1992. (d) The funds are being provided to develop a masterplan in relation to the future facilities needs at the Gordon College of TAFE. The study will also look at the relationships between TAFE and industry training facilities in the area, to show how the total training infrastructure could be shared, enhanced and developed as part of a broader industry training strategy. Post Offices: Profitability (Question No. 1214) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 11 November 1991: What accounting procedure does the Australian Postal Corporation use to gauge the profitability of individual post offices. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows: Australia Post operates a comprehensive suite of computerised accounting systems, based on commercial accounting principles, which capture detailed revenue and expenditure information in respect of each outlet. This detailed revenue and expenditure information is provided on an ongoing basis to a General Ledger System where the information is consolidated in respect of each outlet. Accounting reports for each outlet are obtained from the General Ledger System and associated systems on a regular basis, typically on a monthly basis. Australia Post uses the General Ledger System and associated systems to measure the profitability of the ""retail"" activities of individual offices. The profit or loss so measured reflects only the performance of retail activities at post offices and post office agencies. That is, it excludes such activities as delivery or outward mail processing which are treated as separate ""cost centres"" from the retail ""profit centre"". ""Retail"" profitability is measured by comparing the costs of the ""retail"" activities (ie. postage sales, acceptance of postal articles and agency services for principals such as the Commonwealth Bank and Telecom Australia) with the revenue generated by these activities. Retail revenue is calculated as the number, or value of retail transactions multiplied by the relevant fee. The fees or transfer prices are referenced, where possible, to market rates. Where no market rates exist, the transfer price has been calculated on an ""efficient cost"" basis ie. the transfer price reflects the amount of work that should be involved in the activity.

(3) If a sum was spent on consultancy fees, (a) which consultants were employed and (b) in respect of each of their assignments, (i) what was its purpose, (ii) between which dates was it conducted, (iii) what fee was paid, (iv) what were the locations of the offices attended, (v) what was the duration in hours or days of each seminar or workshop conducted, (vi) what expenditure was incurred in (A) consultants' and (B) staff travelling expenses- and (vii) why was the engagement of a consultant necessary. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the period of enquiry (a) 1990-91, and (b) the first quarter of 1991-92 there were no access and equity workshops conducted as identified in Strategy 3.4 of Outcome 3 of the Department's Access and Equity Plan 1991-94.

Cuba (Question No. 1226) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 13 November 1991: Is he able to say whether the ban on Christians joining the Cuban Communist Party has been lifted; if so, in recognition of this breaking down of religious apartheid, will Australians be able to trade and play sport with Cubans.",171
267,Dr BLEWETT,VICTORIA,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: At the Fourth Cuban Communist Party Congress held in Santiago de Cuba in October this year, restrictions on people holding religious beliefs becoming Communist Party members were lifted. Australia welcomes this decision, although it is only a very smal1 step towards reform of the Cuban political. system. The decision, however, has no bearing on trade and sporting links with Cuba. Australia does not have, and has never imposed, trade or sporting bans on Cuba. United Transport Pty Ltd (Question No. 1233) Mr Burr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 14 November 1991: Does Australian National Line Limited own United Transport Pty Ltd; if so, (a) does United Transport qualify for exemption from (i) sales tax on the purchase of new equipment and spare parts and (ii) fuel taxes and (b) does the Government provide any form of hidden subsidy or cost advantage to United Transport.",171
268,Mr BEAZLEY,VICTORIA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: ANL Limited has no connection with any company currently called United Transport Pty Ltd. Trans-United Pty Ltd which previously was called United Transport Pty Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of ANL Limited. The name of this company was changed to distinguish it from another company with that same name. Insofar as Trans-United is concerned: (a) (i) Trans-United is liable for all taxes and duties levied on companies in the private sector (a) (ii) Trans-United is liable for all taxes and duties levied on companies in the private sector (b) No. Barristers: Legal Aid Briefs (Question No. 1234) Mr MACKellar asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 November 1991: In each State and Territory in the years ending (a) 30 June 1990 and (b) 30 June 1991, how many (i) barristers were listed by the respective bar associations as being available for Legal Aid Commission briefs, (ii) of those barristers received briefs and for how many days, (iii) (A) barristers were briefed direct and (B) solicitors were assigned direct by the Legal Aid Commission and for how many days and (iv) of the barristers and solicitors referred to in part (iii) were former employees of the Legal Aid Commission and how many days were involved in their briefs and assignments.",172
269,Mr DUFFY,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Legal aid is administered in each State and Territory by independent Legal Aid Commissions, established under State and Territory legislation. The Commonwealth does not have the power to direct those Commissions to provide the information requested. Senator Tate has advised me, however, that the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services will write to the Directors of the Commissions asking them if they will provide you with the information direct. Metropolitan Railways: Passenger Numbers (Question No. 1236) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 27 November 1991: Is the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics able to provide data on the number of passengers carried by metropolitan railways in each mainland State. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The largest passenger task was undertaken in Melbourne where there were 305.7 million passenger journeys in 1988-89 and 284.0 million in 1989-90. In Sydney there were 246.1 million passenger journeys in 1988-89 and 248.4 million in 1989-90. Brisbane had considerably less with 49.4 million in 1988-89 and 43.2 million in 1989-90. Adelaide was much smaller with 9.1 million jouroeys in 1988-89 and 8.9 million in 1989-90. Perth was similar to Adelaide with 9.4 million in 1988-89 and 8.5 million in 1989-90. The total for Australia was 619.7 million passenger journeys in 1988-89 and 593.0 million passenger journeys in 1989-90. These numbers are shown in the attached table. niE RAIL PASSENGER TASK FOR NA FOR 1988-89 AND 1989-90 ('000 passenger journeys) City 1988-89 1989-90 Melbourne 305,700 284,000 Sydney 246,100 248,400 Brisbane 49,418 43,248 Adelaide 9,060 8,900 Perth 9,400 8,500 Total 619,678 593,048 ----------------Note-The number of passenger journeys in Brisbane was boosted in 1988-89 by Expo 88.

Australian Science and Technology (Question No. 1238) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 November 1991: Further to the statements in the answer to question No. 1084 (Hansard, 11 November 1991, page 2818), that (a) the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) has had cordial and productive relationships with successive MitUsters for Science and Technology and (b) there have been no meetings between those Ministers and ASTEC from 1980 to September 1991, what were the principal elements that constituted the cordial and productive relationships referred to in the answer.",172
270,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Part (7) of the answer to question No. 1084 noted that MitUster Free attended a meeting of ASTEC in September 1991. Other Ministers for Science and Technology have also been invited to Council meetings. Other than attendance by Ministers at formal meetings of ASTEC, there are many ways in which relationships between ASTEC and Ministers have been maintained. Ministers Crean and Free have given addresses at ASTEC seminars and forums. They have made tabling statements on ASTEC reports in Parliament. Ministers Jones and Crean have requested that studies be undertaken; for example those leading to reports on the core capacity of Australian science and technology (1989) and on a proposal for an Australian gravitational observatory (1991). The Chairman of ASTEC was a member of Minister Crean's delegation to Spain in 1990. Successive Chairmen of ASTEC have met with Ministers for Science and Technology on numerous occasions, and the outgoing Chairman, Professor RL Martin, AO, regards his relationships with Ministers as having always been cordial and productive. Austudy Fares Allowance (Question No. 1241)",173
271,Mr MCARTHUR,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 28 November 1991: (1) How many (a) secondary and (b) post-secondary students applied for reimbursement of airfares between 1 July and 30 November 1991 under the Council Austudy Fares Allowance. (2) What total sum was paid in reimbursement of airfares under the scheme referred to in part (1) for (a) secondary and (b) post-secondary students between 1 July and 30 November 1991. (3) How many one-way journeys in either direction were made by (a) secondary and (b) post-secondary students travelling between (i) Melbourne, (ii) Canberra, (iii) Sydney, (iv) Brisbane and (A) Townsville, (B) Cairns, (C) Perth, (D) Alice Springs and (E) Darwin by air under the scheme referred to in part (1) between 1 July and 30 November 1991. (4) What was the average one-way fare paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training for (a) secondary and (b) post-secondary students on each route referred to in part (3) between 1 July and 30 November 1991. (5) What percentage of one-way journeys on the routes referred to in part (3) for (a) secondary and (b) post-secondary students attracted a fare discount greater than 25 percent of the standard one-way economy class fare. (6) Does the Department employ procedures which allow students to travel under the Austudy Fares Allowance scheme on discounted fares which require that payment be made within three days of booking. (7) Will the Department direct students travelling between capital cities and other major airports to use fares discounted by more than 25 percent, where available; if not, why not. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Information by mode of transport not available. Total numbers approved for reimbursement are: (a) Secondary students: 10. (b) Tertiary students: 2,330. (2) Expenditure on airfare claims not available. Expenditure on all fares assistance claims was: (a) Secondary students (10): $915.30. (b) Tertiary students (2,330): $403,580.91. (3) Information by mode of transport or route not available. (4) Information on average fare reimbursed not available. (5) Infonnation on discount fares reimbursed not available. (6) It is the student's responsibility to arrange their own flight reservations. For students qualified for student concession airfare rates, the Department will reimburse up to the cost of the student concession fare (75% of the standard economy fare). Students can avail themselves of discounted fares if they so wish. When asked, the Department will issue students with a travel warrant, taking into account the payment requirements for discounted fares. Students must apply for warrants within a reasonable time so that their eligibility for fares assistance can be established and the relevant documentation issued. (7) No. It would disadvantage students to oblige them to seek discount fares. There are generally a limited number of seats available at the discounted fare on any particular route. Demand for these is high. Significant cancellation penalties also apply to discount fares. The heavily discounted fares (those requiring payment within three days) are non-refundable. On other discounted fares, a 50% cancellation fee can apply.

275,Mr HOWE,AIRLINE PASSENGERS FROM AND TO USA,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) to (6) There has been no decision to close or relocate offices in the inner Sydney metropolitan area including Crows Nest and Chatswood. The Department is committed to maintaining, and improving where possible, present levels of service to clients. Part of the process of improving service is to see if our offices could be placed in locations better able to serve local communities. In some instances leases are due to expire and decisions have to be taken soon on possible relocations. (7) The Department intends to consult community and client groups about service delivery in the city. Area Sydney Central has already begun these consultations. Coronation Hill (Question No. 1253) Mr Filing asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 19 December 1991: Further to the answer to question No. 1091 (Hansard, 6 November 1991, page 2522), why was it deemed not appropriate to compensate Newcrest Mining Limited, one of the joint venture companies at Coronation Hill, following the Government's decision to prevent mining at Coronation Hill.",181
276,Mr KEATING,AIRLINE PASSENGERS FROM AND TO USA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As with any major project falling within the Commonwealth's constitutional jurisdiction, the Coronation Hill project was required to obtain a number of Government approvals before it could proceed. In the case of Coronation Hill, it had been made clear at the outset that the project could proceed only if it met strict environmental, Aboriginal, heritage and related standards determined by the Government. The fact that the Coronation Hill project ultimately failed to meet those requirements did not, in the Government's view, justify the provision of compensation to the Coronation Hill 10int Venture.

Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (a) It would be an agreement for cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in nuclear science and technology. See my answer to the question without notice in the Senate on 10 December 1991 (Senate Hansard pp.4485, 4486). (b) Officials of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs and the Indonesian National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN). (c) Discussions began in October 1990. (d) Officials' meetings on 30-31 October 1990 and 14 November 1991 in Jakarta and diplomatic correspondence during this period between the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs. (2) As I said in my answer to the question without notice in the Senate on 10 December 1991 (Senate Hansard pp.4485, 4486), an agreement has not yet been finalised. Any agreement which is concluded would, in accordance with normal procedures, be made public on signature and subsequently tabled in Parliament. (3) It is not nonnal practice for such documents relating to Government to Government discussions of an agreement still under discussion to be made available and it would therefore not be appropriate to do so in this case. (4) See the answers to (l)(b) and (3) above. It is not nonnal diplomatic practice to make public such details of international negotiations except where there is some obvious need to do so. (5) No. (6) See the answer to (l)(b) above. The representatives have broad experience in the full range of nuclear policy issues. (7) No. (8) Discussions on the text of the agreement are continuing in diplomatic exchanges between the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and Indonesian officials. (9) A Deputy Director General of BATAN visited Australia 27 October to 5 November 1991 at the invitation of ANSTO for discussion of technical cooperation between ANSTO and BATAN. The visit was not in connection with uranium sales but, in the course of his visit, the Deputy Director General visited the two uranium mines in operation and had contact with mining company officials. He was accompanied throughout his visit by an ANSTO official. (10) See my answer to the question without notice in the Senate on 10 December 1991 (Senate Hansard pp.4485, 4486). IAEA Funding: Inspections in Iraq (Question No. 1258) Mr John Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 19 December 1991: Has the latest mission to investigate Iraq's nuclear weapons program been abandoned because the International Atomic Agency has run out of money; if so, (a) what are the implications, (b) what is the response of the Australian Government to the situation and (c) how will the non-proliferation program be affected. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: An inspection mission to Iraq of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)fUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) scheduled for December 1991 pursuant to UNSCR 687 was cancelled by the IAEA for logistic reasons and not, as has been reported, due to the IAEA's having insufficient funds at that time to cover the costs. (a) The cancelled mission was to have been one of a regular monthly series planned to ensure the integrity of containment and surveillance measures instituted by previous teams. Our assessment is that the cancellation of the mission does not have major significance for the overall activities of the IAEA in Iraq. The previous inspection, the eighth concerned with Iraq's nuclear program, was conducted during November of last year. The next inspection mission, planned for mid-January, is expected to go ahead. The IAEA, like many other multilateral organisations, is cUlTently experiencing financial difficulties as a result of late or non-payment by a number of member states of their annual contributions. A recent additional factor has been the inability of the former Soviet Union to pay its ten percent contribution to the IAEA's budget. The Agency's activities in Iraq under resolution UNSCR 687 should not, however, be affected by these financial di fficulties as these activities are funded by the UN, which is meeting promptly all costs incurred by the IAEA in carrying out activities under UNSCR 687. (b) and (c) The Agency proposes to respond to the current financial situation by reducing each of its program areas' budgets by thirteen percent in 1992. Australia has agreed to a request from the IAEA for member states to bring forward payment of their 1992 assessed contributions. The Government is also urging other states to pay overdue contributions and to pay their assessed contributions promptly and in full, as Australia traditionally does. We have been consulting closely with the Agency Secretariat and other IAEA member States with a view to ensuring that essential safeguards activities are quarantined from program cuts and that the IAEA's crucial role in nuclear non-proliferation is not affected. Fraser Island: World Heritage Listing Question No. (1268) Mr '!russ asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Tenitories, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1161 (Hansard, 11 November 1991, page 2818), has the agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments on the detailed terms and conditions applying to the Commonwealth Government's $16.5 million payment to Queensland as compensation for the World heritage listing of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region been signed; if so, will she answer parts (2) to (12) of question No. 1161. (2) Was a sum of $3.5 million paid in early December 1991 as the first instalment of the Commonwealth's compensation package. (3) When will the Commonwealth receive the first acquittal report from the Queensland Government covering actual details of expenditure. (4) Will the Commonwealth Government be funding new jobs such as thinning State Government pine forest plantations in the Fraser IslandCooloola region as a part of its compensation package. (5) Is the Queensland Government offering redundancy packages for over 70 of its Forestry Department workers, including many in the Fraser Island-Cooloola region who have undertaken work similar to that referred to in part (4).",181
279,Mrs KELLY,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments concerning structural adjustment assistance following World Heritage nomination of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region was signed on 3 December 1991. As previously advised in my answer to question No. 1161, parts (1) to (12), management of the assistance program is the responsibility of the Queensland Government, and decisions about what particular projects are to be funded will be made by that Government. The honourable member should therefore contact the appropriate Queensland Minister to obtain any additional information he may require. (2) Yes. (3) The first acquittal report under the Agreement is due in February 1992. (4) and (5) See answer to (1). Freight: Rail (Question No. 1271) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) Did the Industry Commission on 21 August 1991 report in response to the former Treasurer's reference on rail transport that (a) bulk commodity freight contributes about 55 percent of all railway revenues and is the only area of rail operations where profitability is either a reality or in prospect, (b) rail is suited for the transportation of coal and iron ore more than any other bulk commodity in Australia because of geographically concentrated production, high tonnages, relatively more certain consignments and its robust nature, (c) New South Wales and Queensland each accounts for around 48 percent of total black coal production, (d) operating costs for the NSW and Queensland railways together would decrease by about 22 percent with the introduction of best-practice costs in the haulage of coal and other minerals and (e) similar reductions can be expected for the costs of replacement capital, namely tracks and rolling stock, and non-renewable capital, including initial track, construction, upgrading track standard, electrification works and signalling infrastructure. (2) Has the Government considered the Commission's findings on any of the matters raised in part (1); if so, (a) which findings and (b) with what outcome. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Government is currently considering the Industry Commission's findings on rail transport, including the matters raised in part (1) of this question. An Inter-Departmental Committee is preparing a response for Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee and a group of Commonwealth, State and Territory officials is developing a joint response to the report for consideration by Transport Ministers at the next Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) meeting on 10 April 1992.",185
