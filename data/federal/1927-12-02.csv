1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. INDUSTRIAL TROUBLE ON"" THE WATERFRONT.",13
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I desire to ask a question of the Prime Minister respecting the waterside workers' dispute. The following statements appeared in the Melbourne Herald of last eveningThe secretary of the Waterside Workers' Federation (Mr J. Morris), declared today that the federation had at all times been willing to negotiate with the ship-owners. He said that this was pointed out in the last letter sent to the owners, to which a reply had not been received. Commenting on Lord Souiera,' appeal to "" settle the dispute tomorrow, "" the secretary of the Port Philip Stevedores' Association (Mr R. Cranny) said that the appeal - could be given effect to if the owners would simply agree to meet the federation in conference. So far the owners have not decided whether and when to introduce free labour bureaux but they stated today that unless there was some prospect of peace in the near future they would give the matter earnest consideration in the next few days. They are confident that they can get as much free labour aB they wont. In view of the fact that the officials of the Waterside Workers' Federation are prepared to meet the ship-owners in conference- I have had this confirmed from Sydney this morning-and that the owners have not even answered a letter which the federation directed to them on this subject, but apparently have, taken steps to establish free labour bureaux, will the Prime Minister take immediate action to bring the parties to the dispute together?",13
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I suggest that questions should not be asked in the House which appear to lay the blame for this unfortunate dispute on one party or the other. I have no informatio n as to the present position; but I sincerely trust that the two sides will see reason and come together in an endeavour to settle their dispute amicably. If there is any thing that I can do to assist to that end without interfering with the j u r is d i or authority of the Arbitration Oourt, I shall bo very pleased to do it . But the situation is so delicate and difficult at the moment that I must refuse to answer further questions in regard to it , unless they are placed upon the business paper, or I am given notice before .the House meets that they will be asked. Mr M o GRATH - Notwithstanding the concluding remark of the Prime M in ister, I trust that he will give me a reply to this important question. In yesterday's Melbourne Ago a letter appeared in which it was definitely stated that no Arbitration Court award had been made with respect to the pick-up. The most that had been done, it was said, was to refer the matter to the reference board. Is the right honourable gentleman able to inform mc definitely whether the court has made an award on this subject ?",14
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I shall have inquiriex made into the matter. NA ZEALAND - IRON AND STEEL DUTIES UNIFORM RATES.,14
5,Mr R GREEN,RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHNEW,"In view of the fact that the amended tarif f schedule which was tabled this week has caused increased duties to be imposed upon butter, cheese and potatoes, concerning which we have a reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand, for the termination of which six months' notice must be given, I should like to know whether the Government has given the New Zealand Government the necessary notice? There is a provision in the arrangement for the""""'notice to be waived by the consent of the parties. If notice has not been given to New Zealand, has a request been made that it shall be waived?  sent to the New Zealand Government, on Wednesday requesting it to waive its right to notice of these alterations. Some time ago, when that Government made certain alterations in its tariff on items mentioned i u our reciprocal arrangement, the Commonwealth Government was asked to waive its right to notice, and it did so. I am expecting a reply from the New Zealand Government in the near future.",14

7,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHNEW,"H as the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a question which in the House of Commons on Tuesday was addressed by Mr Alexander a member of the British Parliamentary' Delegation, which visited. Australia last year, to Mr Hacking, Under-Secretary for Overseas Trade, respecting the Australian duties on iron and steel? ' The newspaper comment on the matter is to the effect that Mr Hacking's reply "" has set the lobby writers speculating as to the extent of British representations, if any. "" Has the British Government made any representations to this Government on the subject; and if so, what is the nature of them? Will the Prime Minister make an earnest request to the B r it i sh Government and the members of the House of TARIFF. Commons to keep their fingers out of our tariff pie?",14
8,Mr BRUCE,RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHNEW,"I have not seen either the question Or""the reply to which the honourable member has 'referred. No representations of any k in d have been - made to us by the British Governmeut on this subject. I am sure it would never of. intervening in a matter which I . within the purely domestic jurisdiction the Commonwealth. Mr D. CAMERON"" asked the Minister been for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether any decision has been arrived witli reference to the repeated representations of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce (supberra ported by many other chambers) that, to bring about uniformity in the tarilf, the Customs Act sliould be amended to enable imports to be made dutiable at the rate ing on the day of the vessel's arrival first port of call in Australia? 2. If so, will he state the decision arrived at?  made have received careful and sympaso. thetic consideration, but it is found that the matter has several complications, the action desired would remove one set of anomalies only to create others. would cause the utmost confusion to concerned at time of tariff revision, from the administrative point of view would be extremely difficult. Goods bond at time of tariff alterations cleared at any future time at the rates. If goods in bond were excluded, it report ? would cause differential treatment between bonded and other goods. Similar goods would be landing at a port same time, and paying different rates duty. In the case of tariff reductions, the matter. everything then in Australian waters would have to pay the higher duty in spite of the reduction in the tariff. When at any time a by-law was made which reduced the duty-and such by-laws frequent-nothin g already in Australian waters at the time could obtain our the benefit of the by-law. appears, moreover, that the chambers of commerce of Australia are not unanireport mous as to the advisability of the proister posed change, and it has been suggested by one important chamber that the matducers ter needs further deliberation. Under all tralia? these circumstances, it is not proposed to take any present action in the direction mentioned. GOVERNMENT HOUSE,",14

Francis, Controller of Stores, blocks 11 and 12, section 1, Manukaand, in these cases, the building covenants have been complied with.

(6) Have any other banks applied for permission to operate branches at Eastlake? and (c) Is it a fact that the largest business interests at Eastlake are branches of Queanbeyan firms. If so, is it a fact that if banking facilities at Eastlake are curtailed, a good deal of banking business will be transferred from the Federal Capital Territory to Queanbeyan? I am now in a position to advise him as follows:[a) Agencies only have been opened by these banks-tin : Commonwealth Savings B a n k ^ i i j' the Post - Office, which is a usual arrangement; and the Government Savings Bank in a building occupied by the Canberra Motor Sales Limited, which eonducts the agency.

(c) Several branches of Queanbeyan firms honourable have been established at Eastlake, but there are many other concerns carrying on business there; it is not thought that there is any likelihood of much banking business being transferred to Queanbeyan. It has already been explained that the proper place for banks is the Civio Centre, but that the Commission has been in consultation with representatives of the various banks with the object of providing part-time agencies to meet the limited amount of business to be done at Eastlake. These arrangements have not yet been concluded. NA PROSPECTING ACT. ADVANCES. Mr A . GREEN asked the Minister for Home and T e r r it o r i e s , upon notice I.

39,Mr WEST,SHIPPING SERVICE,"the Minister for for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. W it h regard to the proposed alteration in customs duty^ on cornflour, is it a fact that the matter has not been considered by the Tariff Board? 2. Is it a fact that the increased duty means an addition of 240 per cent, on the f.o.b. price ? 3. Has it been brought' under his notice that the firm that deals with this product declared a dividend of 124 per .cent, and transferred a large amount to reserve funds? 4. Is is a fact that cornflour is shipped only in bulk?  1. Yes. This is regarded as an anomaly item. Starch flour has hitherto been dutiable at a different rate from cornflour and the two are indistinguishable and for purposes of administration should pay the same duty. 2. On some bulk shipments this might be approximately correct. 3. No. A number of firms are concerned with this material. 4. No. ' The r e c t if i c at i o n of one anomaly m a y , in v i e w of representations recently ret ceived, set up another . I will place the matter before the committee when the it e m is received. PUBLIC SERVICE. EMERGENCY LEAVE.  vember, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) asked the following questions:1. Is it a fact that officers applying for single day emergency leave, in accordance with Regulation 50 under the Public Service Act, owing to illness in their families, are deprived, by the Collector of Customs, New South Wales, of their pay for the time absent, and that the Collector will neither exercise the power conferred upon him of giving emergency leave nor allow it to be deducted from the next recreation leave of the officers? 2 Is it a fact that where an officer has not, at the time of asking for emergency leave, already had his annual recreation leave, it is allowed to be deducted from such recreation leave, but if the officer, owing to being earlier on the annual roster of leave, has no leave to his credit in that current year, pay is deducted and different treatment between officers is thus created? 3. Is the intention of Regulation 50 to provide that officers should be allowed, in necessity, to draw against their next recreation leave, even if leave for the present year has been exhausted? 4. Is the Collector of Customs, New South Wales, the only chief officer in the Commonwealth Public Service who does not use this discretionary power given to liim? 5. Will the Minister furnish a return ing the officers of the Trade and Customs Department, New South Wales, who have been deprived of pay during the past two years when they have asked for odd days to enable them to be with relatives dangerously ill? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. Yes, except where such absence is due to family bereavement in which case two days' emergency leave are granted with pay to officers when the death occurs in the city and three days' leave when the death occurs in the country. 2. Yes. 3. The regulation distinctly leaves the matter to the discretion of the chief officer. 4. I have no knowledge of the practice of chief officers in other departments of the Commonwealth Public Service. 5.

TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.  Trade and Customs) [11.27] - In laying on the table of the House, reports and recommendations of the Tariff Board dealing with the following:F r u it Essences. Fused Bi-foeal Lenses. Galvanized Iron-Bount y on. Iron and Steel Industry-Applicatio n for reduction of Excise Duty or .Bounty. Peppermint Oil-Applicatio n for Bounty. Telephone Apparatus. Tobacco Industry. I desire to inform honourable members that a large amount of departmental information is involved in the dissection of the report on the iron and steel industry. I am not yet in a position to supply the House with it, as it contains confidential information that I have not yet received permission to disclose. I move That the reports be printed. [931",20
40,Mr COLEMAN,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Will copies of those reports and particularly that, on the iron and steel industry, be available today, show- seeing that the tariff debate is now to take place. ",21
41,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Swan) [11.29] According to the business paper, the new tariff schedule is to be discussed today. One of the most important increases is that on iron and steel. The House should certainly possess all the information that the Minister has received from the Tariff Board. I do not blame the Minister for the failure to distribute the report of the Tariff Board on the iron and steel industry, before, because it may have arrived late, but while I urge that the tariff debate should not be delayed, as occurred previously, I consider that all of the reports should be available before we proceed to discuss the schedule. I trust that the Minister will at least let us have some typewritten copies of the iron and steel report, so that we may be able to examine it and see what the recommendations are based on.",21
42,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Wimmera) [11.30]. - I also desire to deal with the same matter. I gather that the Minister referred to certain confidential information that had been disclosed to the Tariff Board.  information, and has nothing to do with the Tariff Board.",21
43,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Do I gather that certain confidential information has ininfluenced the Tariff Board in arriving at its decision, and, if so, will that information be given to honourable members'?  Trade and Customs) [11.31] - In reply to the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), I am pleased to say that printed copies are available and I think that there will be quite sufficient for honourable members who. are interested in the subject. In reply to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) I have explained before that certain dissections were made by the department and included in them was confidential information regarding certain profits and costs. These departmental dissections have been _ made as distinct from the report of the Tariff Boards TJiat confidential: information certainlysupplements the information contained, in the . report, available for the. use of honourable members, but I cannot disclose its nature withr out the consent of those who gave it. Question resolved in the affirmative.. TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means:. Consideration resumed from 24th November (vide page 1S9S), on motion by Mr. P BATTEN: That duties of customs and duties of excise ployment ?. [vide page 1881), first item (27), be imposed.",21
44,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Hunter) [11.34] Many thousands of people in. Australia, will express appreciation of the actionof the Minister in introducing this tariff schedule, even though in some respects it is inadequate for present requirements, especially in view of the enormous in crease of importations which are,, unfortunately,' interfering with the industrial and economic life of Australia. We, on this side, fully realizethe necessity fbr Jealing with the tariff schedule as early as possible. During the long period that Parliament was - in recess the imports into this country grew at an alarming rate,, andj therefore, the general debate should be as brief as possible. To this end I shall endeavour to set an example. We, on this side, have no wish that the schedule shall be placed' in cold storage. Our object is to deal with the items and to make what improvements we can to the schedmle..",22
45,Mr FENTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,-Many improvementsare necessary.,22
46,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"There are many omissions which we wish to bring before this committee in the interests-, of the future welfare of this country. First of all I shall refer to the .delay that has1 taken place in presenting the reports of"" the Tariff Board to this: Parliament. I find that the report ou the iron and steel industry has just been tabled. It is very important, and requires mature consideration at:-the hands of honourable members. There were ten. other reports tabled on the 22nd of last month, eight on the 23rd, six on the 24th, ten on the 28th, ten on the 29th, and six on the 3Qph. There are still two orthree reports to be tabled. The reportsrelating to the schedule should be made available to honourable membersas early as possible. It is-necessary that we should, consider them before the. items are discussed, in detail^ and. that discussion I hope will take place early next. week. Two previous amendments to the tariff' were-made by Mr Greene (now Senator) and the present Minister for Trade and  posed' under them were of considerable assistance to Australian industries.",22
47,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,Did they stop unem,22
48,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"They helped f b r a time to reduce it. The tariff -7 had the effect of establishing intries in this country and. for a timethey were progressing fairly well, but a, change has since taken place and judging: by our increased imports the manufacturers overseas have evidently been able to counteract the effect of' the tariff.",22
49,Mr FENTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,Most of our imports are-from foreign countries.,22
50,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Yes , with the exception of iron and steel. J n 1922 -23, our imports were valued at Â£131,757,000;-. in1923-24j at .Â£1.40,618,000; in 1924-2.5,. at Â£157,143,000-; in 1925-2C, at Â£151,638,000; and in 1926-27, at Â£164,744,000. Our imports have increased considerably. During the threemonths-, from July to ""September, of this year alone they amounted in value toÂ£41,821,762. Those figures show conclusively that the position is becomingalarming and there is little prospect of our industries progressing under present circumstances: This tariff schedule is-, certainly necessary to protect our industries and the interests of those who are employed.in them. To-day many of. our factories are working only 'part time. ThisaffeGts not only secondary, but alsoprimary .industries and particularly the coal mining industry. The commercial life of Australia generally is affected. It is therefore necessary to rectify the position, immediately. N I wish to confine myself to twoorthree items of the tariff. First, I shall deal with iron and steel because that is oneof the most important industriesof this country. Muchdependsupon its success or failure. To-day it is in a very unsatisfactory position.. Recently, 1,000 men were dismissed from the Newcastle steelworks, and I have been informed that another 1,000 men may be dismissed before Christmas.",22
51,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"""What are their costs today compared with when the company started operations in 1915 ? M!r. CHABLTON - I have no idea. The standard of conditions in Australia has been set up by the Arbitration Court after careful consideration of the cost of living. Because we bave a higher standard of living and conditions in Australia than elsewhere, it does not low that we should leave our industries unprotected. To enjoy and retain the benefit of our high standard, we must prevent the goods of countries in which conditions are lower, from flowing in here to the detriment of our industries. Our chief concern is tp encourage our own industries. the iron and steel industry. It is well known that a combine is in existence made up of firms in Fiance, Germany, Luxemburg and Belgium. By the aid of co-operative effort, and low wages, and long hours, they have been able to supply iron and steel at very low prices. I shall be told that the iron and steel imported into Australia conies from Great Britain, but I propose to show that British manufacturers import from the Continent, use the foreign material for.local purposes, and export the British product in order to get the advantage of the Australian preferential tariff. In other words, they circumvent the tariff by pooling British and foreign - steel, and so give an advantage to manufacturers in Great Britain and the Continental combine to the detriment of our - own people. The wages paid on the Continent in the iron and steel industry are very much below those paid in Australia. That fact must be borne in mind. The following table shows the imports of iron and steel into the Commonwealth during the last three years:1924-25 .. Â£7,375,000 .. Â£6,909,000 1925-26 6,171,000 .. 5,684,000 -1926-27 8,739,000 . I have been unable to ascertain the proportion that came from the United Kingdom last year, but I assume that it - was, as in other years, about 90 per cent. It is clear that considerable quantities of iron and steel are coming to Australia notwithstanding that we have large works which are capable of supplying our own requirements. Imports, generally, continue to increase, and in 1926-27 were Â£32,987,000 more than in 1922-23, the year in which this Government took office. About 1920, the iron and steel industry in Australia was languishing, and in the following year some of the principal works closed down. I went to considerable trouble to collect information from all parts of the world, and in fol- a speech in this House I showed what was happening as a result of iron and steel from Germany, France and Belgium being imported into Great Britain, there undergoing some manufacturing process in order to make it eligible for our tariff preference, and then being exported to Australia at ridiculously low Take prices. At that time, British iron-works and coal-miifes were practically idle, notwithstanding that Australia was receiving large quantities of iron and steel which purported to have been manufactured in the United Kingdom. The then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) said that there was no foundation for my statement. About two years later, the present Minister for  mitted the correctness of my statement, and said that be had. proved beyond doubt that iron and steel were being sent to Australia, under the preferential tariff, from continental countries, via the United Kingdom. In consequence of that the tariff was amended, and now requires that imports, to be eligible for admission at the preferential rates of duty, must contain 75 per cent, of British work or material. This preference to Great Britain, however laudable it may be in the abstract, is not operating satisfactorily in the interests of Australia, and, after all, our first consideration must be our own industries. If they are capable of producing our requirements, Total. From they should be given the necessary proUnited Kingdom. tection so that employment may be given to our people. To-day, when thousands of men are unemployed and the industrial outlook is black, the duty of this Parliament, is to make the tariff effective. In support of Che statement. I have made regarding ""the unsatisfactory operation of the British preferential duty, I quote the following letter by Mr Hume Cook publishfeo"" in the Melbourne AgeThe industry had also to contend with a competition from Britain of a wholly unexpected and unfair character. Merchants and others in that country, in order to retain the trade with Australia, did not scruple to resort to methods which nullified the Australian customs provisions. The process was simple enough, though not foreseen at the time the customs rates were imposed. They simply purchase large quantities of low-priced Continental iron and steel, and minimum quantities of higher priced British iron and steel. This gave them stocks at such average prices that they could, and did, supply the Australian market with British products at prices almost in line with Continental figures. Proof of these facts had beeu forthcoming from various sources. The latest was to be found in the Ironmonger newspaper of 15th October, in which Mr Reginald Clarry, M.P., an authority on the subject, makes the assertion that 70 per cent, of certain classes of steel used in Great Britain was of foreign origin. It was thus clear that by using foreign iron and steel for domestic purposes, and sending British iron, and steel to Australia, British traders wore able to nullify the Australian general tariff rates, and undercut Australian production by supplying their iron aud steel at prices with' which it was impossible for Australia to compete. If that statement is correct, immediate action is required. We are giving a substantial preference to. the manufacturers of the United Kingdom, but if they are so unscrupulous, as to buy iron and steel in continental countries at cheap rates, pool it with the British product, send the latter here, and supply the home market with the low-priced foreign article, the benefits of our preferential tariff are going, not to British industries and workmen, but to the exporters of Germany, France and Belgium.",23
52,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The exporter United Kingdom has to make a sworn declaration that the article contains 75 per cent, of British labour or material.",24
53,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I grant that, but instead of supplying the British market with locally produced iron and steel, merchants are swamping it with cheap i m ports from continental countries. B y this policy they are able to export British iron and steel to Australia at low prices. Our first duty is to protect our own in dustries and workers; only when that is done can we give a preference to British industries. How can we assist our kinsmen overseas if the B ritish Government allows local needs to be supplied from foreign sources and British-made steel to be unloaded on the Australian market? The preference is indirectly being given to foreign countries against which we have imposed high tariff duties. While this is happening, British workmen are idle, the furnaces are cold, and the coalminers are asking in vain for work. So far as we can prevent a continuance of that state of affairs, it is our duty to do it. Substantial duties must be imposed to ensure that local industries will be able to supply the local market. ' We have no right to allow great quantities of iron and steel to be imported while our industries are languishing and thousands of men are out of employment. The Government talks of migration and development. This country cannot be developed unless we make sure that our secondary industries are placed in a position to withstand competition from overseas. Primary and secondary production must go hand in hand, for the manufacturing enterprises are necessary to provide a home market for the p r i m a r y producer. I propose to say a few words with regard to the deferred duty on cotton piece goods, dealt with in item 105. We have sufficient evidence that something will have to be done to protect industries established under our tariff. We have the instance of George Bond and Company, one of the largest textile manufacturing concerns in New South Wales. They have been compelled to go into voluntary liquidation in consequence of the position in which they have been placed through the importation of cheap goods, particularly from Japan, in the which come into competition with their products. I wish to quote something from the tariff report in this connection to show that it is not true that there is not sufficient provision in Australia for manufacturing these goods, and that the duty on them should therefore be deferred u n t i l 1928. The extract is as follows:L. A. Mellor referred to the new composite duties imposed under tariff item 110 b on knitted underwear which became operative in September 1925, and claimed that these duties were being frustrated by the importation of tubular piece goods, which at the expenditure of little labour were made up into apparel in Australia, thus obviating the necessity of knitting the material in Australia. He pointed out how the importations had increased, principally from Japan. Garments made fro m such imported tubular fabric readily undersold the Australian knitted garment, and thus the object of the recent tariff increases was being defeated. C. J. Lanigan, of the said at the same time last season they had sufficient orders to keep the factory going at full speed; but at present, owing to the importation of fabric, they only had enough orders to keep them going two-thirds of their summer season. A. E. Silvereisen, of the Maryborough kniting mills, said that knitted cotton fabric from Japan could be landed at little more than landed cost of the yarn used by the Australian manufacturer. Such fabric could be landed duty paid at 2s. 9d. per lb. One pound of fabric would make five ladies' undervests, and these would pay a duty, if imported made up, of 2s. each. He thought the fixed duties on fabric should be on the same level as the fixed duty on the imported garment. Evidence was given by a number of other witnesses, including Mr E. N . MCLean, of G. A. Bond and Company. I wish now to refer to a letter which has been published in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, and the Sydney Guardian, regarding the duties as they affect G. A. Bond and Company. The last paragraph of this letter, which was written by Mr George Bond, is as follows :In the writer's opinion the statement made  morning that it was the ment's desire to hold over the proposed duties on tubular pieeo goods until July to enable manufacturers to erect machinery and supply the material, is unsound, for the following reasons. There are a number of manufacturers at present in the position to supply tubular piece goods. My company at the present time have machines standing idle in our underwear mill, and further machines in bond waiting to be erected the moment the business is offering, and should the duty operate tomorrow there would be no acute shortage of similar garments that are at the present time made from the imported Japanese fleeced and brushed cotton tubular piece-goods. Should  unsatisfactory tariff proposals recently brought down in regard to the knitting trades, same will be supplied at once. This afternoon the Hosiery Associations of Sydney and Melbourne are meeting in this city with a view of discussing the matter and arranging a deputation to the Minister for Customs to advise him of their dissatisfaction in regard to the new rates of duty.  tubular knitted goods. Mr CHAELTON"" - That is so. It is stated in this letter that the opposition is coming chiefly from Japan. The manufacturers in that country have found a way by which they can get round our tariff. They are sending their goods into Australia in a different form, and are Clunea K n it t in g M ill , undercutting our manufacturers. Those persons who have established factories in Australia since the duties came into force now find that the foundations are being cut from under their industry. There is no justification for deferring these duties, when a firm like G. A. Bond & Company has to go into liquidation on account of oversea competition.",24
54,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"What about the increased cost of children's 30cks, if the duty is raised ?",25
55,Mr CHAELTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I do not wish to refer to that, because such matters can be discussed in detail when we come to the schedule. Let me refer now to the duty on motor chasses. A duty of 55 per cent, was placed on shock absorbers and bumper bars for motor cars, and after the imposition of that duty, the price for shock absorbers made in Australia fell from Â£10 to Â£7 10s., showing that there is no reason why such goods cannot be manufactured in Australia at satisfactory prices, provided adequate protection is afforded. Later, those who exported motor cars this to Australia got round the tariff proGovernvision by making bumper bars and shock absorbers part of the chassis. By that means they are getting those goods, into Australia for a duty of only 17| per cent. Surely the Minister can rectify this mat: ter. Conditions in Australia bave never been worse since the war than they are now, and it is the duty of Parliament, by making the necessary adjustments in the tariff rates, to protect industry, and provide employment for the people.",25
56,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,That bas been said every time a new amendment to the tariff has been submitted.,25
57,Mr CHAELTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"That is so, but I . am sorry to say that the importers find means to undermine the tariff.",25
58,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,What guarantee have we that' they will not undermine this tariff?,25
59,Mr CHAELTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"We must putÂ«up such a tariff wall as will prevent tbSih from undermining it. If this country is to develop we must foster our industries, and make the nation self-contained as far as possible. Most of the customs venue today is not derived from protecvernment tive duties-, but from revenue duties,the following table shows:Revenue Protective duties. duties. JLOIAI. f- Â£ 1923-24 22,870,758 13,562,424 1924-25 23,750,195 14,144,537 1925-26 24,228,402 15,570.045 Included in the revenue duties is apbe proximately Â£10,500,000 excise duties, so that if that amount is deducted they amount to nearly the same as the protecliances tive duties. The Government should make an investigation to determine whether any of the revenue duties are imposed upon the people's necessaries. There, is no objection to revenue duty being collected on luxuries, but they should not be imposed upon the ordinary necessaries of life. ""When it comes question of supporting our own induscountry tries, substantial duties should be imI posed to prevent our markets from being invaded by cheap goods from overseas. I hope the Government will not merely allow this subject to be discussed for few days, and then put it away in cold storage for a year, or perhaps more. schedule should be dealt with at once. cannot afford to have our people thrown it on? out of employment as a result of cheap imports. Most of the matters concerning industrial activity rest with the increasing. State governments, but it is within the province of the Commonwealth Government to see that sufficient protection afforded to industry. We should see that these amendments are made before the House rises for Christmas, even if other legislation is put aside. Not only are the employees directly concerned in an industry thrown out of work when inWhat sufficient protection is afforded, but workers in other industries are also fected. The coal mines are being closed at Newcastle? down because orders are not forthcoming from the iron and steel works, which themselves unable to compete with ports from overseas. One by one the furnaces in - the Newcastle steel works, wTfich used to consume between 20,000 Mr Charlton. and 30,000 tons of coal a week are closing down. A. falling away in one industry is reflected in another. Unless trade conreditions in general are buoyant, the Gocan expect substantial deficits as instead of surpluses. The Government - should listen to the pleas put forward in this House for increased protection to Tntol industry, so as to ensure more employment, and to assist, in the development Â£ of the country. 36,433,182 37,894,732 Mr GREGORY (Swan) [12.13] - I 39,798,447 was not surprised when the Leader of the Opposition chimed in with the Minister for Customs, and agreed that there should little debate upon the merits of the proposition put .before the House. I have seen too much of these unholy albetween the Government and the Opposition in regard to increased customs duties. It is somewhat like the agreement made some time ago between the ship-owners and the. seamen, and where has that brought us ? We are going along careless of consequences disregarding those economic laws which have ruled to a the world for centuries while the is drifting into industrial ruin. have never heard such a one-eyed argument as that advanced this morning by the Leader of the Opposition. He said in effect that there was nothing wrong a with increasing the' cost of our manufactures so long as the increase could be This passed on. But how can the man outWe back, the wheat or wool-grower, pass",25
60,Mr WEST,SHIPPING SERVICE,The price of bread keeps,26
61,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"It is disgraceful is thatour wheat can be sent overseas, manufactured into bread, and sold there at a lower price than in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition had a lot to say about the iron and steel duties, and the lack of employment in the coal mines. is the price of coal today, and what was it when the Broken Hill Proafprietary Company started its steel works",26
62,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,I can tell the honorfind able member that the coal-miners have imnot had an increase for years.,26
63,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Then they must be going slow. What with the increased 1 cost of production and the go-slow tactics that are adopted, industry is in a deplorable condition. We should remove some of the useless legislation from our book. It must surely be apparent to every honourable member that the iron, steel and copper industries must be established here on reasonable conditions if they are to be of any use for the establishment of secondary industries. But the conditions are daily becoming more unreasonable. The Minister has now imposed a heavy duty on fluorspar, which is necessary to the operations of the Newcastle steel works merely because a tin-pot show in Queensland is producing a small quantity of it. Seemingly the increased cost of the product to the steel works does not matter. I admit that in this case it does not amount to much, but it is an illustration of the kind of thing that industry is being subjected to all the while.",26
64,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,Every mickle makes a muckle ,27
65,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Of course it does. I do not know where it will lead us; the cost of coal and of the transport of ore have become outrageous. Whenever tariff matters are under consideration in this Parliament, we find persons who have expectations of obtaining concession in respect of the minor industries with which they are connected, waiting round for an opportunity to get some honourable member to push their particular interests. Honourable members opposite and the Minister for Trade and Customs appear to want the tariff wall built as high as possible, irrespective of the results. Mir. WEST - The honourable member has lost hope of seeing his policy adopted. Mir. GREGORY - I have lost hope in honourable members opposite. It is only the attitude of the Opposition to the fiscal issue that has prevented me from making a direct breach with the Government. If they would alter their tariff policy I might be willing to give them a little support and encouragement at times, but they can never expect me to do so while they pursue their present course. If their attitude was that of the British Labour party. I should give them a chance for a while, because the British Labour man's view is that the necessities of 'the people should be available as cheaply as possible. statuteI t is incomprehensible to me that honourable members opposite can justify their approval , of every extra duty that the Government proposes, for every new duty causes additional hardship to the poorer sections of the community whom they claim to represent. Just imagine them voting for duties of Ss. and 10s. a dozen on socks and stockings ! The strange thing is that the high duties are imposed on the poor quality goods. How ban honourable members opposite justify a duty of 260 per cent, on cornflower, the food of children, which comes here in bulk parcels? Medicines are also taxed unmercifully. Is this how they protect the poor from exploitation? When I was in New Guinea I was informed that the doctors there had instructions to buy all "" their drugs and chemicals from Australia, in order to assist Australian industry, although the cost to them was increased as much as 500 per cent, in some cases by doing so. That is out of all reason. Moreover it is using money taken from the pockets of the people to enrich a few manufacturers- a noble policy for Labour or Nationalists! It has been necessary to increase our duties in many cases because of the wages and working conditions granted to industrialists by the Arbitration Court. It is ridiculous that we should allow elderly legal gentlemen to determine the rate of wages and working conditions that shall apply tp industries of which they have no practical knowledge whatever. The sooner we substitute the Canadian conciliation system of dealing with industrial matters for our cumbersome and costly arbitration court methods the better it will be for the nation. How can the mining industry at Broken Hill, or the timber industry in Tasmania and Western Australia, carry on in the face of the condition made necessary by the Piddington awards and the Navigation Act? I was talking some little time ago to a man who was running a small boat between Launceston and Melbourne. He told me that his three firemen were earning in the aggregate Â£100 a month, which was equal to more than Â£33 a month each. When I vsjas travelling tlirough Western Australia with the Prime Minister during the last recess he made a number of speeches, which caused me to believe that he was realizing something of the tremendous difficulties that our primary producers have to suffer. He said that it was vital to us that we should increase both our population and our production, and that the high costs were excessive; but he has done nothing since to make the conditions of our people any easier. In creases of duties simply aggravate their position.",27
66,Mr ATKINSON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"What , about the timber industry ?",28
67,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"It is not to be wondered at that the sawmilling industry is disappearing from Australia. A. gentleman in Launceston told me some time ago that it cost 3s. 6d. per 100 super feet to bring timber from Sweden to Adelaide, and 6s. 6d. to bring it from Canada to Adelaide, while the freight from Launceston to Adelaide was 9s. 8d. per 100 super feet. It is extraordinary that the Canadians, can fell their timber, freight it to the 'coast, put it through mill, bring it to Australia, pay heavy duties and sellers' profits, and sell it here for less than we can market our local timber. Wages in Canada are, generally speaking, higher than those in Australia.",28
68,Mr ATKINSON,SHIPPING SERVICE,Not in the timber industry.,28
69,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I cannot refute the statement of the honourable member, but I was under the impression that in the timber industry, as well as in others, the Canadian wages were higher than ours. There was no trouble in Australia over tariff matters until 1920, when the Parliament went mad. Up to that time we had given generous assistance to our various industries, in the hope that they would develop to the point at which they would become self-supporting. But that has not occurred. If I believed that moderate protection would enable industries before long to stand alone, I should become a moderate protectionist; but experience has shown that, when we begin to protect an industry, we begin to kill it, for protection restricts tors and destroys efficiency. Further concessions are required here, and there, until we reach the stage that nothing short of an embargo on importation is demanded. The honourable member for Richmond, (Mr R. Green) amazed me the other day by suggesting that we should place an absolute embargo on all imports and exports. Various other members have suggested thatprohibition of importations is necessary to protect certain industries. But that is a ridiculous policy. The policy of the Government is merely political, and is not actuated by a keen desire to study the best interests of the country. The Prime Minister, both in Western Australia and Queensland, intimated that the tariff wajs becoming a very grave problem, and that it would be difficult to continue. The Treasurer made a statement, which was reported in the press, saying that - the only chance for the primary producer was to get right into the vortex of things and secure his portion. When in Adelaide the Treasurer described the position of. the primary producer as being akin to that of the Biblical as with two burthe dens. He certainly may be described as an as if he approves of a policy of this sort, and returns representatives to Parliament to put such a policy into effect. The policy is a foolish one, and he is again an as if he thinks that it will be beneficial to himself or to the country, or gives support to the Treasurer in furthering the imposition of such imports. Sops are being given indiscriminately, merely to placate certain sections. A big duty is placed on butter. I do not suppose that honourable members opposite will object to that, because it represents a big voting factor.",28
70,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,Does the honourable member oppose that duty?,28
71,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I do, because the policy is a bad one. Only a little while ago I pointed out when Australia became established as a nation, British statesmen urged that we should endeavour to bring all the islands in this hemisphere within our influence. Instead of doing that, we destroyed our trade competi- with F i j i , which does not now wish to trade with us. Japanese women and children are eating the finest bananas in the world, and we are eating the worse. We have lost the Fijian trade through our stupidity, and a trade war is now proposed with New Zealand.",28
72,Mr FORDE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The honourable member is casting a reflection upon an important industry which is giving employment, directly and indirectly, to 16,000 people.",29
73,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I am referring to the position of Australia as a sort of superior nation, which should have brought New Zealand, F i j i , and the adjacent islands under its aegis, and have traded with them on a reciprocal basis.",29
74,Mr FORDE,SHIPPING SERVICE,Why not give the white producers of bananas in Australia some protection against the black growers of F i j i and elsewhere?,29
75,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Ha d the industry asked for 2s. 6d. per central it would not have been so bad; but they have obtained 8s. 4d. per central. F i j i used to trade freely with Australia. It purchased our products to the extent of almost Â£800,000 a year, while we reciprocated by purchasing Fijian bananas and other products to the value of Â£250,000. That was an important trade, well worth looking after. Now we have made enemies of that country, and it trades elsewhere.",29
76,Mr FORDE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"B y our action we have built up an Australian industry worth Â£1,000,000 a year to the people of Australia.",29
77,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I remind the honourable member of some motion pictures that were exhibited when we were in the Victorian Parliament House. We saw pictured country that was being opened up at an unimproved value of from Â£80 to Â£100 per acre. I recently read a Cairns paper, which contained a tremendous number of advertisements of sugar land which people were desirous of selling, and the average unimproved price was over Â£100 an acre. In view of that, cannot it be justifiably urged that those people need excessive protection ? If the land is worth Â£100 an acre, surely its product should be able to compete with similar' products from other countries. I do not contend that there should be no duty on sugar. I want to see the White Australia policy continued. I have read the reports of various commissions as to what they thought was a fair thing. Those reports were worth something when they were made, and had we adhered to their recommendations the position would not be too bad. Unfortunately the political element was introduced, and probably the fate of a Ministry has hinged on the introduction of a duty. Undue preference to our sugar industry has restricted production and it acts injuriously to other indus: tries, particularly the fruit-growing, industry. If cheap sugar could be pur chased in Australia, and proper labour conditions existed here, this country would be able to export enormous quantities of jams and jellies.",29
78,Mr FORDE,SHIPPING SERVICE,When I rise I shall prove that the embargo on sugar does not act detrimentally to the fruit industry.,29
79,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Australi a is suffering not only from its high tariff. Our unlimited borrowing, combined with our high protection & and the socialistic legislation that bas been imposed on us, makes it next to impossible for our secondary producers to make reasonable progress. The Leader of the Opposition quoted the exports from Australia over a number of years. Why did not the honourable member go back over a greater period and tell us what progress has been made in the export of manufactures from Australia? Let the honourable member point out where one industry has developed, and is now able to compete with other countries of the world. I ask the honourable member to read yesterday's Argus, in its comments on the boot-making industry. 'When I spoke on the budget debate I gave figures showing that there had been a slowing down in output and an enormous increase in the cost of production, and that our exports were infinitesimal. What is preventing our boot making industry, which has been protected by the Victorian Government for 40 years, and by this Government ever since federation, from developing? Our manufacturers are content to supply only the Australian market. Our hides are sent to other parts of the world, where they are tanned, manufactured into boots, and then exported. Why cannot Australia do something of the sort? Recently I had a conversation with one of - OUr boot manufacturers. He told me that he had the most up-to-date machinery 'chat Britain or America could supply, - and that, if his men liked, they could turn out' double their present production.",29
80,Mr MCGRATH,SHIPPING SERVICE,He was romancing.,30
81,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Unio n domination has retarded our industrial progress. That man said that it did not matter to him, as he could get his price locally, but intimated that if we had in operation the American system, where men are paid by results, matters would be infinitely",30

83,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I admit that they could be the best workmen in the worldif they were free from the domination of union officials. The Australian is, and should be, the equal of any man. His openair life aud his - education should tend to make him so, and the men who went from Australia to"" the great war and made such a wonderful name for themselves and for us, proves that he is; but he loves the study of sport more than the study of economic laws. While the manufacturer can pass on the cost he does not bother about securing greater efficiency. Only competition will secure efficiency, and we destroy competition. The worker thinks that the manufacturer is making a good thing out of it, and does not bother himself so long as he can' get his share. If he were paid according to what he produced and the manufacturer was efficient, it would not be long before tralia was able to compete with other countries. I was dealing with the Ministry when I was sidetracked. I consider that they have been very flabby over this subject, full of nothing but platitudes.",30
84,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,The honourable member is back in the dark ages.,30
85,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"If the honourable member's party would come forward with a policy of a definite tariff reduction I would endeavour to put them on this side of the House, but when one finds that the majority of honourable members opposite are worse than honourable members of the Government, what is one to do ?

97,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Before the adjournWorks ment I was referring to the attitude that Ministers had adopted in connection with effect. the tariff, and to what I considered flabbiness on the part of some of them. The Tariff Board in its report dealing with the primary producer says The primary producer has to contend the high cost of production, with the into their pledges or not. creased charges that the customs tariff poses in some instances, and with ever increasing land values and seeing that to dispose of a portion of his product overseas, interests for which he obtains only world parity he naturally complains (under pressure of his difficulties) when the amount he receives for his produce does not provide sufficient margin over his cost of production. The Government consists of an association of two parties. There was no member of the Country party inore anxious than I for the two parties to come together. I have always held that no party has a right to a place in this Parliament until it is prepared to accept responsibility.",31

101,Mr GEEGOEY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The object of every honourable member is to benefit his counjoined try and particularly his own State and to the Senate. people, but our main desire is to see first to the future of this country and its successful development. I was most anxious that the two parties should come together, but in our own party room, before any agreement was entered into, I urged that the appointment of managers so that we could consult with the Nationalist party and come to an agreement with regard to policy. Our leader, and also the Attorney-General, who was present, held that it was the duty of the Government when it was formed to decide on its own policy. They were successful in their from plan, and the Government was formed irrespective of what its policy should be, and we see the result today. We have "" flabby "" Ministers, men who are. pledged to a reduction in duties that impose a to the penalty upon the primary producer. formed]. Both the Treasurer and the Minister for and Bailways, when occupying seats in the corner, made speeches to that The Minister for Markets and was Migration, when a private member, moved the adjournment of this chamber in connection with the imposition of high duties. It will be for the country to with judge whether they have been false Surely those imMinisters have sufficient power in the he has Cabinet to be able to protect the of the producer, but we prices, find that further heavy duties are being introduced which must place a greatly increased burden on the primary producer. Take transport, for instance, the duties upon rails have greatly increased the cost of constructing railways. There are heavy duties on cement and steel reinforcements, and on practically every article required for the building of roads. Then there is the increase in the cost of living. We cannot increase the duty on butter, hats, socks, boots, and food and other comthe modities without increasing the cost of living, which in turn increases the cost We should be more in touch I with the conditions that apply in other countries, so that the cost of livin g might try be reduced. We should then be able to have essential works carried out more economically, and this country would .not be in the position it occupies today. At the last election, the Country party and the United party of Western Australia forces. That applied particularly",31
102,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,Not only to the Senate.,32
103,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"It applied to the House of Representatives, but particularly to the Senate, and that enabled the Country party.to have one representative for the Senate as against two representatives of the United party. To show the feeling that then existed in the Country party organization, let me read the following agreement that was come to with the nationalist partyTliat as the present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two associations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. That as a reduction can only be secured - through our Parliamentary representatives, neither party shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement witli this policy. That, subject to the above mentioned conditions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to the electors, the Primary Producers' Association is willing to co-opefato with the United party of Western Australia in running a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the United party, and one representative of the Country party, for the forthcoming Senate elections. The team so selected shall receive the endorsement and support of both associations, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association. Senator Pearce, a member of the Ministry, Was elected on that distinct understanding, so today we have in the Cabinet not only four Country party members, but also Senator Pearce, all of whom are pledged to a reduction of duties. There should, therefore, be a majority of the Cabinet in favour of lower duties. The conference of the Victoria n Farmers' Union passed this resolutionThat this conference considers the Australian Commonwealth tariff unnecessarily high, and that its incidence is hurtful to the great primary producing interests, and also to the welfare and progress of the Australian community as a whole, and this conference further considers that a percentage reduction should be made annually on all tariff items dealing with the staple necessities of primary and secondary industries.",32
104,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPPING SERVICE,What was the that conference?,32
105,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"13t h March, 1925. The three representatives of Victoria in the' Cabinet are connected with that association. They, in addition to Senator Pearce and the Treasurer; have declared themselves in favour of lower duties. What, then, is the influence brought to bear on the Government to allow the i m position of enormous increases in duties? At the last conSerence of the Federal Country party I brought forward a motion demanding a plank in the platf o r m in favour of a big reduction in duties, but it was camouflaged.",32
106,Mr ABBOTT,SHIPPING SERVICE,"In what way was it camouflaged ? ' Mr GREGORY - If the honourable member will allow me to complete my sentence, I shall tell him. It was camouflaged by an amendment being moved that a commission should be appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the effect of the present duties upon primary production. No inquiry has been made, but, instead, we have this i m position of increased duties. My motion was camouflaged, because there was a wish apparently to prevent a direct vote from being taken upon it , and an amendment was moved which evaded the issue.",32
107,Mr ABBOTT,SHIPPING SERVICE,"If I remember rightly, the honourable member accepted the amendment.",32
108,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I did nothing of the sort. There is no doubt as to the opinion of the people of Western Australia respecting the tariff. As I have said previously, we should be perfectly content if given control of our customs for 25 years. Because of the operation of the Navigation Act, and the heavy cost of manufacture, the cost of every article required in Western Australia is considerably higher than it is in the eastern States. Our difficulty is that we are separated from the east by aÂ«vast stretch of country which can, in distance, be likened to an ocean. The increased duties on top of the high cost of transport make it exceedingly difficult to carry on, particularly in a country whose first-class land is not equal to that of many parts of the other States. Western date of Australia is a country of wonderful possibilities. I was reading in the press the other ' day of harvesting operations there, and I noticed instance after instance of twelve bags of wheat to the acre. The future of farming there is assured so long as the price of wheat is sustained; but we have stretches of good land and large portions of second-class and third-class country intervening. The latter had not been farmed untilrecently, but now a great portion of it is under cultivation. According to a recent issue of the West Australian, a. large quantity of thirdclass land is being put under crop. It cannot be cropped every year, but when not under crop it can be used for. grazing purposes. At one time this land could be purchased at 3s. 3d. an acre, and in some cases at less. All that land is now being brought under cultivation, and with the assistance of a large population, will produce a great quantity of wheat and meat. One of the great essentials in that State is superphosphates. The use of that commodity is steadily increasing, but it is a heavy item of expenditure in Australia compared with other countries. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), the other day received a letter from a man who bad settled in the south-west of Western Australia, reporting on its wonderful progress. He stated that a lot of land there, once regarded as useless, is now carrying two sheep to the acre, hut the cost of clearing and preparing the land is heavy. Cheap production cost is essential to the development of Western Australia. If it could be granted free trade for a certain period-of course, allowing a preference to goods manufactured in the eastern States-it s primary industries would have a chance to become established. I am aware that that cannot be done under the Constitution in its present form. Although a grant of Â£300,000 a year is very welcome to the Government and the people, sops of this kind are a palliative, not a remedy. Western Australia is purchasing from the eastern States about Â£8,000,000 worth of goods annually, and selling to them goods to'the value of only Â£1,500,000 to Â£1,750,000. Western Australia will continue to be a big customer of the eastern States if its industries are not destroyed. The high duties that the Government has imposed and is imposing will destroy Western Australia industrially unless special concessions are made. Monetary grants do not reduce the cost of production, and only if that cost is kept down to a moderate figure can Western Australia prosper. The agricultural area of Western Australia is larger than the whole State of Victoria; it extends from 60 miles north of Northampton-whic h is some 40 miles north of Geraldton-eastward s as far as the gold-fields, then south to Albany, and along the coast eastward to Esperance. That enormous belt of country could carry - hundreds of thousands of people if it had cheap transport facilities with moderate producing costs. In the early stages of i settlement the cost of production must be made as cheap as possible, and I feel very much afraid of what may happen when this country experiences bad seasons or has to accept low prices for its primary products. If either of those things should happen, many thousands of people will be ruined, and our splendid efforts to settle this vast area destroyed. In the year 1912-13 a partial drought was experienced over a portion of Western Australia, and the settlers in the newly-opened country suffered terrible privations. Many children were clothed in sackjs, and whole families were living on wheatmeal coarsely ground on the farm. So bad were the conditions that the Government established an Industries Assistance Board to make advances to the necessitous settlers. The advances amounted to millions of pounds. The recovery and ultimate success of the persons assisted was, however, almost like a romance, and this year our wheat production is the highest of any State in the Commonwealth. I said to the Leader of the Opposition this morning that his tariff proposals were 1 one-eyed because they, have regard for secondary producers and the workers only. When the honourable member becomes disturbed over the question of one or two pick-ups for the waterside workers, does he forget the privations suffered by the Mallee farmers? What of the man who throughout a dry season has to cart water for 20 miles over sandy country only to find at the end of the year that all his labour has been in vain? Honourable members are aware that the thrip pest destroyed the blossoms in many Western Australian orchards, and in consequence the apple production this year will be seriously reduced. They know, also, of the losses suffered by the vignerons along the Murray River Valley because of frosts. It is not. fair to impose heavyburdens upon the primary producers who. have to contend with so many forms of adversityOne of the vital necessities of this country is the populating of the north. I do not know much of. Queensland,, but I am sure that it includes much, wonderful country that can be developed.. I am able to speak with greater authority of the north of Western Australia. To encourage settlement in those parts"" I would remit taxation for years, and allow the people to buy their goods in the cheapest market. If that policy were tried for twenty-five years,, and the settlers made good,, they would provide a market for the Australian manufacturer later. It is evident from the discussions at Geneva and' in the press of the world' that the time is coming when we shall have to make out a good case for holding that huge area without peopling and developing it, and it cannot be developed until we reduce the cost of production - part",32
109,Mr FENTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,What does the. commission intend to do? Where will it get money?,34
110,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I do. not know; but, I have morefaith in. a policy which would make, commodities cheaper for the people andso decrease production costs.

111,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The north-west is purely pastoral country;, but I believe pig-raising would be a lucrative industry. One must, however, offer an inducement to people to settle in that country. I have observed, in the mining districts particularly, how the successful' settlement of a few people attracts population to an area. We could do much for the north by getting a nucleus population contentedly settled there. I . doubt if there is any part of Australia-, so rich in mineral wealth as is the north-west. About seventeen years agO: I . toured through the Pilbarra country for seven weeks, with a. view to making a recommendation to the Government regarding the provision of railway transport. My report mentioned the vast extent of auriferous area, but emphasized that, owing to. the high cost of transport and commodities,, even rich shows, had to be abandoned. Its gold mines had treated 60,000 tons, for 120,000 ounces;, and 8000 tons, from the great banket formation at Nullagine, similar to that in South Africa, had yielded am average of 12 dwt. According to the Government geologist there were thousands of square miles of stanniferous country. I bought one block of tin oxide,, weighing 600 lb.,, at Wodgina, and sent it to the Glasgow exhibition. There is a tantalite deposit, the like of which, I . believe, is not to be found in any other of the world, and large desposits of. copper and. silver-lead ore. Some of the. finest quality crysotile asbestos, worth from Â£50 to Â£60 per ton,, has been mined in the. Pilbarra country.. Nbtwithr standing this enormous and varied mineral wealth, the cost of production is so high that this wealth remains latent and' pastoraHsm is practically the onlyprogressive industry in that ai;ea. Are we to lose this groat asset by flagrantly defying all economic laws? The Leader of the Opposition referred to the excess of imports over exports, The and emphasized^ the value of the home, market. The primaryproducer can do without it, but the secondary industries cannot do without the primary producer, because he providesthef u l l market for their output. I join issue with the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to his policy of prematurely forcing the secondary industries upon, the people of this country. When we have a bigger population we shall be able to maintain* secondary'industries; but the Australian people are paying too high a price for many of the manoafactures which are being startedunder nothouse conda'tions.. In, l&23->24. the totalexports from this country were wosuth Â£116,0OO;.OOO, of - which. only Â£4,200,000 represented manufactured products, and those - is - were principally commodities tinned milk and flour, that are really by-products of the .primary indusdustry generally. tries. In 1924-25 the exports were worth Â£158,900,000, .of which again only Â£4,100,000' was secondary products; .and in 1925-26, Â£145,400,000, of which Â£4,100,000 represented manufactured goods. Those figures demonstrate that the products of secondary industries are a negligible .proportion of the export trade, being equal to about 2^ per of the total. I have not the slightest doubt that while the existing socialistic legislation is retained on the statute-book no Australian secondary industries will have the slightest chance of competing in the markets overseas. It is not to encourage the establishment of dustries, that cannot compete with products of other countries, at the expense of the primary producers who have to .compete in the markets of the world.",34
112,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,"If the factory operaand tives worked for nothing, would that meet the case?",35
113,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"In many industries real wages are not too high; but there inefficiency on the part of many manusuch facturers, and the union organizations insist on go-slow methods. These two things have so increased the cost of duction that it is impossible for our secondary industries - to compete with those of other countries. From his'experience in the coal-mines, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) must know something of the high cost of production. I judge by the prices reduced output.",35
114,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,The miner does not get the higher price; he is on piecework.,35
115,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,The honourable memagainst ber for Swan (Mr Gregory) speaks in in the world. ignorance when he refers to slowing down in the mining industry.,35
116,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,I know that in 1915 the price of coal was 9s. 7d. per ton.,35
117,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The increase is not due to the miners, but to the exploiters who own the mine.",35
118,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,I am quite willing to deal with the position.,35
119,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,The honourable member talking about slowing down by miners like who are on piece-work.,35
120,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,I spoke about in,35
121,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The - honourable member spoke about the coal-miners. He gets on very Well while he is dealing in generalities, but he is tripped up as soon as he comes down to specific instances.",35
122,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I know that I referred to coal-mining; but if the honor-cent, able member had heard my argument about the - soap-making industry, and the boot industry, he would know that I had proved my point. Moreover in the coal-mining industry strikes, slowing down and exploitation have increased fair costs from about 9s. to 27s. a ton. in Mr Scullin - I am tired of hearing the these slanders on the working man.",35
123,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I would rather be termed a slanderer than indulge in the tyrannous tactics adopted by the unions, fostered by the honourable member, which are destroying the industry of this country. We must send our products overseas in order to pay for the imports which we bring in. There are numerous is charges to pay on the export of goods, as demurrage and high w'harfage rates, while, when strikes take place, the costs of export are Still further inprocreased. We have to compete with other countries, and, therefore, we must keep our production costs at a reasonable level. There is no one held in higher esteem in industrial circles than Mr Swinburne. That gentleman, speaking last year at and the meeting of the Mount Lyell Company, said It is astonishing what influences seem to conspire against the primary producer, Wlib has mainly to rely on the world for his markets, and compete at the world's prices practically the.highest working costs",35
124,Mr THEODOBE,SHIPPING SERVICE,Ye t the honourable member supports a government which is now trying to sell the only means of protection which Australia has against exploitation by the shipping companies.,35
125,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,I wonder what influences Mr Swinburne was referring to.,35
126,Mr THEPDORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"^-TO the high freights, of course.",35
127,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"And also to high costs of production, but he referred specifically to the influences which conspired against the primary producer. President Wilson once made the naive confession that if any one contributed 50,000 dollars to the party funds that person would necessarily think that his interests would be looked after.",36
128,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The honourable member ought not to talk about that, in view of what the Town and Country Union has done, and the funds it has provided. It has been admitted in this House that they have money to burn to support the free trade policy.",36
129,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,That has never been admitted.,36
130,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPPING SERVICE,What is the use of the honourable member making innuendoes when the facts are against him?,36
131,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The innuendo comes from the honourable member himself. I was' merely pointing out what President Wilson bad said, and there is no doubt about the influences here. The primary producer has to compete with low-wage countries, with the Argentine, and India, and probably with Russia in the near future, in the export of wheat. We have to compete with Denmark in the sale of butter; with Greece in the sale of dried fruits; and with Spain and Italy in the sale of wines.",36
132,Mr LAZZARINI,SHIPPING SERVICE,Is there not a wine bounty?,36
133,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"We , the furthest from the markets of the world and with the highest cost of production, have to face that competition-al l from lowwage countries. We should reduce the import duties, and so reduce the cost of production, thereby enabling us to hold our own with oversea competitors, otherwise we fail. I .remember many years ago the ' establishment the butter industry in Victoria by means of a subsidy. .1 firmly believe that the subsidy paid at that time was the means of restoring the prosperity of the State. It built up a great industry which without assistance now competes in the world's markets. I believe it would be a better thing if , instead of imposing high duties on iron and steel products, so as to protect the industry in Australia, Parliament paid a bounty to the iron and steel producers at Broken Hill. In that way the cost of the raw materials of the manufacturers would not be increased, and every one would contribute towards the cost of supporting the local industry. The rabbit pest is very bad in certain parts of Western Australia, and wire netting is* urgently needed to keep the pest in control. Nevertheless, as soOn as British wire netting was brought in, a dumping duty was imposed on it,, while hundreds of thousands of pounds were paid to the manufacturers in New South Wales as a subsidy for the manufacture of this article. In the Murray River waters scheme we are committed to expenditure amounting to such Â£14,000,000. The people who will be settled here, to the number, it is estimated, of about 10,000, will engage, to a large extent, in the dried-fruit industry. They will have to send their products overseas to be marketed, in competition with those from other countries. Therefore, we should see that the cost of production is not made too high for them to compete successfully; for if they fail the whole scheme fails and we shall be loaded with a terrible debt. I have no doubt that, in the near future, we shall have further increases in the tariff. Honourable members should remember the dark days of July and August of this year, when every one in Australia was wondering what sort of a harvest we were going to have. There was fear among the manufacturers and the workers lest the crops should fail. It was realized then to what an extent the nation depended upon our primary products. Surely, therefore, we should not now do anything which would increase the cost of production to such an extent as to render it impossible for the primary producer to carry on. I say, shame, then, of on those Ministers who support these imports. The. secondary manufacturers in Australia have no prospect of making good unless we can increase the population and production of the country. We cannot export secondary products, and it is only by inducing more people to come here and settle in the interior, and open up our waste lands, that the market for secondary products can be. expanded. The process of heaping extra charges by way of customs duties upon the people will not achieve this end. An honourable member wanted to know what were my grave objections to the tariff. I have been here long enough to know how little desire there is that a good case should be put up for an increase in the tariff. The question has been settled on every occasion with a minimum of discussion. The Minister simply brings in his recommendations, and, without bothering even to debate or study them, the House imposes the duties asked for.",36
134,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,The Minister sometimes brings in higher duties than the Tariff Board recommends.,37
135,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"That is so and when duties amounting to 50 and 60 per cent., and sometimes over 100 per cent., are imposed, it is monstrous. Mr Sutcliffe, the statistician, has pointed out that even if the wages paid to workmen in Great Britain were 25 per cent, lower than in Australia, the difference in the cost of manufactured woollen goods should be only 5 per cent. Sometimes the cost of protection is actually greater than the wages paid to the workmen engaged in the industry which is being protected.",37
136,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,The honourable member cannot blame the protectionist policy for that.,37
137,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I do not know whether the honourable member read the splendid address delivered at Hobart last year by Mr Julius, Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, in which he referred to the proposals for developing the country's hydroelectric resources. He pointed out that the advantages which it was hoped would be derived from extensive power schemes were nullified by the enormous duties which had to be paid on copper wire and appliances used in the distribution and use of power. He referred to the numerous domestic electrical appliances required, and said that they should be allowed in free of duty, so as to enable housewives to make the most effective use of electric power. Further, he pointed out that it would pay the Government, as a business proposition, to allow all electrical goods to be imported into Australia free of duty, and give to all the men at present employed in the electrical industry in this country a pension. My objection to a high tariff is that it is parasitic in its incidence. It is like an Old Man of the Sea on the shoulders of industry, and it feeds on corruption. I refer particularly to the newspaper articles which appeared in the press throughout Australia when the question was being considered whether certain contracts for locomotives should be given to Thompson and Company, or whether the locomotives should be brought from Great Britain. I never before saw such a barefaced attempt to bring pressure on to the Government in an endeavour to give Â£56,000 to somebody in Australia, when the money could be spent to better advantage overseas. Tbese locomotives could have been obtained in Britain for Â£56,000 less than they cost here.",37
138,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,What would the hon the orable member say to a case in which a preference of Â£800 was given to an outsider ?,37
139,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I am not familiar with the circumsances of that case, but I believe that no Government should have the right to pay a higher price for an article, or should give away the people's money by way of favour to anybody just to bolster 'up an industry in Australia. There should be no influence brought to bear on the Government to give away the people's money. Personally I prefer to buy Australian goods, but if I can get the imported article considerably cheaper, I am inclined to buy it, and I think honourable members opposite would be also. A high tariff penalizes the poor people. It exacts tribute from the producers who are struggling against all sorts of odds in the ""Mever-lTever country. It cannot be right that such people should be made to pay tribute to wealthy manufacturing firms in this country simply for the sake of fostering local industry. I should like the Minister to produce the agreement between the Broken Hill Company, the iron and steel manufacturers, and the wholesale dealers. The Minister has suggested that it is only the usual trade agreement. Are we to assume that Rylands and Lysaghts can make agreements like that at their own sweet will? These secret agreements lead to monopolies in business to avoid competition. On other occasions I have directed attention to the large powers given to the Minister. Only recently we bad an instance of what this means, in connection with the importation of a consignment of Belfast binder twine. Some of the p r i mary producers had the audacity to use it for sewing up their bags! Minister declared that, strictly speaking, it was not binder twine, and acting under the powers given to him under the act, he increased the duty tenfold. Let me also remind honourable members of what happened recently in connection with the consignments of returned empty wine casks.' These had been made in Australia, were filled with Australian wine, and exported, but upon their return were made subject to heavy customs duties. Is this the way to encourage our primary in dustries? It is monstrous. This is what the Melbourne Age, a strong protectionist newspaper, had to say on the 29th July, 1921, when the b i ll conferring these powers on the Minister was before Parliament :Tariff making by officialdom and executive act is a degradation of representative government. The resolutions ought to be withdrawn and recast witli the object of eliminating both the Tariff Board and the excessive ministerial power.",37
140,Mr COOK,SHIPPING SERVICE,The Age is free trade in regard to the importation of newsprint.,38
141,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"All protectionists are the same. I remember one of the big newspaper proprietors complaining that certain proposed duties on newsprint would mean au additional cost of Â£75,000 a year to him. I do not anticipate that I shall be able to influence a single vote in this chamber, but I feel that I must direct special attention to the proposed increases in the duties on iron and steel, because they are of vital importance to all who are connected with our primary industries. The Tariff Board states, on page 20 of its report of June last:If the federal revenue statistics are examined it will be noted that the customs revenue is a continually expanding factor.. The net receipts from customs (excluding excise) for 1925-20 were Â£27,838,421, and in 1920-27 were Â£31,831,107. The excess from 1920-27 is, therefore, Â£3,902.686. Probably the excess this year will be considerably more than that. Experiencehas shown that the imposition of higher duties does not necessarily check importations. Surely this demand for increasingly higher duties indicates that there is something wrong in Australia. I advise honourable members to read an in teresting publication F r o m Silver to Steel, issued by the Broken Hill ProprieThe tary Company in 1915, when that concern was building up its great steel in dustry at Newcastle. The Tariff Commission conducted an inquiry into the general position, and the chairman of that body, referring to the Newcastle Steel Works, said I see nothing in the evidence to justify the assumption that some form of fiscal assistance will be permanently inevitable. On the contrary, the richness of Australian ore deposits, compared to those of other countries-the Iron Knob ore yields 68 per cent, of iron as against 36 per cent, profitably worked in Germanyand the freight charges borne by our nearest .competitors, make it probable that Mr Delprat's original view that the industry can stand on its own footing in Australia will provo right, once output is secured, and with it low production cost. The adage, ""the ore goes to the f u e l "" is complied with in the Australian works. Mr Delprat, the manager, in reply to a question whether he was asking for an import duty on iron and steel, at that time saidNo. We have decided that if we cannot carry on without 'Government support or assistance, we shall not proceed with the works at all. We find also this further statement by the chairman of the commissionI find that you can assemble at Newcastle the iron ore, coke and limestone for pig-iron production at a lower cost per unit per ton than is possible for the United States of America steel corporation in that country. I hope honourable members will pay special. attention to that statement. I hope also that they will bear in mind the statement made recently by the general manager of the company, upon his return from a visit to the United States of America. He declared that the Newcastle plant was as efficient as the best in the whole of the United States of America. Notwithstanding this fact, it is now proposed to increase the duties on the products of this important key in dustry. Of course, the result will be. an increase in the price of products that are the raw materials-.for other industries. I feeL sure that I am not exaggerating when I say that these new duties will mean an additional burden of over Â£2,000,000 a year, and that they will inflict great in j u r y on Australia as n whole. The board states furtherDuties for instance, were raised upon machines, machinery, iron, and steel, &c. The boardhowever, is in a position to affirm that such increased duties have largely failed to achieve their objective and, instead of an expansion of. manufacture, the figures reveal rather stagnation, notwithstanding the fact that the tariff increases were granted to stimulate sucli manufacture in Australia. The board then gives figures which show a substantial increase in. importations during 1926-27,. as compared with the previous year. I turn now to the position with regard to dynamo electric machinery. The board statedSimilarly with item, dynamo electric machinery n.e.i., which experienced a generous increase with the view of stimulating a languishing industry, the position is as follows:From 1020-21 to 1924-25 the duties were 30 per cent. Britisli preferential, 40 per cent, general, ancl the imports were:1922-23 Â£949,166 1923-24 1924-25 1,037,915",38
142,Mr WATKINS,SHIPPING SERVICE,I - suppose the honourable member is aware that the Broken Hill Company obtained no benefit from those duties.,39
143,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I am aware of that. I have referred to them for the purpose of showing that increased duties do not' mean, reduced importations. Mr Julius went so far as to say that it would pay the Commonwealth to pension off every manengaged in this industry, and remove the duties so that housewives in. Australia would have an opportunity to obtain electrical appliances for the home at a greatly reduced cost. Unless some radical change is made in QUI' fiscal policy something will have to be done to give relief to primary producers. There has been no stronger sup porter of federation than I have been, and no State has been more loyal to federation than Western Australia. The position, however, is becoming intolerable. The people there are being penalized by these excessive duties. If unfortunately Western Australia experiencesa bad season there will be an almost irresistible demand f b r relief even, if it means an amendment of the Constitution and perhaps separation. Some people will say that this is impossible. If people are trodden upon and if penalties continueto be inflicted upon them as they are under thistariff, they will - seek redress. It is my keen desire to seeAustralia prosper. We. cannot have true prosperity by following along these lines in our fiscal policy. I see no hope for the future of my State linder present policies. I see ou every hand an extravagance that is inexcusable. We appear to be afraid to remove from the statute-book socialistic legislation placed, there by our friends - opposite, notwithstanding that we full y realise that the continued, operation of these laws is not in the best interests of this country. Something must be done to get us out of our present difficulty. I hope that when Ave are considering the various items, honourable members will give serious consideration to the duties imposed in connection with our important key industries because these will create a demand for still higher protection in other industries. In this way we shall go on building up 990,351 a vicious circle, and there will be no escape from poverty and destitution.",39
144,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Dalley) [ 3 . 1 4 ] - I do not desire to set a bad example in this debate by traversing the whole of the arguments that could be used in favour of a protectionist policy for Australia, and refuting all the fallacies that are usually advanced against it . I realise that that has been done many times in Australia. Having had the subject threshed out on more than one occasion, the Commonwealth Parliament has adopted protection as its settled policy, and that policy has been endorsed by the people of Australia. Of course, that does not 'mean that the tariff schedule should not be criticized, or that it should not be open to correction, revision, or amendment. ""Nothing of that sort is in tended by the suggestion that the settled policy of this country is protection, but I believe that a large section of the people and the majority of the members of this committee are convinced that in order to develop Australia economically, to make the best use of our natural resources, and to achieve full nationhood. we must haye a system of protection to guard industries in their struggling days from competition"" with cheap foreign labour. It is rather late in the day for the honourable member for Swan to advocate the antediluvianfiscalismtbat be has been preaching today. The honourable member is possibly so set in his opinions respecting the tariff policy that has been endorsed by this Parliament, so little open to conviction on the subject, that it would be a waste of time to traverse and reply to his arguments. I am afraid that many of his 'statements today were based upon a complete fallacy as to the underlying principles and the consequent effect of a properly controlled protectionist policy. His statements seemed to be a mere reiteration of arguments that have been used ad nauseum by free traders ever since the protectionist policy was first seriously advocated in Australia. There seems to be a surviving remnant of free traders in this chamber.",39
145,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,And it is growing in strength.,40
146,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I should be astonished to find it growing in strength numerically, but it may be growing in volubility, and possibly in insistence. Today it is only a remnant of what was at one time a great political party. Honourable members who are out and out free traders ignore the lessonsof history. They ignore what has happened in Australia and elsewhere, the evidence of which is on every hand, and available in works on history and economy throughout the world.",40
147,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,Can the honourable member quote one economist who writes in favour of protection?,40
148,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,Will the honourable member quote a country that is a free trade country on the basis that ho advocates ?,40
149,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPPING SERVICE,Tb e honourable member for Swan did not advocate a free trade policy for Australia.,40
150,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"He opposed all kinds of protective duties. As far as I could gather from his argument he found fault with the imposition of protective duties, and the logical deduction was that he would remove those duties.",40
151,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,No word was said against the protectionist tariff of this country up to 1920.,40
152,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Ha d the honourable member advocated a schedule of duties to enable local manufacturers to compete successfully with oversea manufacturers, I could have understood his attitude; but if be did that he would be a protectionist. Although I favour protection, I do not. say that I agree with every tariff schedule that is brought down, nor must I necessarily be in favour of every proposal to increase tariff items. I advocate a policy that is reasonable, just and rational, one that will have the effect of protecting our primary and secondary industries from the competition of cheap-labour countries.",40
153,Mr MANN,SHIPPING SERVICE,Does the honourable member advocate the exclusion of all foreign goods ?,40
154,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"In some cases I should be prepared to place an embargo on importations. I have never made any secret of my advocacy of that. I do not say that it would be wise to adopt a policy of all round exclusion. We have to apply to the fiscal policy, as in the case of every other policy, reason and intelligence. We have to apply the intelligence that comes from experience and knowledge. Some industries are suffering because of the facility with which oversea producers, especially those of Asiatic and other cheap-labour countries, can produce an excess of certain commodities beyond their own requirements, and dump them into this country. To maintain those industries and to protect them from absolute extinction-the y may have cost millions to establish- I should impose an embargo on imports, and I believe that logical arguments can be used to justify the placing of an embargo on the importation of sugar on the same grounds.",40
155,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,"An embargo was placed on carbide, and what was the result?",40
156,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"We shall have an opportunity later of dealing with these commodities. I wish to point out what I consider to be some defects in the present policy. I agree with the honourable member for Swan that if the country is to be benefited at all it is essential as a concomitant of protection to have efficiency in production. We shall never have the full advantage of protection if we merely build up a high tariff, allow the manufacturers to exploit the community as the res nit of that tariff, and permit their protected industries to drift into inefficiency. It is necessary to watch the consequences of the tariff. I deprecate the suggestion that has been made by so many honourable members, that if there is inefficiency in production in secondary or primary industries, the entire responsibility for it rests with the workers.",40
157,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,I would not say that.,41
158,Mr THEODOEE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The honourable member has not gone so far as that, but he has attributed a large share of the responsibility for alleged inefficiency in production in Australia and the high cost of production to the workers in industry. That does not represent the true position. The workers are not by any means wholly responsible for any inefficiency. During the last year or two I have availed myself of every opportunity to visit factories, particularly in ""New South Wales, and to meet the representatives of employers and employees in order to gain some understanding of the difficulties confronting secondary industries. I had the good fortune some time ago to meet Mr. Octavius Beale, who Waa one of the pioneers in the manufacture of pianos in Australia. He has done herculean service to this country. I have no axe to grind on his behalf, nor do I hold any brief for him; but he is a typical example of an excellent Australian. He has worked wonders in establishing a new industry. He is employing a large number of workers in his factory, workers of many grades, from highly skilled, technical, professional men down to unskilled workers. He has nothing but the highest encomiums to offer for the efficiency of his workers. Mr Beale is not a supporter of the Labour party; indeed, be is a well-known ""Nationalist supporter; and he says that, from his experience of more than 30 years in manufacturing in Sydney, he considers that the Australian worker is as highly efficient, adaptable, capable of learning, intelligent in trade and profession as is the worker, of other countries.",41
159,Mr COOK,SHIPPING SERVICE,In his own business.,41
160,Mr THEODOEE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"He was speaking of his own experience. I have met other employers in different branches of manufacture, and they have reiterated that opinion, although I know that in some cases they think application of union rules lessens production; but that is no fault of the worker. Honourable members on that side are prone to ignore the fact that where there is high cost of production arising from cqntrollable costs in industry, where there is what is called industrial or commercial inefficiency, to a large extent the main factors for that are attributable to the management, and therefore to the employers. Mr G. FBANCIS - And to the nature of the plant.",41
161,Mr THEODOEE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"The employers are responsible in the main for that inefficiency, and the responsibility arises from defects in management, obsolete machinery and plant, lack of standardization, lack of proper accounting systems, and other causes. If it were possible to apportion the responsibility for inefficiency, it would probably be apportioned as it was in the United States of America. There, an influential committee of 80 engineers and commercial men investigated the question of the responsibility for inefficiency in industry. After inquiry, it reported that about 9 per cent, of inefficiency was attributable to the employees because of union rules and slackness on the part of the individual workers, and 91 per cent, attributable to the employers and those con_ trolling industry, because of lack of "" supervision, up-to-date machinery, and lack of efficient costing and otljer methods. I shall not say to what extent inefficiency in Australian industry is attributable to either one side or the other, because there has been no inquiry here. But there is no reason why that responsibility should be greater on the Australian worker than it is on the American worker. The workers in most manufacturing industries work under supervision, and the result here should be no different from that in America. I agree with the honourable member for Swan. that the flow of money into the customs house in increasing volume year after year does not necessarily mean that we are obtaining effective protection, or that we are adequately safeguarding the manufacturing industries; I believe it indicates the opposite. If the protectionist policy were only to produce, as it has done during the last few years, an inflated customs revenue, and were not to be more effective in checking the influx of foreign goods, we had best abolish altogether that kind of protection. It would be an absolute and complete failure, and would have a worse effect on those it is designed to benefit than if no tariff at all were imposed. The difficulties occasioned by the imposition of this form of indirect taxation, the burdens cast on the community ^-especiall y on the workers and the primary producers-ar e so prodigious as to be tolerable only if we believe that they are transient, and will disappear when Australian maunfacturers can produce the goods we require. A tariff that merely increased the price of commodities and swelled indirect taxation would not have a tittle of justification. If the protectionist policy is failing in its application and is not as effective as is desired, the responsibility rests with the Government and with the .administration. The Minister has been given practically a free hand by Parliament. In the consideration of this schedule some defects may be pointed out, items may be suggested as suitable for inclusion, and advice may be offered as to an increase or reduction of items already there, but the Minister has been untrammelled in the framing of the schedule and he must accept responsiIity for it. He has been given a great deal more freedom by Parliament in developing his policy than any of his predecessors. That is a compliment to him, because it shows that Parliament has confidence in his bona fides as a protectionist and in his desire to develop Australian industry. But he must take advantage of his opportunities. If at the end of a reasonable period he is unable to prove that he has protected our industries, if he can show only that he has piled up indirect taxation, he. must consent .to be written down a complete failure. NoUr. Theodore. body has a better opportunity than has the Minister of understanding the full economic effect of the policy he proposes; he has access to the Tariff Board and to other experts, and he can get guidance and light which often are denied to private members of Parliament. Therefore, the Minister must shoulder his responsibilities. The honourable member for Swan referred to the duties on agricultural machinery, as a special tax on agriculture. I recognize, as all reasonable members must, the special case that can be made out for Western Australia. Because of its geographical situation and economic condition, because it has to rely largely on primary production, it is in a slightly different category from the other States, and it must receive special consideration from Parliament. But we should not, because of Western Australia's peculiar position, abandon protection as a national policy. Far better would it be to give to that State assistance by other means. In studying the effect of the tariff upon the agricultural industry, I read of a deputation which waited upon the present Minister to complain of the cost of agricultural machinery and contrasted the prices in New Zealand and Australia. As an illustration, the deputation mentioned that the price of a 6-ft. reaper and binder in New Zealand under free trade is Â£72, and that the same machine is sold in Australia for Â£92. In refutation of that it has been pointed out that although the Australian farmer would have to pay Â£92 for the same class of machine as was sold in New Zealand for Â£72, he could buy an Australian-made binder of the same capacity, and at least equal quality, for Â£77. So long as he used the Australian machine he would pay only Â£5 more than the New Zealand farmers. A similar case can be made out in respect of many other agricultural, implements. For instance, a 15-hoe drill in New Zealand costs Â£63, and in Australia, Â£59 7s. 6d.; a four-furrow discplough in New Zealand, Â£47 15s.; in Australia, Â£34; a six-section set of harrows, in New Zealand, Â£15 12s.; in Australia, Â£10 9s. I have noticed in thesugar industry, in which cultivation is now carried on largely by implements and' machinery, that if the farmer utilizes: Australian-made articles he is mot quired to pay an extortionate price in comoil, parison with the price that would have been charged for similar implements prior to the imposition of the tariff. It said that the Australian agricultural plement industry is now well established, iind that many firms are producing on large scale ",41
162,Mr ABBOTT,SHIPPING SERVICE,And piling up huge fortunes.,43
163,Mr THEODOEE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I believe they are, supply and it is possible that they are unduly fiteering, and that the prices could lower than they are. Nevertheless the - farmer is not suffering by reason of the protectionist policy the great burden some people allege.",43
164,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,"There is a marked contrast between the prices in Canada Australia, and tht Canadian farmer is our competitor.",43
165,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"That may be, but using the argument adduced by the honsidered orable member in connection with the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line, it does not follow that if 2>rotecting the protectionist policy were abaninto Consolidated Revenue. doned and the Australian factories closed, the farmer would get implements as cheaply as they are sold in Canada. He might find himself subject to the rapaat city of an American combine. The lopsided trade between Australia and the United States is economically unsound. It may not result in any very great evil, but it is unfair that Australia should have such limited access to American markets while providing such wonderful market for American products There is a lack of reciprocity between Australia and America-bot h the United States of America ancl Canada-and i we are to take full advantage of our nomic position-the fact that we valuable markets that are available in - Commonwealth to those countries-w e shall have to consider before long whether we should not insist upon better terms our own exportable products. I do not suggest a retaliatory tariff-othe r counrevenue tries have resorted to that method when other methods have failedbut it should be possible rational negotiation to get a better - deal for Australian producers. I realise -.that many of the commodities imnot reported from the United States-^mineral kerosene, films, motor cars, and player pianos-ar e not being produced in Australia to the extent to meet all our requiremay be ments. But we import from the United imStates also large quantities of tobacco. Australia has land eminently suitable for a the cultivation of this crop, and offers a good home market. It should be possible to establish in Australia a very valuable agricultural industry that would the raw products for the tobacco factories. More should be done to enprocourage tobacco* cultivation, and only a be small percentage of the enormous revenue raised by the excise on tobacco would be required to establish this industry on a thatsound and profitable footing.",43
166,Mr THOMPSON,SHIPPING SERVICE,I intend to ask the and Government for a bounty.,43
167,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"That is the way to do it, and it should be a liberal bounty. I do not know whether it would be consound, but I believe that a considerable proportion of the customs revenue, levied for the special purpose of an industry, should not be paid It should be ear-marked or paid into a special fund-firstl y for the purposes of relieving such distress as may be occasioned the outset by the imposition of such duties; and secondly, for the payment of bounties to assist agriculturists who may be adversely affected. If it can be shown that duties imposed some years ago to, assist particular industries have resulted the in the collection of an additional a Â£5,000,000 a year in customs and excise - receipt s that were not collected for the purpose of aiding the Consolidated Revenue, but which are being collected from f the consumer and are detrimental to proecoducers and workers alike-that money have might be utilized to mitigate the the initial hardships caused by the impost. .The effect of such duties is felt in this way for a little while, but the flow of for goods is stopped aud the articles concerned are produced here. ' That kind of should not be considered as ordinary revenue but as a fortuitous income and should be. used for the special purby poses I have mentioned. I wish to call the attention of the ' Minister to some items that are included in the tariff schedule. I mentioned at an earlier stage of the session, when we were meeting in Melbourne, that a customs duty ought to be imposed on the importation of books into Australia. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this respect. In my opinion the tariff ought to be so arranged as not to bring about an increase in the price of educational works required in Australia. Even the imposition of an all-round duty on imported books would not, I - think, produce that effect. There are many large printing firms in Sydney and elsewhere which are subjected to unfair competition from overseas. An enormous number of books are brought into Australia comprising light fiction and other works, and are dumped into the country to the detriment of the local printing industry and also of Australian authors. I have had the facts relating to this matter placed before me in a convincing light by those concerned in the printing and publishing industry in Australia. I find that books such as have been referred to are imported free into Australia. They - are allowed not only to come in free, but to be dumped here. Books which are published in England at 3s. 6d. are available in Sydney at 2s., while in some of the great distributing bouses, such as Anthony Hordern's, they are sold at as low as 9d. a volume. These books probably represent the excess production of the English publishing houses. One of the largest publishing firms in Australia, Angus and Robertson; who are among the pinoeering publishers in Australia, and who are printers and book manufacturers as well, turn out a great many books every year, including books by Australian authors. I have' a list here indicating the nature of the publications which they issue. During the last four years they have handled 1,400,000 books, including such publications as the "" Bell Bird"" series, and the "" Platypus"" series. They do*, everything in connection with the publishing of these books, including setting up the type, printing, binding and distributing them throughout Australia. They also print Australian editions of books published oversea, such as My Life and Work, by Henry Ford. That particular work, which the public has been able to purchase at the bookstalls throughout Australia was printed and published in Mr Theodore. this country, and it was sold here cheaper than in Great Britain or America. Another such book was Lindbergh We. They paid a royalty for the right to print it, and the book, as printed by them, was sold cheaper than the original puhlication in America. A typical example of dumping is furnished in the case of Anne of Avonlea, which is sold wholesale in England for Is. 9d., and retailed for 3s. 6d. This book is sold in Australia at 3s. 6d. retail, notwithstanding that freight has to be paid to bring it 12,000 miles. It is also printed and published in Australia at 3s. 6d. There is no item included in the schedule providing for the better protection of the printing industry. There are 1,423 printing establishments in the Commonwealth, employing 32,600 people, to whom wages and salaries amounting to Â£6,300,000 are paid. The value of the raw materials, including fuel and light used, is Â£7,000,000, and the value added in process of manufacture is .Â£11,600,000.",43
168,Mr GREGORY,SHIPPING SERVICE,Does that include the newspapers ?,44
169,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"No ; it includes only the manufacture of books, printing, and lithography. Everything this industry uses in the way of raw material for the manufacture of books carries a duty at the present time. That is the unfair part of it. The machinery, when it has to be imported-and some, such as the linotype machine, is not manufactured here-pay s a heavy duty.  linotype machines.",44
170,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"I think the honourable gentleman is quite right in that statement, but there is a duty on printing machinery, and on such articles needed for book manufacture as linotype metal, inks, paste, paper, thread, tape, strawboard, blocks, and plates. It shows that the tariff duties are incomplete when duties are imposed on the raw materials, while the manufactured article is admitted free. If duties are imposed on the one, they should be imposed also on the other. This is a valuable industry which is not being adequately protected. It may be said that the imposition of a duty on books would increase the price of educational works. I do not think that it would. Recently one of the largest printing firms in Sydney secured a contract from the New South Wales Government for the printing and production of certain classes of school books used in primary schools. Tenders were called overseas as well as in Australia, and the Sydney firm secured the contract. It is costing the New South Wales Government about 4.7 per cent, more than for imported books, but the Australian firm is paying 12 per cent, royalty to the copyright holders. The Australian firm offered to print all the technical and other books required in the secondary schools, and to make them available to the schools at no increase on present prices, but in that case it was not able to obtain the copyright from the oversea owners. In the matter of copyright, we have no proper protection for our Australian authors, nor for our producers of books. In Canada, the law lays it down that the owner of a copyright must produce the book in Canada, and, failing that, any one else may obtain a licence to produce the book upon the payment of a specified royalty. In the United States of America they will not. give copyright protection unless the matter is wholly set up, printed, and manufactured within the United States of America. The other day I asked the Minister a question regarding a reference in the Tariff Board's report to certain classes metal goods manufactured in Sydney. It related to the output of factories engaged in what is known as the pressed metal trade. There is one firm known as the Australian Lock and Pressed Metal Company, which manufactures locks and all kinds of stamped pressed metal goods. It is an industry which employs many men, and its products are used as fittings on kit-bags, suit-cases, and other goods of that kind. It also produces pressed metal boxes and containers for various articles. I have here a container intended, when complete, to be a metal box holding a transformer for a wireless set. It is stamped out of one sheet of metal, and I am told that it is a particularly fine example of what can be done in Australia, because of the depth of the stamping and the. structural nature of the article. This industry has been haying a hard struggle, because it is up against the competition of German, Swedish and Japanese manufacturers. Among other the things the firms engaged in it produce articles known as barrel and socket bolts, This factory produces also barrel and socket bolts; they are used extensively in the building trade, and Canberra has been furnished with a good many hundred dozen gross of these bolts. The Tariff Board has apparently made a mistake and assumed that the bolt referred to is a fitting on kit bags and suit cases. It has not made any recommendation in its report regarding these socket bolts. I trust that the Minister will see his way to do something in this matter. This may not be a very large industry, but in my electorate alone there is a factory capable of employing more than 100 workers, and which gives indirect employment to a great many more.",44
171,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Is the industry being carried on today without any protective, duty?",45
172,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"There is a duty on many of the things produced, but it is inadequate in regard to barrel and socket bolts. At present the duties are 35 per cent. British, and 45 per cent, general, and it is desired that tbese duties should be increased to 45 per cent. British,' and 60 per cent, general. There are many of different countries, both continental and Asiatic, competing in the production of similar articles, and if the Australian industry has to compete unaided with the cheap labour in those countries, it will have to go out of production. There is a further anomaly in the tariff schedule and in regard to the articles known as pin bolts. There is not sufficient protection afforded to the industry to meet the competition of Japanese and German manufacturers. The German article, in particular, is coming here in great quantities. There are two sizes of tbese bolts, and on one of these sizes there is an import duty of 35 per cent. British, and 45 per cent, general. The other size is admitted free.  very good reason for that.",45
173,Mr THEODORE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"There is no other reason, I think, than that the matter has been overlooked by somebody in control. The smaller size is imported and sold at a price equivalent to 6s. a gross. Australian manufacturer cannot sell it at less than 12s. a gross. Therefore, the foreign article is sold at a Â£d. per holt as compared with a Id., which is the remunerative price for the Australian article. The Australian industry cannot carry on under those conditions. That has happened in this particular case. It shows how anomalies can occur in our tariff legislation. As this is the usual time for the adjournment of the House on Friday afternoon I shall defer any further remarks which I may have to make until we are dealing with the items in the schedule. I hope I shall have that opportunity next week. I exhort the Minister to use every endeavour to have the tariff schedule dealt with before the Christmas adjournment. Progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the House at its rising, adjourn until Monday next, at 3 o'clock p.m. ADJOTJENMENT. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS - COMMISSIONE R IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAINDUSTRIAL TROUBLE ON THE WATERFRONT-CANBERR A LICENSING ORDINANCE.",45
174,Mr BRUCE,SHIPPING SERVICE,Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.4] - I moveTliat the House do now adjourn. For the information of honourable members. I should like to say that it is proposed on Monday next to proceed with the debate on the tariff. The Land Tax Assessment Bill may also come on for discussion next week.,46
175,Mr COLEMAN,SHIPPING SERVICE,Does the Government propose to go right through with the tariff debate?,46
176,Mr BEUCE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Muc h will depend upon the progress made. There are certain measures that should be dealt with before the Christmas adjournment. The Government does not propose to ask members to sit beyond the 16th December, or possibly the following day. It would be impossible for honourable members from the more distant States to reach their The homes for Christmas if the House continued in session after that date. It is impossible to indicate exactly what measures will be taken next week, or the exact period that will be taken in connection with each bill.. I desire also to inform the House that I have received the resignation of Sir Hugh Denison, the Commissioner for Australia in the United States of America. Sir Hugh Denison has expressed the wish to leave New York not later than the second week in January ' next and the Government, in reluctantly accepting his resignation, has concurred in the proposed arrangement. A communication has been forwarded to the commissioner expressing the Government's appreciation of his valuable services which, it is recognized, have been carried out at great personal inconvenience and sacrifice. The Government does not propose to appoint a successor until it has had an opportunity to consult with Sir Hugh Denison regarding the future representation of Australia in the United States of America.",46
177,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,Can the right honourable the Prime Minister give the House any further information concerning the waterside workers dispute?,46
178,Mr BRUCE,SHIPPING SERVICE,I have nothing of an official character that I can communicate to the House.,46
179,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPPING SERVICE,Hunter) [4.7] - I trust that the Prime Minister will next week push on the tariff debate and allow the schedule to be dealt with finally before we rise for the Christmas adjournment. This matter is urgent in view of the unsatisfactory position of a number of industries that are affected by the tariff.,46
180,Mr STEWART,SHIPPING SERVICE,We all think that it should be fully discussed.,46
181,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Lang) [4.8] I wish to direct the attention of the honourable the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) to what appears to be, if not an actual infringement of the licensing ordinance in the Federal Capital Territory, something approximating very closely thereto. I have had placed in my hands a circular issued by a firm of wine and spirit merchants; in Goulburn inviting the residents pfeithe Federal Capital Territory to do business with them. Extracts from the circular read .as follow:Under present conditions it is of course necessary for residents of Canberra and adjoining districts to .obtain supplies of wines and spirits, ales; &c. from outside the Federal area. However, this need not be a hardship or even an inconvenience, as we are in a position to offer unique facilities for the prompt and satisfactory supply of a vaat selection of the choicest brands, spirits, wineB, ales, lagers, stouts, liqueurs, ciders, Schweppes cordials and waters, &c., at lowest possible prices. Our business at Canberra is already an extensive one, and we can with confidence refer you to many of your residents of high standing. There iB now a splendid service of trains available for the delivery of goods from Goulburn to Canberra. The circular goes on to state that there is also an inter-city coach leaving Goulburn on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays and* that it is possible to obtain through that servioe, at moderate prices, parcels and cases that are not too bulky. These circulars and the accompanying prices list are sent through the post at less than, the ordinary letter rates. Whether the invitation to buy spirituous liquors in that way is an infringement of the ordinance I am not prepared to say; but it-seems to me that if the goods are purchased by people living in Canberra, and if money is sent with the order, the transaction is tantamount to a sale within the Territory. As it seems an infringement of the spirit of the ordinance if not of the letter, I have token the opportunity of directing the attention of the Government to the position, and to ask the Attorney-General if he will note it . The point is-doe s an order from a resident within the Territory for liquor delivered to him within the Territory and paid for by him as the recipient constitute a sale within the Territory.",46
182,Mr BRUCE,SHIPPING SERVICE,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs ) [4.11] - I shall have the matter raised by the honorablo member for Laug (Sir Elliot Johnson) inquired into by the Crown Law officers in order to ascertain if the ordinance is being infringed, and if it is within the power of the Government to prevent an infringement. cannot > give the honourable - member an answer at the moment, b u i ' I am sure the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) and his officers will go seriously into the question to ascertain whether a - contract actually takes place. Whether he will t divulge the information obtained in order to safeguard the position of any honourable member who wishes to avail himself of the offer, I cannot say. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.12 p.m. I",47
