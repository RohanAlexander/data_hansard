I will and Superannuation, Bill Shorten, later on all the bills that have come to this House and I to use the opportunity of this debate on Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013 to express my concern about rising cost-of-living pressures Australia, and to express my dismay that the As many in this chamber would be aware, in price way in excess of inflation or indeed daily or weekly basis, and the stats back this of electricity has gone up by 90 per cent since education by 31 per cent and medical and hospital childcare costs have gone up by 15 per cent. they are starting to hurt families in a very receive telephone calls on a very regular basis meet because of these price increases. There are many reasons why the cost of living in recent years is government policy. I government's policy and the government's approach of-living pressures. The first, of course, is four years, the government has delivered the four history, and this year there will be a further budget deficits, that will have an impact on members of the coalition who support this Treasurer themselves have made exactly this surplus was 'the best thing that we can do Wayne Swan said: … meandering back to surplus … would compound of living for pensioners and working people. And they are exactly right. By running such deficits, by abandoning their solemn promise contributing to higher cost-of-living pressures The second way the government are contributing specific measures that they have put in place. immediate effect on electricity prices and good and service in the nation. Electricity has months alone, and that is entirely due to the by nine per cent-also entirely due to the this? Because the government's modelling before would go up by that amount. So they actually were going to increase through the carbon Bear in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker Lyons, that carbon tax is at $23 per tonne. As we know, the tonne and it is then forecast to increase to times increase in the carbon tax is expected that is going to have on electricity prices. government is taking the axe to the private would not, but they have already means tested flows through to everybody, and they are hitting residents in my electorate and across government's policies are making things worse. essential goods and services have been going up wages. People tell me this in my community on a up. The official ABS statistics show that the cost 2007, water by 64 per cent, gas by 60 per cent, by 38 per cent. In the last 12 months, even Cost-of-living pressures are indeed rising, and significant way. I receive correspondence and I from people who are struggling to make ends has been going up, but a significant reason would like to outline in four ways how the have contributed to the increase in costby running enormous budget deficits. In the last largest budget deficits in Australian political budget deficit. We know that, if you run large the cost of living. It is not just me or other particular view. The Prime Minister and the point. The Prime Minister said that achieving to help families with cost-of-living pressures'. the pressures in our economy and push up the cost huge budget deficits, by continuing to run budget to get the budget back to surplus, they are for every Australian in the nation. to cost-of-living pressures is through They introduced the carbon tax, which had an gas prices and, through those two things, every gone up by at least 10 per cent in the last 12 introduction of the carbon tax. Gas has gone up introduction of the carbon tax. How do we know they introduced it said that those costs got the forecast right. They knew that costs tax, and that is exactly what happened. these cost increases are occurring when the carbon tax is legislated to increase to $39 per an incredible $350 per tonne by 2050. So, a 15by this government by 2050. Imagine the impact Healthcare costs are going up because the health insurance rebate. They promised they the private health insurance rebate, which now proposing a further measure to abandon the ability to claim the additional penalties associated at the age of 30 against the rebate. Childcare costs have also been increasing government have decided that the staff-to-child They have already been reduced for the noughtto future for the twoto four-years-olds. The Productivity 'If you go ahead, costs will go up by 15 per gone ahead anyway. And what do you know? will continue to go up as the government's proposals and four-year-olds. The third area where they have put up the they have imposed. We all know about the government's products that working people use. They have were elected to government in 2007. Some of use, but others are taxes on businesses, which that those businesses offer. The fourth area is in regulations. The government over the five years since they were elected, one in, one out, but they have only removed regulations do is impose red tape and additional that then means is that business cost structures either have to put up the prices of their services lay off workers. They are the two choices profitability. So, in four ways the government have contributed running huge budget deficits; secondly, by introducing certain areas-electricity, gas, child care and putting up particular taxes-21 in all across regulations which make business costs so much the goods and services that those businesses concern that prices have been going up, but they have, in fact, been contributing greatly astounding thing, though, is that when the them because costs have been increasing so have been doing and remove some of the regulations, of their policies to try to reduce those cost-of-living No, their response has been to spend more the government introduced a bill for a further constituents in the community. It is all very additional cash in the short term, but all of all of it just contributes to the government's yearly deficit. Hence we get into this vicious which puts up cost-of-living pressures. So increasing the debt levels again, which then with not taking out private health insurance directly due to government policy. The ratios in childcare centres must be reduced. two-year-olds.

They promised 200 and have introduced 20,000. What these new reporting requirements on businesses. What go up and to recoup those costs they then or the goods they manufacture or they have to which they have in order to maintain their to the cost of living increases: firstly, by specific policies which put up costs in private health insurance, for example; thirdly, by the board; and fourthly, by imposing 20,000 new higher, which then flow on to higher costs for produce. The government like to talk about their when you examine what they have been doing to those increases in the cost of living. The government then get some political pressure upon much, their response is not to examine what they remove some of the taxes, tweak some pressures or try to run budget surpluses. money on cash splashes. Last week, for example, billion dollars of cash splashes to certain well that those residents get a small amount of that cash was put on the government's credit card, debt, all of it contributes to the government's cycle. The government has taken us into debt, the government then allocates some more cash, puts up cost-of-living pressures. And so the cycle continues. If we continue on that cycle the continue to allocate more and more cash and cannot be done. So what should the government be doing to number of things and it can do these things immediately. tax. The carbon tax adds approximately $515 confidence. That would be the first and best pressures on everyday families, including those thing they could do to support our manufacturers. examine some of their policies which are increasing attacks on the private health insurance rebate. possible, they should reduce taxes to make it Lower taxes are in the coalition's DNA.

Fifth, they particularly into supermarkets, where many people contributing to higher prices. That is a list of things the government should immediately in order to take the cost-of-living some of the things which the coalition will government later this year. The cost-of-living is perhaps one of the greatest concerns that the government have been doing is not alleviating Through their taxes, through their policies have been putting up cost-of-living pressures them. We need to be doing the opposite. The pressures, to get the budget back into surplus, causing prices to go up and to remove the taxes. elected to government. They should be things will not.

These are continue to raise formally and informally in my electorate but in particular, in the context Cardinia. I look forward to the opportunity to the findings that are presented in this report.

I would like to talk about some of those and also some of the other investments infrastructure and other commitments that we have this government has made around $110 million in through the Building the Education the only program that has gone to supporting to be able to say that we have invested heavily is very much to the benefit of one of the growth that Hillcrest Christian College has been the grant of $1.5 million to develop an equine trade that is covered by Clyde and right across to to benefit from this.

I am proud to be part of a government that has during the global financial crisis. That is so during the global financial crisis and we now when it first entered office. It is also an all three credit rating agencies-something the is a very important accomplishment by the eye off the road when it comes to guiding our to grow and continues to stay strong. When we talk about what is important for sure of who we are managing it for. I am very has been not only on managing a strong economy country, and in particular it is about ensuring I am pleased that it has seen a continually to many, many places around the world. The since it came to office. Quite frankly, that is what has been happening around the rest of the like to hear about what is happening around the where they ignore the fact that there has been a that. They ignore the fact that there has been countries significant unemployment. I am on people, focusing on their jobs and of life because they have jobs, they have an only been focused on growth, and focused on that that is delivering to people such as has not just been about the good economic this government has delivered assistance to those who may be doing it tough-the fact is that are areas that are doing it tough-continue that assistance that I am very pleased to have of Kingston is the Schoolkids Bonus. Most of us would be aware, if we are listening to people can be costly, especially with all the associated speak to parents, they are so desperate to give costs around that can really add up. I am originally allowing a number of school items Bonus. Just in my electorate, in January representing 19,750 primary and secondary $205 for each child in primary school and $410 will receive another payment in July. This electorate. I have to say that, after the opposition announced came into government, there was a lot of disappointment In particular, families indicated that they were families would just waste this money and children. I have to say that there were a lot feeling quite insulted by this. I was at a opposition announced their position on this would spend it wisely, and I had a line-up of it wisely and would spend it on their children's But what is even more concerning from opposition gave to these families but the fact bonus. This is very concerning, because this children go to school. Indeed, if the Leader with two kids would be approximately $15,000 schooling. That is a significant burden to thing-that want to buy the school uniforms for their kids to share so that they can connect projects. All those things assist kids at school do their homework, and these families will Leader of the Opposition ever gets his way. But, of course, that is not the only area they are worse off if the opposition ever again of the government's decision to triple impact for many people in my electorate necessarily have to pay tax anymore. That assistance with the cost of living. But it workforce and perhaps take up a part-time were doing this and found that they had to put have done is not only to take many, many people a little assistance with cost of living but also back to work. For many people, that will be a indeed it affects many, many people in my local electorate. In addition, the news of the scrapping of income earners was very welcome. This was in our electorates, that sending a child to school costs around uniforms and books. When I their children a very good education, but the very pleased that the government moved, after to be tax-deductible, to provide the Schoolkids it delivered to approximately 11,200 families, students. These families have already received for each high school student. Of course, they has certainly been welcomed by families in my they were going to scrap it if they ever and concern around the electorate. insulted when it was said by the opposition that not spend it on the educational needs of their of mums and dads that came up to me that were shopping centre in Hallett Cove just after the and the fact that they did not believe parents people wanting to tell me that they would spend education. I certainly believe them. my perspective is not just the insult that the that they are going to scrap the schoolkids has a significant impact for families while their of the Opposition had his way, a typical family worse off during the course of their children's be placing on families that want to do the right and the school resources and perhaps a computer to the internet and be able to do their school and assist them when they go home at night to have that money ripped away from them if the in which families in my electorate will find that does come to government. I was very proud once the tax-free threshold. This has a significant who are now out of the tax system and do not is a massive saving to many people and provides is also an encouragement for people to enter the job, maybe only working one day a week. If they in a tax return, it was all too hard. So what we out of the tax system and allow them to have to create an incentive to contribute and to go big bonus. So I think this is very important, and the 15 per cent tax on superannuation for lowvery popular in my electorate, because we are not only helping low-income earners with the free threshold-but also, by getting rid of that them to accumulate more superannuation that will better in the future. So these are two examples that really show economy very well but also thinking about the I have had to report to my electorate that these ever come to government. They have indicated $27,820 or lower. They will reintroduce it so it back to the status quo as before. That electorate. In addition to that it has now been confirmed would reinstate the 15 per cent tax on superannuation so important not to put that tax back on. The they are low-income earners, are not going superannuation over time. They really need superannuation so that people are not living critically important thing for many women going back to work, once again, part-time-maybe help them build up their superannuation and ensure we are going to be committing them to living So these two are really important, and I strongly change their policy and to say, 'We came out these things. We've changed our mind now and lower-income earners really get help with the wealth for the future.' At the beginning of my speech I made a economy well we also need to consider who we have been very pleased about is that the management strategy. We spent when it was actually needed to stimulate. Recently we consolidations ever, because as the economy returns do. Of course, this was not the attitude of Howard government spent more, fuelling interest many, many people in my electorate. While with a mortgage is 34.9 per cent, in my electorate high, this has an unrepresentative burden on my electorate. What we have seen from the responsible those families, perhaps with a mortgage of now paying $5,000 less in repayments each remember a pamphlet coming out in my electorate interest rates lower?' That was one done by the evidence is in: it is actually Labor that cost of living now-with the tripling of the taxtax, helping them in the future. This allows ultimately ensure that their quality of life is that the government is not just managing the people that it is managing it for. Unfortunately, two initiatives will be scrapped if the coalition that they will reinstate tax for people earning that they have to pay tax after $6,000, so taking has been very distressing for many people in my that the opposition, if ever in government, for those earning $37,000 or below. It is reason it is so important is that these people, if to have the same opportunity to accumulate a step-up and assistance when it comes to under the poverty line when they retire. This is a workers. Many women workers perhaps might be a day or two days a week. If we do not that they have a nest egg to retire on then below the poverty line when they retire. urge the coalition not to scrap these but to a bit negative, saying that we're going to scrap our policy is a bipartisan policy to help those cost of living today and also help accumulating very important point: when we are managing the are managing it for. One of the things that I Labor Party has had a very responsible fiscal needed, when we needed to save jobs and we have gone through one of the largest fiscal to growth that is the responsible thing to the Howard government. As growth accelerated the rate rises. That was very burdensome for the national average percentage of homes owned it is 44.3 per cent. So if interest rates are economic management of this government is that $300,000 on a standard variable mortgage, are year than when the coalition left office. I in 2004 saying, 'Who do you trust to keep the Howard government. Unfortunately for them, manages the economy in the interests of people with a mortgage-the people facing these considering what their needs are. As I said, keep their jobs, and we have acted now to ensure on interest rates. We have done that well, people in my electorate. As a member of the government, and as we responsible economic management. This is quite were ever put on it. However, I will continue does that by not forgetting who we are managing continue to deliver to those who need it who really need our assistance-and we will here and that is why we govern. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:44): I rise Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Firstly, I would the last election.

First, there is the mining tax-an absolute government commit $14 billion of expenditure lucky to raise anything more than a few million our Treasurer absolutely played off a break gets down to is a fundamental flaw in ideology. done with the company tax rate. Very simply, increase the tax rate, we get more money in. when you increase rates of tax you have a disincentive disincentive to invest you get less investment, growth and, therefore, you get less tax. Take the example of what the last coalition Under the guidance of Peter Costello and from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. I can remember argued that lowering the company tax rate paying less tax, that the government would than needed for spending on our hospitals, what actually happened. In 1999-2000 we which the Commonwealth received from company we fast-forward just eight years to when we the government received 144 per cent more revenue at a lower tax rate, the government If we go back to the mid-1980s when represented about 2.4 to 2.7 per cent of GDP.

As a government we will most-those low-income earners and those people continue to do that because that is why we are I commend the bill to the House. to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and like to rewind a little and go back to the time of to the country identified four things that was going to fix the mining tax; second, she was to stop the boats; and, fourth, she was going Australia. In the time remaining to me today I and how they have affected my constituents of rolled gold disaster. We have seen this to a mining tax which we now realise will be dollars. We have seen our Prime Minister and by the large mining companies. What it basically I would like to give the example of what was it is easy to sit down and see on paper that if we But in real life it does not work that way because for investment, and when you have a fewer people taking risks, less economic government did about the company tax rate. John Howard, we lowered our company tax rate at the time that those on the Labor side was terrible, that all these companies would be be getting less tax and that we would have less roads and education. But look at the numbers and raised approximately $24 billion worth of tax tax, and that was at a rate of 36 per cent. If lowered the rate of company tax to 30 per cent, from the tax over that period of time. So, received 144 per cent more revenue. the company tax rate was 49 per cent, that Fast-forward again to the last year of the of 30 per cent, we were getting 5.4 per cent GDP as company tax. That shows that the way get to spend here in this House, is not to increase companies, to take the tax burden off them and the company tax rate but, unfortunately, government. The second rolled gold disaster is the carbon What we have seen is a plunge in the EU carbon are still forecasting revenues based on an EU we look at some of the recent forecasts in equivalent of $8.86 in 2015.

39,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I rise to the excellent contribution from the member Australian government. I have spoken in relation that I have been in this place, and once again the ordinary business of government-but in could only describe as absolute free fall. Let us have a look at what is happening right perhaps the worse example of public policy debacle. This has a profound impact on the line and is another reason that the government think is completely unsustainable. I have Australian budget every single dollar that is door in the form of welfare-a completely unsustainable a mining resource rent tax that does not something that discourages investment and hinders for their future. But what is worse is to government that spends up to $15 billion against That is completely unsustainable expenditure. It is not the first time we have seen it from a series of questions put to this government. has it put $15 billion expenditure against funded? Of course, the Treasurer today was answer about how it was to be funded. Of funded-he has not thought about it. The borrowing-more debt and more deficit. Borrowing borrowing against the future employment generations who will have pay for the flagrant government. We have seen the whiz-kids of the Labor Not only did we see Penny Wong and the Treasurer were going to get a surplus. We saw the wonder little logo that said, 'Back to the surplus Future, thinking they were being clever. chuckle. It is funny-'Back to the surplus going to do next? The only problem is that government. I know I have found some sympathy the current government. 'Back to the surplus'-these seem to think this is some kind of joke. it is those students who, when they enter the for this government's debt. Fortunately for the this year-and they will have a clear choice. that does not know how to stop spending and track record of effective economic and opportunity for all Australians. speak on the appropriation bills and to follow for Forde in relation to the spending of the to appropriations over the past five years we see the government seeking funds to conduct the context of a budgetary condition that you now in the nation's budgetary situation-with in our era being the mining resource rent tax economy's bottom line and the budget's bottom will need to appropriate money at a rate that I spoken on many occasions on how already in the collected in individual income tax is sent out the budget footing. What you have with bring in any revenue is, of course, a bad taxthe ability of companies to plan securely find a government of the calibre of this Labor money that is not going to ever come in. That is completely unsustainable expenditure. this government. Each day in question time we see What is it going to do to fix this situation? Why no incoming revenue? How is this going to be completely embarrassing when he really had no course, he does not know how it is going to be only answer, of course, is borrowing, more against the future of this country, of this country, borrowing against the future expenditure of this out-of-control Labor Party come up with the slogans about the surplus. on 650 occasions go out and say that we kids of the Labor Party put out on Twitter a in 2012-13'-playing off the movie Back to the I know the member for Bruce is having a little 2012-13.' Those crazy Labor kids! What are they the same people are running this country's in the member for Bruce about the state of crazy Labor kids running the government It is not funny. On 650 occasions you announcing a surplus. You have the Assistant electors that he had already delivered a businesses and honest hard-working people member, who serves in this place as Assistant surplus. He has delivered it! But he has refused voters-to tell his electorate the truth, to movie concept. It was never going to get made; to get into production because the actors were out and front his electorate and tell them that to be delivered under this government. Are we to believe that this is due to commodity We know for a fact that federal government when the government took office. We know revenue is forecast to rise by $37 billion and $4 billion. The write-down in commodity prices increase in government revenue, and yet this of billion on the commodity market, the entire we are supposed to believe from this government. businesses, people from overseas to make of fortunes and its ability to deliver a surplus volatile. Commodity prices will rise and fall. have the unedifying spectacle of a Treasurer basis essentially to say each week: 'Well, this sorry, commodities are down.' Then the next and he starts to say, 'Well, look, maybe we'll government. This is an unsustainable approach an economic climate where people are hanging their money because they know the kind of They know the kind of people who are running this country.

They will go to any length to cover The MRRT represents perhaps the single biggest It is a completely unedifying spectacle and who lack confidence in the economic climate economy. In the context of this appropriations bill, about what Labor is doing to the budget and the problem. I mentioned that we have had $70 to office; however, the problem is that we have since Labor came to office. Expenditure has deficit is becoming larger and larger. Of have the finance minister and the Treasurer Treasurer David Bradbury announcing to his budget surplus-that is, all those families and in Western Sydney have been told by their local Treasurer, that he has delivered a budget to retract, to correct, to respond to his update them that 'Back to the surplus' was just a it was a low-budget film that was never going too D-grade. On a serious note, he refuses to go his much vaunted budget surplus is never going prices? My answer is that I do not think so. revenue is now $70 billion higher than it was that just from MYEFO. Commodity price the write-down was in the order of $3 billion to was just a small percentage of the total government says, 'Because we have lost a couple budget is going to fall into chaos.' That is what What are the Australian public, investors, a government that seriously links its political to commodity prices? Commodity prices are For the first time in this country's history we who has gone to the media on a week-by-week week the surplus is not going to happen. I'm week there is a bounce in the commodity prices get there.' This is an unsustainable approach to to managing the budget. No wonder we are in onto their money. People are hanging onto people who are running this Labor government. mining company, you cannot trust the word of if this government were re-elected in word means nothing. Their signature means up their own grave inadequacies and failings. public policy blunder in Australian history. it has serious consequences for ordinary people and the ability of the government to manage the I think it is important that we continue to talk some of the expenditure, because expenditure is billion of increased revenue since Labor came had $90 billion worth of expenditure increases now reached proportions that mean that our course, the government is right to say that comparatively, in an international context, our they inherited from the previous Howard government. What we see now is this completely out-of-the-ether Gonski, whether it be the dental scheme, whether Scheme or whether it be the NBN-and projects completely unaffordable. These projects, which context, are simply being announced to try to a daily exercise in this parliament. It is afford to fund $6 billion for Gonski, billions for the National Disability Insurance Scheme Network? Who is going to earn that money? who is going to pay for all that debt you will Some of these ideas are worthy. Some of world's problems without having the how. You have to know how you are going to fund it. really have no idea how you are going to solve is crazy to think that even with one of the even redistribute wealth properly.

But perhaps, as I have spoken about many about the budget and the appropriations and defence expenditure. I have mentioned in this federal government-in fact, one of the reasons prime motivator-is having a Defence Force that the first priority of government must be is why it is shocking to this House to understand spending cut by 10.5 per cent in one year-the Korean War in 1953. When I saw the Minister dispatch box today, I thought, 'How does cabinet minister who took the biggest annual significant cabinet portfolio?' There are people in this chamber who have How can you front up to parliament each day as of your portfolio in such a critical and vital to understand that we are now ranked 65th in regard ourselves as one of the most advanced role to play in the free world, how can we personnel if we are ranked 65th in the world per cent cuts in the annual defence budget economic mismanagement.

It is time for this (16:27): I rise this afternoon on very for my own electorate of Maranoa. The topic is rather sensitive but I am taking this to take note of what I am saying, particularly sure that money could be appropriated to the issue that is growing across Australia-sexually Queensland Health department state: Sexual health is not just for people who have had It means taking care of your body, your health, having sex. Trying to avoid STIs is part of sexual health. That is a direct lift from the Queensland health.

In 2011, chlamydia was the most frequently some 79,833 new notifications for persons aged of our population. This is nearly seven times notifiable STI, gonorrhoea.

The REC 'ticket' is then sold to a federal government's legislation. All of this scam it is intentionally deceptive. Let me walk you through what benefits my a serious attempt to refocus on and change the renewable energy opportunists. I will talk about Hume alone, the subsidy for new wind turbines, excluding existing turbines, is set to reach $10 billion over 10 years. This subsidy is equal turbine. Meanwhile, communities are at war serious land value losses and If the wind industry subsidy for Hume were could do the following. We could reduce emissions through the wind turbines. We could solve Hume electorate. To name a few things we could Barton Highway, $600 million; rebuild the cameras in every major town to prevent crime, black spots-for example, in Crookwell, $2 million; million for heightening the dam wall. After infrastructure problems, we could hand back electricity prices-up to $7 billion over seven to the Parliamentary Budget Office or Treasury right. Who benefits from the subsidies? In the electricity consumers. Meanwhile, the beneficiaries subsidy in the form of renewable energy certificates the power is generated and redeemed at market investors are losing faith in these companies. not have other large businesses outside of extremely hard, with the only realistic options sponsored capital, to fund the developments money. Does wind make sense as a source of power answer is whether wind turbines are the most can clearly say two things on this: first, uneconomic unless they receive large subsidies second, we should allow the most economic without favouring one option over another. Massive subsidies are required to support what a poor option it is. The cost of producing hour. The cost of producing gas fired power CO2 emissions of coal. The cost of producing per megawatt hour. Low utilisation and high capital of this, wind requires backup power for times economic case. Some argue that the costs of costs of other renewables, particularly solar, energy is bringing down its costs by increasing more community unease. If it is true that makes sense to do so, not before. Another way of thinking about the economics options for reducing carbon emissions. Using $500 million to $1,000 million per year, or up to to around $450,000 to $900,000 for each new with each other, adjacent landholders face health issues continue to emerge. given to the electorate to spend, we commit we by 50 per cent more than is achieved every major infrastructure problem inside the do in infrastructure, we could: duplicate the Goulburn hospital, $150 million; set up CCTV $2 million; fix mobile phone and TV reception and pay off the Yass council debt of $18 three years of using the subsidy to fix all of the subsidy to the government to reduce years. We are prepared to give these numbers for verification because we know they are end, the costs of the subsidies are worn by are the wind companies. They receive this issued by the federal government when price. Despite the massive subsidies involved, Their share prices have dropped where they do wind. Raising money for wind projects is now being to search for Chinese or other state from profit or to look for more union sponsored generation? One of the questions we need to economic way to reduce carbon emissions. We the excessive cost of wind turbines makes them relative to other means of reducing emissions; means of reducing carbon emissions to succeed I will spend more time on both of these points. wind. The raw economics of wind demonstrate coal fired power is about $40 per megawatt is closer to $60 per megawatt hour, with half the electricity from wind is around $100 to $120 costs are the main reasons for this. On top of low generation and this further weakens its wind generation are coming down. However, the are expected to come down much faster. Wind the size of the turbines, and this is creating costs are coming down, let us use wind when it of wind is to compare wind with other wind to reduce one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions costs around $60 to $80. Other means indeed, this government believes it can substantially carbon tax to around $25. The cost of reducing $10 per tonne. So, in order for wind investments that is not just compared with other means of means of reducing emissions. Who pays for these subsidies? These subsidies more in our bills to subsidise wind and other each year and will continue to do so until 2020 could be as large as $3 billion. This will require in all likelihood, the construction will not happen the subsidies is an important reason for countries across the world. In closing, all I have to say on this very strength to recognise that there is a very serious terms of offshore $2 companies ripping off, in of funding their projects and taking the money currently in the system for this renewable energy and put into the reconstruction and restructuring",243

It may appear to at times, but the reality is that the decisions on the ground on the lives of ordinary people. As that our job is not to be lord of the manor servant of those people in those areas. We are here The reality of this is that we need to put in impacts across the whole broad spectrum of sure people's lives are somehow better than heard on many occasions speeches by members things the Howard government was responsible for-this is after the government last changed at that stage, but when we look back on those left, someone needs to clean it up. For those measures required to clean it up is pretty rich. In this appropriations debate, we are talking fiscal position right now, and it is a mess in been here for the last five budgets, and on every have proved to be wildly inaccurate. Excluding speeches and positions that were outlined represent As for the last one, at one point it was estimated out to be a $44 billion deficit. Now the government the promised, much-vaunted budget surplus and While some might say this is an economic for the government. When the finance minister, 650 occasions that there is a cast-iron guarantee everything up to the highest levels, creating out, you fall a lot further. It is little wonder then that it was reported the Edelman Trust Barometer for 2013-a survey across 26 countries, about trust and, in particular, that, of those 26 countries, in only one has the is Australia. If we look at what has happened budget perspective, it is little wonder As I have outlined, the budgets have been we get to the final budget position-or the find every budget and every MYEFO to be wildly Australian people no longer have confidence The Prime Minister knows only too well that, people do tend to remember them, particularly newspapers. The government have a problem not only with with their promises about things like 'no carbon certainly very clear in the minds of every person promised and the Treasurer said before the There has been plenty of spin, but the reality and what was delivered, and there Before I move on from the carbon tax being government, it has also been reported that the account for another $4 billion of revenue forward estimates. In fact the broken promise the budget, so when the budget is being dragged another good reason that when Tony Abbott government he leads that is something the Australian back to the coalition in 1996. I was in the Army times we must keep in mind that, if a mess is who leave the mess to then complain about the about what is happening with the government's every respect. A couple of us in the chamber have occasion the figures in those budget speeches last year's budget, the other four budget some $147 billion in collective deficits. to be a $22 billion deficit and then it turned has clearly moved completely away from we can expect yet another budget in the red. problem, it is also obviously a political problem the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say on of a surplus-you make the big call and lift high expectations-and then that does not work today, in the Financial Review, I believe, that of 31,000 people from around the world, trustworthiness in government-reveals level of trust in the government fallen, and that over the last three years, and even longer from a that confidence in this country is flailing. way off the mark, and I suspect that by the time post-election budget position, anyway-we will inaccurate. So it is little wonder that the in this government with regard to fiscal matters. when you promise things before an election, when it gets reported on the front pages of fiscal issues and inaccurate budgets but also tax'. I do not wish to labour this as it is in this country, but what the Prime Minister election have been completely brushed aside. is that everybody remembers what was promised is no correlation between the two. an issue of trust and a big problem for the falling carbon credit price across the world will that the government will not receive over the on the carbon tax is now having an impact upon down by the carbon tax as well that is says there will be no carbon tax under a people should well and truly welcome. My next point is the mining tax. Again this wealth concept that the government likes to before the 2010 election, but it did a few quieten down the campaign against the mining Minister and the Treasurer and, as we know, was going on, were left outside and the Prime Deputy Prime Minister of this country, accepted Treasurer stands behind still. They stuffed billion of spending to this mining tax across were going to get $2 billion during this financial of revenue has been accrued from the first six the tax will take away a fair bit of that Australian people soon, but I make the point Treasurer's tax, it did not work out, it stuffed their errors. I also want to raise the matter of border since 2008, when the government changed the Ever since the current Prime Minister took the support Paul Howse and the union people, blowouts to the budget. Across the forward $5 billion would be saved because things would anything the acceleration of their arrival levels. There have been some 900 in just the out of the bottle, no-one has found the lamp we do have the answer because the answer but before it was unwound it was working. election. The reality is that we have a government trust and that trust, according to the Edelman Australia who were surveyed, relates to poor government tends to look at our questioning being negative. It is easy to push that away, not have to accept accountability. Again, that moment with this government. When we look through these matters-the budget budgets with all the figures; the carbon tax the climate and this country no better, and in been a complete failure; and border security, that we have a situation where this government this government is accruing will have to be paid be paid for by showing some restraint As I said at the start, when someone creates mess, to then complain about measures used mess. In amongst this, what we have is a situation expectations with regard to education. According was meant to be the great redistribution of push. This was a big problem for the government deals, worked a few things out and managed to tax. That deal was signed off by the Prime the officials, the people who really knew what Minister and the Treasurer, who is also the full responsibility for this tax which the it up. They were more than happy to commit $15 the forward estimates. They believed that they year alone, but as we know just $126 million months of the tax. The costs of administering as well. We will get to what that means for the again that this is the Prime Minister's and the up and we will see how accountable they are for security. I have spoken on this on many occasions policy and suddenly boats started arriving. over and ditched the former Prime Minister with there has been something like $6.6 billion in estimates the government has estimated that some be so much better, but at the start of 2013 if of illegal immigrants by boat has been at record last five or six weeks. The genie has not come to rub to try and find the answer, but fortunately worked last time. This government unwound it, We do not need three wishes, we just need one that suffers from a problem with regards to Trust Barometer and the 1,000 people in performance and accountability. I know that this of them, our constructive criticism of them as because if you talk about negativity then you do is the problem that this country has at the and the failures over the five years of the that was not meant to be but is and which makes fact the budget worse off; a mining tax that has which has also been an abject failure-we see is borrowing a lot of money and that the debt for by the generations to come. It will have to in spending in the future. a mess it is rough for them, having created the by the next person who has to clean up that where the government has built very high to Gonsky, billions of dollars a year will be required, and there is an expectation that that is bleeding cash at the moment and how they the same time, with regard to the interest payments deficits-some $7 billion a year in interest much the NDIS estimate cost. You can then see spending, this inaccuracy in the budget figures, cetera, is starting to have an impact upon NDIS, who have been promised it by this government, to be let down by the spending regime government's policies. I will go back to where I started, which parliament, as members of a government or an country better.

45,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS," unfortunately I cannot-because of what is contained 2013 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013. another spending expedition by the Gillard additional $1.27 billion in expenses into the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for, amongst other visa compliance, with a bill of $37 million; settlement, with a bill of $23 million; increased million; and $19 million to help the Australian superannuation member accounts into government revenue. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) will add a further saddlebags-that is right, $660 million, the all this lead in the saddlebags when the pony the economy is straining under the weight Already the Gillard, and previously the biggest budget deficits on record, back to back. Economically speaking, it is the Treasurer-he abysmally failed to balance the books under Griffith, and who is continuing to be an abysmal The reason behind that consistent failure and fact that they only know one thing: they the Treasurer, I should say, is a one-trick pony, musician Paul Simon: One trick is all that horse can do. Paul Simon might have had a premonition when 1980-because that was before the member have not seen a Labor government deliver delivered their last surplus, Paul Simon wrote these words: He's a one trick pony is all going to be paid for. But this government are going to plan to do this is not yet clear. At that have been accrued through all these payments alone-just counter that against how that maybe the downside for all this reckless this inability to control borders, spending et real people. Those people who are in need of an are going to be the ones who are going of this government and the failures of this was about our position. Our job as members of opposition, is to make the people's lives in this why we are here. If we put things in place and people's lives in this country better, then we someone a go who will do a better job? I rise-I would say with gladness but in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012It is a case of saddling up again for Labor government. Together these bills load an economy's saddlebags-that is, $600.8 million in things, offshore asylum seeker management and visa and migration services and refugee water protection capability, with a bill of $24 Taxation Office funnel potentially lost $660 million worth of weight to the economic mark of the beast.

The infrastructure we need for a strong this government, because they are too busy trying to people in blatant vote-buying exercises and that they have actually taken away from them, The legacy that this Labor government has built a year, $7 billion they have to tax Australians debt that they created in five years. In simple seven days a week-that is the interest bill. Labor has created a debt so big it costs us producing sectors and regions in the economy $800,000 an hour every hour in interest.

Because, this aircraft is a comprehensive and hugely expensive its life, so no wonder we are getting so much the aircraft is an outlier. We are told that need for high aerodynamic performance; it will they crow about the 50 degree angle of attack combat? The reason is that, according to Defence therefore anything it can do is important and quite willing to mislead, lie and obfuscate-anything elephant. Remember, even if it achieves the 2020 IOC, Do you really think it will be remotely competitive the Europeans and indeed LockMart with its for these aircraft to have supermanoeuvrability supersonically without using afterburner-if light up the sky to get into a position to afterburners which can be seen from a long distance do that.

Are Eurofighter, Gripen and Rafale all wrong? wisdom of the likes of John Boyd and von Lockheed Martin Fort Worth division is correct? I want Tom Burbage, the head of the parliament and explain why he did not give parliament. If we do not insist on full transparency, ones to pay the price, not those in Russell Finally, no doubt Defence and LockMart will state we will have to take them on trust that it truly combat, and that is why it is a world-beater. where we have had the opportunity to compare to 4.6 g.
