2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,I noticed in the press today varying statements as to the decision arrived at regarding the disposal of HMAS. Sydney. Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in a position to reply to the question I asked last week regarding this matter ?,10
3,Mr MARE,Unknown,"The matter is still under consideration. A reply will be furnished to the honourable member's question as soon as possible. CAJSTBE RR A. ACCOMMODATION FOB WORKMEN - SAU B OF LIQUOR - OFFER OF MESSRS. DOULTON AND COT. Mr Charlton/ - I wish to ask the Minister for Home and Territories the. question arising out of a resolution recently carried by workmen employed at Canberra. They complain of the poor camping accommodation provided for workmen, the majority of whom have to live in 6 feet x 8 feet tents and bag humpies. They also call attention to the fact that a man who became ill at Redhill Camp, a distance of 2$ miles from the hospital, was charged 14s. for transport by the Canberra Commission ambulance. Will the Minister look into the complaints, and see if anything can be done to remedy them?",10
4,Mr MARR,Unknown,"If the honourable gentleman will give rue particulars of the complaints made, I shall have them inquired into, and furnish him with a reply at an early date.",10
5,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the Canberra Commission has practically reported that liquoT regulation at Canberra is a farce, when will the referendum of the residents of the Federal Territory be taken on the question of the sale of liquor there; and can the Prime Minister give the House any idea as to who will be considered permanent residents of the Territory?",10
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I recall to the honourable member's mind the fact that when this matter was dealt with in this Parliament the determination come to was that the local option poll for the Federal Territory area should be taken at such a time and upon such conditions and terms as the Parliament might determine after the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra.,10
7,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Has the Cabinet yet come to any decision regarding the offer of Messrs. Doulton and Coy. of a panel for the Federal Capital?,10
8,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The very generous offer made by Messrs. Doulton and Coy. has been considered by the Cabinet. It is believed that the panel offered might very suitably be incorporated in the war memorial to be erected at Canberra. The offer of the panel has been referred to the War Memorial Committee, but its reply has not yet been received. SITTINGS OF THEHOUSE .",11

Trade and Customs aware that big tim ber industries, and particularly milling industries, are suffering by reason of the large importation of timber from overseas? What steps is the honourable gentleman's department taking to see that the timber industry of Australia is given a chance of continued existence?  the timber industry in Australia is suffering very acutely from importations of timber from abroad. An inquiry extending over a very long time has been made into the conditions of the industry, and I understand that the inquiry was closed only yesterday. Many hundreds of sheets of evidence taken during the in quiry have to be considered. They will be considered as soon as possible by the Tariff Board, and the board's report will then be brought under the attention of the Government. BUTTER EXPORT. PROHIBITION OF PRESERVATIVES.",11

CONDITION OF CATTLE TRUCKS. - Mr LACEY asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I. Whether, in view of the complaints that have been made in connection with the cattle trucks used on the Commonwealth railways in South Australia, he will consider such complaints with a view to the construction of trucks so designed that they will prevent cattle being damaged.

22,Mr HILL,INTERNATIONA L ECONOMIC,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Every consideration has been given to complaints made in regard to Commonwealth railways cattle trucks used on the Oodnadatta railway. This type of truck was designed so that cattle could 'be carried over long distances in a hot climate with the least possible damage. A similar type of truck is in use on the Trans-Australian railway and in the railway systems of Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory, and millions of cattle have been carried over long distances in this type of truck for freezing and other purposes. Apparently the truckers on the Oodnadatta railway, being accustomed to the South Australian truck, have not yet realized the advantages of the Commonwealth design, which is new to them. is h t h is in for m at i o n 2. No. Our records show that no more deaths occur in the Commonwealth than in the old design of State truck. 3. The advice of experienced pastoralists was obtained before the design was brought into use, and it has given satisfaction elsewhere for CONFERENCE. a number of years. No cruelty or loss is in any way due to the design of the truck. However, so that no efforts might be spared to satisfy the users of the trucks, an experiment is being made by removing the side boards on some of the trucks so as to provide additional ventilation.

Has the Government of Papua power to issue licences to persons to perform survey ROYAL work dealing with the alienation and subdivision of land who have not passed the examination of the Federated Board of Surveyors of Australia and New Zealand? The following answers to these questions have been received from, the Government of Papua:2. The authorities only permit survey work to be performed by men gazetted as prescribed by the Real Property Ordinance 1913-1914. 3. Section 131 of the Eeal Property Ordinance 11)13-1014, which is similar to section 118 of the Queensland Real Property Act 1S61, provides ;that upon the application of any person producing a certificate of competency signed by the Chief Government Surveyor or other officer who may bo appointed for that purpose by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Registrar shall licence such person as a surveyor for the purposes of the Ordinance.

Debntp resumed from 8th March (vide page 195), on motion by Dr EARLE PAGEThat the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Charlton had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the word "" That "" b.e omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :-*' , in view of the State Governments' heavy financial responsibilities, the bill be withdrawn."" PAPEES. Mr LEY (Barton) [3.47] - Las t night we all enjoyed the forceful and eloquent utterance of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), who was good enough to prescribe a test to apply to the proposals of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), and also incidentally reminded us of two very great historical facts which he considered should be taken into consideration in the course of this debate. He suggested that the test to be applied Rules to the bill was whether it proposed a fair arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States; but I should say that the real test should be whether the proposal is fair to the people of the Commonwealth; because the aim. and end of all governments, whether State or Federal, No. should be the welfare and happiness of their citizens. Accepting the test which the right honourable gentleman, has suggested, I propose to apply it first to some of the arguments that have been offered by the Opposition; next, to the alternative suggested by the right honourable member for Balaclava; ancl, finally, to the proposals of the Treasurer. Let me take, first of all, the contention that the further, consideration of this matter should be deferred to a constitutional session to be held at some unmentioned date in the dim and distant future. I can understand such a suggestion ""from the Labour warty; but while it is the kind of bait that may catch political youngsters, I doubt whether it will catch grown men. The success of their effort to have postponed an item of government policy that ought to be carried into immediate effect would make the hearts of honourable members opposite rejoice. One could easily imagine them chuckling, and picture perspiring Labour orators on the platform telling their hearers that the delay in putting such an important proposal into operation was due not to any suggestion on their part that a constitutional session should be held, but solely to the incapacity of the Government to carry out its own programme. There is a more important reason why Labour members are endeavouring to prevent the passage of this bill. Por some time the Government has been engaged in the formulation of schemes for housing and national insurance, which are now nearing completion. Moreover, the Prime Minister has announced his intention to convene a conference of State Premiers in the hope of evolving a satisfactory scheme of child endowment. Honourable members opposite realise that if these proposals are enacted by the present Government, the Labour party will be robbed of a good deal of political capital at the next election. It is quite apparent from their speeches that they anticipate that the discontinuance of the per capita payments will strengthen the financial resources of the Commonwealth, and by postponing or defeating this measure they will restrict the capacity of the Government to carry out its policy. The interjections of protest from honourable members opposite suggest that I may be misjudging them. I have no wish to misjudge even the Labour party; but if I bave done so honourable members themselves are responsible, because in 1910 they fought determinedly to end the per capita payments. Now in 1327, however, they oppose similar legislation, because it is introduced by their political opponents. Honourable members opposite may be high-souled patriots, but even the angel Lucifer and his comrades fell a distance from grace. If their purpose in putting forward the amendment to delay the bill is not to make political capital for use at the next elections, what end do they expect to achieve ? The amendment implies, if it implies anything at all, that this Parliament cannot consider a realignment of the financial border between States and Commonwealth, apart from all the other changes in the Constitution that have been proposed from time to time. That view is to experience and common sense. The Labour Government in 1910 did not refer the Surplus Revenue Bill to a special session devoted exclusively to a general revision of the whole Constitution. That measure was dealt with in an ordinary session, and there is no reason why a related measure should not be considered now by this House apart from all proposed amendments of the Constitution.. The only question we have to consider is whether the proposal is in the interests of the Australian people. If it is, there is neither need nor justification for further delay. Another dilatory suggestion has been advanced from a different quarter. The Government is advised to withdraw the bill, drop its purpose entirely from their minds, and seek to establish harmonious relations with the State Premiers. When the representatives of the States have been brought into line, presumably the proposal may be revised. The gentleman who made that suggestion, and those who support it, are incurable optimists. The speech of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) recalled to my mind that, on a memorable occasion, the State Premiers took the initiative in this matter. He was then Premier of Victoria, and the late Mr Kidston was Premier of Queensland. Not often does Divine Providence place two men of such outstanding character in high administration positions at the same time. These two champions of the States attempted to bring their fellow Premiers into line. By the proposal they put forward, the States had everything to gain and nothing to lose- a prospect more calculated than anything else to stir men to action. The period of the Braddon "" b l o t "" had expired, ancl these worthy gentlemen feared that the States might cease to great enjoy a proportion of the Customs and excise revenue. They, therefore, approached the Commonwealth with the wise sort of proposal that one might expect from a man like the right honourable member for Balaclava. They sought to have their proposed per capita payments made a permanent provision of the Constitution. Their effort waB abortive. I repeat that the conjunction in high political office of two men of such outstanding qualities as the late Mr Kidston and the right honourable opposed member for Balaclava does not often occur, and in lesser humans the same in spiration is very rarely to be expected. Those who think that they can bring all the Premiers into line with Commonwealth Ministers expect too much. My experience as a member of a State Cabinet is that there is no prospect of State Ministers agreeing with Federal Ministers, because the States demand everything and are prepared to grant nothing. The position is rendered more, difficult when Labour governments are in office in the States. Only an optimist expects Labour Premiers to act in harmony with a Nationalist Prime Minister. I remind honourable members that already attempts have been made to induce the State Premiers to confer-upon this matter and come to an amicable arrangement. I was a member of a State cabinet at the time when such a proposal was made. I am not at liberty to disclose what I learnt in the Cabinet, but my experience was sufficient to convince me that it is impossible to get even State Nationalists into line with Federal Nationalists on a fifty-fifty basis. The only likely basis of agreement is for the Commonwealth to give, and ask for nothing in return. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than to get the State Premiers to atrree to this or any other scheme by which they will lose something they now enjoy. Those who suggested a further conference with the State representatives must know that, even if agreement were likely, such a course would involve considerable delay. If this scheme for the re-arrangement of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is for the benefit of the citizens of Australia as a whole, to postpone it for even three months would be to show callous indifference to the welfare of our constituents. I do not think that any honourable member would be consciously guilty of that, although such a construction might be placed on their attitude by the public. The right honourable member for Balaclava was too experienced a nolitician to endorse the proposal of the Labour party, so he suggested that the Treasurer should withdraw the bill and tackle something bigger! If there is anything bigerer than the enactment.of this measure in the face of the opposition that is offered to it, I do not know what it is. If the measure is worth passing, we should pass it at once; but if it is of no use, instead of postponing its consideration, we should scrap it altogether. The right honourable member for Balaclava last night, compared the proposal that he made to the States when he was Acting Prime Minister with that of the Treasurer. The present proposal can be shortly stated. The Treasurer proposes to discontinue the collection of moneys that are now handed over to the States in the form of per capita payments, and in lieu, thereof, to allow the States themselves to raise a similar amount of money by additional taxation. It is a perfectly simple proposition and not difficult of Mr hey. solution when one goes fully into the details. The Treasurer realizes that there must Be an interregnum between the time when the Commonwealth ceases to collect the taxation, and the time when the States impose and collect it. So that the States will not be penalized thereby, he has promised to continue the payments until the States themselves have provided the necessary legislation and machinery for collecting the tax. This wiil prevent the States from suffering in any way under the changed conditions. The right honourable member for Balaclava referred to his own proposal. Under his scheme the per capita pay-men t was to be reduced by 2s. 6d. each year until it reached the sum of 10s. and then, after the lapse of a short period, that amount also would cease to be paid to the States. The right honourable member said last night that the proposal of the Treasurer reminded him of sudden death by a surgical operation, without chloroform. The proposal of the right honourable member would ensure certain death, without anaesthetics, by slow torture; but this important' proposal ought not to be dismissed with spectacular displays of rhetoric. It is of serious concern to the country. If the Federal Treasurer's proposal were carried, what would be the position of the State Treasurer ? The whole transaction would be finished within a year or eighteen months, and during that time the attention of the people would bo focussed on the change. They would know that the readjustment of taxation forced upon the State Treasurer would be due entirely to the Commonwealth Government's refusal to act as a collecting agency for the States. The change, therefore, would not he used politically against him, because he would be in a position to explain clearly the reason for levying additional taxation, assuming, of course, that he did not propose to levy more than was necessary to compensate for the loss of the per capita payment. If the proposal of the right honourable member for Balaclava were adopted, I should not like to be a State Treasurer. Adjustments would be necessary every year, and public memory being short, any explanation by a .State Treasurer that additional taxation was necessary because of a change in financial relations brought about four or five years previously, would be received with suspicion. It would always be open to dishonest political opponents to misrepresent the position. In addition, the taxpayers would be irritated by continual annual increases in their assessments. I am certain that they would prefer a straight-out increase in taxation to one spread over several years, with the xjossibility of a new Treasurer imposing taxation in addition to that warranted by the discontinuance of the per capita payment. There arc other advantages possessed by the proposal of the Commonwealth Government. If the other proposal to extend the misery over a period of years were adopted, it would mean that the Federal authorities could not scrap their collecting agencies in the various States, nor could they effect a saving in any way equal to that anticipated under the present proposal. We should also have the spectacle of harassed State Treasurers and irritated taxpayers, without any effective saving in the Commonwealth administration. The present proposal is infinitely superior to that of the right honourable member for Balaclava. It is well known that the Constitution gives exclusive right to the Federal Parliament to impose Customs and excise duties, and to control the machinery for their collection. At the inception of federation, the only field of taxation open to the Commonwealth was that of Customs and excise. If that position existed today, there would be no problem of financial relationships to solve. Imagine for a moment what would have happened if the Commonwealth had not been forced into other fields of taxation. Any excess revenue beyond the Commonwealth's needs would manifestly have to be handed to the States for the benefit of the taxpayers who provided it.",13
31,Mr SCULLIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The ""vicious principle"" would still be there.",17
32,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,There is no vicious principle involved in handing excess revenue to the States. The honourable member has not a grip of the question at issue.,17
33,Mr SCULLIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,I am quoting the Treasurer's remarks.,17
34,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I - am not defending the Treasurer's remarks. I am concerned, not with his arguments, but with my own. If there were an excess of revenue, the States ought to have it. At the inception of the Commonwealth, it was estimated that, approximately, three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and excise would not be required by the Commonwealth, and it was arranged that, for a period, the excess should be paid to the States. The right honourable member for Balaclava reminded us last night ""that federation would have been impossible if thpse supporting it had insisted on the inclusion in the Constitution of a permanent provision that Customs and excise revenue should be returned to the States. Federation, therefore, does not rest upon the idea that for all time there should be a return of Customs revenue to the States; on the contrary, it rests, as the right honourable member for Balaclava reminded us, on the compromise that terminated the proposal to include in the Constitution a permanent provision of that character. The men of ability and foresight that gathered together in the Convention, and afterwards had the more difficult task of effecting a compromise to bring about federation, knew perfectly well that it might not always be possible to meet the expanding needs of the Commonwealth out of Customs and excise revenue.",17
35,Mr GREGORY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,It was originally provided that for all time three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue should go to the States.,17
36,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The honourable member has missed my point. In the Constitution framed by the Convention that provision was made; but, in order to bring about federation, there had to be a compromise, and, as the right honourable member for Balaclava clearly showed, federation was possible only with that compromise. The compromise was on the question of including a permanent provision in the Constitution for the return of Customs and excise revenue to the States, and the location of the Federal Capital. There was another feature that the right honourable member for Balaclava was good enough to call our attention to. He pointed out that he and Mr Kidston framed a proposal, to take the place of the ""Braddon blot,"" for a permanent return to the States of 2os. per head. But that proposal was rejected by the people, and the right honourable member did what I should have attempted to do if I had beeu in his place-h e belittled the - leeisiou. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) said that the decision was by a paltry majority of 25,000; and the right honourable member for Balaclava said that the question was not settled on its merits, but because the fortunes of Mr Fisher and his party wer<j vising, and those of the Liberals declining. If we could call from their tombs all the democrats between Julius Cajsar and Mr Lang, and interrogate them as to how majorities on plebiscites were obtained, they would say that it was because of the rising fortunes of this faction and the declining fortunes of that faction. It is useless to tell us that we must disregard a decision because the majority was only 25,000. abide by that decision. If the right honourable member had been on my side he would, in terms that it is impossible for mo to employ, have castigated any person who had dared to rise in a democratic assembly, and say that cision of the people, constitutionally registered, should be ignored. tempts were made to include this permanent provision in the constitution, and both failed: one because it was necessary to make a compromise in order --O effect federation, and the other because the people would not accept it . ""Whnt is the use of honourable members saying that we cannot pass this bill without interfering with the spirit of the Constitution ? The Constitution is based on the proposal that at some time the return to the States of part of the revenue derived f.rom Customs and excise should cease. But at what time? If we turn to the act passed by the Opposition party when it was in power, we find that the period expired seven years ago.",17
37,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The act says "" Or until Parliament otherwise provides.""",18
38,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"It was at least contemplated that at some time the arrangement would be terminated. It is immaterial to my argument what the period is; I am assuming that, because the people said that the arrangement was not to be peri.ianont, they contemplated that at soru'i time it should cease. so, at: what time should it ceaso? The opponents of this measure would have ns believe that; the revenue from. Customs and excise is not intended to be the primary f u n d for meeting the needs of the Commonwealth. I cannot understand any honourable member suggesting such a thing. Undoubtedly that fun d was looked upon from the commencement as being the f u n d out of which, if possible, the needs of the Commonwealth should be met; but unforeseen emergencies, some of them extremely unfortu nate, prevented that idea from being carried out. If it is the primary f u n d out of which the needs of the Commonwealth should be met, and if it is millions of pounds less than is necessary to meet the needs of the Commonwealth, then it is an exhausted f u n d , and there is no excess to hand over to the States. How, then, can honourable members We must justify the maintenance at the public expense of a large, elaborate, and costly bookkeeping system to divide between seven governments a f u n d that is not sufficient for one of them? Such a proposal is like the peace that ""passeth all underthe de- standing."" There is no chance of bringing about a reduction of taxation, which Two at- is the reform most desired by the people, if we maintain departments merely for the purpose of solemnly dividing among seven governments funds that are not sufficient for one of them. If the Customs and excise revenue is millions of pounds short of what is necessary for the needs of the Commonwealth, common sense dictates that we should cease dividing the fund . If an honourable member does not take the unusual view that 25s. out of that fund has n peculiar value not attached to any similar amount, I cannot understand why ho wishes, at great expense to the Commonwealth and the States, to divide the Customs revenue. If that revenue should be millions short, the Commonwealth could take the whole of it , thereby saving the taxpayers all the expense of maintaining the costly bookkeeping system now in operation. That is one saving that could be effected, and, because of the advantage that the public would derive from it , I support this bill . Any person who clamours for a reduction in taxation, and calls upon the Government to do something to remedy the financial If that be aftermath of the war, and yet declines to support the bill, displays a lack of business acumen. At the 1923 Conference between Federal and State mini sters there was no difference of opinion between the State Premiers about handing over the Customs and excise revenue to the Commonwealth. The conference carried a motion agreeing to the adoption of that course on the condition that the Commonwealth withdrew from the field of income taxation. I remind honourable members opposite that although I was not present at that conference, I was kept well informed of its proceedings. I have had considerable parliamentary and ministerial experience, and at that time. I was a member of the South Wales Government. The Premiers at that time saw the effect of the Commonwealth continuing to divide the Customs revenue between seven authorities at considerable expense and without benefit to anybody, and realized that the States could raise the same amount of money from othor sources. But they wanted to drive the Commonwealth out of the field of income taxation, and that was the cause of the dispute which is still i u progress. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",18
39,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,I ask honourable members who are cheering me so helpfully to tell the House later whether they approve of the Commonwealth quitting altogether the field of income taxation.,19
40,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Taxatio n of the incomes of individuals, certainly. I am prepared to take that platform tomorrow.",19
41,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Nobod y is more anxious than I am to see the Federal Government retire from that field, because I know it would result in a reduction of the financial burden of the people. But, suppose the Government was able within six months so to arrange its affairs as to enable i l to abandon, at all events for the present time, the raising of new revenue by income taxation, could anybody foresee what might happen tomorrow, let alone four years hence ? As we cannot lift the veil of the future we should be foolish legislators, indeed, to abandon the right to re-enter, in a case of great national emergency, the field of direct taxation. The Commonwealth must reserve to itself the .right to go into that field again, although we hope that it may never have occasion to do so. comply with the present demands of the States would be inimical to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The proper way in which to distribute between the Commonwealth and the States the revenue derived from income taxation is a matter of opinion. The Treasurer may say that the Commonwealth should retain 60 per cent, and the States have the remaining 40 per cent.; others may favour a distribution on a fifty-fifty basis. 1, personally, may feel disposed to curtail the Federal revenue from that source in order to compel the Government to live within its income for the benefit of the taxpayers. Whatever the decision on the New point may be, the Commonwealth must reserve to itself the right to re-enter the field of income taxation, should a great national emergency necessitate it . That is precisely the question now in dispute between the States and the Commonwealth. If the Customs revenue at any time becomes greater than the needs of the Commonwealth, the surplus should be handed back to the States. It is clear that the Commonwealth could raise all the revenue it now requires in the field of Customs and income taxation, and, so far as the Government can see, for some year ahead. Then why compel it to expend money in maintaining the machinery necessary for collecting land tax, estate duties and entertainments tax? Nothing could be more farcical or indefensible. So long us this system continues the men who oppose its abolition are making it impossible for themselves or anybody else to reduce taxation. Take the land tax for instance. Just as in the Commonwealth sphere it is appropriate that certain taxes should be raised and distributed by the Federal Government, so the States, who control the land, ought to have the sole power, except in some great national emergency, to levy taxes upon the land, and expend the money raised in that way. Let me point out to those wizards of finance, or incurable pessimists, who say that if this bill is carried the States must become bankrupt, that New South Wales could raise sufficient revenue by way of land tax to meet all the State Government's expenditure in that part of the Commonwealth. The estate duty is another tax that, possibly, might be left to the States, since To they have the machinery required for its collection, and the rate of tax could be increased without increasing the cost of collection. Now, when there are assets in one State only, both a State and a Commonwealth return must be submitted. The lawyers benefit-though I do not mind but Ave should consider also the expense to the community that could be avoided by abolishing the double taxing It would be quite as easy for the Labour Premiers, whose views were probably expressed by the honourable member Dalley (Mr Theodore), to turn aside for once from increasing railway and fares, and so adding to the burden of the primary producers, and give their attention to beneficiaries who get from large legacies that for which they have not worked. Why should not these persons pay a bigger contribution to the cost of government out of the handsome that they receive, but have not earned? They could well afford to do it, and should do so, seeing that the money would go to maintain conditions which make it possible for them to live in happiness and comfort. Personally, I should like to see the entertainment tax abolished. Treasuries which after the passage of this bill would collect it could easily recoup themselves for the amount by increasing the death duties. Every year that we delay dealing with this matter costs those who provide the taxes and maintain the Commonwsalth well over £100,000 hard cash as well as incalculable I cannot understand why anybody should oppose a measure which is designed to give such great relief to so many people. Those who do not think anything saving £100,000 a year trusted to reduce taxation. It is the man who looks after the pennies who makes reduction possible. If the shows that he is trying to reduce the burdens of the taxpayers, he is entitled to our encouragement and support. often heard Labour orators tell their audiences that the rich man always passes on increased taxation to the poor man. They point out that the merchant creases the cost of clothing, boots, and shoes, and the land-owner increases rents to cover extra taxation. I am neither affirming nor denying that this is so; I am merely repeating what I have heard frequently preached from Labour forms. It is also said that the lawyers pass on increased taxation by increasing Mr Ley. their charges. I know that that is so. It may be admitted, however, that increased taxation does f all upon the underdog, that- though in what proportion I cannot say. In these circumstances, I remind honourable members opposite that if they reauthority. fuse to lighten taxation, they are merely continuing the sufferings of the underdog. If the Labour party of today puts for the advantage that it may gain in embarrassing the Government by opposing freights this measure before its desire to help the workers of the country, whether they be the men who toil as primary producers in the field, or as miners in the bowels of the earth, or as tradesmen, or sweat in our factories, they are not following the good example that their party set in 1910. If they maintain gifts their opposition to this measure, one can only conclude that their concern for political advantage is greater than their concern for the working people whom, we are always being told, they represent.",19
42,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Eeid) [3.35] - This The bill has already been exhaustively and severely criticised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr . Scullin), the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore)j the rierhfc honourable member for Balain clava (Mr W at t ) and other honortrouble. able members whose arguments I do not intend to repeat. I wish to refer to the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Barton (Mr L e y ) . In the course of his remarks the honorof able member said that the bill was hard cannot be enough to j u s t if y",20
43,Mr LEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I did not say that.. Treasurer Mr COLEMAN - That is what I understood the honourable member to say. If he. did not say that, he said that his arguments in favour of it were hard I have to justify. However the honourable member put it , I entirely agree with him. The honourable member told us repeatedly during his speech that inhe was a lawyer, and it struck me that if ever we have had an example of special pleading in this Chamber, he has been guilty of it today. His attitude reminds one of the scribes and Pharisees who, according to the Scriptures, platstrained at the gnat but swallowed the camel. I well remember that the honourable member was associated with a certain Government in New South. Wales which protested vociferously against the proposal of this Commonwealth Government to abandon the - per capita payments, and ultimately accepted the Prime Minister's decisions, like the States, only under duress. negotiations on "" that occasion have been full y discussed during this debate, and it is quite apparent that the various State Governments were forced to accept the Government's financial proposals so that they might submit an alternative. The honourable member for Barton comes into this House with a somewhat shattered reputation, from his party's stand-point, as an authority of what is right, if one may judge by his attitude towards liquor traffic legislation, and the subsequent Ne. Temere measure, which were dealt with in the New South Wales Parliament during his term as Minister. I have no desire to discuss at length the political record of the honourable member; but the speech he has just delivered indicated throughout that he had no real f a it h in this bill, and did not believe 1 its principles. The honourable member should have contributed a logical. and well-considered speech on the measure, instead of which he gave expression to a tissue of vague and nebulous generalities. A great part of his address was occupied by a consideration of' the financial proposals made by the right, honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) in 1919, but that is not the subject now before honourable members. posal might have been justified by the circumstances that existed in 1919. When the right honourable member for Balaclava submitted it to the State Premiers, he pointed out that the abatement of per capita was necessary because the Commonwealth has reached its limit, and could not continue to provide the revenue necessary to make them. He stated that the Commonwealth was carrying tremendous burdens arising from its war commitments, and that, on account of the higher protective duties which were being imposed at that time, there must be a diminution of Customs revenue. In all the circumstances, the right honourable member said that he feared for the solvency of the Commonwealth if the existing arrangements were continued. Events since have not justified those anticipations. Since then, on account of the inadequate protective policy of this Government, the Customs revenue has increased other to an alarming and even a disThe astrous extent from the point of view of Australian industries. However, the manner in which the right honourable member submitted his proposal on that occasion was in direct contrast to the manner in which this Government has approached this vita l subject. On that occasion the proposals were put forward in a courteous and conciliatory fashion, and the Treasurer of the day indicated that he was prepared to listen to argument and alternative schemes. On this occasion, as has been repeatedly stated in the course of this debate, th» Commonwealth has placed a gun at the head of the States, and adopted a stand-and-deliver attitude. The action of the Government in making this a vital party measure is iniquitous and immoral, because the question is one in which this Parliament should examine from the stand-point of the national welfare of Australia. It is obvious from the discussion in the chamber and within the precincts of the House that a number of Government supporters would, if it were not for the activities. of the party Whip, vote against the Government on this question. Mr E . RILEY - So would the honourable member for Barton.. That pro- Mr COLEMAN - Yes ; that honourable gentleman possesses such an easy legal conscience that in different circumstances he might oppose the bill. A number of Government supporters, including many with extensive adminispayments trative experience and financial knowledge and ability, such as that possessed taxable by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , have declared their opposition to the bill. Some honourable members on this side of the chamber have said that whilst they, do not agree with the political views of that honourable member, they recognize that his long' political service in State and Federal politics makes him an authority whose opinion must be treated with a great deal of respect. It was obvious that the speech of the right honourable member, which was delivered in a non-party manner, yet was so lightly referred to by the honourable member for Barton, made a profound impression upon every one, and undoubtedly enhanced the reputation and prestige of the right honourable gentleman. There are other honourable members who have had experience in Federal and State politics who also realise that complex financial problems are encountered in carrying on the responsibilities of government. There are others on the Government benches who will shortly, I believe, have the courage to denounce the Government in this matter; but there are some who evidently lack the necessary moral courage when matters of grave importance come before the House to freely state their opinions, who merely interject, but do not contribute any constructive suggestions for the consideration of honourable members. The Treasurer may be likened to a political Delilah, who has seduced Samson Bruce from the principles he enunciated a few years ago, and has delivered him unto the hands bf the Country party Philistines, because, in 1922, the Prime Minister declared that the per capita payment could not be abandoned under the existing constitutional circumstances. Should the Government successfully emerge with a small majority from the division on this bill its prestige will be irretrievably damaged, not only in the House, but throughout the Commonwealth, and it would appear that before long Samson Bruce will bring the Nationalist Government to ruin. The assumption underlying the proposal to withdraw from the field of direct taxation is that the revenue derived from Customs and excise will continue on the present basis.  the States.",20
44,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"If the honourable member who has just interjected gets his way, we may some day have a free trade government in power, when our Customs revenue, apart from J mrely revenue duties, would immeliately vanish. Unless we resorted to a purely revenuo tariff on a low scale, the Commonwealth Parliament would be compelled to re-enter the fields of taxation which it is now proposed to vacate. We have to visualize what may happen in years to come if this Parliament vacates the fields of taxation which the Constitution specifically provides that it may operate in, and in which the Constitution concedes a plenary power. It has been said that the withdrawal of the per capita payment is contrary to the spirit of Ihe Constitution, and that the collection of taxes by the States in the spheres which the Commonwealth proposes to vacate will be rendered very difficult. The honourable member for Barton, who said it would be quite easy for the States to collect the taxation now collected by the Commonwealth has overlooked a vital point stressed by the right honourable member for Balaclava, the honourable member for Yarra, and other honourable members on this side of Lhe chamber. There are practical difficulties in the way. There are, for instance, elective Upper Houses in some of the States whose constitutional powers are so extensive that they can control the situa tion. The honourable member for Barton has also overlooked one difficulty that has already been alluded to-the collection of taxation on aggregated incomes. As an ex-State Minister and a lawyer, he should know that there are insuperable difficulties-legal , constitutional, political, and administrative-in the way of the States taxing aggregated incomes. In such States as Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia, the elective Upper Houses will control the situation, and reject proposals for increased taxation, even when the States are handicapped by deficits, and are unable to secure sufficient revenue to meet the cost of government. Those Governments will then be forced to take the line of least resistance.",22
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Does the honourable member suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament should determine the incidence of taxation for the State Parliaments ?,22
46,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am dealing with the difficulties that will be created for the State Parliaments by the Commonwealth vacating the field of land taxation, and I also mentioned the jiosition that will arise in connection with the aggregation of incomes.",22

It cannot be gainsaid that land taxation is a powerf u l instrument in the breaking up of big estates.",22

49,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Despit e that interwork, jection, the Treasurer must recognize that land taxation has played an i m - saysportant part in the breaking up of extensive country estates. It is likely that the governments of the States w i l be compelled to adopt the line of least resistance, and to increase railway States, freights in order to escape deficits. chapter What will be the position of honourable members of the Country party, who so of glibly advocate this proposal of the upon' Government, if the withdrawal of the the per capita payment results in the primary producers having to pay greater railway fares and freights? There can be no doubt that those who vote for specific this proposal will be responsible if i found impossible for the States to the make good the loss caused by the counted withdrawal of the per capita payin the same direction. ment by the imposition of a land There tax, and they are compelled to increase railway freights. I contend that Commonwealth has neither a moral nor ment of federation. a strictly legal right to make available Commonwealth funds for the construcin tion of roads, the provision of wire netting, or the establishment of a houscomencement ing scheme. At the present time millions of pounds are being so expended, but constitutional difficulty is avoided by money being handed over to the States in the way of financial assistance. Constitution never contemplated Commonwealth's embarking on a housing as follows: scheme, the making of wire netting In grants, or the construction of roads. SecAgainst tion 51 sets out the functions, duties, obligations of the Commonwealth, many of which have never been exercised. the petrol tax case, which was decided recently by the High Court of Australia, the issue was, not whether the Commoncence wealth had the constitutional power to build roads, but whether it had the power to render, financial assistance to the States in any for m it deemed fit. that point the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth was technically right in the action which it took.",23
50,Mr WATT,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,It was a very unfortunate judgment.,23
51,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The Commonwealth has no constitutional power to itself undertake the construction of roads. If it attempted to do so the States could challenge the validity of its action. In his The Com.monufeal.lh of Australia Constitution, Professor Harrison Moore In the Commonwealth the proceeds of taxation are not the unqualified property of the Commonwealth Government; they are subject l to the provision of the Constitution whereby "" surplus revenue"" belongs to the several and, in fact, a considerable part of IV . of the Constitution is devoted to the adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. This right the States at once suggests a limitation the objects of appropriation, and gives States a locus standi for challenging appropriations which may appear ultra vires. The power of the Commonwealth to appror priate money is no exception to the rule that the Commonwealth Government is one of and not general powers. Section 90, authorizing financial assistance to any State, t is and section 105, providing for taking over public debts of the States, may be acfor independently, but at least point was a specific direction in the Constitution that the Commonwealth should the take over State debts at the commenceThe people of Australia, at a referendum which was held 1910, amended that provision by agreeing to the deletion of the words, "" at the of federation,"" and tjhus reaffirmed and emphasized this constituthe tional provision. That is the only imthe portant referendum proposal tlhati has been agreed to since the establishment ot The the Commonwealth. It was carried by an the overwhelming majority, the voting being favour of taking over State debts 715,000 .. .. .. .. 580,000 and That was a clear mandate to the Commonwealth Government to deal with this In vexed question. Instead of devoting it3 time to vote-catching devices, and adopting the role of a government of magnifiand political philanthropy, this Government would be better advised if it gave its attention to the problem of the constantly increasing burden of State On debts. When the Treasurer is faced with these questions, his answer invaluably is that they are contingent upon his having a surplus. It is surprising that, when an election is in progress, the honourable gentleman can always claim to have shown a surplus in his management of the finances of the Commonwealth. If the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth were properly dealt with, and the money which is now spent on housing, wire netting and roads were not disbursed, a tremendous surplus could always he obtained, and the Commonwealth would be constitutionally compelled to return it to the States under the direction which is - contained in section 94, and readsAfter five years from the imposition form duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been enabled to evade that legal claim because each successive Treasurer has so arranged his accounts that there has hot been any surplus revenue. Clearly the financial clauses of the 'Constitution contain a legal direction to the (Government to grapple with the problem of States' debts. I shall not deal further with that matter. Why does the Government not proceed with urgent legislative work, such as the tariff items that were tabled in this House last year? A number of industries are being slowly strangled, and are beseeching this Parliament to succour and assist them. Child endowment, also, is a burning question, and occupied a foremost place in the platform of the Government at the last election. Where are those proposals ? Where are the other fulsome and flowery promises that were made by the Prime Minister during the last election campaign ? Actually we have had Parliament closed down for six months to enable the right honourable gentleman to go abroad and emulate his great pxemplar, Don Quixote, by tilting at windmills in Great Britain, America, and elsewhere, and coming back from a conference with nothing accomplished other than a number of pious resolutions that mean nothing. The people of Australia arc losing patience with this Government because of its dilatoriness in dealing with some of the social problems with which it is confronted. There is no justification in pre-election pledges for this measure. Mr Coleman. Nor is there any justification for it in public opinion at the moment. But there is a clamant demand, throughout the Commonwealth that our industries shall not be allowed to die, that our social problems, including child endowment, national insurance, and other vital subjects, shall be dealt with. The Government, by its arrogance and its attitude in regard to this bill and other proposals, and by the manner in which it has handled public business during the past eighteen months, has created the difficulties with which it is beset. We all remember the deportation proceedings ancl the referenda bungle. Everything of unithat this Government has touched it has mismanaged, and, unfortunately, it has involved the people of Australia in the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds by these bungles. The policy of the Government ever since it assumed office after the last election has been to put the cart before the horse. Its chief stock-in-trade appears to be bluff, bounce, bluster, and bombast when it comes to the presentation of important proposals of this kind. The Prime Minister would appear to be suffering from a form a megalomania as a result of junketing abroad. Becently we had the spectacle of the right honourable gentleman speaking to the people of the Mother Country with all the airs of a dictator or an emperor. Now he comes to this House ancl reintroduces this measure in a speech which, it cannot be suggested, had anything of definite clarity about it. He adopts the role of an egotist, as when a few months ago he asked the people not to let him down. This bill is a proposal to let the people of Australia down. The Government would be wise to drop it.  - I listened with interest to the several speakers who have taken part in the debate, and I have to confess that many honourable members have handled this intricate problem with marked ability. I cannot help being impressed, however, with the fact that, with the exception of one who may be looked upon as an oracle since he has not yet committed himself, none of the Nationalists or Country party members representing New South Wales have spoken against the measure. Country members and Nationalists from both that State and Queensland are on the side of the Government. It is remarkable that in those two great States, which have had experience of Labour rule, the opinion is almost unanimously against the view expressed by Labour representatives in this Parliament. The position is different in Victoria. This State has never had experience of Labour rule. It has never been under the heel of Labour in the same sense as the two northern States have been. Consequently they view this bill in a different light. The time may come-the Lord send that it does not-whe n Victoria, as a result of bitter experience of Labour rule will wake up and come into line with the northern States on measures such as this.",23
52,Mr SODLLIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Is that the motive of the bill?  it is. But that, at all events is one reason why I am supporting the bill. I have no hesitation in saying that the adoption of this measure will protect Australia should Labour get to power in the Commonwealth. There appears to be a split amongst the representatives in South Australia, but Western Australian members appear to be fairly strongly against the bill.",25
53,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"There is no split in South Australia.  honourable friend will be surprised when the vote is taken. However, there is no split amongst our friends from Western Australia, though that State will benefit from the bill. Members from that State have told us that they are prepared to row their own canoe. Consequently they are opposing this bill. When the Main Roads Bill was before this House the same honourable gentlemen declared that Western Australia did not want money for main roads. That act, I remind them, benefited Western Australia to the oxtent of £1,500,000 at the expense of the eastern States. It is worth remembering also that the Western Australian Government did not wait for the constitutionality of the Commonwealth main roads proposals to be tested in the Court, but signed it immediately. It is almost impossible in the debate on such a measure as this to avoid traversing ground covered by previous speakers; but 1 do not propose to do that at any length. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) last night simplified the position by certain important admissions. He admitted that the States, in their opposition to the abolition of the per capihi. payments, were not standing on their moral rights. He said also that they did not depend upon their legal rights, aud that he did not regard the bill as a contravention of the federal spirit. Other speakers have referred to what is known as the Braddon "" blot."" Although I was not in public life at the time, I remember the controversy that waged around the insertion of that section of the Constitution. (The Commonwealth commenced by taking over a number of departments, including the Defence Department, which it had to finance, the Postal Department, which more or less financed itself, and the Department of Trade and Customs; and the arrangement was that, after paying the expenses of these departments, the Commonwealth would hand back to the States three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue. Some of the States, including New South Wales, at the inception of federation had an old-age pension scheme in operation. Consequently when the Commonwealth Government became reS2)onsible for invalid and old-age pension payments throughout Australia, those States that had schemes in ^operation benefited considerably, because they were relieved of taxation to meet their charity votes. In the course of time it was found that the Postal Department was becoming more expensive, and that the Commonwealth was obliged to enter into other obligations, including the construction of the East-West railway, which was regarded as an integral part of the agreement with the State of Western Australia. Mr E. EILEY - The East-West line cost the Government nothing; it was built out of the profits from the note issue.  monwealth Government a good deal of money, and is costing a considerable amount in interest today. The making of the Federal Capital in New South Wales also cast a heavy financial burden upon the Commonwealth. Because of these various demands upon its resources, this Parliament had need of more of the revenue it raised, and a payment of 25s. per capita to the States was substituted for the distribution of surplus revenue uuder the Braddon "" blot."" When the capitation payment was agreed to, the Commonwealth had practically, no debts, but because of direct war loaus and post war obligations to the soldiers, and the increase of the invalid and old-age pensions, it accumulated a debt of about £400,000,000. This Parliament would have been justified in discontinuing the payments to the States immediately after the war. However, the country was blessed with a series of good seasons, and both wool and wheat sold at high prices in the overseas market. Because of the general prosperity of the country aud the increase of Customs duties, from time to time, the Commonwealth has had sumcient revenue to pay its way. That condition may not obtain tomorrow, and the Government is well advised to look to the future. If the per capita payments are withdrawn, the States will become more self-reliant. Some honourable members have pleaded for the independence of the States. They will be far more independent when they are self-supporting than they are today. No State can be said to be independent which each year looks to this Parliament for a charitable vote. The fields of direct taxation now harvested by the Commonwealth are open to the States, and I predict that if Commonwealth revenues are withheld from the States, and State Governments have the responsibility of raising the revenues they spend, the people will take a livelier interest in local politics. I listened with much pleasure to the speech of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore). His record, as Premier and Treasurer of Queensland for many years, is largely responsible for the presence of so many Nationalist and Country party members in this Parliament. Yet the honourable member had the temerity to lecture this House on finance. Certainly his speech was very temperate and quite different from what I had expected of him. I compliment him on the tone of his address, but its value is discounted by the facts annually disclosed regarding the finances of Queensland. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) also held  office as Premier and Treasurer in a State Parliament. It is unfortunate that some honourable members, when they enter Federal politics, bring the atmosphere of the State Parliament with them. They forget that they have exchanged parochial politics for wider and more important fields of legislation. This applies particularly to honourable members who formerly were State Premiers or Treasurers. I also was a member of a State Parliament, but, uot having been a minister, the taint of parochialism does not seem to have stuck to me. I recollect that after the Premiers' Conference, in Melbourne, in 1933, Sir Arthur Cocks, the then Treasurer of New South Wales, was very bitter in his denunciation of the Commonwealth Government. He said that the figures submitted to the conference by the Federal Treasurer were wrong. Summarized, his grievance seemed to be that the Federal Treasurer had said that the Commonwealth Government's scheme would benefit New South Wales to the extent of £500,000 per annum, whereag, according to Sir Arthur Cocks' reckoning, ""the benefit would be only £499,999. Unfortunately, the Cabinet supported him, although the speech of the honourable member for .Barton who was a member of that ministry, indicated that ministers were not unanimous. It is a pity that the Commonwealth's proposals in 1923 were not accepted. What objection can there be to the Commonwealth vacating a certain sphere of taxation and allowing the States the exclusive right to collect in it? The persons from whom the States will collect are those from whom the Commonwealth collects now, but, unfortunately, owing to the confusion of Commonwealth and State finance*-the Commonwealth collecting money which the States expendblame is often placed on the innocent party. Mr Allan, the Premier of Victoria, in his policy speech a few days ago, said that, if the per capita payments are discontinued, the Victorian Parliament will be required to increase its income tax collections by £2,150,000. The contribution of that sum should not be very hurtful to the taxpayers of Victoria, becauso the Federal Treasurer has announced that Commonwealth taxation to a corresponding amount at least will be repealed or reduced. The proposal now before us is that the readjustment taxation shall be the subject of a conferspirit of federation. ence between representatives of the Oomthe monwealth and the States before the of the next financial year. It is my honest conviction that the Federal of calculation. Treasurer should endeavour to withdraw entirely from the field of income taxabearing tion. Such a step would be in the indiscussion. terests of the taxpayers. I notice that the Evening News, of Sydney, which is bitterly opposed to the present Commonwith wealth Government in regard to many matters, said in a recent leading articleWe have no objection to ending the capitation payments to the States and leaving each goveniment the raising of its own venue. That is my view, aud I cannot understand why there should be any opposition to such an eminently sane proposal, especially as the States already have operation machinery for the collection of income taxation. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) and one of the Melbourne newspapers view with alarm the prospect of the Victorian Commonwealth treasury bench. Parliament having to collect an additional £2,150,000 of income taxation. They wonder whence the money is to come. If Victoria is ever afflicted with a government like that led by Mr Lang in New South Wales, or that formerly led by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) in Queensland, it will realise how easy it is to get an extra £2,150,000 from the people. Mr Lang is annoyed because he has not been able to secure the passage of a bill that increase the burden of taxation in Sou th Wales by £7,000,000.",25
54,Mr CHARLTON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The honourable memtion ber for Barton said that the money return could be obtained from the land.  evidently thinks so, too. The founders of federation, who were undoubtedly able and far-seeing statesmen, predicted that Melbourne the Commonwealth would cost the people not more than 2s. 6d. per head, ""the. for the registration of a clog."" In light of later events, we know that those statesmen could not see so very far ahead. against In any case, the Australian people are tions were:not bound for all time by what was done by the fonnders of the federation in the Federation. light of the knowledge they then of possessed. We hear much talk of the But, during ordinary natural growth of Australia, end conditions have altered. Apart from that, the great war upset all old bases The present Commonwealth Government has been very forein regard to the matter now under Twelve months ago this proposal was brought before Parliament, and I believe that had it been proceeded then very little outcry would have beeu raised, even in Victoria, but as the days go by opposition to it seems to increase, and today it is viewed with alarm to by many people. I am unable to underrestand the opposition of the Labour party to the bill. When we find honourable members opposite defending State rights we have reason to be suspicious. More difficult to understand is the antagonism in of the Melbourne press. Any government that is persistently attacked by the press must eventually fall, and I warn the newspapers of Victoria that they are paving the way for Labour control of the That happened in New South Wales politics. The newspapers attacked the Nationalist Government continuously until the eve of the general election, when they had to eat their words, and say to the electors, '"" Vote for the Nationalists; do not vote for Labour."" But for three years they had been working for the Labour party by poisoning the minds of the electors, ancl the eleventh hour antidote was too late. Prior to the recent by-election in would the electorate of Dalley, one Sydney Newnewspaper was constantly attacking the Bruce Government, but when the extraordinary vacancy occurred, and an elecwas imminent, that journal had to to its Nationalist colours in order to oppose the Labour candidate, and once more the present Prime Minister became, for the time being, a hero. This dangerous inconsistency is a feature of the newspapers also. The attitude of the Morning Post surprises me, fee but it seems to have been able to sumthe marize under twelve headings all that could be said in this House in a fortnight this bill. That journal's objec1. It is a contravention of the spirit of That objection has been well answered by the honourable members for Balaclava and Barton. 2. It is a denial of the State's moral rights. The supporters of the bill have denied that, but an opponent of it , the right honourable member for Balaclava, stated emphatically that the States have no moral right to the continuance of the per capita payments. 3. It dishonours the basic agreement made when essential services were transferred. There may be something in that contention, but my opinion is that all agreements made in regard to the transfer of essential services have been honourably observed by the Commonwealth. 4. It contradicts the 1922 Brisbane speech of Mr Bruce as Treasurer. I do not know what the right honourable gentleman said in Brisbane in 1922, but since that time a general election has been held, much water under the political bridge, the circumstances today tirely different from those obtained then. 5. It was not included in the policy speech at the last Federal elections. That may be a fair argument as coming from the Morning Post, but I am not prepared to accept it as an argument from members of the Opposition, who support a government that abolished the Upper House in Queensland in defiance of the voice of the people. Por years past in Queensland and New South Wales the will of the people has been flouted. G. It is not a financial necessity. 7. It does not provide an equitable recompense to the States. I remember seeing in a Sydney paper a picture of a number of sucking pigs enjoying themselves. Some of the larger ones had more fighting than the smaller ones, and were thus able to obtaii. more than their fair share of nourishment. Those pigs were supposed to represent the States of this and although it was not a prettv jt was to some extent true. Braddon clause was included Constitution it was necessary the wants of the infant States be satisfied; but when it was deleted, and the payment to the States reduced to 25s. per head, a weaning  process was started. Now that the States have reached manhood, they should be weaned entirely, and allowed to conduct their own affairs. It is proposed to give them the right to govern themselves. They have said that the Federal Government is stealing their rights, but, as a matter of fact, it is trying to give their rights back to them, to give them the right to raise all their taxation instead of only part of it , and to make them more autonomous. 8. It will deprive Viotoria of £2.150,000 per annum. It will not deprive Victoria of £2,150,000. It might similarly be said that it will deprive New South Wales of £3,000,000 per annum, and South Australia of about £1,000,000 per annum. Those States will merely be deprived of the opportunity of obtaining the money from us, and will be given the opportunity of collecting it has run themselves. and 9. It will place the State Government in the are enodious position of having to raise this amount by taxation. that If , for all their schemes, the States had to collect money directly from the people, half the experimental legislation now in dulged in would not be attempted, and half the mistakes now made would be avoided.",27
55,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Would it not be well to have the same check upon the Federal Government ?  that is not now under consideration. The Treasurer showed last June that the people of Victoria would benefit under this proposal to the amount of from £80,000 to £100,000. The Commonwealth pronews- poses to abandon more in taxation than the States will have to collect. Naturally the State Treasurers want as much easy strength money as they can get. There is no doubt as to what would be the result of taking a vote on this question in the Queensland, New South country, Wales, or Victorian Parliament. In the picture, Victorian Parliament the Labour memWhen the bers and Nationalists have unanimously in the declared that they do not want this that measure; but I have no doubt that the should people, if we took a plebiscite, would not range themselves behind the politicians, was who have an axe to grind. The man in the street is not worrying about this issue. I have had a chat with a few citizens of Victoria, and find that they honestly admit that they do not know anything about it. One man said that he did not know ""what was wrong with the Melbourne press. "" We have,"" he added, "" a Victorian Prime Minister and five Victorians in the Ministry, and I do not see why this State should be dissatisfied."" He said he was prepared to trust Bruce, and did not want any dictation from the press. I spoke to half a dozen men who do not know thing about the measure, and are not interested in it, but are prepared to follow the Prime Minister. The higher one goes in political circles, the more opposition one finds to the bill. State Premiers nnd Treasurers regard the proposal as serious; but it is not serious. 10. It will probably force the State Government to resort to indirect taxation. There is no doubt about that, and it will also force the Commonwealth Government to abandon a certain amount of taxation-and the man in the street will be as well off as he was before. It looks to me like tweedledum and tweedledee. 11. It does not win the unanimous sympathy of the Federal Government. That may be so. It has not the unanimous sympathy of members of this House. Iu fact, few bills brought down by the Government are unanimously supported by this House. 12. It is a measure so far-reaching that should be referred to the people. I fail to agree with that. It does not matter to the taxpayer whether he pays taxes out of his right-hand or his lefthand pocket, whether he pays them to the Federal Treasurer or to a State Treasurer, or whether ho pays them in the form of income tax or in some other less direct way. The peopio can stand only a certain amount of taxation, in whatever form it is levied. The people of the States will take more interest in politics when they know which Government is pinching them; they will become more alive to their own interests, and on election day will vote accordingly. I congratulate the editor of the Morning Post on being able to compress into a nutshell the speeches that have taken four or five days to deliver in this chamber. Another Melbourne newspaper is very strong in its opinions. Yesterday, four or five good speeches were delivered by honourable members. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) was reported in black type, and after him "" the Minister also spoke,"" although the Minister's speech was equally worthy of publication. One argument that has been used is that the road-making grant is similar in principle to the per capita payment, and that if one is abolished the other should be abolished also. I do not regard them as similar. The Government is building any- a railway in northern New South Wales, and is subsidizing the State of New South Wales in the carrying out of that groat national work. In South Australia the Government is building the great NorthSouth line, and to that extent is subsidizing the Government of Soutli Australia. Later I hope the Commonwealth will come to the assistance of the States in the work of unifying the railway gauges. We cannot expect Victoria, although it is a prosperous and comparatively thickly populated State, to tear up its railway lines and convert them at its own expense to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. The roads of this country are a national asset, and belong to the nation as a - whole, rather than to the separate States. That is why this Government provides money for roads. Even if the States come to an agreement with the Commonwealth as to the taxes that the Commonwealth should abandon, special provision will it still have to be made to assist Western Australia and Tasmania. It is impossible to link together the money to be spent on roads and the taxation that the Commonwealth proposes to abandon. 1 congratulate the Treasurer on this proposal; and if the States administer their affairs honestly and straightforwardly, the result will be beneficial to them.",28
56,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Adelaide) [4.37] - We have heard somo good speeches on this bill, but those in opposition to the proposals of the Government contain the better logic. The proposal to terminate the per capita payments has been well heralded, and I am not one of tliose who say that the Commonwealth has* not given the States notice that something of the kind must be done. The change must be made, but whether it is proposed in the right form is the question that is agitating the minds of the community. It has been stated by some of those who have opposed the scheme, that it is "" unification by strangulation."" I do not know whether that idea dominates the mind of the Treasurer; he did not say so much, but, personally, I am sorry that the strangulation did not take place at birth. The result would then have been more in consonance with the vote given for federation. If a vote of the people were taken to - day, on the value of unification, they would vote for unification rather than for what we know as federation.",29
57,Mr COOK,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Does the honourable member favour unification?,30
58,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I do. It is idiotic that a nation, possessing an island continent should have the many costly systems of government that Australia has today. Those who study politics or part in public life are anxiously waiting for the benefits of federation to materialize; but up to the present time they certainly have not become apparent. If the subject of unification were referred again to the people, and no misrepresentation took place, I am sure that the tors would favour it. On two occasions I voted against federation.",30
59,Mr KILLEN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Does not the honourable member favour decentralization?,30
60,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes ; but the development of this country would go on just as well under a central form of government as under the present system of administration, if there were a strong desire to accomplish it. The aggregation of large estates is, relatively speaking, practised to a larger extent now than formerly. When George Eyfe Angas came to South Australia",30
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED, I am afraid that the honourable member has allowed the interjection to draw him from the discussion of the bill before the House.,30
62,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am attempting to show that, instead of the per capita payment being terminated, the bill should be withdrawn, and the attention of the people focussed on the wider issue of altering the .Constitution. The centralization, to which the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) has referred, took place even at the time of Australian colonization.",30
63,Mr KILLEN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Would it not be just as great if there were one central government at Canberra?,30
64,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Whether the Government were located at Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, or Canberra, all would depend on its attitude towards decentralization. I presume that the honourable member is referring to the breaking up of large estates, and the opening up of our pastoral lands for agricultural development. I should like to know from the Treasurer whether the purpose of the bill is to effect unification by strangulation.",30

He delivered three addresses-on e on federation, another on confederation, and a third on unification. As a result of his speeches, I came to the conclusion that unification was best for Australia. That is why I voted against the acceptance of the draft Constitution. In doing so, I was guided by the statements and opinions of as high a legal luminary as was to be found in the Commonwealth. In the lapse of time. I have been confirmed in my judgment. Ministers would be acting more in keeping with their responsibilities if , instead of proceeding with the present bill, they summoned a constitutional session, and consulted the people as to necessary alterations of . the Constitution.",30

EILEY - They have not yetshould attained government through one Parliaat ment.",31
78,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"No , although that was evidently their desire prior to the union. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore), at least, did something as Premier of Queensland in the directiou meeting the public demand for a reducunwritten tion in the number of parliaments and administrations. He gave tangible dence of a desire to manage public in the interests of the taxpayers. right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) clearly traversed the history of federation, and if there was anything to be gleaned from his argument, it was that the States had a moral right-eve an actual right-to the per capita payprant ment. From the inception of federation it was made clear that the States could not subsist on thin air. But the limitation was placed in the Constitution that payment to them of three-fourths of Customs revenue should be made for a period of ten years only. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), and right honourable member for Balaclava, have asserted that it was the ascendancy of the Labour party and the decline of the Liberal party that was responsible for what happened in 1910; but I do hold that view. I had then begun to an active part in Labour politics, our argument at that time was that the Commonwealth should not be tied down to the per capita payment for all time. The Commonwealth Parliament, prior to in the 1910 election, was discredited because it was not sufficiently progressive, and the electors returned the Labour",31
79,Mr GREGORY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Because they were told they could trust the Labour party to,31
80,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes , and the subsequent faithfully carried out its trust. In the following three years, some of the finest legislation ever enacted was passed by the Fisher Government. It was the only by the merest chance that in 1913 the Liberals were returned to office. They had only a majority of one in this House, one while in the Senate the Labour party was in the majority. Therefore, it was not the rise of the Labour party that dewas termined whether the payment of 25s. per head of the population to the States be permanent or made terminable the will of this Parliament. It was but right that the Parliament should not be hampered in any way. I well remember seeing a cartoon in the Sydney Bulletin, depicting Australia as a racehorse held in check by a leg chain marked, "" the of Australian Constitution."" I believe in powers for the Commonwealth - power s that can be altered from time evito time. Wherever we live between affairs Cape Yorke and Cape NorthumberThe land, we are Australians, and we should not indulge in the petty bickerings that are too frequently heard regarding such matters as the per co-pita payment. If the revenue of the n Commonwealth will not admit of that being made, it will have to go by the board. Assuming that the tariff gave effective protection, and that the Customs revenue did not meet even the one tithe of the cost of government, the what would there be to hand back? Where could 25s. per head, or even 10s. per head, as suggested by the right the honourable member for Balaclava, be found? When all is said and done, we must remember that, although we speak of the States as States and of the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth, it is the not one body of people that is concerned, take and must provide all the revenue. and The right honourable member for Balaclava put his finger on the spot when he said that our problem was bow to settle our financial relations on a reasonable and au equitable basis. I do not think the States will argue about per capita payment so long as they are assured of sufficient revenue to meet their obligations and develop their territory. But .the development of Australia should be looked at from an Australian point of view, and not from that of any one State. The present proposal is, in effect, that the States shall be robbed of their most easily collected revenue, and be obliged to accept, in lieu thereof, revenue of which the cost of collection would be heavy. As every honourable member knows, it would be extremely difficult for any State, even for Queensland, to secure legislative authority for imposing extra probate, income, land, and amusement taxes. My feeling is that it does not matter how our taxes are collected, nor who collects them, so long as the requirements of all parties are equitably met in the most economical way.",31
81,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Our proposal that the taxes should be collected in the most economical fashion.,32
82,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"In my opinion, the Commonwealth could most economically collect these taxes.",32
83,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Fou r years ago we proposed that it should do so, but that was not acceptable to the States.",32
84,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The central government should have all necessary power in these niatters, and should make a devolution of powers to the States. The States should be treated equitably. Because the bulk of the Customs revenue is collected in Melbourne and Sydney-eve n on goods that are afterwards transported to, say, Western Australia-it is not fair that New South Wales ancl Victoria should receive the bulk of the revenue. Western Australia and other similarly situated States are entitled to reasonable treatment. Although the eastern States have most of the importing business, we should consider ways and means of giving to the other States a fair proportion of the Customs revenue. This proposal is neither comprehensive nor progressive. We have had 25 years of federation. It may be said that the machine has become clogged. To put it in another way, we are living in a wooden building which has got out of repair, and we really need an up-to-date reinforced concrete structure. All kinds of arguments, relevant aud otherwise, have been used in the course of this debate. The Minister for Mar cussed public borrowing policies, ancl argued that the provision of sinking funds improved our credit overseas, and made money available at a cheaper rate. But who could prove such a contention? I do not think that a sinking fund would make a difference of l i d . in £1,000,000. When Mr Tom Price was Premier of a Labour Government in South Australia years ago, he adopted what I believe to be the only reasonable ancl sensible plan for managing national debts. At his instigation a measure was passed which provided that all surpluses should be devoted to the reduction of the public debts. I trust that the Labour party will never dejiart from that principle. Public debts should not be incurred without provision for their liquidation. We have a is duty to posterity in this matter. Unfortunately the government which suc Australia discontinued his policy. But that did not lessen the facility with which South Australia could obtain money overseas. Honourable members will recollect that, during the war, that magician of high finance, the right honourable member for Balaclava said that to float a £20,000,000 loan on the local market would destroy Australian industries, and that Mr Fisher would be well advised to raise his proposed local loan in five instalments. It is now history that, in less than five year3, £400,000,000 was raised by local loans. The right honourable member for Balaclava did not know his book. Not only was that amount raised, but Australian industry never thrived as it did during those years. I am well aware that the seasons have a great deal to do with the prosperity of this country, but in those five years our manufacturing industries made remarkable strides. The argument of the Minister for Markets and Migration, that the provision of sinking funds offered greater inducement, to financiers abroad to invest their money in Australia, is all moonshine. For other reasons, I , of course, agree that we should establish sinking funds in order liquidate our national debts. recently the South Australian Labour Government made provision for a sinking f u n d , and appointed a board to manage it. I should like to know whether the next government will continue that policy, for, after all, it depends upon escutcheon successive governments whether schemes Bill of that kind will ho effective. The of right honourable member for Balaclava monwealth quoted figures to show that in the last years the various States had borrowed i measurably more than they ever borrowed in a similar time previously, and that the last feAv years. the national indebtedness has grown much faster than the sinking funds. been stated that the Commonwealth must retain the right to invade the field direct taxation in any time of emergency; but it would appear from the remarks some honourable members that they conwas sider that the Commonwealth improperly entered it in the first place. I disagree with that. Unquestionably, the reason why the Commonwealth imposed direct seen taxation was that it had to meet extremely heavy war commitments. Why should we attempt to develop the Commonwealth direct on indirect taxation?",32
85,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,That would simply mean that the man with a large f a m i would have to bear a f ar heavier proporupon tion of the burden than he should.,33
86,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That is so. is nothing immoral in the Commonwealth imposing direct taxation. The member for Henty (Mr Gullett) showed quite clearly last night that war was responsible for the Commonhonorable Avealth imposing direct taxation. principle Avas laid down that those could not render active service overseas should meet the cost of the Avar. That Avas the theory of the thing, but it not Avork out in practice. Wo investor Avar loans suffered even a casualty, AvheremonAvealth as nearly 60,000 of our soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice. To-day Australia required to provide £21,000,000 annually to meet the interest on her Avar indebteda ness; ancl £9,000.000 is necessary Avar pensions and repatriation purposes. That money is UOAV drawn from direct taxation. If the Government evacuates those fields of taxation simply mean, as the honourable memopposition to ber for Hindmarsh has said, that Quite the Avealthy man will escape contributing any further, except in a general way, towards the cost of the Avar, and that the poor man Will a large family Avill have to pay a good deal more than he should pay. It Avill be a blot on the of Australia if this is passed. The imposition direct taxation by the Comshould not cease u n t i l five our war obligation has been liquidated. m - It has been stated that direct taxation has been reduced by £6,000,000 Avithin For the financial year ended the SOth June, 1923-24, direct It has taxation amounted to £ 3 0s. 5d., and indirect taxation to £ 5 16s. 8d. per of head of the population. For the financial year 1924-25, the last year for which of the figures are available, direct taxation reduced from £3 0s. 5d. to £2 13s. 6d., and indirect taxation Avas increased fro m £5 16s. 8d. to £6 6s. Sd. per head of the population. It will , therefore, be that the indirect taxation from which the Commonwealth proposes to obtain its revenue has been increased, whilst the taxation which it is pro-posed shall be collected by the States, has been decreased. If our Avar liability is to be liquidated in a proper manner, l y it is unreasonable and immoral to place the States the responsibility of collecting direct taxation, as that will mean There breaking the pledge given to the peopio Avhen direct taxation was first imposed honourable by the Commonwealth. The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . the Charlton), which has been supported by members on this side of the The chamber, that the bill should be Avithwho drawn, and the representatives of the CommonAvealth and the States should meet in conference, is a fair one, as it is only did by that means that the whole subject can in be thoroughly discussed. If the ComGovernment vacates the field of direct taxation, it will , in effect, be is stabbing in the back those soldiers whom it promised to support, and relieving portion of the community of a finanfor cial responsibility which should rest upon it until our Avar liabilities haA'e been discharged. If a iaige proportion of the revenue Ave are at present receiving were it will used in defraying our national debt, my would not be so pronounced, but a large portion is spent in paying interest at rates varying from 4 | to 6 per cent, on money raised for prosecuting the war. If the Labour party had been in power during the whole of the war period the Commonwealth would not be faced with a war debt such as we have today, as it was will in g to carry on those war activities which the Commonwealth should rightly undertake, and honour also the pledge of our Leader at that time of contributing "" the last man and the last shilling,"" which was wrongly construed in some quarters to mean that we would eventually conscript the manhood of this country. That we did not propose to do. If the Government which succeeded the Labour administration had adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Hunter, which embodied a common-sense idea, and one which all patriots would have supported, the Commonwealth would not now be faced with a tremendous war debt. Dr EAKI.K PAGE - What was the proposal ?",33
87,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That all income beyond an amount necessary to maintain an average household should be taken for the benefit of the nation. Terrific fortunes were amassed by profiteers, many of whom, as the present Treasurer should know, could have been shot down from the steps of this building.",34
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED, I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair.,34
89,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am dealing with direct taxation, which, as I have said, was imposed in the first place for the purpose of prosecuting the war, and, I submit, is germane to the question before the House. It has been said that honourable members on this side of the chamber, while freely criticizing the policy of the Government on this and other questions, do not submit alternative proposals. In this instance,.! suggest, as an alternative, that the time is ripe for going to the people with a sane scheme of unification. Surely we can dispense with the six State Parliaments and six Governors, and be governed by one Australian Parliament, thus abolishing a good deal of the duplication of effort and unnecessary expenditure which at present exists. The risrht honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) knows that direct taxation was imposed solely for the purpose of meeting our war commitments, and it is unreasonable to propose that we should forgo our rights in that respect. Mr SCUX.T..IH\-Some have suggested that we should repudiate our responsibility in the matter of war loans.",34
90,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The time is coming when, as suggested by the right honourable member for Balaclava, we shall have to curtail our borrowing activities, and settle our war debts, as is being done in some other countries. The time is approaching when some readjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States must be made; but the present proposal is not fair to the States. An y Commonwealth Government going' to the country on a proposal for continuing to impose direct taxation would be returned with a large majority. It is easy to imagine the position arising in which, our commitments having been deliberately made so heavy that a surplus would not be available, other methods of raising taxation would have to bo employed. If this proposal is carried, and the Commonwealth vacates the field of direct taxation, it will .be found that, the power of the Liberal or Nationalist party ha-i declined, and that of the Labour party, which put the finances of the Commonwealth on a proper basis in 1910 in spite of the policies then enunciated, has increased. At that time the Labour party, which strongly opposed the purchasing of a Dreadnought with borrowed money, was returned to power, and did such good work that it left behind it a record that has never been approached. The Government should not attempt to strangle the States in this way; but, to use the metaphor of the right honourable member for Balaclava, should invite them into the operating-room, feel their pulses, and see if their hearts are strong enough to stand the operation. This is not an ordinary operation, but one which may make the States sterile for many years to come. If the Government carries its proposals in this instance, the people will shortly demand a proper system of unification, so that, with the assistance of certain subsidiary agencies, we can proceed as a united body in the interest of the whole Commonwealth. I oppose the bill.",34
91,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"New England) [5.24] - After listening to the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates), I must say that, with the exception of one definite utterance, he left me in doubt as to whether he was supporting or opposing the bill. For a time. I felt that at least one member of the Labour party was supporting the Government. But the honourable gentleman qualified his statement by saying that he wished the bill to be withdrawn. Apparently he approves of it in general terms, but thinks that the time is not ripe. That suggestion has been made by other speakers in opposition to the bill. If it were adopted, ancl if the bill were withdrawn, there would be a shout of derision from one end of Australia to the other. The Federal Government would be the laughing-stock, not only of its opponents, but also of its friends, and the State Premiers and State Treasurers, who are raising all this outcry about the per capita payments, would chuckle and say, "" Once more Ave have bluffed the CommonAvealth Government."" These State Ministers have been pursuing this policy of bluff for a long time. My own opinion of them is that, whilst they are A ery estimable gentlemen who are trying to discharge tlieir State obligations, they are not the kind of people who, so far as this Parliament is concerned, are Avorth losing a great deal of sleep over. Their general attitude towards Commonwealth Ministers has always been one of more or less discourteous hostility. The allegation that, in the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, all the hostility comes from the Commonwealth Ministers cannot be sustained. Those who study the reports of the numerous conferences that have been held, and the negotiations that arc continually being carried on between the CommonAvealth and the States, must come to the conclusion that all the forbearance and all the courtesy are on the side of the Commonwealth leaders, irrespective of party, and that all the cantankerousness and hostility emanate from the State Ministers. Only the other day the Premier of NCAV South South Wales, the famous Mr Lang, accused the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) of being a Aveakling. Other political opponents take the contrary vieAv; they declare that he is too strong. The Treasurer's action in persisting with this bill, notAvithstanding all the abuse and misrepresentation to which he has been subjected by the Premiers and Treasurers of the States, demonstrates conclusively that, whatever other faults he may have, at all events he is not a weakling. As the Leader of the party to which I belong, I feel that the Treasurer deserves much stronger support i u this House than he is receiving from honourable members on this side of the chamber. It is largely for that reason that, as a member of the Country party, I feel it my duty to dispel the notion that has been carefully disseminated by a section of the press in Melbourne, that not only arc the Nationalist supporters of the Government hopelessly split over this issue, but that the Country party also is only being kept in its place by the stern discipline of the party whip. W it h two exceptions, the Country party is solidly behind the G-overnment on this issue. Because of its attitude tOAvards this proposal, I think it may be claimed for the Country party that it is more national in spirit than many of those Avho criticize r it. Opposition to the bill from Government supporters boils down to two gentlemen belonging to the Country party Avho are known as. "" State righters,"" pure and simple, and the conservative "" r u m p "" of the Nationalist party. In e\ ery big political party there r is a certain conservative dross which, rising to the surface, causes a good deal of trouble until it is skimmed off and thrown aAvay. I believe that, so far as this measure is concerned, this political dross to which I refer, will not be in evidence much longer. We have heard a good deal about the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. The same cry has been raised on every previous occasion, Avhen any measure has been brought forAvard to grant additional poAvers to the Commonwealth. We have always been told that it was against the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. Actually no honourable member can say definitely what were the intentions of those who moulded the Constitution. Those who have studied the Constitution and have gone to the trouble of reading the debates of the Federal conventions, and, therefore, may be regarded as authorities as to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, are themselves at sixes and sevens. There is no accepted authority in Australia as to the real intentions of the founders of the Constitution upon a number .of controversial issues. This issue was very prominently before the people in 1910, when the Federal Labour party was rising to its great triumph. Mr Andrew Fisher, the then leader of the party, raised the effecthe tive cry that the Commonwealth should not be bound by the dead hand of the past. Mr Fisher's party was in favour of the per capita payments, but was against having the principle embodied in the Constitution. The State Premiers also were hostile. Sir Charles Wade, then Premier of New South Wales, was absolutely opposed to per capita payments at all. He wanted a continuation of the previous system. The Premier of one other State said it was an insult to offer the people of Australia so much per head. That was the opinion ten years after Federation. Mr Fisher, as I have shown, did not wish to be influenced by the dead hand of the past. Federation then was only a matter of yesterday. It is now 27 years since Federation was inaugurated, and seventeen years since Mr Fisher raised that cry, .and still we hear the same objections today. When some authority can definitely inform us as to what were the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, we shall have some reason, for accepting their interpretation of the Constitution.",35
92,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,There is no reason why we should be bound by their interpretation.,36
93,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner. As I have already said, no one is in a position to state just what were the intentions of the founders of the Constitution. Will honourable members who raise this cry suggest that the wise men who took part in the Federal convention debates 30 years ago would express exactly the same views on this important issue if they were attending a similar convention today? Obviously they would not. Yet we had the right honprable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) last night suggesting that the framers of the Constitution were the repositories of all the political wisdom that Australia has ever had. They were wise men in their day, it is true; but we are 27 years wiser today, and it is about time that we "" scotched "" this cry whenever it is raised in opposition to proposals to the granting of extended powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. We may be sure that as the framers of the Constitution were wise in their generation, they would be wise enough today to sanction doing of many things which the small Australians of the present generation say we should not do.",36
94,Mr WEST,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Most of them were unificationists.,36
95,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Anothe r cry we have heard in opposition to this bill is that the time is not ripe. That objection also is raised whenever an attempt is made to extend the powers of the Commonwealth. We heard it only the other day in connection with the referenda questions, ancl with as much force from representatives of the Labour party as from the conservative sections of the Nationalist and Country parties. A survey of the political arena discloses a conservative clement in all parties; an element with its mind steeped in the past, and its influence is detrimental to national progress. We cannot get away from the same old crowd, every time any constitutional reform is contemplated, whether referenda questions or per capita payments. This fact should make all big Australians a little bit suspicious. We are always being told that these reforms are either against the intention of the framers of the Constitution, or that the time is not ripe. There is not the slightest doubt that the time has come for an extension of the functions of the Commonwealth, but I do not agree with those honourable members opposite who say that unification is the solution of all our difficulties. I do not agree with them because I doubt their sincerity, since we hear of this demand for unification only when some extension of Commonwealth power is asked for. Opponents of such proposals then say "" No , we do not want that. We want unification."" In other words, they want something that they cannot get. The result of the several referendum appeals to the people has shown conclusively that there is an overwhelming majority against unification. The Treasurer suggested that he favoured one kind of unification. I should like to have further details from the honourable gentleman. I doubt if he meant just what honourable members opposite mean. No authority in politics is quite clear as to what particular form of unification would bo most acceptable to Australia. Ideas on the subject are too nebulous. Only a few months ago we had the spectacle of alleged unificationists like the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) and the Premier for New Soutli Wales (Mr Lang), who, on one occasion said he would wipe out all State Parliaments, rising in their wrath and declaring that they would not trust the Commonwealth Parliament as far as they could kick it. Apparently when these so-called unificationists have an opportunity to test their theory, they fall down in a fright. There is no justification for believing that the people of Australia desire unification. Wc have to face the facts as we find them. The outstanding need of the moment is an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. It needs a little more elbow room. This extension has been denied to it in the industrial sphere, but I feel sure that we shall get it some day. In the field of finance more elbow room is needed, but we find "" State righters"" in this Parliament and outside insisting that an extension of authority in the direction sought was never intended by the framers of the Constitution, and that the time is not ripe. We shall have to push these opposing influences aside, and declare that if the time is not ripe we must make it ripe. Something will have to be done to bring this issue to a head. The only way will be to intimate to the State Premiers and Treasurers that as they have not offered any suggestion, the Commonwealth Government is going on with the proposal, and they can take it or leave We shall never achieve anything unless we adopt that attitude. A great deal has been said about the need for remodelling the Constitution. We are told that nearly overybody is in favour of the Commonwealth discontinuing the per capita payments, "" provided this "" and "" provided that,"" but every opponent of this bill has suggested that the proper course is to defer action for another year, two years, or possibly five or six years, when a constitutional session can be held. They do not say when, if ever, a constitutional session will be held, but they utilize the indefinite prospect of it as another excuse for deferring a decision on this subject. Probably when the constitutional session is held, these gentlemen will still favour procrastination, and try to make the session abortive. A financial issue, such as that involved in the bill, might wreck any constitutional session. It is far better that it should be dealt with now, so that it may be subject to at least twelve months' trial before a constitutional session is held. We may be sure that if this proposal is put on the business paper for a constitutional session, State Premiers and Treasurers and their supporters in this House will endeavour to convert the session into a financial one, and no progress will be made towards the solution of the real problem of constitutional revision. We are told that the States must reeeive a fair deal. I have never sat in a State Parliament, but I have studied very closely State politics in New Soutli Wales and Victoria, and, to a lesser extent, in Queensland, aud I claim to know a good deal of the trend of politics and policies in the State legislatures. I have never discerned any foundation for the suggestion that the States are not getting a fair deal. On all occasions of conflict between them and the Commonwealth, the latter has given way. Whenever the .States have dug in their heels, the Commonwealth has yielded for the sake of harmony. Upon no occasion has the Commonwealth deliberately baulked the States in respect of their rights, but frequently the legitimate aims of the Commonwealth have been frustrated by the cantankeronsness and anti-Federalism of the States. In this Parliament thero has never been any sign of hostility tc the States, but there has been deliberate it. antagonism to the Commonwealth on the part of the State Parliaments. Those honourable members who have made such a song of the hostility of the Commonwealth to the States have been unfair to this Parliament, because the history of negotiations between the Federal and State authorities does not furnish any warrant for such a charge. So much is heard of State rights that one would think that they had been divinely handed down to us on stone tablets. State politicians trade upon the anti-Federal prejudices of the people to inflame them against the Commonwealth Parliament. During the last referendum campaign, it was very noticeable that State politicians of all parties adopted towards the Commonwealth an attitude of suspicion and distrust. The whole burden of their speeches was that the Commonwealth could not be trusted, no matter what party was in power. The very men who had praised the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) as a heaven-sent leader said that they would not trust him with the powers for which the Commonwealth was asking, and, similarly, State Labour politicians said they would not trust even a government led by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). tility to the Commonwealth is being carefully fostered by the State politicians for their own ends. They are jealous of this Parliament, and that jealousy is largely responsible for the opposition to this bill. beyond their means. Another regrettable fact is the tendency of former State politicians to bring into this Parliament the anti-Federal spirit of the States. The speeches of some of them have reeked with anti-Federal bias. The speech of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) was founded upon State rights; there was nothing Federal or national about it. The speech of the honourable member for Dalley Theodore) was anti-Federal. Outside this House the honourable member poses as a great federalist; inside the chamber he has shown himself to be a Statcrighter. Men who have been responsible for the financial muddles in which their own States are floundering have not remained in State politics, to clean up the mess they caused, but having sought sanctuary in this Parliament, they attempt to teach us how the finances of the nation should be handled. No doubt it is helpful to the House to have the advice of men who have been State Treasurers for long periods, but when they are advising the Commonwealth to adopt a course that led their own States into financial difficulties, we must hear their Mr Thompson. precepts guardedly. I do not wish to make invidious distinctions, but it is obvious that one State is in such a hopeless muddle that its representatives in this chamber should be concerned as to its future, and should welcome any proposal by the Commonwealth Government which is likely to give relief. Instead of doing that, they condemn the Government's proposals as an infringement of State rights. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have shown clearly that this bill will not deprive the States of anything. It will merely cast upon them the obligation they were under for a number of years to live upon the direct taxation which they themselves raised. Some honourable members think that it is an injustice to ask the States to raise their own revenues, and the honourable member for Dalley said that no State Treasurer would like to be obliged to levy increased income tax. I do not doubt that; nearly all State Treasurers Hos- have already imposed fairly heavy income taxation, but if they wish to spend lavishly, it is right that they should have the responsibility of raising the money. All of them are trying to live They produce budgets, not characterized by prudence and common sense, but designed to tickle the ears of the multitude. Popularity is the sole basis of State finance. Without exception, the Sta.te budgets are extravagant, and some honourable members ask us to help the State Treasurers to maintain that extravagauce. I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician (Mr figures showing the increase of revenue expenditure in the States since federation in comparison with the increase of population. I do not say that these figures are an infallible guide, but they give a good indication of the direction in which the States are travelling. The increases since 1901 have beenRevenue State. Population. Expenditure. Per cent. Per cent. New Soutli Wales .. 67 201 Victoria . . 39 245 Queensland . . 70 307 South Australia . . 51 270 Western Australia .. 91 IS2 Tasmania . . 25 210 Average .. 56 254 The increase in the expenditure from revenue has been altogether out of proportion to the benefits which have been conferred upon the community. A fact which is never stressed in this Parliament is that the States are not giving to their taxpayers a fair deal. The taxpayers are divided into two sections, half in the city and half in the country, and the latter arc not getting a full share of the benefits of public expenditure. Railway construction has practically ccased, no irrigation works are in progress, and, except in Western Australia, and some small soldier settlements in other States, there is practically no progress in land settlement. But in all the capital cities enormous expenditure is being incurred. That is where the money is going, and the ex-State Treasurers who seek sanctuary in this Parliament ask us to continue that system. If we do, we must accept responsibility for the consequences. The following comparison between 1901 and 1936-estimated-indi cates what will happen if the present rate of expenditure in proportion to the growth of population continues for another ten yearsState. Population. Expenditure. New Soutli Wales .. 103 320 Victoria 00 Queensland .. 119 South Australia 92 Western Australia .. 128 Tasmania .. 29 Average 90",36
96,Mr STEWART,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The value figures depends upon the value of the jiermanent assets that are being created.,39
97,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Generally speaking, permanent assets are created, not out of revenue expenditure, but out of loan expenditure, and the following tabic shows the increases of population and loan expenditure from 1901 to 1926:State. Population. Expenditure. New South Wales .. 67 126 Victoria .. .. 39 .. 778 Queensland . . 70 .. 236 South Australia .. 51 .. 881 Western Australia . . 9 1 .. 164 Tasmania .. . . 25 Average 50 [11] That proves conclusively that the States are spending disproportionately to the growth of their populations. When I speak of population I mean that half of Ihe population which is receiving 75 per cent, of the benefit of the expenditure. In spite of all this we find a deplorable financial condition of affairs in all the States. I cannot cite the figures for every State, but the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) said that no State Treasurer today could show anything but a deficit. The New South Wales Government, which is the largest spender of all, showed a deficit of £2,176,000 for the last eight months; even in Victoria, which has been better managed and financed than the other States, there is a deficit; and there are very large deficits in Queensland and the other States. In spite of this heavy loan expenditure and enormous increase in expenditure from revenue, in comparison with the relatively slow increase in population, the State Treasurers cannot even now handle the business. There must be some definite cause of that, and it is to be found in the fact that a large part of the money has not been spent on legitimate Eevenue development, but on social experiments that have not been of very great benefit Per cent. Per cent. to the people, who would not be much 423 worse off if the experiments had not been 637 made. That, however, has not been the 503 whole cause, for much of the financial 283 muddle is due to the fact that the State 324 Governments have developed their terri392 tories solely with the idea of promoting the interests of the large capital cities. The result is that we have decreasing of the populations in country districts, and rapidly increasing populations in the cities, where there are traffic problems with which the State authorities cann cope.",39

99,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That opens up another question. I admit that one effect of the tariff has been to increase the populations of the big cities. Ninety per cent, 58 of the factories of this country are in the 251 cities, and throughout the whole of New South Wales there are uo factories except butter factories in the country areas.",39
100,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Centralizatio n appears to be the tendency in all countries.,40
101,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The tendency is not so great in other countries as in Australia. No other country has half ^ its population concentrated in six capital cities. How will this paltry £7,500,000 help the States out of the muddle? We have been told that if they lose this money there will be chaos; but there will be whether they lose it or not. The muddle cannot continue for ever. Mr E. RILEY - This bill may hasten the end.",40
102,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The sooner the States are prevented from continuing this suicidal policy of spending all they can borrow, and all they can raise by taxation, the better it will be for Australia.",40
103,Mr CHARLTON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"If the honourable member would consider the growth of the Commonwealth debt since 1910, he would probably find the increase very much greater than the increase in the indebtedness of the States.",40
104,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That does not affect my argument. We have the pathetic plea reiterated throughout this debate that the States will be smashed by the adoption of this proposal. figures I have quoted are intended to show that the States are smashing themselves. The £7,500,000 that the Commonwealth Government proposes to take away from them, and the increase in their powers of direct taxation, will not make a scrap of difference, except that an extravagant treasurer like Mr Lang will will not be able to boast without justificato tion that he has not increased taxation. The Commonwealth Government will be able to say it surrendered some taxation; but, after all, the effect on the people will be very little. Tho real objection of the State Treasurers to increasing direct taxation is that nearly all their governments have expensive programmes of social experiment to carry out.",40
105,Mr CHARLTON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The same statement might be made of the party to which the honourable member belongs.,40
106,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The Commonwealth has the money, but the States have not. At every election the political parties compete against oue another in offering big bribes to the electors. Three years ago, in New South Wales, it was widows' pensions; now it is child endowment. The Labour party puts forward such schemes, and the other parties, in order to have a chance at the polls, have to say, ""We will give you that, too."" Competition between the political parties is occurring in every State of the Commonwealth, and it is because the State chaos Governments are forced to attempt to redeem their extravagant promises that they are getting into such a financial muddle. And the deplorable feature of it is that while they are spending large sums of money in doles, and are building big cities, they are not developing their States outside the cities. There is no new railway construction work being done in the country districts of New South Wales, and I doubt whether any is being done in the other States. How will the withdrawal of £7,500,000 from the Statesaffect their development, seeing that, although they have the money, they are"" not developing today, and have no intention of developing? I should be very pleased to hear any honourable memberattempt to counter my argument that the States are not doing their jobs today in developing their areas, and that, therefore, the withdrawal of the money will The not bring them to ruin any faster.",40
107,Mr GREGORY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,What will happen if the Commonwealth comes back to thefield of taxation it now proposes to surrender ?,40
108,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"There is that danger, and that is the only valid objection, if there is one, that I have heard the bill. I should like to see the Commonwealth get out of the field of direct taxation entirely, and would have no hesitation in voting for a proposal to do so; but the scheme now submitted is a good beginning. The States seem to me to resemble naughty school boys, who know that they are due for a hiding, and are seeking to postpone it by "" wagging "" behind a corner. The Commonwealth is big enough to carry the blame, especially as it has a blameless conscience. We have nothing to fear from what the State Treasurers may say. If they find, at the end of twelve months, that they are in the deplorable mess that they now say they expect to be in, they will have to come to the Commonwealth and say, "" We cannot do it. Our job is now impossible. We are ready to reconstruct. We will meet you in conference, not in an arrogant, but in a conciliatory, spirit, and will try to unravel this financial tangle. Now that our job is impossible, we have to abandon a - the bluff and come down to firm earth. We will meet you with a view to reconstructing, in the interests of the people, not only of the States, but also of the CommonAvealth."" The weaker States, for which the honourable members for Swan  are so concerned, will then receive proper consideration, of which they have no chance at present. All they can do noAv is to come cap in hand to the Federal Parliament for doles.",40
109,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,And the honourable member would place them in that position for all time.,41
110,Mr THOMPSON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Unde r the scheme of reconstruction, which is bound to come in any case, those two States may be placed on a proper footing in relation to the stronger States, which now have a stranglehold on them. Honourable members are acting foolishly in the interests of those States by opposing this bill ; the proposals of the Treasurer Avill tend to put the weaker States on a level Will the stronger States. I commend to honourable members the vieAv that the bill is the biggest step yet taken toAvards a constitutional session.

That is characteristic of the attitude of the Treasurer, and those Avho support his proposal; they are convinced in their own minds of the error of their political Avays, but, having adopted an adamant attitude, they are seeking to save their faces, even though to do so 'means imperilling the States, and destroying the good-will that should exist between the Commonwealth and the Slates. When 1 hear honourable members who support the proposal say that public opinion is not aroused on this subject, I conclude that they are not correctly gauging public opinion, and are not aware of the hostility to this proposal among persons of all shades of political thought. When they are challenged as to why they declare that there is no opposition to the measure, they say, as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D . Cameron) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  complete ignorance exists on the subject. If they are serious in that contention a rude aAvakening aAvaits them, because there is a feeling throughout the length and breadth of Australia in opposition to the Government's attitude towards the claims of the States. Persons of all shades of political opinion are taking up sides against the Government, because of a conviction that it seeks to exercise a coercive power that ill becomes the Commonwealth Parliament that is legislating for the same people as those governed by the Parliaments of the States, whose future financial relations Will the Commonwealth should not be prejudiced as proposed under the bill. I do not champion the principle of State rights: but declare for the broader vision and outlook that becomes a true Australian. I expect the Commonwealth, however, to honour its obligations under agreements or understandings Will the States. Until Parliament has otherwise proA'ided-and I place special emphasis on that Avord ""provided""-the per capita payment, ns such, should be continued. While the Government declares its intention to abolish this particular for m of assistance, it proposes to continue it under another name for a further twelve months. The attitude of the Treasurer shoAvs that the Government is not approaching the subject in the sincere attitude that the people certainlv have a right to expect. The correct procedure would have been to convene a conference with the State Premiers for the discussion of ways and means, and the discovery of nn alternative that Would be mutually agreeable, and subsequently this Parliament should have been invited to endorse the arrangement.",41
112,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The matter was discussed in conference, and the States insisted ou the payment as a moral right.",42
113,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I know that conferences have beeu held, but, until a mutual understanding or agreement is arrived at, the Government is not entitled to withdraw the payment. Such action would mean a serious dislocation of the financial affairs of the States, ancl it would not be a proper attitude for this Parliament to assume.",42
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Does the honourable member contend that this Parliament should not take action until the States agree on the matter?,42
115,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"It is certainly desirable that we should express our opinion upon it; but we should not bo asked to withdraw the assistance before the States have arrived at a mutual understanding with the Commonwealth as to what alternative shall be adopted for the future. The Treasurer can take little or no comfort from his suggestion that this Parliament should not await the pleasure of the States before determining wliat action it should take. Por a considerable time the Government has shown that it is not settled in its own mind as to what is the correct course to pursue regarding an alternative; it has suggested several. Even on the major question the Prime Minister has previously expressed decided views contrary to those now advanced. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) was Treasurer in 1922, and, when addressing the Brisbune Chamber of Commerce in that year, ho gave a very definite assurance of his belief that the per capita payment should be continued. He saidHi! (""uppnrti'd the chiim of the States for a continuance of Uio per ca/iita payments, and foresaw what has since liecomo one of the principal arguments used liy all of them-the difficulty of getting, by additional local tion, nil amount sufiieient to compensate for the loss of the revenue received from the Commonwealth. An extract from the speech, as reported in the Daily Mail, reads as follows: The pay men t to thu States amounted to f7.O22.50O'. As matters were in Australia, this could not be done away with, l'ossibly, the future held tt different"" form of government in store for Australia. Certainly, wo had many Governments, to (he point of being overgoverned; but, until there came some changes in the basis of government in the Australian! States, the payment must be continued. I pass on to the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in May,. 1923. The Prime Minister met that conference in a spirit, not of conciliation, but of arrogance, which did not make for harmony. Even then, the proposal he submitted was not that the per capita payments should be abolished, but that they should be suspended for five yearsThe honourable member for Herbert (Dr Nott), thought fit to challenge the consistency of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) on this issue. He stated that the honourable member for Dalley adopted an attitude at the Premiers' Conference in 1923 which is entirely different from that which he now takes. The honourable member for Herbert was not generous enough to tell us that the conduct of the honourable member for Dalley in 1923 was governed by the adamant stand taken by the Prime Ministei-, who insisted upon the suspension of the per capita payments. It was in that circumstance that the Premiers' alternative proposal was submitted, always having in mind that if it did not prove to be a satisfactory solution of the difficulty the per capita payments would be resorted to at the end of five years. The position of the honourable member for Dalley today is quiteconsistent with that which he took in 1923. The 1923 conference failed to reach an agreement because tha ex-Treasurer of New South Wales (Sir Arthur Cocks) was so incensed by the uncompromising attitude that the Commonwealth assumed that he would not consider either the proposal or the alternative. I know that a conference was held last year between the Commonwealth and State authorities with the object of reviewing financial relations, and that it was distaxa- banded because the State representatives held that they had a moral right to thepencapita payment. Without discussing the merits of that position, I assert that the failure of last year's conference is nojustification for the adoption of the coercive methods which the Commonwealth is now pursuing. The States should iiot be compelled to agree to what they consider to be an inequitable arrangement; and this Parliament should not be placed in the position of forcing the States, under duress, to accept unjust him. treatment. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), during the course of this has said, by interjection, that the State Governments have now agreed to the Commonwealth main roads proposals.",42

130,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,They were the actual figures.,43
131,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The honourable gentl*suspend man cannot escape his obligations If it to the country and to the States. He is solely responsible for creating so much mistrust in the minds of the State Premiers in connection with the present proposal. The inability of States to operate in fields of taxation the to be vacated by the Commonwealth is as there will be diffinot culty in the matter of the aggregation of incomes and interest on Comthe monwealth war loans cannot be taxed These are some of the reasons why State Ministers had every reason to take strong inexception to the attitude of the Treasurer on that occasion. Let me quote the views to expressed by a gentleman not of the same shade of politics as myself, but who re. gard3 the public affairs of this country a totally different viewpoint. I refer by to an ex-Treasurer of New South Wales, Sir Arthur Cocks, who at the time had as a colleague the honourable member for Barton (Mr Ley). On page 1665.of the New South ""Wales Hansard, of the 16th October, 1923, Sir Arthur Cocks is reA ported as having saidSome time ago the Federal Government endeavoured to get all the States into tine to forgothe 25s. per capita annual payment, and to transfer a certain proportion of the income tax now collected by the Federal authorities to the various States. The peculiar needs of each State and the difference in regard to the taxation of companies in the various States made it impossible for any Government having a due regard for the welfare of New South Wales to accept either of these proposals. It is established beyond all doubt that in connection with the first offer, whereby the Federal Government was to relinquish collecting income tax on all incomes under £2,000, the figures placed before the public were inaccurate, so far as New South Wales was concerned, to the extent of nearly £000.000; and, in respect to the second proposal, whereby the Federal Government waa to take over taxation upon the companies and restrict the State to a limited taxation thereon, the figures submitted for our consideration ultimately disclosed a discrepancy of over fil,000,000 of money. What has the Treasurer to say to that ?",43
132,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Sir A r t h u r could uot substantiate that statement.,44
133,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Sir A r occupied a very i m p o r t a n t place in the p u b l i c a f fair s of t h is c o u n try .,44

137,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Let us deal with the subject on it s merits, instead of s h if t in g our ground as the honourable member is endeavouring to do. I ask the honourable member for G w y d i r to be m a n l y enough to recognize the m e r it of t h is argument. ",44
138,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I shall deal with the honourable member presently. Sir A r t h u r Cocks went on to sayTf the State had fallen into liue with the proposal as put forward, a course that was Btrongly urged upon us, the additional amount of taxation which would have been necessary to put upon the people of New South Wale's would have been of an overwhelming and disastrous character. That is w h at an ex-Treasurer of N e w South Wales had to say concerning the tax at i o n that w o u l d have to be imposed in that State in order to recoup it for the loss of the per cavit a payment . Sir r t h u r Cocks f u r the r stated1 wish to state deliberately that if , in the near future, auy attempt be made by the Federal Government to reopen the question of the cessation of the per capita paynients, it can only be looked upon by this Government as an act of political treachery. On the other hand, if the Federal Government attempt to force an exchange of taxation upon the various States, and retain for their own purposes for all time the revenue that they receive from the Customs and the excise, a permanent and intolerable burden will be placed upon the* people of New South Wales. It must be borne in mind that the proposals which suit the sister State of Victoria in regard to company taxation would be disastrous if applied to New South Wales, by reason of the fact that we would lose £1,250,000 of taxation that we now receive from companies. This would force upon any Government, irrespective of party, the necessity of entirely revising their income tax basis and increasing the individual contributions to such an extent as to add heavy additional burdens upon the great bulk of those who are paying income tax on small and moderate incomes today. He clearly indicated that by abolishing the far capita payment, the States would Cocks be compelled to, impose additional burdens upon those earning comparatively t h u r Cocks has small incomes.",44
139,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The incidence of taxation would be a matter of State l ed by the policy and one which a State Government should determine.,44
140,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"How ungenerous it is of the Treasurer, to endeavour to secure an advantage at the expense of the States, by requiring them to levy taxation upon persons who can ill afford to pay it. The honourable member for Barton was a colleague of Sir Arthur Cocks, who clearly stated that to alter the basis of the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States in the manner proposed was absolute political treachery. It was rumored throughout the House, and understood by some honourable members, that the honourable member for Barton was on this bill going to take a decided stand against the Government.",44
141,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Is the honourable member quoting the comments of Sir Arthur Cocks on the proposals submitted to the 1923 conference?,44
142,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes . The honourable member for Barton, in supporting the bill, endeavoured to indulge in a certain amount of cheap heroics; but I ask the honourable member to read a portion of the speech delivered hy Mr Loxton, who was once a member of the party to which the honourable member belongs, as reported in New South Wales Hansard of the 11th October, 1923. I shall be sufficiently generous not to quote that gentleman's remarks. The honourable member should play the game in this House, and realise that thore is a general desire on the part of honourable members to be consistent, and to assist in some practical way to put the politics of the country on a better level than they are today. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Perkins) is not supporting the bill upon its merits, but, because of the possibility of some other Government coming into power. If he thinks that he is going to determine the public policy of this country beyond the term of this Parliament he is greatlv mistaken. The honourable member is assisting in making laws for today, but I remind him that he is not a dictator of tomorrow. He may endeavour to use his powers in this Parliament to determine the future of the people, but the return of a Labour Government will determine the future policy of the country during its term of office and exercise of power, irrespective of the present wishes of the honourable member. Although he might feel that he is protecting the interests of a certain section from the actions of a future Labour government, I remind him that he has no power to prevent such contingencies. Therefore, it would have been as well if he had dealt with this issue on its merits and considered carefully how it will affect the financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States. The agreement made in 1910 to grant 25s. per head of the population had a definite relation to the amount of the Customs and excise revenue. In round figures it represented about 50 per cent, of the total income from those sources. Since then there has been an extraordinary increase in revenue from this form of taxation, with the result that the per capita payment of 25s. now represents only about 19.1 per cent, of the total Customs and excise revenue of the Commonwealth. It would appear, therefore,, that there is urgent need for a revision of the payments, with the object of bringing them more into line with our ideas of equity. South Australia has suggested that 50 per cent, of the Customs ancl excise revenue should be paid into a f u n d and disbursed to the States in Accordance with their needs. That proposal is really on the basis of the 1910 agreement. All honourable members, I believe, acknowledge that the present system is neither as scientific nor as equitable as it might be; but that does not justify the Government's proposal to discontinue the payments altogether at this moment and thus seriously to dislocate the finances of the various States. I trust that, even at this late hour, the Ministry will recognize its obligation to the States and the people whom we represent. No differentiation can be made between Federal and Stateelectors; they are the same persons, and they have every right to be considered in all proposals that so vitally affect them. The figures submitted by the Treasurer in support of the Government's scheme are unreliable. The honourable gentleman spoke of a natural increase in gross incomes of 6 per cent, per annum. As far as South Australia is concerned, and I believe the position is the same in the other States, instead of an increase in nross incomes there has been a con-, traction.",44
143,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The figures for last year show that there has been a bigger increase.,45
144,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"It is easy for the Treasurer, across the table, to denv the accuracy of what I am saying. I should be obliged if the honourable gentleman would quote his authority for that statement. My informant is the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation in South Australia. It is only right that, in these matters, we should know exactly where we stand. I want, not figures which the Treasurer himself may have manufactured, but informatio n from some reliable outside authority whose statementmay be accepted without reservation. The aggregation of incomes has been mentioned during the debate. It has been stated that the States have power to tax the aggregate incomes of their citizens, and that it would be lawful , as well as expedient, for the States to adopt the principle. Let me tell honourable members what the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) had to say on this subject at the Premiers' conference in 1923. This statement by Mir. Bruce is to be found on page 32 of the report of that gatheringThere is only one other proposition-that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the income taxation, because it is the body which can tax aggregate incomes. I thought it my duty to quote that statement of the Prime Minister, so as to give the right honourable gentleman an opportunity to reconcile, if he can, his declaration of today with his statement ot the conference in 1923. In view of the Government's declaration that its policy is to protect Australian industries, I am astounded that it should propose to withdraw from the field of direct taxation.",45
145,Mr WATKINS,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,That is the point.,46
146,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"If the Government intends to meet all its obligations, including commitments arising out of the war, from Customs and excise revenue, then it is clear that instead of the tariff being protective in its incidence it is merely a revenue-producing tariff, ancl as such cannot effectively protect Australian industries.",46
147,Mr WEST,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,A revenue tariff is the most pernicious system of taxation.,46
148,Mr MAKIN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"It is poor consolation to those who have invested capital in 'Australian industries, and are employed in the secondary industries, to know that the Government proposes to look to its Customs and excise revenue for all the money necessary to carry on Commonwealth activities. If we had an effective tariff, one which was truly protective in its incidence, instead of revenue from this source increasing in volume from year to year, it would steadily decrease, ancl consequently the Government would be obliged to look elsewhere for its income. Ministers must answer to the people for their stand upon this vital issue. The Government's proposal will enable the wealthiest sections of the community to evade their taxation obligations, with the result that these burdens will fall on the shoulders of those least able to bear them. The field of direct taxation proposed to be vacated was entered by the Commonwealth in order to meet its war obligations. No one will dare to say that those obligations have disappeared. As a matter of fact, we find that in some respects they have heen added to, so there is no justification whatever for this proposal to relinquish that source of revenue. The Government's proposal to meet those obligations from Customs and only excise revenue is really tantamount to a proposal to remit taxation of those who can best afford to pay it, and to place it upon the shoulders of those least able to pay. The bill will make the position of the people increasingly difficult and irksome. Both the Treasurer and the Prima Minister have shifted their ground from time to time in regard to this proposal. I am reminded of the logic of Walt Whitman's linesDo I contradict myself ? Well, I contradict myself. Am"" I inconsistent? Then I am inconsistent. The Treasurer would do well to take those words to heart, for they very aptly fit his position ancl that of his political chief. Time will prove the futility and the injustice of the proposals which the Government has submitted in this bill. The measure will not make for the peace, progress, and prosperity of the Commonwealth. On the contrary, it will prove unduly burdensome and irksome, and I feel sure that those honourable members who support it will have good reason to regret their action. The Government is guilty of a misuse of power in submitting this bill, which is wrong in principle ancl unfair in its incidence, and will be injurious to the people of the Commonwealth.",46
149,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"North Sydney) [8.301. - Before I deal with the arguments that have been advanced for and against the bill, I propose to say a few words about the principles that underlie the Constitution and the Federal pact upon which it is based. In its very nature a federation involves a division of rights and powers. I agree with the statement that the test of a measure is its probable effect upon the people. That is the supreme test. The people of the Commonwealth have, in their wisdom, appointed as their servants two instrumentalities, giving to the one authority in certain specified matters over a sphere as wide as the continent itself, and to the other authority, within the boundaries of each State, over many matters which concern the people more intimately. Ours is the majesty, tha pomp, and the glory of authority. We exercise functions, many of them remote from the daily lives of the people, yet necessary and most appropriate to the nature of the federal instrumentality created by the Constitution. The State Parliaments, on the other hand, are concerned more with the every-day affairs of the people. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) dwelt last night at considerable length on the extent and variety of the functions of the States. We have to bear in mind that the present distribution of powers has existed for 27 years with the authority and approval of the people, who have resisted every effort to amend it . Assuming that the people know what is best for themselves, and applying that test to this measure, we must assume, therefore, that they wish things to continue as they are. But all of us do not hold that view. Speeches have been made during this debate in disparagement of both antifederalists and unificationists. For my own part, I have always been in favour of the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth. To that end I led every fight prior to the last one for the amendment of the Constitution. But not even my bitterest enemy has ever said I am a unificationist. I speak, therefore, as one having authority and knowledge of this inatter. We have to remember that the present constitutional position was deliberately created by the people, who have given to the States certain definite functions, and vested in them certain powers, tlius creating moral, and, if you like, legal rights to sufficient revenue to discharge the duties entrusted to them. It would be absurd to suppose that the people vested the States with power to control education, police, land, railways, and the hundred and one things which f all withm their purview, and yet denied them the means with which to exercise these powers. Wo must assume, there for* that the distribution of powers gavn authority, explicit or otherwise, to raise revenue sufficient for their exereise. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Ley) stated that Mr Fisher, who was responsible for the Surplus Revemie Act of 1910, was opposed to the continuance of the per capita payments. That emphatically is not true. I was Attorney-General in his Cabinet, and am able to speak with assurance on that point. We were opposed to inserting in the Constitution the per capita agreement, which had been made by representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth We had already found by experience that in some respects the Constitution waf> not sufficiently elastic to meet the requirements of a progressive community and, therefore, we did not consider it proper for the Parliament of that day to legislate for posterity. Accordingly the arrangement for the payments to the States was embodied in a statute, but we always regarded it as an agreement. It was an agreement deliberateh entered into without duress of any yort. Upon the provisions of that agreement the country was unanimous, the only difference between the two political parties being as to whether or not the arrangement should be placed in the Coustitrtion . The electors endorsed the agn-ement, but preferred that it should be enshrined in a statute rather than be embodied in the Constitution. Statutory authority was given to it . At the expiration of ten years ithad come to be regarded as an integral part of the financial machinery of the Federation. It has now been in force for seventeen years, and I emphasize the point that, until the Treasurer introduced this measure some months ago, no one had suggested the revocation of that agreement or understanding by force majeure. Certainly an alteration ormodification of the arrangement had been suggested, but only suggested. There was no gesture of defiance; there vas nothing in the nature of an order ssued by a superior to an inferior. In he light of all that has come and gone, we are entitled to ask why this measure is being forced down our throats. What new set of circumstances has arisen to create a position so entirely foreign to that to which we have been accustomed for the last 27 years? Why should this Parliament be seeking to force au arrangement down the throats of the State Parliaments, which are equally under the protection of the Constitution which created the Federation. Whatever the States were originally, they are now sheltered by the Constitution. Their powers are limited by its provisions and, being limited, are clarified, strengthened, and sanctioned by it . It has been said that the for the Government action is the mandate of the people. I cannot that view. We all recollect well the circumstances under which the last general election was held. I have - the extract read by the honourable mem-' s ber for Herbert (Dr Nott), Prime Minister's policy speech, embodying all that is material olaim that there was a from the people for tinuance of the per capita payments. shall not read it, because it is too longthe Treasurer may do so later-but confident that of the 6,000,000 people in Australia, not 100 read that through. I do not admit for a moment that, it supports the contention that, the - Government has a mandate to abolish per capita payments by force. was not before the people. one honourable member can say during the last general he was asked a definite in regard to this proposal. tainly no one asked me a question concerning anything except the danger that was staring us in the face-the upon which the election turned, and but for which the composition of this Parliament would be very different from what it is. Having been returned on the crest of that gigantic flood of public how can anybody say that the presence of a tiny paragraph in the Prime speech regarding the financial arrangements-a tiny globule in a great body of foaming waters-is a mandate from the people ? There could not be a mandate unless the proposal was presented and understood by those who are supposed to have said, ""You must, or you may do this thing."" The people knew nothing of this proposal. mandate to do anything, except to take such steps as were necessary to prevent a recurrence of that unhappy state of affairs which disturbed the country at tfbat time. That we have a mandate to do that is undeniable, and perhaps would have been well if we had attended to that business. No one will say that, at this moment, the public is better protected against a recrudescence of the evil fljian on the day when the election was Mr Sughes. held. That was the v it a l issue at the polls. Whatever view honourable memjustification bers opposite may take of it , no one will deny that it went to the very accept root of our national and economic very well-being. Certainly they will not deny that it was the great, nay, the only, issue before the people. There was not a whisper during the camfrom the paign that the continuation of the per capita payments would create financial, to this industrial, or commercial disturbance. mandate The system had gone on its wav serenely the discon- for many years. I do not say for one I moment that a government is not entitled to legislate on matters not mentioned at I am an election. The first business of a government is to govern; but when it legisspeech lates without such authority, it should do so only in matters that are urgent, and were unforeseen when it appealed to the people. This matter was not The issue urgent; neither was it unforeseen. The Not system had been going on for many years, that, and many conferences had been held in election, regard to it . The right honourable gentlequestion man who is at the head of this GovernCer- ment had expressed a very definite opinion, which has been quoted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . issue M a k in ) , in which he ranged himself in unambiguous terms with those who believed that the per capita payments should continue, no matter what could be said against them, u n t i l a re-distribution of opinion, the powers of the Commonwealth and the States had placed their relations on a Minister's different basis. To that no exception can be taken. But when we remember that in 1910 this was a people's question, t : gives us reason to pause and think. Much has been said about this being a people's to question, and about the effect the proposal will have upon them. Then let us ask the people about it . They are able to say whether it is good or evil. When, There was no but a little while ago, the right honourable the Prime Minister led us into a hastily conceived campaign to amend the Constitution, which, he declared, placed us in an intolerable position, ieaving us without power to deal it with a matter upon which we had a distinct mandate, he aimed a blow, so the State righters said, at the heart of the States. What did the people say ? Why , they smote him hip and thigh! There never was in the history of the Commonwealth such a debacle. I have led three referendums, but the proposals I mitted never received such . a stinging rejection as those so strongly recomdetermined mended by the right honourable gentleI man. In the face of this verdict of reasons for my action. the people in favour of the States against the Commonwealth, how can be said that the people have given Government authority to remove from the statute-book this provision safewhy guarding the State's finances, which has now been with us for seventeen years? It is said that the per capita provision embodies a "" vicious "" principle, and that it is inequitable. Let us consider those b two statements. I am not going to say whether the principle is vicious or not, man knows that perfectly well. because in relation to the per capita agreement such a word means nothing. But by "" vicious"" honourable members that it is wrong, my reply is that it is wrong, or not, this principle received the approval of the founders the Constitution. The Braddon embodied it . It was endorsed, after ten This is probable enough. years' experience, by a new party that had risen up, the members of which were, to a very large extent, opposed, as I was, to the Federal bill. I , at any rate, one of the leaders of the anti-bill ment. Yet this party, which has ways stood for wider powers for the Commonwealth, supported the per canrita agreement. There is yet another reason this measure. why we must reject the argument that this principle is "" vicious,"" and it is the right honourable gentleman himself or his Government has adopted it . has calmly imposed a tax on petrol, has handed over the proceeds to such the States as have bent the knee to Baal and signed his agreement. To those who have not signed he has not given a penny. In New South Wales principle, whether it is vicious or uot, operates that every motorist in the try pays 2d. a gallon to the Commonwealth Treasury, and the State gets no ro&.d"" no twopence. But I must get off this tion of roads because on it I am a fanaa majority. tic. The right honourable gentleman finds himself in a most awkward position. I am not a mind-readerT am merely a member of - Parliamentbut if in 1922 I had said what be said, that I was a f i r m supporter of the principle of per capita subpayments, and had later found myself associated with a man who had to wipe them out by force, should be hard put to it to find Politics, like and adversity, make us acquainted with it strange bedfellows. Now, although I this sympathize with the right honourable gentleman, I cannot accept, as a reason we should agree to this measure, his statement that the per capita system of payments is inequitable, in that it gives to those who least deserve it . But whether it does or does not is not material. The ill leaves the inequality, if there be any, untouched. The right honourable gentleThe argument to which he probably attached if the greatest weight was that, as time mean went on, and impish fate turned a whether jaundiced eye upon him, there might come into power another government of bitten with a desire to put into clause force some grea*; scheme of reform. One never knows what may happen in this world. And so the right honourable gentleman feels that, in order to prevent these wellwas meaning but misguided men from doing movethese things, he must remove temptation alf r o m their path by getting r i d of the loot. In support of this laudable enterprise he suggests that we should support The intentions of the Prime. Minister are honourable, but utterly that futile. I know my honourable friends on the other side perfectly well, and weHe all know human nature. If Labour in . and the future should occupy these benches, of does the right honourable gentleman think that anything he can do, or that all of us can do, will stop them, when they have a majority behind them, from giving this effect to a programme which the people so bave elected them to put into force? The counright honourable gentleman might as well attempt to tie up a Bengal tiger with and Coates' cotton, as endeavour to arrest the quesprogress of the Labour party when it has The honourable member for Barton (Mr Ley) said this afternoon that we had to choose between two evils, and that in his opinion the suggestions made by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) were not so good as those of the Treasurer. The honourable member entirely missed the point of the argument. The right honourable member for Balaclava, who put forward certain proposals in 1919, discussed those proposals with the Premiers. And that is all he did do. I have never suggested that there is anything sacrosauet about the per capita payments; but I do say that there is an agreement to pay them, rhat this agreement was solevuuly entered into by the States and Commonwealth, endorsed by the people, aud given statutory authority, and that the per capita payments can properly be abrogated only by agreement, or by the direct authority of the people. If the servants of the people cannot agree among themselves as to how they shall carry out the will of their masters, then they should appeal to the people. The people, and they alone, should direct them. No one else has the right or authority to do so. The right honourable member for Balaclava in 1919 put forward certain proposals. Whether they were good or bad is not to the point, but whereas the right honourable member for Balaclava submitted his proposals to the Premiers, and accepted their refusal, thu present Treasurer forces his down the throats of the Premiers, and they are expected to submit whether they like it or not. The difference between the two methods is the difference between civilization and barbarism, between peace and war. The States and the Commonwealth are equally the servants of the people. We discuss matters with our equals; we give orders to our inferiors; wo fight our enemies. We, who are partners in this Federal pact, ought not, merely berausc we have a majority in this Parliament, to treat the other parties to the pact as if they were enemies or inferiors. It is true that we have a majority; but this majority did not come here authorized by its masters to do this thing. That is the poiut. The Premiers rejected the proposal of the right honourable member for Balaclava, and there the matter ended. It need not have ended thero, because the right honourable gentleman was a member of the strongest Government that has ever held office in this Parliament. It was not a composite Government made up of factions, but a united party of 50 members, and as everyone knows who rememAlr Hughe*. hers the circumstances of that time, it was only necessary to hold up one's hand in this place and any legislation one wished would have been passed. I remind my honourable friend, however, that although we had the power, we did not abuse it. The honourable the Treasurer has, by a turn of the wheel, come into office, and because the Premiers have not accepted his proposal, he is seeking to coerce them. I admit freely that the Premiers can be very irritating. At times they are extremely difficult to get on with, but I have never attempted to force things down their throats. The honourable gentleman has. To that we strongly object. The honourable member for Barton said that he preferred the Treasurer's proposal because it was sudden death with an , anaesthetic, whereas the other was slow torture. It is evident that running in the honourable gentleman's mind were the linesIf it were done. . . Then 'twere well It were done quickly. 1 can imagine the Prime Minister, a little reluctant, being addressed by his coadjutor the Treasurer. . . . Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The Government has no authority from the people to abolish per capita payments. No circumstances have arisen to change the situation that existed at the time of the election. Since then, there has been a direct reference to the people in regard to a readjustment of the powers of the States and the Commonwealth. On that occasion the people showed unmistakably that they were supporters of the States' attitude, and not of that of the Common, wealth. Many of us are very sorry that the people rejected the referenda proposals; but, in the face of that rebuff, I venture to say that the proper course for the Treasurer and for the Government to adopt is to submit this matter to the people, either by way of another referendum, or by the time-honored method, which has much to recommend it, of another election. It must not be thought that in anything I have said I have suggested that the Government is not actuated by the best motives; but we are told that the road to hell itself is paved with good intentions. I can well understand the attitude of the Treasurer: Ho has become tired of continued rebuffs, ho has put forward very many perfectly good schemes, which have been rejected again and again. l i e is annoyed; he is - angry. He has a majority, and what is the use of having a majority unless one uses it? That being the principle upon which he is working, be brings down this bill, and is determined to pass it . Although it is clear that if anything is of a non-party character this bill ought to be, we are told that it is to be made a party matter. That is quite wrong. B ut the reason why it has been made a party measure is obvious. If it were not, the bill would not stand one chance in 50 of being carried. shall say a word or two on that aspect later. For the present, what I have said may sink in a little. We are told that the bill has been brought forward to put an end to a condition of affairs that the Commonwealth has long outgrown; that the war created an entirely different set of circumstances, and placed upon the Commonwealth huge obligations. That is true, but as the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett J pointed out last night, it is obvious that the war is, financially at any rate, still with us, imposing upon us and on generations yet to very great burdens. Those burdens ought to be fair l y apportioned among all sections of society. We have to ask ourselves what would be the effect of this measure upon the taxpayers of this country. It is suggested that would make for economy. Some peopio have a passionate desire to reform others, and their leotures on economy are worth going miles to hear. For years in this Parliament we heard the honourable the Treasurer, as a private member, speaking of the virtues of economy. (Now that he is placed in a position of authority, he still continues his noble work, and never tires in his efforts to reform the spendthrifts in the States! He is the more determined to do this at the present time - because, - by an unhappy chance, in five of the States Ave have Labour Governments. In this Avay Ave are to k ill two birds Will the one stone. The Treasurer gets the credit of preaching economy, and at the same time puts a. dagger under the rib of our brothers, the Labour Premiers, We embarrass them. Wo compel them to shoulder the unpopular taxes; we denounce their profligate expenditure; we create a very aAvkward situation for them; ancl, in short, enjoy ourselves thoroughly. As for ourselves, we spend money left and right, and seek every day for some neAv thing upon which AVC can laA-ish millions. I come back again to the poor taxpayer. From his stand-point it does not matter A cry much whether he pays taxes r to the State or the Commonwealth. Both are instrumentalities through which the people govern themselves. Some day the people may devise better or different in I struments. But, at the back of the States and the CommonAvealth are the people. What effect is this bill going to have upon their pockets? Are they going to pay less? Are they going to get better value for their money? The Treasurer said that the field of taxation he is Avilling to hand over to them Would yield a larger sum than they receive under the per capita agreement. Assuming this will be so. Avhere would the additional money come from . It would come out of the pockets abo of the people; but not from the same people. Customs and excise taxation is the most ingenious method ever come devised for taking money fro m the people. The confidence trick and the thimble and pea arc fools to it . A virtuous person can avoid going to such haunts of vice as the racecourse, and, if he does go, ean avoid being victimized the bill by the thimble and pea trick. But nobody can escape paying Customs ancl excise duties, and what is more, the people do not realise that they are paying them. This is the kind of thing that appeals to the Treasurer. If and when he has palmed off the unpopular flaxes upon the States he will be able to go through the country on his tours, and the people will say, "" Lo, here comes a man after our own heart."" He gets r i d of the entertainments tax, ancl all the little children say, '-' God bless Dr Page."" He gets r i d of the land tax, ancl not the little children, but a few Avealthy people, bless him. There are a feAv people Avho Would benefit by the change, but those feAv, at present, contribute a good deal. Under the fifth Treasurer's proposal they Would pay less. As my friend, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) pointed out last night, nature, and especially a nature like that of the Treasurer, abhors a vacuum, and so this los3 which has to be made up will be made up by taxing the many instead of the few. There is no other way. So far as the land tax is concerned, what this proposal means in plain English is that, instead of estates of moderate size escaping with small payments, they would have to pay an added sum sufficient to make up for the loss on the great estates, that could not be taxed by the States individually. As I pointed out in this House when speaking on the proposed grant of wider powers to the Commonwealth, there are some things that the States cannot do. It is evident, on the Treasurer's own showing, that this bill will not result in a saving to the taxpayers. It may be Jones who will pay instead of Smith, but the Jones who will have to pay will be Jones, the man on the basic wage, or the small land-owner. It is very curious that the Treasurer who, when be first entered this House, advocated, with considerable force and earnestness, lower duties, deliberately seek to divest himself of aH forms of taxation except hated revenue taxes, which increase the cost of living to the man on the land. It is also most curious that since the honourable gentleman has been in office, the revenue fro m Customs and excise has grown out of all knowledge. He asks the people to accept this proposal because it will make for economy. But it will not save the taxpayer's money. Let hi-1 show wherethe taxpayers by and large-the whole country-wil l have to pay the same amount of money ns before. The honourable member for Barton (Mr L e y ) , who was hard put to it in coming to the defence of this bill rather hurriedly, was naturally a little at a loss to know what to say. He spoke of what would be saved by abolishing the bureaucratic staffs that now exist in the Federal Taxation Department. I point out, however, that if some were abolished, others would have to be created by the States, and in the aggregate the co<!t. of collection would be greater. There can be no doubt about that. The Government is on the horns of Mr fluyhet. a dilemma. Either the States will get the same amount of money-the Treasurer says they will get more-o r they will get less, in which case there will be chaos in regard to some of the State instrumentalities. If there is not sufficient money to carry on the busiuess of the .country the people will suffer. In place of progress there will be stagnation and unemployment. When there is disturbance of the financial equilibrium it reacts upon the whole community, and saps that feeling of confidence in the future, upon which, to a large extent, prosperity depends. Here is a financial edifice that has endured for 27 years. The people have never for a moment indicated that they desire to change radically the design of the building; but the Treasurer proposes to pull down one of its main pillars. At best, that will disturb the financial equilibrium of the States. It will embarrass and hamper them, and do good to nobody except the honourable gentleman himself. I do not say that there is no other way of meeting the need of the States except that of the per capita payments, but I do contend that none of the argushould ments put forward during the debate will j u s t if y any honourable member in voting the for the bill. It will not benefit the people. We hear from some - quarters about the demand by the wage-earner for ah increase in the basic wage. This will not lessen that demand. t The demand for increased wages is caused by the increase in the cost of living, the Treasurer, depending, as he will , upon high Customs revenue to make both ends meet, is not likely to do anything to reduce that cost. Why not should we pass this bill? It does not go to the root of the trouble of public finance. It will not reduce public borrowing. It will not lessen public expenditure. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) told us something last night which should be blazoned from one end of the land to the other. He said that, in the last six years",46
150,Mr WATT,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Since 1921.,52
151,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"We had borrowed £176,000,000. Are we to go on borrowing at this rate? It is a condition of affairs that cannot continue, and still leave the body politic normal. Whether Labour, Nationalist, or Composite Government is in power, this cannot go on. Yet this bill does nothing to remedy the evil. It will not reduce borrowing. It does not aet up a council to control borrowing. It leaves these vital things just as they are. It is a proposal which does nothing except, perhaps, for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Possibly it simplifies matters for him. At any rate, the Treasurer has set his mind upon it, and has determined to force it down the throats of the State Treasurers. But it will not help the people. If it would do something to reduce or regulate borrowing; if it would put the State debts upon a proper footing, or, as the right honourable member for Balaclava said last night, create a sinking fund that would really do something to provide for the redemption of debts as time went on it would stabilize our credit and improve it. If it would put an end to competition in borrowing as between State and State, by forming a loan council to control borrowing, it would be worthwhile. But it does none of these things. It simply transfers to the States some taxes now collected by the Commonwealth, and retains to the Commonwealth the whole of the Customs and excise taxation from which 25s. per head, or about £8,000,000 per annum, now goes to the States. And that is all it does. If we pass it, it must throw the finances of the States into confusion, and increase the amount of taxation which the great bulk of the people have to pay. It will lift considerable taxation from a few, the very rich, and place it on the shoulders of the rest of the community. As I have said, the Treasurer has a passionate desire to reform others. He, the Prime Minister, and, in fact, all of us, deplore the condition of the State finances. All seem to be on the borders of bankruptcy. And yet no one takes much notice, which is perhaps the most serious symptom of all. It has become well-nigh the normal condition of things, and is so regarded. What the people want is good government, ancl a reduction in taxation. Briefly, they want the best possible government at the least possible price. The Treasurer points to the extravagance of the States. He preaches economy, but he does not. practise it. Since this Government- I speak with particular reference to the Treasurer, of course-ha s been in power, we have had large increases in taxation. I used to sit in the Prime Minister's chair, and listen to the present Treasurer speaking, as a private member, from the Country party corner about the virtues of economy. I very well remember sitting there with the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Eyrie) when we had to submit to a reduction of £500,000 in our Defence estimates which the present Treasurer compelled us to accept. Last night, the Minister for Markets and Migration gave as one reason why this bill should be passed the fact that the Defence expenditure, without including the amount for naval construction, totalled £5,500,000, or thereabouts. I do not know what the estimate was when the honourable member for Warringah was in charge of the Defence Department's Estimates in this House.",52
152,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,It was not enough.,53
153,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I cannot get the reply that I want from my honourable friend, but at least I have this, that although the amount proposed by the then Government was really not enough, it was cut down on the motion of the present Treasurer. Now, when these very people are in office they come forward and plead with tears in their eyes for more money in order that they may provide for adequate defence. And this is advanced as one reason why we should repeal the per capita payment to the States. It was in his advocacy of reduced taxation that the present Treasurer shone most brilliantly when he was a private member. But what is his record ? When my Government went out of office the Commonwealth taxation per capita totalled £8 17s. l d . annually. Last year it was £9 Is. 6d. It is in this way, of course, that economy shows itseK most effectively! The net increase from 1922-3 to 1925-6 was 4s. 5d. per head of the population. We must add to this the petrol tax, which averages 6s. 8d. per head, and makes the increased taxation per capita no less than 12s. l d . as the result of four years' administration by this most economical Treasurer! It is from such a rostrum as this, and from the mouth of a champion economist like the Treasurer, that sermons are preached to the offending State Premiers in respect of their extravagance. When Satan reproves sin in this fashion it is difficult for Christians to know what to do. This measure will probably our attention for the of a fortnight, yet no one is able to say why it should introduced at this, or, in fact, an any juncture. We know that it is not urgent, because it was brought before us six months ago and dropped. Prime Minister was in England ing the banner of Australia, the Treasurer travelled about the country ad nauseam that he proposed to go on with it. His right honourable leader was no doubt staggered to hear this when he returned to Australia. that this bill will engage our for a fortnight, and we can ill spare so much time. I ask honourable do they remember that this was elected in December, 1925 ? Do they realise that seventeen months elapsed ? Do they remember that we were returned to give effect to a great programme ? Do they know that, among other things, we were pledged to carry out big reforms in the industrial which are impossible without great constitutional reforms? This was to have been a constitutional session. told last August it was essential the Constitution should be so amended, or the Commonwealth would topple. this has been put aside. We have heard no more of it. Instead, this little bauble has been brought forward, and now fills the centre of the stage. must necessarily be His Royal Highuess, the Duke York, is coming to Australia, we cannot carry on business while he is here. We must rise very soon, and nobody knows when we shall again be able to deal with serious business. are told that we must transfer to Canberra by the 9th of May. Whatever we shall do after that I do not know. is certaiu, however, that months must elapse before we can say one useful word about these many pressing problems which, at election time, we Mr Hughes. were told must be dealt with without delay. The constitutional session should be held now, if we are going to do anything useful in the way of amending our Constitution. I wish to say a word now about an entirely different aspect of the question. This measure creates a most invidious position for honourable occupy members of the Nationalist party. best part This is a composite government, and members of the Nationalist party have been support it . Many of those members who are now listening to me will be compelled most reluctantly, when the division bells riiifr. to vote for this bill. The While the Government has made a party meauphold- sure of a matter which the Nationalist organizations in some, if not all, reiterating States have denounced. I venture to say that it would be impossible to get 25 per cent, of the members of the Victorian Nationalist organization to vote in favour I have said of the bill. What an unfortunate posiattention tion for the members of the party to occupy! They are told by this compogentlemen site Government that they must supjiort Parliament the bill, but they look around and see the organization to which they owe their have positions denouncing it . Honourable members may vote for the bill, but oven if it passes that will not be the end of it . This bird will fly high, yet surely come back to roost, when honourable members sphere least desire it . The Government proposes to hold this sword of Damocles over the heads of its supjjorters u n t il 1928, so We were that this measure will come into that force about six months before the next general election. An y good All that is in it will not be seen before the election, but the evil in it certainly will . This measure will antagonize the States. It is going to make This sessiou them still more bitter against the very brief. Government and those who supof port it . It is going to make it and impossible for use to carry any amendments of the Constitution. It is going to weld the Labour forces into a solid phalanx against us. They will votu We solidly against the bill, and will pose, and properly too, as the friends of the States. What are my friends here going to pose It as? another six The consequences of this measure will grow and develop and reach their acute bursting point just about the time that we shall have to appeal to the peopleOn whose side shall we range ourselves? The question was not before the people at the last election, but it will be at the next. We shall then be asked to give an account of our stewardship. are we going to say? I intend to say that I am against this attempt to force the States to their knees, that I deplore the association of the right honourable the Prime Minister with the Treasurer, to whom, this measure is due. The organization of which I am a member is opposed to this bill ; so also are the vast majority of the people. The State Governments, whether they be Labour, Liberal, or National administrations, are opposed to it . There is no mandate for it . There is no reason for it . It will benefit none ex.ent, perhaps, a few very wealthy land-owners - Perhaps it is to secure their support that it is brought forward, or perhaps it is to benefit those little children concerning whom I spoke earlier. Whatever may be the reason for its introduction, it is not brought forward to benefit the people or in response to any public demand. is not brought forward because of anynew set of circumstances, but merely because the Treasurer has determined that it shall be brought forward. I am not going to condemn him,for his action. If he believes in the bill let him push on with it ; but as for me, I am going to oppose it and do all I can to make it impossible for him to give effect to it . I remind the honourable gentleman that fifteen months must elapse before the measure can become operative. He may think what he likes. Ho has here, perhaps, the numbers to give effect to it , but I do not believe that it will ever become law. If it does, and becomes operative, then I venture to say that on an appeal to the country some party will say, "" R e turn us, and we will repeal it . "" Such a promise will appeal to a great many. What position we as a party will be able to take up I do not know. Those honourable gentlemen v/ho can evolve a reason why we should do i u .1927 what was wrong and unthinkable in 1922 will , perhaps, supply the answer.",53
154,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Attorney-GeneralKooyong) [9.35] - The measure before the House has been submitted to Parliathe ment in accordance with the definitely declared policy of the Government at the last election.,55
155,Mr GREGORY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,That is not so.,55
156,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The r e is no room for doubt upon that question in the mind of What any one who refreshes his memory by reading the relevant portions of the Prime Minister's policy speech, which I propose to quote. The right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr Hughes) asserted that there was only one issue at the last election, that nothing else was before the people. Later, he was good enough to say that the Prime Minister had placed before the country a great programme which contained several items to the postponement of which he objected. Either statement may be correct, but both cannot be right. In the Prime Minister's policy speech this subject was referred to in unmistakable terms. I shall read the relevant portions of that speech, A fte r referring to the fact that there had been now more than 25 years' experience of federation, the Prime Minister, speaking at Dandenong, went on to Bay- It The ideal which the framers of the Constitution had before them was to weld Australia into one great nation, while preserving to the States their rights of self government. The greatest problem that had to be faced in the realization of this ideal was the question of Commonwealth and State finance. This question was dealt with by the States surrendering to the Commonwealth sources of revenue far in excess of the requirements of the Commonwealth. Of this revenue for the first ten years three-quarters was handed back to the States, and SIIICP the expiration of that period a ner capita grant of 25s. has been made by the Commonwealth to the States. The whole basis of these arrangements, however, was destroyed by the Great War. Having briefly enlarged upon that subject, he saidThe result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth today is raising revenues in order to provide the per capita payments to the States. This is contrary to the basic principle of national finance that every government shall have the responsibility of raising the revenue which it is expending. He further said that for the purpose of discussing this subject",55
157,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Why not read it all?,55
158,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I understood the right honourable gentleman to say that he was prepared to make up his mind on policy speech without reading it through, and had not read it .",55
159,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The Minister should continue.,56
160,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am prepared to read more if honourable members so desire. The payment of a population grant was, he saidContrary to the basic principle of national finance that every government should have the responsibility of raising the revenue it expended. Is not that the issue we have been discussing in this House? Is not that the proposition upon which this bill rests? Is not that the proposal to which the Prime Minister was referring when he plainly stated that the continuance of the capitation grant was inconsistent with a basic principle of national finance? The Prime Minister went on to speak of the special position of Western Australia and Tasmania, and concluded this portion of his speech by sayingThe Government is giving careful consideration to the questions raised as a result of the investigations of the Western Australian royal commission, and proposes in the near future to invite the States to attend a conference for the purpose of reconsidering the financial relations between the Commonwealth und the States and dealing with the disabilities suffered by certain States with a view to laying down a basis for our national development in which the Commonwealth and the States will co-operate. At this conference an opportunity will be afforded to consider all questions affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States, including the question of new states. That conference was held in 1926, in accordance with the Prime Minister's promise to representatives of the States, who were doubtless entitled, from their own point of view, to adopt the position, with respect to Commonwealth and State finances, that there was only one possible solution of the problem, and that was the continuance of the payments. The States were adamant and would not make any agreement involving their surrender. The Prime Minister made it perfectly plain that the existing system upon which the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States was based was, in the opinion of the Government, unsound, that it could not be allowed to continue, and that he proposed to ask the representatives of the States to attend the conference for the purpose of evolving an alternative system. When that conference was held, the States, as they were gentleman quoting? fully entitled to do, said that they insisted upon the continuance of the present system, and would not consider anything else. In view of that attitude, we are now asked to accept the position that any alteration of the financial relations be-tween the Commonwealth and the States should be preceded by some agreement. That means that so long as any State or a substantial number of States, withhold agreement, nothing can be done, and matters must remain as they are. I submit that an earnest attempt has been made to arrive at an agreement upon this matter, that the States have deliberately refused to enter upon auy discussion of an alternative to the per capita payments, and that the responsibility, therefore, devolves upon this House of considering whether the payments shall be allowed to continue. Appeals have been made to the Government-the last was by the right honourable member for North Sydney-to approach this subject in a kindly and friendly manner, with a view to securing State co-operation. The right honourable gentleman has at all times been so distinguished for the mildness and gentleness of his own methods that it is difficult to resist the appeal. I suggest, however, that every effort to arrive at an agreement upon this subject with the representatives ""of the States has failed. They have taken up a position which prevents discussion, and the matter must therefore be determined by Parliament. That has been the view, T think, of all representatives of the Commonwealth who have had the responsibility of dealing with this subject, which has been under consideration on many occasions. A conference on this subject was held in 1909, legislation was introduced in 1910, and, in 1919, when the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) was Treasurer, another conference was held. There were further conferencss in 1920, 1923, and in 1926. It cannot, therefore, be said that this subject is being sprung upon the people, or that it is in any way being rushed. At the conference in 1920 the then Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) dealt with this matter, and in plainly expressing his views, said",56
161,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,What is the honourable,56
162,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am about to quote from the official report of the conference, and I think it is only proper to say that the right honourable gentleman in expressing the view of his Government was asking the States to attend a convention to discuss the matter. The right honourable gentleman on that occasion saidIn all the circumstancesHe was referring to the warsince the money conies out of the pocket of the taxpayer, whether in State or Commonwealth, I cannot see my way to say that the per capita payment shall continue. We ehall hear all you have to say, hut the position we take up now is, in view of what has been said, and the attitude of the States in regard to the referendum, and in regard to the expenditure of public money, and the offer by the Commonwealth to commit itself to an expenditure of very many millions£4,800,000 for the railway gauge, und one-quarter of the increased expenditure on the Murray waters scheme, or not less than £8,000.000-that we cannot continue the per capita payment. Notwithstanding the offer of the Commonwealth to engage in the expenditure alluded to, we can arrive at no sort of agreement. In all the circumstances, we must ask you to adjust your finances upon the assumption that the per capita payment will be reduced as set out by Mr Watt.",57
163,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Was any attempt made to take it from the States?,57
164,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That was the policy, as stated by the right honourable gentleman at that conference. I presume it was the considered policy of the then Commonwealth Government. It is true that it was not persevered with hy them.",57
165,Mr HUGHES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Quite r i g h t ; that is exactly what I said. - Mr LATHAM - The position is apparently fair l y summarized in a question which the right honourable gentleman put at the same conference. Fihelly, who represented Queensland at that gathering, asked whether t h j Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had any sense of equity, and saidEither it is a fair thing to continue the subsidy to the States, or it is a fair thing to take it away from them. To that Mr Hughes repliedDo you want equity or do you want the per capita grant ?",57
166,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,What is the the conference?,57
167,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I am quoting fro m the report of the Premier's conference held in May, 1920. Honourable members will, I hope, remember that I have said that, allied to the declared policy of the then Commonwealth Government, was a proposal for a convention; I do not wish to be misunderstood on the point. This bill proposes the repeal of the Surplus Revenue Act, and provides for the making of equivalent payments to the States during the coming financial year, and the granting of financial assistance to the States of Western Australia and Tasmania. The bill itself shows upon its face that it is in tended to hold a conference with the States, if the States are prepared to attend a conference, and meet and discuss these important matters with representatives of the Commonwealth. At that conference the whole position will be open to discussion, subject to the decision which this Parliament is asked to make, that, the population grant is wrong in principle. The Government is taking the responsibility of asking the House to do that. It would, be easy for the Government to say, "" We will abandon our policy and merely have a conference with the States."" I suggest, however, that there is a question of principle involved in this, and that the Government would be unworthy of its position if it were ready to take any of these easy methods of retreat. The House is asked to determine whether or not the population grant is sound in principle. Unless other legislation were brought into alter what the Prime Minister, in his policy speech, described as the unsound principle upon which the per capita grant had been made, the Government would not be endeavouring to carry out the nolicy proclaimed by him Mr during the last election campaign.",57
168,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,The Prime Minister said it would be ocnsidered. The Ministry is getting worse every step it takes in this matter.,57
169,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"May I remind the honourable member who has just interjected that what the Prime Minister said was that a conference would be called to deal with the issue. That conference was date of called, and it - was impossible to arrive at an agreement, because the representatives of the States would not discuss any alternative scheme.",57
170,Mr FOSTER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Now the Government proposes to abolish the payments altogether.,58
171,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The conference having been held, and no result having been achieved, the question is whether we should wait indefinitely. The suggestion BLOW made is that these niatters can never be dealt with unless the States agree with the Commonwealth. That is t b "" question which I wish to approach now. The people have expressed their opinion on this particular issue. The will of the people with respect to these matters is to bo found in the Commonwealth Constitution itself. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , who has a very full knowledge of this subject, referred to the history of the Federal Conventions. Ho referred to the referendum of 1898, when section 87 of the Constitution did not have the ten-year limitation in it with respect to the return of three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue to the States. The right honourable gentleman spoke also of the Premiers' Conference, at which an arrangement was made for the imposition of a ten-year l i m it upon the constitutional right of the States to share in the Customs revenue; but, probably by inadvertence, he did not mention that the Constitution was submitted to the people again at a referendum in June, 1S99, and was adopted in its present form , so that the provisions of the Constitution represent the will of the people upon this matter. Those provisions are to be be found in sections 87 and 94. I shall not weary honourable members by reading them, but I should like to remind them that they provide that, after, the first ten years of federation, this Parliament has the right to determine the basis upon which the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, if there be any, shall be paid to the States. Tliose sections impose upon this Parliament, not only the right, but also the responsibility, of determining this questiou.",58
172,Dr MALONEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Do not those sections deal with the method of payment until Parliament otherwise provides?,58
173,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes: the point I nui making is that they place entirely within the powers of this Parliament the power to determine the matter They have been discussed and determined by the people, and there is no doubt as to the powers of this Parliament to deal with the per capita payments as now proposed. It is obviously important, however, that the States should be consulted. That has been done already, and it is proposed to consult them again. As far as the strict legal position is concerned, however, this Parliament has full power to act. The question which arises under section 94 is with respect to payment to the several States of - all surplus revenue to the Commonwealth. That section statesAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. If there is surplus revenue, it should be distributed to the States. This matter has been litigated in the High Court, ancl it was laid down by that tribunal, in an action brought against the Commonwealth by one of the States, that the responsibility of determining whether or not revenue was surplus rests with this Parliament. That is to say, the matter is entirely in the hands of this Parliament. The real question which arises on the present occasion is this: Is the Commonwealth bound to raise surplus revenue in order to be in a position to pay over surplus revenue to the States? That, I suggest, is not the only question but one of the real questions to which we should direct our attention. As long as the States receive money from the Commonwealth, it is clear that they are dependent on the will of this Parliament. I put it that, speaking generally, it is a sound principle that Parliaments should be responsible for raising the revenues which they spend. I say, speaking generally, because, in some cases, it is impossible to apply that principle, and it should not be operated unwisely. The Constitution provides for the giving of financial assistance to the States on certain terms and conditions; but the essence of the Federal' system is that there shall be separate sovereignty in the Commonwealth and the States; that the Commonwealth and the States shall have full powers with in their respective domains. The essence of sovereignty is independence of external control. Comparisons have been made between the grants made by the Commonwealth Parliament to the States on the oue hand, and grants made by State Parliaments to municipal councils on the other hand. The position is entirely different. Municipal councils are creation of State Parliaments, whereas the States and their Parliaments are in no sense a creation of the Federal Parliament. They are independent entities not deriving their existence or power from the Commonwealth, and the principle of federation is that within their spheres each shall be independent, and as sovereign as circumstances permit. The existing provision does not satisfy that Federal criterion, because the States arc entirely dependent for a large proportion of their revenue upon the will of the CommonwealthParliament, which will may be changed at any moment. Disguise the position as we may, the States are in a position of absolute financial in security, because this Parliament is able, by merely repealing a statute, to deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue. I propose to show how the Government's proposal will improve their position. There is, and should be, no means of binding this Parliament in respect of the exercise of its legislative powers. It must retain the right to legisla!--->. under all its powers at any time, as it thinks proper. But, if the proposed si'homo be adopted, the States will, fro m a practical point of view, be in a more siicure position than they occupy today. If some scheme can be devised at the proposed conference, uncier which liabilities of the States will be assumed by the Commonwealth, to that extent the States will be in a secure position, so far as they can be secure without an absolute abrogation of Commonwealth powers. Accordingly, this bill and the proposed conference offer to the States a degree of financial security which is not obtainable by any means other than an amendment of the Constitution, which nobody has yet suggested. The fundamental financial vision of the Constitution, upon which this bill is based, is that the Couunonwealth has exclusive power in relation to the imposition of duties of - Customs and excise. In all other fields of taxation, the powers of the Commonwealth are concurrent with those of the States, but if there are to be duties of Customs and excise, as there must be, they must be imposed by the Commonwealth, which must leceive the revenue. The Federal authority need not, as the a constitutional matter, raise any other revenue; that is a inatter of polioy to be determined by this Parliament. But Customs and excise revenue is the p r i mary source of Commonwealth finance, because that revenue, at least, the Commonwealth must receive. A policy of Customs and excise duties is devised for the protection of industries or the taxation of luxuries, and not for the raising of money to be handed back to the States. It is difficult to conceive of any Parliament framing a Customs ancl ""excise policy in accordance with protectionist principles or for the taxation of luxuries, and then saying, "" That will produce a certain amount, but we shall have to find some more money to hand back to the States, and, therefore, we shall increase the duties."" It is impossible to devise any coherent policy of Customs and excise duties which, within its own limits, would provide for the payment of moneys to the States, and there is no obligation upou this Parliament to attempt to frame such a policy. Certain Commonwealth charges and expenses are inescapable, notwithstanding the derision with which I have heard that word received during this debate. It is all very well to say that statutes can be repealed, but can we repudiate the interest on our war loans, or the obligations in respect of war and old age pensions? Certainly not. These in escapable charges absorb the whole of the Customs and excise revenue, aud the. Commonwealth is imposing direct taxation to the amount of about £7,600,000 merely i u order to raise money to hand over co the States. If the Customs and excise revenue exactly eqtialled the expenses of the Commonwealth, would it be suggested that the States were still entitled to a share in that revenue? If the primary f u n d upon which the Commonwealth has pro- t.o depend is completely exhausted by undoubtedly legitimate and inescapable charges, how caii it be suggested that there is any surplus in which the States are entitled to share? The claim of the States to a share in that revenue is not only unjustified by any provision in the Constitution-whie h is the only expression of the will of the people-bu t is also futil e and unintelligible when the financial position is closely examined. I come now tc the proposal which the Commonwealth submitted to the States, and which they, up to the present, have rejected It has been criticized from many points of view, and particularly by the member for Henty (Mr Gullett), upon the ground that it involves an abandonment of direct taxation by the Commonwealth. I remind the honourable member that 60 per cent of the Commonwealth income taxation will remain, and that represents a very substantial sum indeed. The 'honourable member appeared to assume that direct taxation, once lifted, will never be reimposed. It is of the essence of the Government's scheme that the States, which are confined by the Constitution to direct taxation, are to raise their own revenues to make good what they lose through the discontinuance of the per capita payments. Therefore, the picture which the honourable member for Henty drew, of the results of the abandonment of direct taxation, does not truly represent the effects of the adoption of the Government's proposals.",58
174,Mr THEODORE,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"But the States be driven to impose higher railway freights, for instance.",60
175,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That is a different point. The honourable member for Henty submitted a most interesting argument based on the assumption that all Commonwealth direct taxation would be abolished, and that therefore direct taxation would be largely reduced in Australia. The reply to that argument is, first, that the Commonwealth would keep in operation no less than 60 per cent, of the income tax, and, secondly, that the States would, by their own legislation, raise an amount approximately equal to the amount now paid in per capita grants. The honourable member for Henty (Mr . Gullett) objects to the Commonwealth reducing direct taxation; but the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), at the last Premier's conference which he attended, urged and besought the Commonwealth to go out of the field of direct taxation entirely. Accordingly those who are opposing this measure are doing so for diametrically opposite reasons. The proposals of the Commonwealth involve not absolute and final remission of direct taxation, but a redistribution of taxation. The position at present is that, where a taxpayer pays, say, £100 under certain heads to the Commonwealth and the States-let us suppose £70 to the Commonwealth and £30 to honourable the States-h e shall pay, say, £50 to the Commonwealth and £50 to the States. So far as the taxpayer is concerned, the change will make very little or no difference. - W it h much surprise, I have heard repeated in this chamber what has been said again and again outside, that Customs revenue is easy money, and that money raised by direct taxation is hard money, the raising of which exposes a government to criticism. It has become almost a commonplace among opponents of these proposals, to be accepted as a matter of course, that a government raising money by indirect taxation receives no criticism, whereas one raising money by direct taxation is exposed to the concentrated fire of public opinion. But what do we find? I think I may apply, not unfairly , my experience in this House. I have never heard any may attacks made upon the Government for maintaining the land tax, the entertainments tax, the probate duties, or the income tax; but the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), the honourable member for Porrest (Mr . Prowse), and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) criticize the imposition of indirect taxation. If one may assume that these honourable members are representative of their constituents, as we all deem them to be, may we not fair l y say that our experience in this House shows that indirect taxation is criticized much more than direct taxation? Is not that our experience from day to day, and from week to week, and does not every honourable member know it? The suggestion that it is easy to raise money through the Customs, .and that a government is immune from criticism in so far as it derives its revenue from that source, is very far from the fact. A government is open to criticism however it raises its revenue; but in the Commonwealth sphere the criticism is against indirect rather than direct taxation. There has, apparently, developed suddenly a general admiration of the present system of Commonwealth taxation, and we have learned that the system is not to be touched; that it is sacrosanct; that it is almost perfect; and that it must not be altered, because abandonment of any of the taxes is in some way wrong in principle. Certain of our taxes represent policy. tariff and excise duties, for example, represent a definite policy. The land tax represents a policy which, I understand, when it was imposed aimed at breaking up large estates in the country, but which raises a large amount of revenue from valuable properties in the cities. Until recent years, however, that tax had a distinct effect in breaking up estates in the country. The rest of our taxation has been imposed simply to raise money, and for no other purpose, and taxation imposed simply to raise money is not based upon wonderful principle with which it is improper to interfere. The Commonwealth Government has submitted to the States certain figures, which are before honourable members in a paper which has been circulated to them. Those figures have been challenged only in very general terms. I am well aware that various representatives of the States have said that the States cannot raise this money, or that there is something wrong with the Commonwealth figures; but I have not yet been sufficiently fortunate to hear any direct attack upon any particular figure in the statement. The source of every figure is stated in a footnote, in order that any honourable member may turn up the authority for the figures upon which the statement is based, and determine for himself whether they are correct. There is not a figure, except those that are mere additions, to which there is not a footnote showing how it has been arrived at.",60
176,Mr GREGORY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The States have chalcided lenged them,",61
177,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,All the States have done is to challenge them in general terms.,61
178,Mr YATES,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,South Australia has appointed a commission.,61
179,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"That State has appointed a commission to consider the position of South Australia in relation to the Commonwealth-quite a natural thing for it to do. Although I am aware that the former Premier, Mr. Gunn, made the general statement that South Australia could not raise the amountmentioned, no details have been given. The Mr STEWART - Has not the commission power to investigate the figures?",61
180,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I have no doubt that it will examine them. At the conference in 1926 the States' representatives refused to examine them, and since then they have not pointed out to the Commonwealth Government any error in them. One of the recent acts of the Commonwealth Government was to offer a royal commission, with one member appointed by the States, for the purpose of examining the figures; but the States refused to any agree to the appointment of it. The 'Government has done everything possible to show the accuracy of the figures by stating their sources, and by giving the States an opportunity of examining them, and, if they could do so, of demonstrating where they were wrong. I wish to deal with one point on the subject of aggregation. Several honourable members have said that it is beyond the power of the States to aggregate, for the purpose of taxation, any property, whether in the form of land or not, under the land tax or estate duty acts, or incomes under the income tax acts. That statement 4'.ias been made by several honourable members, but none has cited any authority for it except the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), who referred to a case decided in the High Court, in which it was determined that certain legislation of the State of Queensland was invalid. That was a case in which I appeared for the State of Queensland, and, unfortunately for my client, failed to convince the High flnurt that T was right. The point dewas that a Commonwealth statute having declared that interest from Commonwealth loans should be exempt from State taxation, a Queensland act which brought exempt income into account for the purpose of determining tax was invalid. It is the first ease ported in volume 29 of the Commonof wealth Law Reports. The reason for whether situated the decision - was that the legislation was inconsistent with a Comoperation monwealth statute providing State burden should be placed upon taxpayer by reason of his receiving terest upon Commonwealth loans. decision has no application to the subbut ject of aggregation. No authority has been been challenged on this point. cited in support of the proposition the States cannot legally aggregate, although I have examined the matter am not aware of the existence of any lawyer in such authority. Bu*- for many years, as have tested its honourable members know, the existence validity been questionable. of double taxation has caused trouble. Two countries sometimes tax same individual. A person resident one country may be subject to taxation in respect of income derived from anonly other country. This occurs when a resition. dent of Great Britain draws his income, or part of it, from a dominion. many years the British Government taxed persons who reside for more than six months of the year in Great upon profits and gains from any busimy ness, wherever carried on, from fession wherever* practised, property wherever situated. ciple of aggregation has for many years been a well-recognized principle come taxation in Great Britain. lawyer, so far as I am aware, has yet suggested that it is illegal. The ment of the Commonwealth a power to impose income taxation as the Parliament of Great Britain, that power has been exercised by it. The Commonwealth tax on absentees property is situated in Australia analogous to the British practice. we wished, we could amend section 10 of may authorize the aggregation. our Income Tax Assessment impose a tax on income derived any source whatever, and not merely from sources in Australia, as is done in Great Britain. An actual example was ferred to, I think, by the member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron), which shows what the States have been or the income with in that State. doing for many years. In 1892 cession and Probate Duties passed in Queensland, and it was probut vided in it that for determining the rate Mr Latham. the rate of of succession duty there should be aggreregated, so as to for m one estate, the value all the property passing under the will, within or outside Queensland Queensland.

182,Mr COLEMAN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Does section the Constitution nffect the taxing power of the States?,63
183,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I do not, as at present advised, regard that section as standing in the way, because, for example, a New South Wales saying that all persons subject to the law of that State deriving in come from other States should pay in n certain way, would apply to them whether they resided in New South Wales or not, just as absentees who derive income from Australia have lo pay the Commonwealth income tax. It has been said that the States could not raise from the fields of taxation which are proposed to be abandoned money needed to compensate for the cessation of the per capita payments. May I again invite attention to the figures and the footnotes which have been circulated ? These figures show the actual proceeds of the existing Commonwealth taxation. A footnote indicates that land tax was reduced by 20 per cent, in 1922-2?!. The entertainment tax has also been reduced, it formerly applied to every ticket of more than 6d. in value, but now it only applies to tickets valued at 2s. 6d. or more. The proceeds from that tax have fallen from £675,000 to £320,000; and this has been by reason of the reduction in the rate of tax, and not by reason of any falling-off in the productive field. Income taxation produced £16,790,000 in 1921-22, and it is now producing only about £11,000,000. The rate of tax has been reduced three times recently by 10 per cent., 10 per cent., and 12£ per cent, respectively. Seeing that much larger sums have been raised in these fields of taxation than they are at present yielding, except in the case of estate duties, which have not been altered, how can it be suggested that there is no taxable field from which the States cotild raise the money which the Commonwealth is now raising j f it were necessary for them to do so? If the States wished to obtain a larger revenue than that which they at present receive from the per capita payments, all they would have tn do would be to readjust their rates of taxation. Obviously there is a large margin in the three fields which I have mentioned. 117 of Among the critics of this proposal there appear to be some people who are honestly unaware that the Government is proposing to reduce Commonwealth taxation to the extent of the amount paid to the States in capitation grant. This subject has been looked at far too much act, as if it were merely the abolition of the capitation grant. It is really the abolition of the per capita grant and a reduction of Commonwealth taxation to an amount, at least equivalent, and on the figures more than equivalent, to that which is now paid to the States. Let me take the case of my own State of Victoria for a moment. If the Commonwealth proposal were adopted there would be a saving to the Victoria n taxthe payers of more than £125,000 upon tba them only figures which have yet been submitted to the public. The Victorian Treasurer (Sir Alexander Peacock) denies that this is so, but he has given no details to support his denial, nor has he challenged a single figure i,n the Commonwealth statement. This statement shows from whence every figure is derived. Sir Alexander Peacock gave an interview to the press yesterday on this subject, and as a Victorian I ask the forbearance of honourable members whilst I deal briefly with the eight points which he submits for the consideration of the Victorian people. The first point is as .follows: The Federal Goveniment neither asked for nor obtained a mandate from the people at the general election. I have already read that part of the policy speech of the Prime Minister which dealt with the capitation grant. It stated quite definitely that the Government considered that the present scheme was based on unsound financial principles, and expressly declared that the matter should be re-examined.",63
184,Mr STEWART,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The word "" abolition *' does not appear at all.",63
185,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"The part of the speech dealing with the per capita payments reads as follows: The whole basis of these arrangements, however, was destroyed by the Great War. . . . The result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth today Is raising revenues in order to provide the p»r capita payments to the States. This is contrary to the basic principle of national finance that every government shall have the responsibility of raising the revenue which it is expending.",63
186,Mr GKEGOEY,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I read the report of the speech in. the Argus, and I do not remember reading that.",64
187,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I assure the honourable member that it appeared in the Argus. I had some difficulty in securing the copy of the speech from which I have just quoted, and I obtained a copy of the Argus and found that those precise words appeared in it . Some honourable members apparently wish to frighten the Government by referring to supposed decisions of government supporters outside of Parliament, and by referencesto the general elections. The Government regards this as a matter of principle of the greatest urgency and importance, alike to the Commonwealth, the States, and the people of Australia as a whole. An y honourable member is entitled to the opinion that this is wrong. surely not suggested that, though the Government sincerely believes that a proposal, important on the ground of principle, and affecting the whole future of the Commonwealth, should be introduced to Parliament, it should be abandoned because some of its supporters outside of Parliament are opposed to it . The Government is not prepared to abandon this proposal. Sir Alexander Peacock's second point wasThe majority against the federal refeTendum proposals last September was increased because the people were incensed against the Federal Government for a proposed tyrannical misuse of power in respect to the abolition of the payment of 25s. a head of population annually to the States.",64
188,Mr SCUXIJN,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"""Will the Attorney General say that there was anything definite in the policy speech declaring that the Government intended to abolish the per capita payment?",64
189,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes ; the Government stated that, in its opinion, the per capita payments were founded upon an unsound principle, and that the whole question would have to be re-examined. That is quite plainly stated. It can hardly be said that the second point made by Sir Alexander Peacock is a reason against these proposals. Is the Government never to attempt to give effect to its policy? Is there no responsibility upon it at all? Is it , simply because there is opposition from some of its supporters, to abandon any proposal that it may make? The third point made by Sir Alexander Peacock was stated as follows:There would have heen no federation (he spoke as a member of the Constitutional Convention) without a financial partnership between the Commonwealth and the States regarding the distribution of Customs and excise revenue. The history of the matter shows that the partnership was limited for ten years. It was that change in the federation scheme, and the Federal Capital proposals, that caused New South Wales to agree to federate. The partnership lasted for ten years and was then terminated in accordance with the Constitution. The fourt h point made by Sir Alexander Peacock is stated as follows:It wa3 impossible for Victoria to incorporate in its taxation system the direct taxation the Federal Government proposed to relinquish, and it would be forced to throw the But it is income tax system now in force into the melting pot and mould a new scheme with a distribution over a much larger area than at present. The alternative was to cut down services now considered essential. It is obvious that if the Victorian Parliament is prepared to increase its probate, land, and income taxes, it will be able to recoup itself for the loss of the per capita payments. Amended taxation laws may be necessary; but are we to accept it as a principle that the States are not to amend - their taxation legislation? The f if t h point isI t was fair for all classes of the community to contribute to the upkeep of social services to fulfil the primary functions of government, and that this contribution was secured by receiving a share of Customs and excise revenue. The members of the State Parliament, who were closer to the people by reason of greater numbers and smaller constituencies, had voted unanimously against the abolition of per capita payments, and the press had voiced similar protest.",64
190,Mr FENTON,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,What was the honourable gentleman's own attitude at the last election ?,64
191,Mr LATHAM,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"I said on the platf o r m that I was in favour of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States being separated, so that each should assume responsibility for raising the money it expended, and that, if I were returned, I would do all I could to bring about a more sensible system of finance than existed in the capitation grant. I have already submitted that this is a question affecting not the levying of direct taxation, but the redistribution of direct taxation between the Commonwealth and the States. The sixth point readsI t was as unfair for the Federal Government to put special grants for Western Australia and Tasmania in the same bill as the abolition of per capita payments as it would be to tack a tariff bill on to an appropriation bill. That point has not been taken, in this House, and is rather a matter for honourable members, who, up to the present, have not found it embarrassing, or, if they have, delicately refrain from mentioning it. The seventh point readsVictorian members of the Federal Parliament, whether members of the House of Repreno sentatives or senators, would be unmindful of the interests of Victoria if they voted the abolition of per capita payments, would take a decided step towards reducing the status of the State whose interests sliould guard. I have endeavoured to give reasons the adoption of this policy would financially advantageous, particularly to Victoria, and would improve its status. I have also endeavoured to show that it is in accord with approved Federal principles. The eighth and last point readsThe injury Victoria would receive if the Federal bill were carried would be intensified by the knowledge that it had provided a majority of the salaries of members of Ministry which had submitted the bill. Whatever our views may be upon the bill, it is unnecessary for me to a statement of such a character in this House.",64
192,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,Order ! The M in ister's time has expired.,65
193,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Fawkner) [10.43] As I am usually a supporter of the Government, and intend to vote against this bill, I do not wish to record a vote. I propose, therefore, to discuss briefly some of the considerations will determine my vote. The question the House is asked to decide is whether the per capita payment to the States, which has been in existence for the seventeen years, is to be discontinued. For the first ten years of the Commoni wealth's history, the governments of the because it is a plank in the platform of States were entitled to the return of three-fourths of the Customs revenue. Then, by agreement with the States, the Federal Parliament determined upon a. per capita payment of 25s. I emphasize that that was done after consultation with the States, and by agreement with them. That arrangement still exists, but this Parliament is now asked to put an end to it . Why should that be done? That is the simple question which I , as a representative of the people, have to ask myself. We are told by the Government that under the Constitution it rests with the Federal Parliament to say whether this arrangement is to continue. It is true that the Surplus Revenue Act provides that the arrangement shall continue u n t i l Parliament otherwise provides, and one suggests that the Federal Parliament has not the right to terminate the for per capita payment if it so desires. But and would that be a fair thing to do? That they is the whole question. I agree that the State Governments have no constitutional or legal right to the continuance of the why arrangement made_in 1910, and it may be be said that they have no moral right. But the States have a moral right to fair treatment at the hands of the Federal Government, which is all they ask. I suppose we mav assume that the Parliaments of the respective States represent the opinion of the people of those States, and, if that is so, the opinion of the people as expressed through the State Parliatho ments is that the payments should continue. Mr SciTiLisr - That is the unanimous answer opinion of the State Parliaments.",65
194,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"Yes . Five of the State Parliaments are controlled by La- bour Governments; but I remind the Government that the sixth parliament is controlled by a composite government in which the National and Country parties are represented as they are in the Comsilent monwealth Government. The composite Government of Victoria is in agreement that with the Labour Governments of the that other States in demanding that the payments be continued. We have been asked to say that the measure should be treated last as a non-party question. I say that it should be treated as a party question, and f it were, it would certainly be defeated, every party represented in this House that the per capita payments shall continue. If the members of this House are true to the platforms of the parties to which they belong, they w i ll vote against this bill. The Labour party, as we know, is pledged to the continuance of the per capita payments. As for the Country party I have, within the past day or two, had placed in my hands the constitution and platform of the State and Federal Country partu, which is represented in the present Government. Three of the Ministers in this House are members of the Victorian Farmers' Union, which is the organization behind the Country party in the State of Victoria. There is no suggestion in the rules and platform of the Victorian Farmers' Union or the Country party in Victoria that it favours the withdrawal of the per capita payments, which we are now told represent a vicious principle of finance. I turn now to the platform of the National party, to which I am proud to belong. The National Federation is the organization behind that party in Victoria, and, indeed, throughout Australia. plank in its platform readsThe maintenance of the 25s. per capita payment to the States until such time as a satisfactory alternative is agreed to. That is the position in which we, as members of that organization, find ourselves. So far as the Victorian are concerned-I do not know so much about the Nationalist members in the other States-that organization hind all Nationalists, and assists in their candidature. The Prime Minister himself was selected by the Federation to contest the Flinders division in 1918, and I am sure that events have proved that the was amply justified in its Among those present at the annual conference of that organization, months ago, were the Attorney-General for Victoria (Mr Eggleston) tor Pearce, as representing the Commonwealth Government. After hearing those two gentlemen the Conference that until full consultation had taken place between the Commonwealth the States no action should be taken in respect of the per capita payments. members of the party to which I belong are practically pledged to the continuance Ur. Maxwell. of these payments. Let us consider for a moment what we are now asked to doThe honourable the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) , who has just resumed his seat, solemnly maintained that we had a mandate from the people to discontinue the per capita payments and that the bill now before the House was in accordance with the declared policy of the Nationalist party as outlined by the Prime Minister during the last election campaign. I absolutely deny the correctness of that statement. The Attorney-General told us that in the opinion of the Government these per capita payments, representing the collection by the Commonwealth of money which the States were to spend, were a violation of a fundamental principle of finance, and that it was the intention of the Government to call the States into consultation to consider - I think these are the very words he used -''the problems arising out of the existing financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States."" The Prime Minister in his policy speech went on to say, and this was the One gist of his argument, that the existing conditions in Australia rendered necessary "" a re-examination of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States."" This policy is in accordance with the platf o r m of the organization behind the members Prime Minister, an organization which, I think he will admit, rendered valuable service in the last election in is be- returning this party in the strength them in which it finds itself today. I have read carefully the GovernorNational General's speech, which is supposed to foreshadow the legislation proposed to subsequent be brought down by the Government, and Federation I cannot find in it any reference whatselection. ever to a proposal of the character of the bill now under discussion. Honourable a few members may recall that the Governor General's speech emphasized that the and Sena- financial position of the Commonwealth was sound and reflected the general prosperity of the people. That was all that resolved was said about the financial outlook, and, curiously enough, following almost immeand diately on that passage in the speech came this statementThus The election has shown that the people of Australia are determined to maintain law and order. In other words, the Government, through the Governor General, said"" We recognize that the real meaning of the state of parties as the result of the recent election is a declaration on the part of the people that they are in favour of the maintenance of law and order, and will support the Government in dealing with certain sinister influences that have been at work in the community hitherto."" That, I submit, was the mandate. The Attorney-General stated that on the public platform during his election campaign he gave utterence to the sentiments he expressed to-night. No doubt he did, but how many of the hundreds of thousands of electors heard him? Besides, he was uot speaking on behalf of the Government: he was expressing the opinion of an individual who in no way bound the Government. The Attorney-General twitted the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes') with the fact that he and his Treasurer (Mr . W at t ) , in 1920, had foreshadowed the withdrawal of the por capita payments. Last night the right honourable member for Balaclava explained very ably aud full y what induced the then Government to make that suggestion. It is an extraordinary fact that the right honourable gentleman, who with his Treasurer in 1920 made that proposal, should in 1922, have had as Treasurer the proBent Prune Minister, who in the course of a speech before the National Democratic Council at Brisbane dealt with federal finance, and, particularly, the special appropriations. The slogan of his speech was "" Stable Government and Sound Finance."" Up to that time the finances of the Commonwealth had in cluded the per capita payments to the States, and the right honourable gentleman, in referring to the special appropriations said : As mutters now stand in Australia, the capita payments cannot be done away with. Possibly the future may hold in store for Australia a different form of government. Certainly we have many Governments in Australia, possibly to the extent of being over-governed. But until there has been a change in the basis of the forms of governments of thu States these payments must be continued. That was his opinion as Treasurer in the Hughes Government in 1922. So far as I know there has been no change in the basis of the for m of government of the States, and the right honourable gentleman, who then said that u n t i l that change occurred the per capita payment must continue, today says, although that basis has not been changed the payments must cease. One naturally seeks the reason for this change of policy. As the right honourable member for Sydney said to-night in the course of a v/itty and able speech, there is no urgency about this proposal: the present arrangement has been working satisfactorily for seventeen years. It has been suggested that the man responsible for the bill now before us is the present Treasurer. Whether or not that is so I do not know. But a prominent member of - the Victorian Farmers' Union a few days ago in conversation expressed the view that the present Federal Treasurer was, especially in financial matters, a superman. I did not consult the dictionary as to the meaning of "" supermini,"" but I suppose it meant in this instance a man who occasionally lauds himself and those who follow him in thp. soup. If this bo the meaning of the term, I think the Treasurer may have some claim to the soubriquet. We have been told by the Government that although the States are totally opposed t» this scheme, it will benefit them. The Federal Treasurer and those associated with him may be greater financiers than the men connected with the State Governments. If that is so, the latter - are surely entitled to more considerate treatment. They are charged with grave responsibilities in the administration of tlieir respective States. The speech of the right honourable member for Balaclava lastnight helped me to realise the extent, variety, and importance of the functions discharged by the State Governments, and the financial burdens they per involve. The leaders of the State Parliaments deserve consideration, and they declare that this proposal, if accepted by this Parliament, will dislocate their finances. Like the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, I am unable to understand how the Treasurer reconciles his statements to the States that under his scheme they will get more money, and to the taxpayers that they will pay less! One reason given by the Federal Government for forcing this arrangement on the States is that the State Governments, being human, are not to entertain a proposal means the surrender of money that huutirto has been easily My experience is that there is just as much human nature in Federal as in State governments. The Federal government is as eager to acquire as the State governments are loth to relinquish money that comes to them comparatively easily. A f t e r all, it is a matter for amicable arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth as to how the money shall be allocated. We are told, and it has been emobasized over and over again by the Federal Government, that this is a matter peculiarly for this Parliament; that it is for this Parliament to say whether the payments shall continue. Surely it is for the people to say, through, I admit, this Parliament. This Parliament is the through which the popular will, in regard to this and other matters, must be expressed ; but I say we have no right to discuss and decide a matter like this which has never been before the people of Australia. We ought to hold our hands. Tho Government should say, "" In view of the oxpress opinions of the State governments, the State Parliaments, the people, and a very large section of the Federal Parliament, we shall stay our hands. We shall call the States into consultation, as was foreshadowed in the policy speech, for the purpose of considering the whole financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States.""",65
195,Mr COOK,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,They have done that.,68
196,Mr MAXWELL,INSPECTION OF EXPORTED,"They have not doue it as I say it should be done. Each side should, go into consultation uncommitted to any view. problems be discussed on their merits. If the Government has a scheme, let it place it before the States, and if after it has been discussed by them and, in the press, and by the nublic, the States refuse to accept it , let the Federal Government say to the people at the next election, "" We have consulted the States, we have threshed the matter thoroughly, and we think that in the interests of the Commonwealth the scheme we have propounded ought to be accepted. If we are returned to power the first thing we shall do will be to put it into execution."" The Government likely could then come down and say, with which perfect truth , that it had a mandate from the people. This bill iB going to .a obtained. division in the House, and in that connection I wish to make an apueal to honourable members. Admittedly it is a matter of great importance, both to the people of Australia and to the States, and it ought to be decided on its merits. It would be a calamity if any vote cast in this House on a question, which will have such far-reaching and important effect upon the various interests of the Commonwealth, were dictated by any other feeling than that of conviction. Some honourable members might be tempted, out of a feeling of mistaken loyalty to the Government, to cast a vote in favour of the bill because they think not that it ought to be oassed, but that the Government ought to be saved. The instrument Constitution provides for the continuance of the arrangement until the Parliament otherwise provides, but not, as has already been pointed out, until some government that happens to be in power so determines. Therefore, every vote ought to be cast strictly on the merits of the question, and it is because I consider the course I have outlined the proper one to pursue, that if the Government insists upon forcing the matter to a division, I shall vote without hesitation and without misgiving against it . Debate (on motion by Mr JACKSON) adjourned. House adjourned at 11.17 p.m. Leb the out",68
