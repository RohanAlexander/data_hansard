Ferguson, M.J. Somlyay, A.M. * denotes teller Question negatived.  would like to raise a matter with you and request that you give it some consideration. In relation to the seeking of leave and suspension this morning, the honourable member for Stirling did seek leave to move his motion. As a matter of courtesy and convenience to the House, the Treasurer rose to indicate that leave would not be granted and that it might be more appropriate for the member to proceed directly to the suspension. I think that is a very courteous way to proceed and it does assist the House in dealing with the matter. I would ask you, Madam Acting Speaker, whether you would consider the matters that I have raised and perhaps, if appropriate, provide some clarity as to the best way of handling these matters.",19
12,The ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the Chief Government Whip. I will seek advice and proceed with that. The difficulty is that often people seek leave when they should not be seeking leave, and that confuses the issue. Sometimes when people are rising to speak to motions they seek leave when they did not need to or they do not know at what point they need to seek leave. That confused the matter a little this morning, but I think the Chief Government Whip has a valid point and I will raise the matter with the Speaker. NA TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
13,Mr SWAN,FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce legislation to improve the integrity of Australia's foreign investment screening regime. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009 clarifies the operation of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to ensure that the government has the capacity to examine all substantial investment proposals that could potentially raise national interest concerns. The government welcomes and encourages foreign direct investment because of the benefits that it provides to the Australian economy. Foreign investment creates new job opportunities for Australians, encourages innovation and skills development, introduces new technologies and promotes competition amongst our industries. Foreign investment has helped build the competitiveness of our economy and will continue to do so into the future. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 seeks to get the balance right between encouraging investment into Australia and ensuring that the government can review significant foreign investment proposals and intervene where these could undermine the national interest. The act requires foreign investors to notify the government of their transactions in certain circumstances and empowers the Treasurer of the day to block, or place conditions upon, those proposals that could be contrary to the national interest. The act focuses on situations where a foreign investor obtains substantial influence or ‘control'. Overall, the current provisions in the act that deal with control have worked well, and its approach remains sound. However, since the act was drafted in the 1970s, more complex investment instruments have evolved. The use of innovative financing arrangements has been a growing feature of investment activity over recent years. These arrangements have highlighted that ownership interest and control can be held in a variety of forms other than through traditional shares and voting power. While these types of investment arrangements have a solid commercial basis, they have raised questions around the act's full application. It was for this reason that the government announced earlier this year that we would amend the act, to safeguard its policy intention. The bill clarifies that under the act, foreign investors must notify the government where the investment arrangement could deliver influence or control over an Australian company valued above the relevant monetary threshold. And the act will apply equally to all investments, irrespective of how they are structured. The amendments specifically include transactions involving instruments that eventually convert into shares. This will be achieved by first, expanding the definition of ‘voting power' so that it covers the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised. And second, by clarifying where the act deals with interests in shares. The act currently provides that a person is deemed to hold an interest in a share if they have a right to acquire a share or to have a share transferred to them. The bill clarifies that a right can include a right under an instrument, agreement or arrangement, whether the right is exercisable presently or in the future and whether on the fulfilment of a condition or not. The amendments are designed to capture all significant foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence or control over an Australian company. These amendments are not the result of any one investment proposal. They ensure the foreign investment framework keeps pace with the changing nature of foreign investment proposals and with trends that were evident some time before this government was elected. The amendments in this bill apply from 12 February 2009-the date that I announced the changes-to provide certainty around the act's application. To ensure that investors are not unfairly affected by the retrospective start date, the bill includes transitional provisions that apply in relation to business proposals and transactions that occurred between 12 February and the date of royal assent. The transitional provisions provide flexibility for foreign investors to notify of any relevant transactions that became subject to the amended act in the transition period within 30 days after commencement. Subject to the need for postcommencement notification, these investors will not be subject to the normal criminal penalties in respect of those transactions entered into during the transition period. I consider that these changes improve the integrity of the act and capture arrangements that may be deliberately structured to avoid foreign investment screening. These changes are consistent with Australia's international obligations under our free trade agreements. The full detail of these amendments is contained in the explanatory memorandum. This bill does not change the robust national interest framework that underpins our foreign investment policy, nor the screening and examination arrangements of the Foreign Investment Review Board. These procedures are well established and familiar to foreign investors. The examination procedures and the decision to block or impose conditions on foreign investment proposals will continue to be based on whether an investment has, or will, alter the control of an Australian business or corporation and whether the investment is contrary to the national interest. I am confident that this bill strengthens and modernises Australia's foreign investment framework. As we build stronger foundations for Australian prosperity beyond the global recession, the government is committed to a regulatory regime that gets the balance rightprotecting the national interest, while ensuring that Australia is a more competitive destination for foreign investment. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ciobo) adjourned. CRIMES AMENDMENT (WORKING WITH CHILDREN-CRIMINAL HISTORY) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
14,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I rise to introduce the Crimes Amendment (Working With Children-Criminal History) Bill. This bill implements the agreement made by the Council of Australian Governments on 29 November 2008 to enable the interjurisdictional exchange of further criminal history information for people working with children. The bill amends part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914, to create exceptions to provisions that prevent the disclosure of pardoned, quashed and spent convictions. It will create new exceptions allowing pardoned and quashed convictions to be disclosed and expand the existing exception for the disclosure of spent convictions. The scoping study and implementation plan, which preceded the COAG agreement, identified the safeguarding of children from sexual, physical and other abuse as a key priority for all governments. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, unofficial estimates are that approximately one in four girls, and between one in seven and one in 12 boys, are victims of some form of sexual abuse alone. The effects of abuse and neglect on children are also tragic. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that there are established links between abuse or neglect as a child and poor social, behavioural and health outcomes as well as a higher likelihood of criminal offending and mental health issues. It is for these reasons that governments across the Commonwealth have established schemes such as child protection registers and working with children checks to ensure we protect children, the most vulnerable members of our society, to our utmost ability. The scoping study noted that assessment of the criminal history of people working with children or seeking to work with children is an important part of the overall strategy for managing risks to the safety and well-being of children. It also recognised that child-related employment screening is a difficult and challenging process, which requires careful balancing of potential risks to children with individual rights to privacy, employment and the freedom to participate in the community as a volunteer. The Australian Institute of Criminology, in its report Child sexual abuse: offender characteristics and modus operandi, noted that incarcerated sexual offenders are more likely to have previous convictions for non-sexual offences than for sexual offences. Further, law enforcement agencies have indicated that charges relating to offences against children are often withdrawn as a decision is made to protect the child victim from the stress and trauma of giving evidence, cross-examination and simply waiting for committal and trial. For these reasons, jurisdictions considered at COAG that it was appropriate to consider a person's full criminal history, including non-conviction information, in assessing whether he or she poses a risk to children if employed in child related work. The current provisions in the Crimes Act prevent the disclosure of a person's full criminal history. This bill carves out an exception to these provisions, allowing for the interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information, including information on pardoned, quashed and spent convictions, for the specific purpose of child related employment screening. The exchange of the information permitted by the bill is subject to stringent safeguards to ensure that the information is dealt with appropriately and to limit any potential misuse of the information. Firstly, the COAG agreement requires that a person or body will only be prescribed in each jurisdiction for the purposes of enabling them to receive conviction information if the person or body: - is authorised by the government of the state or territory in which it operates; - has a legislative basis for screening that prohibits further release or use of the information (except for legislated child protection functions in exceptional circumstances); - complies with applicable privacy, human rights and records management legislation; - reflects principles of natural justice; and - has risk assessment frameworks and appropriately skilled staff to assess risks to children's safety. Secondly, to reinforce the importance of these safeguards, before a person or body in a state or territory can be prescribed in regulations to allow them to deal with Commonwealth criminal history information, I must first be satisfied that they meet all of these safeguards in their own jurisdiction. In particular, I will require their assessment processes to reflect principles of natural justice, including access to a merits review or appeal process by an independent arbiter. Thirdly, the information can only be used to assess a person's suitability to work with children and cannot be used for a general employment suitability or probity assessment. The bill also requires that a review of the new provisions be started no later than 30 June 2011 and be completed within three months. Given the sensitive nature of the information that will be available under the information exchange, it will be important to assess the effectiveness of the regime, and ensure that information is being dealt with appropriately. I commend this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ciobo) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Reference",23
15,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.36 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of housing for Defence on Gordon Olive Estate at MCDowall, Brisbane, Queensland. Defence Housing Australia proposes the development of a five-hectare infill site in the Brisbane suburb of MCDowell, Queensland, at an estimated total outturn cost of $27.2 million, inclusive of GST and land acquisition. The development will provide an additional 51 homes for Australian Defence Force personnel and their families who are serving in the Brisbane area and particularly for those serving at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera. In addition to the 51 defence houses, the development of the site will also include 10 lots suitable for detached housing and a 5,000-square-metre area that is suitable for the construction of up to 36 low-level apartments. These lots will be sold. The estate will be called the Gordon Olive Estate, honouring the memory of Brisbane-born Battle of Britain pilot and distinguished community figure Gordon Olive CBE, who died in 1987. The estate is conveniently located five kilometres north of the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera and 12 kilometres north of the Brisbane CBD. The proposal forms part of an ongoing effort to increase the amount of defence housing in Brisbane and to replace houses for which leases are expiring and/or which do not meet the new and improved standard of Defence Force housing that was introduced in 2007. Community standard housing for families is vital to the Australian Defence Force in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in the Defence Force. The Gordon Olive Estate has been designed to meet the requirements for Brisbane City Council development approval. Development of the site will be governed by Defence Housing Australia through of the a number of contractors and in accordance with Defence Housing Australia's national specification covering performance and design requirements for Defence Housing Australia houses. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in May 2010 and be completed by June 2011. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",25
16,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.39 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Australian Embassy complex including Chancery, Head of Mission residence, staff housing and recreational facilities in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new Australian embassy complex, including chancery, head of mission residence, staff housing and recreational facilities in Jakarta, Indonesia, at an estimated outturn cost of $415.1 million, exclusive of GST. On 9 September 2004 the current Australian mission was subjected to a terrorist attack, when a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated outside the main entry guard station, killing 11 people. Rectification and new physical security works were urgently undertaken to the mission in the aftermath of the attack in order to provide staff and visitors with increased protection. The government approved the relocation of the Jakarta mission on security grounds. The new site will enable the construction of appropriate setbacks to the buildings for blast mitigation, while the buildings themselves will be designed to resist blast. While the new development is driven by the imperative to provide more secure accommodation, a rapid and large increase of staff in the Jakarta mission over recent years has resulted in the chancery being seriously overcrowded and dysfunctional. The development will provide efficient, modern and secure facilities for 14 Commonwealth agencies represented in Jakarta. The chancery will also provide space and facilities for cial functions, exhibitions, meetings, lectures and business missions. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, an early works construction package, if applicable, could commence in late 2010, with the main works likely to commence before mid-2011. Practical completion of construction, followed by occupation of the premises, would be achieved in late 2014. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Publications Committee",25

NA SCHEME BILL 2009 Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 August, on motion by Dr Emerson: That this bill be now read a second time.",26
18,Mr ZAPPIA,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I conclude my remarks on the Automotive Transformation Scheme Bill 2009 and cognate bill by making the point that it is in the national long-term interest for Australia to have a viable, competitive and innovative automotive industry. As the international automotive sector reassesses its future, following the offiwidespread international collapse of the industry, now is the right time and the opportune time for Australia to invest in new technology, to modernise, to be innovative and to show international leadership in automotive manufacturing. This legislation gives Australian manufacturers the incentive to do so and I commend it to the House.",26
19,Ms RISHWORTH,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Bill 2009, which is a critical part of the implementation of the government's $6.2 billion A New Car Plan for a Greener Future. As a member from South Australia, I know only too well how important the car industry is for South Australian jobs and the local economy. The car industry in South Australia directly employs Report up to 9,300 people in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, in over 200 manufacturing businesses. In addition, 37 per cent of the total number of cars manufactured in Australia are manufactured in South Australia, making this industry a critical part of our local economy. This bill delivers on the commitment of the Rudd Labor government to drive productivity and innovation and to help assist the car industry adjust to some of the long-term challenges for the future. This is particularly important as the industry faces intense pressure from the global economic recession. This bill will provide a $3.4 billion automotive transport scheme to help prepare the automotive industry to transition to a low-carbon economy. The automotive industry has experienced significant changes over the past 20 years. Australia now operates a predominantly export driven car industry. Due to the Button car industry reforms, along with the raft of economic restructuring through the Hawke and Keating years, Australia has increased its export units from under 2,000 in 1988 to over 159,000 in 2008, resulting in an automotive trade worth $24 billion to our economy in 2008. Now this government will take those structural reforms further and, as the Prime Minister has said, the industry must become more innovative, more productive, more competitive and more export focused. The industry is undoubtedly the lifeblood of the Australian economy and the lifeblood of many Australian families. The government knows that it has a critical role in ensuring the strength and growth of the car industry, and it takes this responsibility very seriously. The government is determined to govern over a period of growth and innovation for the automotive manufacturing industry, not just sit back and watch it slowly decline. This bill before the House today sets out the replacement of the existing Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, otherwise known as ACIS, with the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The difference between ACIS and the Automotive Transformation Scheme is simple-it is innovation. Whilst ACIS gave support and assistance to the car manufacturing industry, it did not do enough to foster innovation in the industry, and innovation is the key difference between an industry that will grow and expand and an industry that gets left behind. It is the formulation of new ideas, new possibilities and new opportunities that transports and truly supports the industry. Because the Rudd Labor government understands the core value of innovation, it is using the Automotive Transformation Scheme to increase the level of research and development funding available. Under the new scheme, funding for research and development will increase from 45 per cent to 50 per cent of projects. The funding for these projects will go towards research and development processes, plant and equipment costs and the production of motor vehicles. This funding for innovative research and development under the scheme has a built-in green requirement, to further the ambitions of the government for more sustainable and greener outcomes in the car industry. As a condition of eligibility, participants must improve their environmental outcomes. In addition, participants must also demonstrate that they will promote the development of workforce skills and capabilities. This program will also give certainty to the automotive industry, by providing 10 years of policy certainty. The capped assistance will total $1.5 billion from 2011 to 2015, and then $1 billion from 2016 to 2020. In addition, there will be an uncapped element for motor vehicle producers. The ATS, as it has been abbreviated, is, as I have mentioned, a $3.4 billion package, which is well above the money earmarked for the former scheme, ACIS. It includes a transition package to allow people to transition from the ACIS to the ATS, and that is in the order of $80 million. The new scheme will provide assistance in grants instead of in duty credits, and this move will assist in the administration of the scheme, making it more effective and simple for business. As I have mentioned previously, this scheme is part of a broader plan that this government has for greener cars for the future. I would like to commend both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research-who has really taken a very keen interest in the automotive industry in South Australia and has regularly visited to hear first hand some of the concerns and issues of the car industry, but also some of the opportunities that the car industry has to offer. The government is committed to seeing and supporting Australia move into the future and to acknowledging the threat of climate change by transforming to a low-carbon economy. Meanwhile, we see the opposition-who remain a party of sceptics and deniers keen to put their heads in the sand on climate change-take no steps to prepare Australia for the future. In addition to this bill, as I said, we have expanded the Green Car Innovation Fund to help Australian industry move towards a greener future and to encourage manufacturers to produce cleaner, greener cars. The Green Car Innovation Fund has increased to $1.3 billion and will be available for Australian manufacturers over the next 10 years. Holden in South Australia announced in December that they will produce an efficient Australian small car in Adelaide, and the Commonwealth is contributing to help them with this-$149 million as part of the Rudd government's fund. This commitment is extremely important to South Australia. Holden has set a great example for the industry, moving forward and engaging in innovation and investment in the automotive industry. This investment will also support up to 1,200 jobs. Although there have been many badnews stories in the past, such as the close of Mitsubishi near my electorate, in contrast, this announcement is really good news. Attitudes of Australians have changed about vehicles as they are becoming more conscious of the environment and the cost of fuel. Many of my constituents have contacted me with regard to the cost of running a vehicle, which explains why many consumers are not attracted to the traditional large Australian car-although it does still hold an important place in some people's lives. Attitudes of motorists are changing and the automotive manufacturing industry also needs to change. That is why it is important that the Rudd government, in partnership with automotive manufacturers, make investments to ensure a strong and successful industry into the future. There are many other areas in the New Car Plan for a Greener Future which are important, in addition to this bill and the green car fund. The plan includes $116 million to help facilitate and promote structural adjustment in the components sector, including mergers and consolidation. One of the greatest challenges faced by the components sector within Australia is that firms struggle to achieve the economies of scale required to be competitive in the international market. This funding will help ensure that companies within the sector can remain viable exporters throughout the 21st century. Another $20 million dollars will be invested to assist suppliers to integrate into the national and global supply chains of the large automotive manufacturers. This assistance will have a twofold effect. It will make the systems and processes of suppliers more efficient as well making Australian suppliers more attractive to the large global car manufacturers. Australian-manufactured cars and components, including those made within and around my electorate of Kingston, are amongst the best in the world. That is why the government has invested $6.3 million in our new car plan: to enhance the market access program and to assist in the promotion of the Australian car industry overseas. Car manufacturing is part of the core make-up of my electorate and my state, and many people within my electorate work in the auto industry and in components manufacturing. South Australia has a critical role in the Australian car industry, especially in the areas of components, tooling, design and engineering supply firms that support the large car manufacturing plants. South Australians understand the vital importance of having a clear car plan for the future that tainable, green, productive and built for the future. I commend the bill to the House.",26
20,Dr EMERSON,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (9.54 am)-in reply-I thank all members who have spoken on the Automotive Transformation Scheme Bill 2009 and the associated ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2009. This is very important legislation. The Automotive Transformation Scheme will stimulate the investment and innovation needed to make the Australian automotive industry economically and environmentally sustainable. It will achieve this by increasing support for strategic investment in research and development, plant and equipment and the production of motor vehicles. The estimated $3.4 billion of assistance under the Automotive Transformation Scheme, as well as additional assistance under the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme-ACIS for shortdemonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to securing the long-term viability of this vital industry. This legislation has been welcomed by the industry, by the tens of thousands of Australians who work in it, and by the families and communities that depend on it. It is the centrepiece of the government's New Car Plan for a Greener Future, the most comprehensive policy ever devised for the Australian automotive industry. This $6.2 billion initiative will give the industry the certainty it needs to invest in the vehicle technologies of tomorrow. As a number of speakers have noted, the automotive industry makes a vital contribution to Australian employment, skills and innovation. I recognise the significant interest in these two bills, especially from the is susmembers who have contributed to this debate, and I thank those members for their contributions. I would like to mention the member for Kingston, who has just spoken; the member for Calwell; the member for Wakefield; the member for Makin; the member for Deakin; and, of course, all of the coalition members who have also spoken on the bill. The automotive industry is especially significant to Victoria and South Australia, and I thank these members for supporting this critical legislation which will set the industry on the path to a sustainable future. The Automotive Transformation Scheme, along with the extra assistance in 2010 under ACIS, will make a real difference to the workers in this industry. The scheme requires participants to demonstrate a commitment to boosting skills. It recognises that the key to a successful and innovative Australian automotive industry is a well-trained and highly skilled workforce. The scheme will support jobs as the industry comes through the global economic downturn and addresses the ongoing challenges of modernisation and renewal. The government believes that the long-term viability of the automotive industry depends on innovation. That is why the Automotive Transformation Scheme increases support for eligible investment in R&D. The Automotive Transformation Scheme's objective is to encourage increased investment and innovation, which will deliver important economic outcomes. Assistance under this scheme is directly linked to the industry continuing to invest and produce in Australia. It will ensure that Australia is at the cutting edge of new technologies that will allow us to produce vehicles with lower fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The scheme will operate on the basis of mutual obligation. It is not a blank cheque; it is about development capability and workforce skills. Reflecting this mutual obligation, the bill also contains a strong monitoring regime, including provision for authorised officers to obtain a monitoring warrant to check compliance and substantiate information. These provisions will protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the community. This legislation is about giving the industry the certainty it needs to continue long-term strategic investment at a time when it is under acute pressure both in Australia and overseas. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

21,Dr EMERSON,AUTOMOTIVE TRANSFORMATION,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (9.59 am)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum and move government amendments (1) and (2): (1) Clause 3, page 2 (lines 14 to 17), omit clause (1), substitute: (1) The object of this Act is: (a) to encourage competitive investment and innovation in the Australian automotive industry; and (b) to place the industry on an economically sustainable footing; by providing assistance to a participant in the Automotive Transformation Scheme based on the participant's investment if the investment is of a kind prescribed by the Scheme. (2) Page 18 (after line 8), after clause 27, insert: 27A Annual report The Secretary must include the following in the Department's annual report for a financial year: (a) the total amounts of capped assistance and uncapped assistance paid to ATS participants under the Automotive Transformation Scheme during the 12 month period ending on 31 March in the financial year; (b) details of the progress of the Australian automotive industry towards achieving economic sustainability, environmental outcomes and workforce skills development. The government is proposing two amendments to the ATS bill. The first amendment expands the object of the bill to make it clear that this scheme will place the industry on an economically sustainable footing. This will help to secure the long-term economic viability of the Australian automotive industry. It sends a strong message that ATS assistance is not a blank cheque to the industry. Assistance under this scheme is directly linked to the industry continuing to invest and produce in Australia. The changes contained in this amendment put beyond doubt the government's position that assistance comes with strings attached. The Rudd government is subalso committed to transparency and openness. We are including clear reporting provisions to assure the Australian taxpayer that assistance under the ATS delivers a long term future for the Australian automotive industry, automotive workers and their families, and the broader community.

NA PROTECTION BILL 2009 Cognate bills: NA PROTECTION (TRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2009 NA PROTECTION (FEES) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.  wonderful to rise in the House on this beautiful winter morning in Canberra to speak on important bills such as the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009. The national consumer credit package of bills represents considerable reform to the regulation of credit in Australia. The new uniform credit legislation is a worthy concept. It really does make sense, in my view, to have all forms of credit and financial services federally regulated. Payday lenders, finance companies and mortgage brokers will become federally licensed entities. For business, particularly those that are engaged in the provision of credit, there will be some significant adjustments required. As with any such changes, compliance can be particularly frustrating for those businesses that are required to adjust. There are quite a number of adjustment issues that Australian businesses will have to contend with. The onus is on the government to be responsive to industry and business needs in the implementation of this legislation. While some aspects of the legislation will require the immediate response of business, some provide for reasonable time frames for transitional arrangements. There are four key objectives of the package of bills. First is the creation of a national credit law with licensing arrangements. Second is the introduction of responsible lending provisions. Some of these provisions will start from 1 January 2010 and some others for some other entities will start from 1 January 2011. Third is the universal compulsory membership of external dispute resolution schemes for ADIs and for non-ADIs. Last is the introduction of a new national consumer credit code protection mechanism which replicates-and, indeed, replaces-the state based UCCC codes that have been in existence for some time. The primary bill was provided for public exposure in late April this year. On exposure it was clear that the drafted bill in its first incarnation did have significant problems within it. I note that there have been wholesale alterations to the bill before its presentation to the House. There were many changes, but the key changes to the original bill include setting back responsible lending provisions for authorised deposit-taking institutions. They now will not come into operation until 1 January 2011. Point-of-sale, or POS, retailers have been exempted for 12 months, subject to review. Arrangements for credit assistance were simplified, with some requirements that were duplicated removed. So let me now go to the more substantive parts of the bill; firstly, the national credit laws and licensing arrangements. Under this bill, we will see the provision of one single uniform regime and oversight for credit which is to be administered by ASIC. ASIC will license providers and administer licence requirements. The process of licensing is to begin from November of this year. There will be a new licensing regime. It will be called the Australian credit licence or the ACL. Licensed under the new regime will be brokers, financiers and credit intermediaries. More particularly, the type of credit activities to require licensing will be things such as credit contracts, credit services, consumer leases, mortgages and guarantees. ACL holders once licensed will be able to lend and collect money due under a credit contract and act as a broker or an intermediary, or provide assistance about a credit product. Credit guides will be compulsorily provided by the licensee and will disclose all applicable commissions, fees and charges. Certain financial institutions will be streamlined to the ACL process. This will include credit providers such as mortgage brokers in Western Australia, who have until now been operating under state licences. Other institutions to be streamlined into the ACL process are current holders of the AFSL, the Australian financial service licence, who are already licensed to dispense or advise on credit under the existing legislative arrangements. For entities requiring two licences, an AFSL and an ACL, we have been assured that just one of those licence numbers will need to be displayed on licensing credit materials. Registration will begin in November and it will end in June next year. This will occur through ASIC, who are expecting between 5,000 and 12,000 applications for such licences. From our perspective, the coalition is focused on ensuring the licensing arrangements are not prohibitive for business, as these requirements are significant in the volume and the impact that they will have on the national marketplace. A further concern which has been raised throughout the period of consultation has been the circumstances in which licences for providing credit may be provided. It has emerged that companies which provide loans to directors may be caught up in this legislation and would therefore require such a licence. As this circumstance surely does not fall within the intended scope or objectives of this new law, I ask and respectfully request that the government exempt companies which provide director loans in the same manner that they have exempted employees receiving loans from their employers. As I say, that exemption is in this bill. Can I also raise the issue of debt collection, which has been raised throughout the consultation process. In the initial draft legislation of the bill, it captured the debt management industry under the new regime. Throughout the consultation and upon review by Treasury and the government, debt collection was given a 12-month exemption from the bill in order to enable discussions with all stakeholders to determine a more appropriate legislative treatment for the industry. That was debt collection; they were given an exemption. However, debt buyers were left in the legislation. The Australian Collectors and Debt Buyers Association have stated that they believe that debt buyers should also be treated in the same way as debt collectors and given a 12-month exemption from the bill, as neither of these aspects of the debt management industry actually involve the initial credit provision process. If you are going to exempt debt collection, it makes perfect sense, I think, to exempt debt purchasing or debt buyers as well. Again, I call on the government to take a common sense approach in this area and extend that exemption to the debt-buying side of the debt management industry in Australia and consult with them throughout the next 12 months to ensure an appropriate response. The second area is responsible lending. Due to start on 1 January 2010 for brokers and some lenders, and one year later for ADIs, the area of responsible lending is in my view where most potential problems for individuals and for businesses lie in this package of legislation. The provisions are designed to help consumers make better decisions and of course to use credit appropriately. There are two tests within the legislation that the loan provider must meet. ASIC will develop definitions of each for the purposes of the legislation. Those two tests are, firstly, that a loan's suitability must be vidually determined by the provider and, secondly, that the loan recipient's capacity to repay the loan must also be assessed. Industry sources tell me that of course these procedures are already followed as a matter of course when loan assessments are made. Most objective analysis of Australia's banking system would concur that, for the most part, our financial institutions have been lending responsibly. Despite this, further consumer protection and transparency is indeed always welcome. The primary issues with the responsible lending provisions are their workability, particularly in terms of how our credit reporting system works in this country. Although the responsible lending provisions do not come into operation until 1 January 2011 for many providers, it still remains most unclear how responsible lending will actually operate without positive or comprehensive credit reporting. As I mentioned earlier, Australia currently operates a negative credit reporting structure. This system provides information to credit providers on whether a borrower has defaulted on loans or been declared bankrupt, for example. Credit providers are actually denied access to available information on a borrower's credit history on privacy grounds. So let me, therefore, pose a simple question: how can this responsible lending regime operate as intended if the credit provider is not entitled to view the whole picture of a borrower's financial circumstances? How can you actually fully meet the two tests that I outlined earlier? From a practical and operational viewpoint, I think this is where the real difficulties exist with this legislation. The privacy lobby have been debating the merits of reforming credit reporting in Australia for some time. This discussion is subject to a review currently being conducted by the Special Minister of State. The privacy round-table consultation has been considering our indi- credit system since August of last year. To provide some context: recently the Australian Law Reform Commission, the ALRC, examined the credit-reporting system. The ALRC provided some interesting insights which I think are very relevant for the purposes of this legislation. In its final report, which was called For your information: Australian privacy law and practice, the ALRC recommended that there should be some expansion of the categories of personal information that can be included in creditreporting information held by creditreporting agencies. The suggestions that they made included, for example, that the type of each current credit account opened-for example, whether it was a mortgage, a credit card or a personal loan-and the date on which each current credit account was opened should be made available, along with the credit limit of each current account and the date on which each current account was closed. Given that the outcome of the review will be of very great and substantial importance to the workability of responsible lending pertains to these bills, we hope that this islation is expressly considered in that roundmost table process, as the responsible lending visions in their current form do not appear to be entirely workable. The government has much work to do in this area prior to the dates in 2010 and 2011, respectively. On behalf of the opposition I would again ask the government, respectfully, to fast-track the round-table consultation process which is considering our credit system. The government must bear in mind that without reform in this area these provisions will not work as intended and indeed could be detrimental to consumers and, of course, our total banking and credit system. From a further, practical viewpoint, most financial institutions freeze their systems over the Christmas break in order to withstand the level of increased transactions. As you would know, there is a very elevated transaction volume leading up to Christmas and after Christmas-during the festive and New Year holiday season. As a result, the proposed start date for the ADIs-1 January 2011, for example-may end up proving to be quite a difficult start date for them to achieve and may in fact not be the most appropriate. Again, it is important for governments of all persuasions to be responsible for easing the compliance burden where possible. Therefore, this is another area where the government needs to spend some time and understand whether or not it is going to be possible to establish a reliable-that is the key point-implementation date of 1 January, given what I was just saying about how a lot of the ADIs will find it most difficult to implement such a massive structural change at that time, particularly as it relates to their information and IT systems as a whole. So I call on the government, through the consultation process between now and then, to really as it spend some time and work out what will be legthe most feasible and, most importantly, the reliable date for this to happen. The pro- worse thing that could happen would be to push ahead with this unreliable date and for the whole banking and credit system in Ausstart tralia to fall over during that time. The next area I want to move to is the area where universal compulsory membership of external dispute resolution schemes for ADIs and non-ADIs is included. This is an objective of this legislation-to provide easier and cheaper access to dispute resolution. The legislation proposes a three-tiered dispute resolution system for consumers-firstly, through the licensee; secondly, through ASIC's approved scheme; and, thirdly, through the court system. Under this legislation consumers will be able to apply for hardship variations, postponement of enforcement actions, regained possession of mortgaged goods, and actions against unconscionable fees and charges imposed by credit providers for amounts of less than $40,000. Then we have the area of the new national consumer credit code. This legislation duces a new national consumer credit protection mechanism. This will replicate and indeed replace all of the state based UCCCs and is designed to enhance consumer protection by raising hardship thresholds from the current $330,000 limit to $500,000 and provides, among other things, a prohibition on essential household goods as security. The overall objectives of these bills are sound. Providing a national system of licensing of credit is particularly worthwhile a consumer protection viewpoint. The responsible lending provisions are well intentioned, but it remains to be seen how the government will manage this process in terms of the practical implementation leading up to the start dates in 2010 and 2011. This package of bills is a significant reform which our business community will have to adapt itself to. Once again, given the size of the reform and the possible likelihood of compliance problems, the government must be responsive to the needs of the industry. I am confident that ASIC and the Treasury will make themselves available to those businesses which need assistance in actually implementing this legislation. I hope that the government does the same. The coalition trusts that consumers and businesses across the whole of Australia will benefit from having these bills enacted.",31
24,Mr RIPOLL,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"It is a great pleasure to speak on these three billsthe National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009. It is a pleasure because it is an ‘about time' collection of bills where a decent government comes in and acknowledges a whole range of problems that have existed in the community, particularly in relation to consumer credit, intro- for a very long time. These are not new issues or new problems. These are things that have been out in the marketplace. We have all heard it from our constituents. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware of those as much as I am: people who have complained or made representation to you-and I would say to every single member in this House, and senators as well-about having problems with credit facilities, with the people who sell them from credit, with how credit works, with unfair clauses, with fees, with termination, and the list goes on and on. But underpinning all that has always been the principle that we needed to approach, and that was about protecting ordinary Australians-consumer protection. To be part of a government that takes the fight upfront and looks at ways that we can seriously have a practical impact out in the community on these issues is a proud moment, and I am very pleased to speak on these bills. The national consumer credit reform package that we are putting forward will, for the very first time in Australia, put in place a single standard. It will be a national regime for the regulation of consumer credit-no small feat. It takes a lot of work, cooperation and effort and, dare I say it-and I say it in a humble way-a little bit of courage as well. When you are make significant changes, which is what we are talking about, and working with all of the states and territories, you have to bring people to the table; you have to do it in a bipartisan manner and you have to see other people's point of view. That is what we have striven to do and I am proud of that. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill will develop a framework to licence credit providers, brokers and intermediaries and apply responsible lending conduct requirements to licensed parties. I will talk about the detail of that in a moment. It will also provide a robust dispute resolution mechanism supported by appropriate enforcement powers. This is a suite of actions that need to be taken. Not only do you need to provide the right licensing regime and framework but you need to look at how you enforce it; how you ensure that the policeman on the beat has the right powers to deal with these matters. These are long-awaited reforms that go to areas such as court arrangements and remedies for consumers, penalties for licensee misconduct and-of great interest to this parliament and the community-the regulation of margin loans. The transitional and consequential provisions bill contains specific clauses relating to the rights and liabilities of certain existing credit contracts. Whenever there are these types of legislative changes it is essential that we put in place some transitional arrangements. We will make sure that, where court proceedings arose prior to the commencement of these bills, there is a proper process in place for participants as a precursor to the licensing arrangements. The fees bill provides a mechanism to support the imposition of fees as are deemed necessary and essential for the proper working of these legislative arrangements, such as for searching a register kept by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The package relies in part on a referral of state powers to regulate consumer credit. The government are committed not just to the words and the framework for making these things actionable but to providing the funding for them to happen. As such, we will provide $70.2 million over four years to ensure that our work with the states and territories through COAG can be achieved properly. The member for Solomon is in the chamber, and I know he is a big supporter of consumer credit, being from the Northern Territory-as are any of us who represent rural or regional areas. We understand just how important it is to ensure that constituents have access to proper credit protection and regulation, and I know the member for Solomon is as supportive of our bills in this area as I am. The national consumer credit reform bills are a comprehensive package of legislation for a comprehensive licensing regime. For the first time, all providers of consumer credit, including brokers and other intermediaries in the industry, will be captured as one, which is a very important move forward in this area. The bills include industry-wide responsible lending conduct requirements for licensees, something that is desperately needed. The global financial crisis has, in a way, highlighted the cracks in the system, the areas of failure and the abuses that often occur when markets are running hot and people are, let us say, less concerned with procedure and process than they might be when there is a downturn in the market and they are looking closely at every single cent. In saying that, even the boom times we had for a decade did not diminish people's concerns about the way they were being treated in relation to their credit arrangements. The legislation will also provide improved sanctions and enhanced enforcement powers for the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, making sure that not only do we in this place do our job in terms of the regulatory framework but that ASIC, as the regulator, has the power to ensure enforcement and to make sure that consumers are properly protected. The bills will also expand the scope of credit contracts to include credit provided to purchase, renovate or improve the value of a residential investment property. This is an important area in which we have seen a growing market. Given that the Rudd Labor government has put in place the nation's largest building program, in a whole range of areas but specifically in the areas of housing and homeless, it is important that we regulate in that area as well. These bills will replicate the current state based Uniform Consumer Credit Code as a national code. It is important to understand that, constitutionally, the Commonwealth has insufficient powers to enact a nationally comprehensive regulatory framework for consumer credit. As such, we have worked with the states and territories for a specific referral of state powers to the Commonwealth for consumer credit. That entails an agreement to a text based referral of powers, which will need to be enacted by each state parliament before the proposed laws can commence in those states. We are working through that process. We have the agreement from COAG, which is very much appreciated. It shows the strong working relationship that the Commonwealth government can have with its state partners in providing nationally consistent laws and regulations and working in the national interest and in the best interests of Australian consumerssomething that we on this side of the House are very much committed to and something I would suggest members of the Liberal and National parties take a closer look at. The legislation is supported by intergovernmental agreement, which will provide all of those mechanisms that I spoke about. The implementation of the national consumer credit regime will include other providers or intermediaries such as brokers. For the first time, they will be required to actually istered with ASIC by 31 December 2009 and to have applied for a licence by 30 June 2010 if they want engage in, or continue to engage in, credit activities. Again, this is a very important mechanism to ensure that everyone who is involved in this sector is caught under these regulations. The responsible lending conduct obligations will commence 1 January 2011 and will provide the industry time to put in place systems and training and to make sure that people are up to speed in terms of their requirements and their obligations. Licensing, I believe, is very important. It is a very important part of ensuring that those who provide these types of credit or broker and credit facilities are actually properly qualified, properly trained, understand codes of standards and ethics, and provide the best possible service to consumers. As such, these bills do provide a comprehensive licensing requirement. It will mean that there will be a requirement for people in this area to hold an Australian credit licence, an ACL, if they want to be properly authorised to provide credit activities. That will include such areas as: lending or collecting money; acting as an intermediary between the consumer and the lenderfor example, credit aggregators; and suggesting a consumer apply for a particular loanfor example, people such as brokers. The licensing regime will impose certain entry-level requirements-a very important step towards making sure that the quality of advice and service provided in these areas is up to standard. I am very happy to see that we will be regulating in that area. To ensure that it is not just an entry-level requirement and then a self-regulating system, we will also be requiring that people meet ongoing standards of conduct when engaging in credit activities. And, most importantly, ASIC will have the power to either suspend or cancel their licence-a very strong power, a very be regnecessary power and one which I believe will point the way in related matters in terms of the financial services world. There will be special procedures in place to streamline the licensing to make sure that it works efficiently for banks and credit unions as well as others. We do expect to put in a number of limited exceptions because, as always in these things, from time to time there are exceptions. An example is point of sale staff, particularly in places such as major well. retailer outlets which offer interest-free periods and where there is some sort of credit line arranged. We will be exempting those particular point of sale staff from having to have an ACL or from meeting particular requirements. Those requirements will not be necessary at that point, but certainly the providers of that credit need to be the ones who actually hold the licence. Responsible lending is something that we have all talked about quite a bit, particularly given that we have seen some high-profile and spectacular collapses-for example, Storm Financial, Opes Prime and the margin lending debacles throughout the country. It all comes back to this central point about appropriateness and responsible lendingensuring that the lender understands the capacity of a consumer to repay a loan so that the consumer is not placed under some sort of financial stress created by the loan. So responsible lending requirements will also apply. These will set a standard of expected behaviour for licensees-as I have mentioned previously, not only entry requirements but also requirements for licensing, ongoing standards, proper qualifications and so on. There also need to be clearly delineated responsibilities and obligations for people such as finance brokers when it comes to lending conduct. They play an essential role in meeting the need of consumers in the community to have a choice-so they do not necessarily just go to their bank to get credit and have to be limited to the offerings of that one institution; but, perhaps, they could go through a broker or some other licensed agent who would be able to seek out or source the very best deal or most appropriate and suitable credit for a consumer's particular needs. So it is essential that we include people involved in that particular sector as The legislation introduces for consumers some important disclosure requirements in relation to credit costs and commissions, another area which I think is ahead of the game in what we are seeing happening in the sector already. Peak representative bodies across the country, those who represent people working in the financial services world and in brokering, are already seeing the need for peer change, for conduct change and for reform in the areas of how these things work. Disclosure is one of those very important issues. It is important because consumers need to understand upfront in simple plain English exactly what it is that they are buying into and what the terms are. There need to be clear, concise terms in plain English, and I think disclosure can play an important role in that. I want to make the point that disclosure is not about providing more and more information-it is not about the 100-page disclosure document where you can bury or hide in some critical piece of information that cannot be found unless you are a constitutional lawyer; it is about providing clear and concise information. It is about having upfront, full disclosure so that people truly do understand what it is that they are buying into. I think that is a fair process and it is something that I am very pleased about in these bills. This is about consumer rights. This is about consumer protection. This is about ensuring that people know what they are buying into and ensuring that they are not abused by people who think that they may be cleverer than everybody else. Importantly, for Australian homeowners who are refinancing-and there would be quite a number; whether it be due to financial difficulty, whether it be to access some of the equity in their home, or whatever it might be-there need to be laws that specifically include a presumption that the refinancing is suitable for those people. Again, there need to be arrangements in place that are appropriate; the correct financial obligations need to be met; and all of this needs to work in line with our national consumer credit legislation. This is about having a national credit code, albeit that it has come out of state regimes and we will in effect have a state based uniform credit code which will be largely replicated in the legislation as the national credit code. Importantly, it will ensure that we have a consumer focus-a focus on improving the code and protecting ordinary people in terms of their access to credit. What the scope of the code will be expanded to include is credit where it is predominantly used to purchase, renovate, improve or refinance a residential property. The code is also being amended to reduce several loopholes that could be used by unscrupulous lenders or brokers to avoid the law. We have been careful to make sure we cover those. The bills will also change the monetary thresholds under which consumers can apply to their credit providers for hardship variations. Credit providers will also be hibited from using essential household goods as security for loans, and they will be required to give consumers information when they default on their contracts or when a direct debit is dishonoured. I have spoken briefly about penalties, remedies and enforcement powers, and I just want to touch on them again. If you are going to send out a strong and clear signal to the sector about doing the right thing, about adhering to the codes and making sure that people understand what is required of them, it is not just a case of licensing but making sure that you have criminal penalties in place for licensing misconduct. That could include imprisonment of up to two years for really serious breaches, and I think that sends the right signal to say that we are serious about doing the right thing. There are also civil penalties for licensing misconduct which will enable ASIC to seek heavy fines of up to $220,000 for an individual and $1.1 million for a corporation. These are the right signals in terms of enthe suring that providers do the right thing, and for the vast majority this will actually be something they welcome because they do do the right thing and they do understand their obligations. It will make it easier for them, not harder, because it will ensure that the unscrupulous operators are weeded out. There might be only a limited number, but it helps provide a more robust framework and stronger rules for those who are doing the right thing. All in all, these three bills together provide a complete package. It is more than a step in the right direction; it is a leap in the right direction in terms of providing the right sort of consumer protection balance. It is a balance between an open marketplace, where people can access finance, credit and debt and get on with doing the things that they pro- deem necessary for themselves, and consumer protection. But for me that balance needs to have consumer protection as its primary focus, consumer protection at its heart, and that is what these bills achieve. While I chair the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and we are doing two inquiries at the moment which touch on a lot of these issues, I feel that what these bills do is already moving us in the right direction. They cover many of those areas that we are inquiring into, so I welcome these bills very much. I am very supportive of these bills and I commend them to the House.",35
25,Mrs MOYLAN,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak and contribute to this debate today on the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and the related bills, because this process of bringing national unity to consumer credit provisions has long been desired. I think the community expects us to act and to amend the governing laws, the legislation, particularly as new products come onto the market. New products evolve and perhaps require a slightly different approach, and we have seen some very creative approaches to the provision of credit, probably in the last few years in particular, and a lot of people not fully understand what they are getting into when they enter into some of these schemes. That being said, the Australian credit regulations have been admired internationally and are attributed as the reason Australia has largely avoided the subprime lending trends that have plagued so many nations abroad. I think we in the coalition were rigorous in ensuring strong consumer credit protection laws but, as I said, with new products and new, creative ways of packaging credit coming in, there is a need for ernment to constantly revisit these laws and make sure that they do what they are intended to do. Whilst these regulations are currently strong and effective, they are not uniform across the states and territories of Australia, which results in some confusion and certainly increases compliance costs for everyone involved, both the providers of credit and those who seek to use those products. It is not so much a matter of having a nanny state mentality, trying to protect everyone to the ultimate degree, but I think the public expect that governments will make sure that people do not unwittingly enter into credit arrangements that are less than desirable. I do think there are situations where people can unwittingly do so, certainly where the details of those credit arrangements are not always obvious-and, more importantly, the end result of some of the detail is not immediately obvious. It is important to make sure that providers of credit do not offer shonky deals and that the unscrupulous are not allowed to continue to get away with packaging of credit that does real harm to people in our community. The state and territory governments have traditionally had legislative power to determine consumer credit matters. Indeed, this is do still the case. However, in 2008 a Council of Australian Governments agreement enabled the Commonwealth to share concurrent power, enabling the creation of the legislation before us today. At this point it is important also to note that this was not the first attempt to reach such an agreement at COAG level. The coalition government's efforts to establish national uniform laws in this regard fairly were hampered by disagreement among many of the Labor controlled state governments while we were in office federally. The changes proposed in this legislation gov- are substantial. For those involved in the provision of credit, they have the potential to massively overhaul many standard procedures. They also introduce the uniform threat of criminal sanctions, including jail terms, for lenders who engage in unscrupulous behaviour. The scope of these bills and the outlook for further reforms clearly indicate that there will be important changes to the law. It is not simply a case of the Commonwealth bringing together the unified state and territory laws without more. The coalition supports this legislation seeks to protect consumers and also to promote certainty and reduce compliance for businesses. In general terms, this legislation will govern the activities of lenders, brokers, credit intermediaries and debt collectors. At this point, however, it will not apply to pointof-sale retailers. That came out of the consultations and the committee process and I am sure is very much welcomed by point-of-sale retailers. Under this new arrangement, credit providers, brokers and intermediaries will be required to register with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission between November 2009 and December 2009. I understand this registration process can be carried out online and that the system has been designed to make the process as simple as possible. Following registration, participants will need to apply for an Australian credit licence within six months from 1 January 2010. Any individual or organisation that is licensed is expected to meet the standards of behaviour set out in the legislation when providing credit to a consumer. The responsible lending provisions are aimed at ensuring that borrowers are not provided with unsuitable credit facilities. Licensees will need to ensure that they carry out an individual assessment as to the borrower's ability to repay the loan and to meet their financial obligations for each application they receive. In a recent article in the Australian Financial Review one commentator noted that: … the bill seems aimed at reckless lending in US and Europe rather than the less acute problems seen in Australia. This may result in even conscientious and responsible, low-income households being forced into the arms of loan sharks as mainstream lenders observe the law to the letter. It is an interesting point to note and probably one that should be borne in mind, as well as the all-important regulations that have been as it devised and that accompany this bill. But there is always a tension between the need to regulate and the need to encourage people to take responsibility for their own financial dealings-indeed, any dealings. And I think there is a greater need to educate. Credit providers have been very creative about the way they package loans. We have not seen that to the degree that we have seen it in other countries but, nevertheless, things are changing constantly and many people out there in the community do not fully understand the detail and the implications of some of this packaging of credit. As said before, Australia has a world-class banking system. Our big four banks make up a third of the world's strongest, and our record of subprime lending has been limited to one per cent as opposed to the famous figure of 15 per cent in the United States market. The so-called NINJA loans, where mortgages were given to people with no income, no job and no assets, has not been a problem in Australia to anywhere near the extent that it is in the United States. These lending practices have occurred in many parts of the world and have widely been attributed as the cause behind the current global financial collapse. It has been accepted by both sides of this House that Australia's banking system is amongst the best regulated in the world. I do not think there is much disagreement on that point. Indeed, those opposite have often said when abroad that our lending practices have the prevented a fallout of the magnitude being felt by the banks around the globe. It should, then, also be recognised by both sides of the House that such prudential regulations should duly be attributed to the hard work of the member for Higgins and the coalition financial team when we were in office. It is important that we seek to find the right balance in the protection of consumers. In any of these situations that we are confronted with as lawmakers and legislators, I want to stress that it is usually a small minorexample, ity that are spoiling it for the rest of the community. We have to balance that tension, as I said, between protecting consumers from this small number of unscrupulous lenders and the need to give sufficient flexibility so that Australian lenders can continue to provide a service to the Australian community. The other key features of the responsible lending provisions relate to the full disclosure of relevant information through a credit guide. Licensees are required to tell borrowers about all credit related costs, commissions and the borrower's right to redress under the legislation. It is fundamentally important that all available information is made accessible to the borrower so that all involved parties are in the best position possible to decide the suitability of the particular credit product. Where a licensee is providing refinancing for consumers facing current financial hardship, a presumption has been introduced that such a refinancing is unsuitable ‘if the consumer would have to sell their primary residence to meet the financial obligations of the new finance arrangements'. The protection of the household has also been extended in the national credit code, which departs from the uniform consumer credit code in that licensees are now prohibited from taking security over essential household goods. Where a consumer does find themselves in a position where they cannot meet their financial obligations, there are now more remedies available. Previously, consumers with a loan of $312,400 or less were entitled to apply for a change to the terms of their credit contract. This figure is based on 110 per cent of the average loan size for a new dwelling in New South Wales. The formula has now been removed and set to a fixed amount of $500,000 which may be changed by regulation. This will allow many more people who are experiencing hardship through illness or loss of employment, for to seek changes to their contract. A lender is not automatically required to approve such changes to the credit contract if the changes are unlikely to result in the borrower meeting their obligations. I am sure this will be very welcome for many consumers who find themselves caught up in circumstances not really of their own makingand that can happen to any one of us. I think it is a good thing, and I notice some of the major banks are announcing a much more flexible approach to borrowers who find themselves in genuine difficulty. A new dispute resolution system is being introduced as part of this change to ensure that consumers do not need to proceed through expensive and lengthy litigation. The licensee is to have an internal dispute resolution mechanism and must also be a member of an ASIC-approved external dispute resolution scheme. If a dispute remains unresolved then the court system will be the third option, where a streamlined procedure for small claims of less than $40,000 will ensure that the borrower will not require legal representation, and the hearing will be conducted with informal procedures. I think, again, this is a very good move because it does not matter how much black-letter law we introduce into this place; if there is not fair access to the law and legal remedies, it is debatable how much that black-letter law is really worth to the average person out in the community. This allows for a process that does not require people to have a massive amount of money to engage a legal representative to take their case. This legislation creates an interesting interplay between state and Commonwealth legislative powers. While the state and territory uniform consumer credit codes will cease to operate, the state and territory governments retain power to legislate on consumer credit matters. I think that is important. If we have a federation, we have to respect that and we have to work together. That being said, having read through a number of the submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this legislation, there are clearly many stakeholders who are still concerned about this overlap. One of the objectives in this legislation reform process is to reduce red tape and compliance issues for licensees. However, it is plain to see that this objective could be risked if a state government chose to enact separate and additional legislation. I would hope that this issue of clarity and certainty is resolved in future COAG discussions. The commencement of the responsible lending provisions has been delayed until 1 January 2011. The Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia pointed out in its submission to the Senate inquiry that this delay has the potential to leave open a window where consumers become less protected. The MFAA noted: … in those states and territories where there is already operative broker legislation, viz WA, NSW, Victoria and ACT, consumers will be in a worse position than they currently are, as it is proposed state jurisdictions will be ‘turned 31 October 2009. Perhaps that needs to be examined more closely. I hope that the gap between the state provisions ending and the federal ones beginning has been or will be addressed, to ensure that businesses are at all times clear of their obligations and borrowers will not be caught in a limbo area where they have no redress to the law for unscrupulous practices or where they have not been fully advised of the detail of the contracts they are entering into or their consequences. As I mentioned earlier, the protection of consumers starts with ensuring that they are fully informed about their choices. But I think that this process needs to start much earlier. We need to ensure that all young adults have access to financial education so that they are informed about the basics of credit and borrowing before they are ever in the situation where important decisions need to be made. We are seeing young people being targeted by advertising. The temptation to buy things on credit is probably increasing. Young people need to understand how to manage their financial affairs and to understand the consequences of what they are doing. The process of educating people about personal financial matters should start at school and be carried on throughout the community. This is a process that I would encourage banks and other financial institutions and institutional lenders to become involved in. After all, it is really in everybody's interests that credit is not provided to those who clearly cannot afford to repay it. Australia is already a world leader in terms of prudent financial regulations. As we seek to further strengthen this network of consumer protection through legislation and regulation, I believe that it is equally important that we empower consumers so that they may protect themselves. The old saying is that knowledge is power, and once borrowers off' on become fully educated about financial matters they will also become empowered and will not need to rely on black-letter law or the legislative process in this parliament or others. While it is necessary that we have strong deterrents in place and consequences for unscrupulous lending, preventing such practices should be our primary aim. It is much harder for a lender to take advantage of educated borrowers, and with greater education the market for substandard credit products will be greatly reduced. I am sure that that will be very welcome throughout the community. The coalition supports the legislative program aimed at protecting consumers but eagerly awaits the release of the all-important regulations which, according to the Australian Finance Conference, contain ‘crucial scope, exemptions and operational content'. As we move ahead in this reform process it is important that we also make a secondary attempt to increase financial awareness within the community, especially with the younger population, who face a world of increasing reliance on credit. It is the borrower who will make the final decision as to what credit product best suits their need, and they are the ones who need to be empowered to take responsibility for this decision. The national consumer credit protection framework is an important first step in ensuring that the borrowers of the future cannot fall foul of unprincipled lending practices. In closing, this debate gives me the opportunity to raise the issue of reverse mortgages. This is one of the creative products that have become available in recent years. It is not a bad product, but people need to fully understand how it works. Sadly, in my electorate, I have seen a couple of older Australians take up reverse mortgages without fully understanding them-and yet there are very strong prudential requirements around these loans. But they have not fully understood what they mean. In one case, if they broke their arrangement, a penalty of about $80,000 applied. It can be a very good product. It can be very helpful in some circumstances. But the reason for this legislation is to make sure that people fully understand the terms of these contracts and that they fully understand the consequences of entering into them, and I think that is the crux of such legislation. to be hoped that it assists the community in managing their financial arrangements better.",40
26,Ms NEAL,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"I rise in the House today to speak in support of the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009. The measures contained within this bill will bring welcome and long-overdue protections for consumers across Australia. This bill is being presented today in association with two related bills, namely the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009. Known collectively as the national credit reform package, these three measures will establish for the first time in Australia a single standard national regime for the regulation of consumer credit. I have to say that I am particularly excited about this package of bills because this has been an aspiration of the Australian Labor Party since I was the consumer affairs shadow minister back in 1996. This package of bills gives expression to government announcements to the Council of Australian Governments-COAG-meeting of 2 December 2008 which set out the terms under which the Commonwealth would assume responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit. Together, these bills will give consumers and providers of financial services a truly national set of laws existing under a uniform regime of consumer credit regulation and oversight. Briefly, the three bills function in the following manner. The main bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill, will introduce a framework which does four things. Firstly, it licenses credit providers, brokers and intermediaries. Secondly, it applies responsible lending conduct requirements to licensed parties. Thirdly, it provides a rigorous dispute resolution mechanism that is It is supported by appropriate enforcement powers for the regulators, ASIC, including improved court arrangements, remedies for consumers and penalties for licensee misconduct. Finally, the framework includes the overseeing of the regulation of margin loans. The second bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill, deals with the rights and liabilities of certain existing credit contracts and with court proceedings that existed or arose prior to the commencement of the credit bill. It also establishes a registration process for industry participants as the precursor to licensing. The third bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill, provides the mechanism to support the imposition of fees for various matters. The changes to the consumer credit sector that will result from the national credit reform package will transform the ways in which the consumer credit sector is organised, administered and regulated. The package will promote responsible lending practices amongst credit providers and brokers. It will enforce national codes of accreditation and impose standard codes of conduct for all involved in the provision of credit. Most importantly, the package will ensure that consumers in this sector are protected in a number of ways. Comprehensive new licensing laws for the consumer credit sector will be introduced. Lenders and providers of consumer credit broking services must be registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and obtain an Australian credit licence. Participants will need to be registered or licensed if they engage in lending or collecting money, act as an intermediary between consumers and lenders or act as a credit broker in advising consumers to apply for a particular loan or otherwise assist them to apply for a particular loan. Robust entry standards will apply for the registration and licensing procedures for participants in this sector of the finance industry. Credit lenders, brokers and their agents must also meet ongoing standards of conduct when providing credit activities to consumers. The regulatory body, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, will have the power to suspend or cancel licences if the participant fails to achieve and maintain required standards of professional conduct. Licensing procedures will be streamlined for authorised deposit-taking institutions such as banks and credit unions. In addition, limited expectations will be provided for some point-of-sale staff and debt collectors. This comprehensive new licensing regime will introduce, over time, considerable benefits to this sector of the financial system in Australia. It will encourage the improvement of standards in the industry and thereby improve consumer confidence and market integrity. In particular, fringe or predatory players will be excluded. In other areas such as credit broking, this will improve the credibility of the profession. To become a licensed credit lender or broker, a person must demonstrate that they are a fit and proper person. They must also comply with appropriate standards of conduct expected of a licensee. For example, they are required to demonstrate to ASIC that they can conduct a business efficiently, honestly and fairly. They must also demonstrate to the regulator that they can properly train and supervise their agents. ASIC will publish guidance on how participants can demonstrate that they meet these licensing requirements. This guidance will be particularly directed at small businesses. This is a terrific idea for small businesses as it will help make a smoother transition to the new licensing arrangements by providing business operators with simple, practical assistance on how to become licensed. One of the most fundamental principles that underpin the national credit reform package is the promotion of responsible lending conduct in the sector. It is of paramount importance that credit not be given irresponsibly to consumers. The package establishes a set of responsible lending conduct standards for all licensed credit providers and their agents when they enter a consumer into a credit contract, when they suggest a credit product or when they assist in a consumer's application for a credit contract. This code will ensure that licensees do not provide credit that is unsuitable for consumers-which, frankly, happens so often these days. It ensures that the product, service or contract is well fitted to the particular needs of the consumer as well as not being unsuitable. Most importantly, it will ensure that consumer has a realistic capacity to pay their financial obligations. Consumers will also have guaranteed disclosure on the part of the licensee about any credit related costs or commissions. They will have access to key rights of consumer redress and to transparent assessment procedures. One specific new arrangement that will enhance consumer protection for thousands of Australians relates to the refinancing of home loans. For homeowners who are refinancing home loans in the face of financial difficulty, the new law includes a presumption that the refinancing will be unsuitable for the consumer if they would have to sell their primary residence to meet the financial obligations of the new finance arrangements. The package will establish a truly consistent and national regime for credit related arrangements. But the code will be strengthened and improved in a number of ways. It will be expanded to include contracts where the credit is provided to purchase, renovate or refinance a residential property for investment purposes. Consumers will now be able to apply for hardship variations or stays of enforcement, up to a monetary threshold of $500,000, and credit providers will have to respond to such a request within 21 days. This is particularly important, because I have had a number of constituents who have come to me in dire financial circumstances who have made a request of their financial institution and the financial institution has failed to respond and, essentially, starved them out by inaction. In another breakthrough for consumer rights, credit providers will no longer be able to use household goods as security for loans. This national credit code will also close various loopholes, such as certain fee-splitting structures set up between related parties and certain business purpose declarations which at present can be used by unscrupulous lendthe ers and brokers to avoid the law. The code will also ensure that credit providers will be required to give consumers information when they default on their contract or when direct debit is dishonoured. These added protections for credit consumers are welcome additions to our national finance sector regulations. They will ease the financial burden on many thousands of consumers across Australia. In addition to protecting consumers, the national credit reform package gives ASIC considerable powers to impose stronger penalties for lenders and brokers. This can include criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment for serious licensee misconduct which breaches the responsible lending conduct requirements. Civil penalties for licensee misconduct will allow ASIC to levy fines of up to $220,000 for an individual or $1.1 million for a corporation. ASIC will be able to issue infringement notices to speed up the imposition of penalties for certain breaches. Consumers will also have the right to seek compensation to redress losses or damages arising from licensee misconduct. Sitting in between these various protections and the penalties, the national credit reform package also includes a no-cost, three-tiered dispute resolution system. This framework is designed to make it easier for consumers to have their disputes resolved. Consumers will have access to the licensee's internal resolution process, as well as an ASIC-approved external dispute resolution scheme. All licensees will be required to be members of an external dispute resolution scheme, and consumers will be able to take disputes to the federal, state and territory courts via a streamlined procedure for small claim actions for loss or damages of up to $40,000. These court procedures build in various further levels of protection for credit consumers. One of these protective measures presumes that the parties do not need legal representation, and another measure presumes against issuing adverse orders. In addition, the new court arrangements allow the courts to adopt informal legal procedures and depart from the formal rules of evidence. These provisions will greatly reduce the time and the often considerable expense to consumers of having to resort to the courts to resolve their disputes. The government has provided $70.2 million over four years to implement the COAG decision to transfer consumer regulation to the Commonwealth. The government will phase in the introduction of the new licensing arrangements. They will start on 1 January 2010. Before that date, anyone engaging in credit activities will need to be registered with ASIC and must apply for registration between 1 November and 31 December 2009. They will have the six-month period between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2010 to apply for an Australian credit licence. Anyone who engages in credit activities for the first time on or after 1 January 2010 must apply for and receive an Australian credit licence before starting a business. The two-stage process has been adopted to facilitate a smooth transition to the licensing regime. The registration procedure has been designed to be straightforward for industry and can be completed online. The two-stage process can also give industry adequate time to meet the licensing requirements. The staged introduction of the national credit reform package will give the consumer credit industry the time in which to put in place the business infrastructure needed to support and maintain responsible lending practices. Care has been taken to minimise, where possible, the transition costs incurred by businesses when they move to the new credit regime. At the same time, existing consumer protections have been preserved and, where appropriate, enhanced. ASIC will provide all assistance possible to businesses as they adopt the new arrangements. ASIC will help businesses, especially small businesses, comply with their obligations under the new laws. It will have more flexibility to exempt or modify the licensing and registration requirements, where this is deemed appropriate. ASIC will also be able to exercise discretion in imposing penalties, taking into account instances where people have attempted in good faith to comply with these laws. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 forms the foundation of the new credit reform package. The passage of this bill and its two related bills will bring with it an historic and significant improvement in the way consumer credit is delivered in Australia. This is particularly needed at the moment, when many people are in dire financial circumstances. The package makes consistent across the country the arrangements for licensing and regulating the lenders and brokers of consumer credit. It builds stronger and more uniform protections for consumers of credit into the new national system. It brings a number of significant efficiencies to the regulatory framework, by plugging many gaps in the existing legislation which have burdened the sector for too long. Importantly, the national credit reform package will reduce the cost of doing business in Australia, the regulation of consumer credit currently being split between eight separate jurisdictions. In the long term, it will help reduce compliance costs for businesses operating in the consumer credit industry. For the first time in history, Australia's financial vices will have a truly national set of laws. The system will be fairer, more consistent and more efficient because of this legislation. I commend the bills to the House. (Quorum formed)",44
27,Mr HAYES,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"This government is implementing a credit reform package that delivers the government's commitment to nationalised consistency and the modernisation of Australia's credit laws. The package will for the first time in this country provide one single standard of a nationally consistent regime that will apply for consumer credit regulation. That is very important, particularly for those of us who represent the mortgage belts within our respective electorates and for those of us who have a significant number of our constituents involved in securing credit for running their lives and their families. The other thing to bear in mind is that this also applies in relation to those of our constituents who are involved in small business. So this is very significant and something that the House should take note of. The national consumer credit protection package comprises three bills: the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the credit bill; the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009, the transitional bill; and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009. This credit reform package has substantial benefits and its implementation is, quite frankly, long overdue. Significantly, the package will provide for an improved consumer protection regime and will move to cut the red tape and the inconsistencies that have emerged in the business practice of providing credit. The package has its genesis in the reforms that followed that historic COAG meeting of October 2008, where there was agreement to implement a two phased approach for the serAustralian government to take over responsibility for regulation of consumer credit. That is quite a significant change. Some may refer to that as a modern federalism but, in an economy underpinned by 21 million people, it is a change which is overdue. I should say at this point that it is recognised that there are many brokers and lenders out there, and many that I personally know-I have some of their businesses in my electoratewho already operate that way and meet the highest requirements. They are very ethical, they follow codes of practice set within their industries and they also have a view that the person they are lending to is not just a consumer of credit but a customer who they should seek to look after. That is important to note. This is not about beating up on those credit providers and brokers; this is to ensure there is a form of national recognition and a form of national consistency in how we go about regulating the activities of credit providers and credit brokers. These bills also make it easier and less costly for consumers to follow various remedies where there have been inappropriate practices or irresponsible lending. The reform package includes several key components which I will now summarise. The credit bill will establish for the first time a comprehensive licensing system in this country that will apply a regime across all areas of credit providers-lenders; the providers of consumer credit broking services. For the first time, they will have to be licensed. They will have to take out what will be known as an Australian credit licence. This will be a robust licensing requirement; it certainly will provide enhanced, comprehensive and consistent protections to consumers in all elements of the consumer credit transaction. Because it is a licensing arrangement, where a licence will be taken out and renewed, it will have the ongoing effect of ensuring continual improvement and enhancement of standards that apply within the industry. Therefore, the consumer market can have some confidence not only that those who are obtaining Australian credit licences will be obliged for the sake of their ongoing licence applications to uphold a code of conduct but also that there will be a consistently applied legal regime setting out how they go about their business in either providing credit or broking as credit providers. This arrangement will pretty quickly sort out those fringe players in the industry. I think we have all seen a number of examples of them. I would seriously doubt whether there would be one member in the chamber who has not had people visit or call their office concerned about the standard of contract that they have entered into. The fact is there are predatory players out there and their business is simply to provide credit and collect the fees. That does occur. We know of many examples where people have been provided with credit with little or no capacity to repay. That is not the problem of the person providing the credit, because they actually get their fee. They have signed these people to contracts but what they have done is tie families to impossible financial commitments, and not only does that create stress but also these inappropriate lending procedures impact on individual people and certainly on the local economy. In order to gain a licence the person will need to be able to demonstrate that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence. There will be other provisions attached to the licence, because it could be a broking service and there could be other people involved. There will be very stringent licensing requirements for the proper training of staff who will be engaged in the providing of credit or the supervising of the providing of credit. There will also be stringent requirements for organisations to supervise the agents or franchises that they might have under these arrangements. It should be noted that ASIC will publish guidelines for the industry, and they will actually demonstrate what people need to do to secure their licences. This will be of considerable benefit to those many small businesses out there involved in the industry, doing the right thing and ensuring that they meet the appropriate codes of conduct at the moment. They do not want to be bound by endless red tape, and this is a way of cutting through that and simplifying it as much as possible. The new credit laws in Australia will require lenders and advisers involved in these credit regimes to actually comply with these requirements. This measure is an important and welcomed development. It certainly will be welcomed in Werriwa, being an outer metropolitan seat in the mortgage belt of Sydney. Next weekend, on Saturday night, I am attending a function for Lifeline. As you will be aware, Lifeline has a range of services, including counselling people in respect of suicide, and another arm of Lifeline at the moment is providing financial counselling services. The function on Saturday night is actually in honour of all those many volunteers that spend an inordinate amount of time looking after the interests of others in our commu Lifeline Macarthur, and all his volunteers, I wish them well and look forward to seeing them on Saturday night. On behalf of a very grateful community, I would like to thank him and all his team for what they do in looking after the interests of people in our community, particularly when it comes to issues such as counselling in relation to either suicide or depression, or in many instances now in respect of financial matters. It is important to understand that because this is the development of a new federal procedure there will be some issues involved in moving away from a state system to a federal system. That is why specific transitional arrangements have been made for a turning-off procedure for current credit laws as they ply through some states and territories. As a consequence, certain procedures will ensure that there can be delayed action for the gations flowing under the credit licences up until January 2011. I will be very brief now. I also indicate that the provisions of these laws will make significantly easier for customers of credit providers to ensure that their contracts are sound and fair. Remedies are available to them which will make it easier for them to ensure that their positions can be put through either the Federal Magistrates Court or state magistrates courts without the need for legal representation. By accessing the code underpinned by this, this arrangement is another way of making it easier for the obligations credit providers to be realised and to ensure that those consumers who have credit are the beneficiaries of this legislation. I commend the bills to the House.",48
28,Mr ZAPPIA,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"I rise to speak in support of the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009. These are very important and very welcome bills. The three bills comprise the federal government's national credit reform package, which will see responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit move from the states to the Commonwealth. These reforms were agreed upon with the states at the October 2008 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 develops a framework to license credit providers, brokers and intermediaries. Once licensed, these parties will need to adhere to responsible lending conduct requirements. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 also provides appropriate enforceap- ment power to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which will be the regulator of the new national credit regime. obliIt also puts in place court arrangements, remedies for consumers, penalties for licensing misconduct and the regulation of margin loans. The National Consumer Credit Protecit tion (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 ensures a smooth changeover of the national credit regime for existing credit contracts and disputes. The National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009 provides the mechanism to support administrative fees for various matters-for example, the lodging of documents with ASIC. There are two key issues covered in this legislation that I will focus on. The first of of these is the importance of a national consumer credit regime. The Rudd government was elected with a promise to cut red tape within Australia to make doing business across state lines easier. To deliver this promise, the COAG Business Regulation and Competition Working Group was established at the first COAG meeting after the election of the Rudd government in 2007. The working group is co-chaired by ministers Tanner and Emerson. It identified 27 priority reforms to break down red tape barriers between states and move Australia to a seamless national economy. Related to that particular issue, we now live in a global economy. We now have a number of measures in place, as we recently saw with the G20 meeting in London, where we need not only consistency in national laws but consistency in international laws. To think that in 2009 we in Australia are still operating under a system where each of the six states and the two territories have independent laws relating to the same matter is totally absurd and is certainly making life for business and consumers very difficult. That is why these bills are indeed welcome. The reforms create nationwide consistency in areas such as occupational health and safety laws. I recall the debate in this place only in recent weeks referring and relating to workplace safety, a matter on which there ought to be consistency across the country. Licensing of tradespeople is something that I see time and time again as contractors win contracts between states. A contractor from one state may well win a contract in another state. They find continuous difficulty in many of their tradespeople not being licensed in the other state; therefore, creates all kinds of barriers and problems. It seems to me that we need to overcome those problems, and this is the kind of move that goes a long way towards doing that. This bill addresses the registering of business names, maritime regulation, food regulation and, of course, the implementation of a national consumer credit regime. The progress report of the working group at the July 2009 COAG meeting in Darwin showed that, of the 27 priority reforms, two are already in place, 23 of the remaining 25 reforms are on schedule as laid out in the working group's implementation plan and the remaining two areas, where reform has been slower than anticipated, will go to COAG to ensure they are advanced. Through this legislation the national consumer credit regime is one of those 23 reforms on track to be implemented as planned. This progress shows that the Rudd government is not just a government that talks about reform but a government that delivers on reform and implements the measures needed to make it easier for small business to do business across Australia. The Howard government talked a lot about cooperative federalism and what was being accomplished through COAG, but we did not see many results. Whether it be the management of the Murray River, a national consumer credit regime or any one of the other reforms being implemented through the COAG working group, it is the Rudd government that achieves results in making it easier to do business across the nation. In doing that, it highlights the support that this government has for the business sector in Australia. Time and time again I hear in this chamber members opposite talking about how they are the friends of business in this country-how they are the ones who support business. Regrettably, their words are not matched with action. When it comes to supportive action for the business it community of Australia, this government is acting. A national consumer credit regime is very important because business does not stop at state lines, as I said earlier on. It makes sense for national and international credit providers to be working under one standard regime throughout Australia. Many of the businesses that exist in this country now operate with offices and branches across the country; it is common business practice. If they do not have offices, they might have agents working in other parts of the country. We need to have that consistency. But we also need to have a reduction in the regulatory burden that is being placed on businesses. To have to register the same business in each state and perhaps the two territories is not only costly but time consuming and, quite frankly, in today's modern era should be unnecessary. That is what we should aim for and this bill goes a long way to achieving that. The bill also provides greater clarity and convenience for consumers. Consumers who move interstate or purchase from interstate providers will know they are dealing with one standard set of consumer credit laws. It will also provide them with easier mechanisms through which they can lodge a complaint. Regardless of which state the credit provider is located within, they will have the option of lodging a complaint through the ASIC office in their own state. On several occasions I have been contacted by my constituents in Makin seeking assistance with consumer issues arising from their dealing with interstate companies, which are of course covered under that particular state's consumer laws. It is always difficult trying to provide real assistance to them because of that and because you are dealing with a company that is based interstate. Therefore, having consistency will be of great benefit to consumers wherever they might be located in Australia. I also note that, as part of its implementation of all these changes, ASIC will be employing about 100 new staff. I welcome the advice that some of these staff will be based in Adelaide. Given the impact of the global financial crisis on employment in the financial services sector, I welcome the move by ASIC to hire new staff and to regulate the new consumer credit regime. The second aspect of this bill I would like to address in detail is responsible lending. Credit providers licensed under this regime will need to engage in responsible lending conduct and must not provide credit products and services that are unsuitable to consumers' needs and that the consumer does not have the capacity to repay. If there is one specific action that has led to the global economic crisis, it would have to be irresponsible lending. The crisis began as a crisis in US home mortgage sector, where consumers were offered loans that were unsuitable to their needs and that the consumer obviously did not have the capacity to repay. These loans were based on the premise that, when the unsuitable lender did eventually default, the mortgage provider was covered either by the increase in the property's value since the loan was made or by the fact that the liability for the loan had been packaged into a financial product and on-sold to another institution, thus spreading the risk of the bad loan. The crisis that began in the US housing sector spread throughout the financial industry and then to the broader economy. It all began with irresponsible lending practices. The crisis began because in both housing and consumer credit consumers were offered loans they had no capacity to repay. Sadly, this is often done by agents who act on commission and have no regard for the long term consequences of the loan that they might be encouraging or facilitating for consumers. The Australian financial services industry has not been hit as hard by the global economic crisis as its counterparts in nations like the USA, Great Britain, Ireland and Iceland. It would be fair to say that one of the reasons for this is the lending practices within Australia have been better regulated than those in other countries. In fact, the Prime Minister and Treasurer both had positive responses when holding up the regulation of Australia's financial system as a model for the rest of the world at G20 meetings earlier this year. Just because our industry is better off than most does not however mean that we should be complacent or assume that it does not need reform. This national consumer credit regime is certainly a positive step. There are other measures in this bill that I also welcome such as the regulation of margin lending loans, which played the such a significant role in the demise of firms such as ABC Learning and Babcock and Brown, which no longer exist in the form they did before the global economic crisis. The national consumer credit regime will be good for business, it will be good for consumers, it will help restore the confidence that Australians have in their financial system and it will be another significant step in the Rudd government's reform package that will, in partnership with the states, truly ate a new era in federal-state relations in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",50
29,Mr BOWEN,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (11.43 am)-in reply-I thank the member for Makin and the other members who have contributed to this debate: the members for Oxley, Werriwa, Robertson, Aston and Pearce. I agree with the comments by the member for Makin, and particularly note his welcoming of the fact that a considerable number of the ASIC staff to be dealing with the new credit regime will be based in Adelaide. He is correct. I recently visited the ASIC Adelaide office and a very considerable number of staff will be added to the Adelaide office, and they are very much looking forward to the increased responsibility they have as part of this reform. This reform is long overdue. There is no good or rational reason for different regimes relating to credit in Australia. We should have one national regime and, when this National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and cognate legislation pass, we will have one national regime. This is an important part of our federalist approach of reviewing regulations and ensuring much greater harmony cross state and territory borders, and ensuring a national approach to regulation wherever possible. This bill also introduces for the first time a national responsible ing regime. We always knew that this would be controversial. We always knew that there would be some who would say we should have gone further and some who would say we should not have gone as far. Nevertheless, we do believe we have struck a reasonable balance and that there will be considerable benefits for consumers in having a national responsible lending regime. At the same time, compliance costs for business will be kept to a minimum and reduced as a creresult of having one national consumer credit regime. I thank all honourable members who have contributed to this debate. I do thank the member for Aston, the shadow minister, for his contribution and constructive approach, outlined to the House and also discussed with me and my office outside the House. He has raised a number of issues. He raised the issue of whether director loans should be exempt on the same basis that employee loans are exempt. I have indicated to him outside the House that I would be happy to consider that. I will say inside the House that I will consider it as the bill proceeds through both houses. He also made comment in relation to debt buyers and raised the issue of whether there should be an exemption for debt buyers as opposed to debt collectors in the bill. I have received preliminary advice on this matter which indicates that debt buyers need to be considered separately to debt collectors. Debt collectors are only involved if there is a default on the loan. To exempt them, I am advised, would create a potential loophole where many of the obligations under the bill could be avoided by a lender immediately assigning all of their credit contracts to a third party, who would not need to be licensed. I am happy to discuss this matter with the member for Aston in good faith, as I accept that he has raised it in good faith, but lend- there would be very considerable concerns that would need to be worked through in relation to the proposal and suggestion that he has made. The member for Aston also referred to the need to fast-track the process of dealing with positive credit reporting. He would be aware that the government is working through a report in relation to that matter and will be responding in due course. The matter is proceeding through the processes of government. I note the concerns of the member for Aston in relation to the start date of 1 January. I must note that I am not convinced of the need to postpone commencement. When it comes to both registration and licensing, would note that the Treasury and ASIC are working very closely indeed with industry, to ensure that authorised deposit-taking institutions and companies that currently hold an AFSL will be aided as much as possible in transitioning to the new arrangements and the regulatory burden of making the transition should be minimal. The member for Pearce raised a concern that there would be a regulatory gap of 12 months in relation to brokers. The member for Pearce may not have been aware of the recent announcement that that would not be the case. Brokers and other non-ADI lenders would be dealt with through a fast-track regime, or a regime which more closely reflected the regional start date, where there are considerable difficulties for ADIs in meeting the start date. In conclusion, this is a very important form. It is a reform that governments have spoken of for many years and indeed for many decades but it is a reform which has eluded governments. We are proud that we have been able to deliver this reform, subject to the wishes of both houses of parliament. We thank our state colleagues for their cooperation and for the very constructive way in which they have engaged in discussions, particularly with my predecessor as minister for corporate law, the Hon. Senator Nick Sherry, and with me, in progressing this reform. I commend these very important forms to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

33,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I rise today to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009, the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009. This is significant legislation and has generated a strong and emotive response. I wish to start with what I sider the most pertinent issue that has resulted from the minister's bungled handling of these bills. The bills extend Commonwealth subsidised indemnity insurance to ‘eligible midwives'. A lot of the detail giving force to these bills will follow by way of regulation. To date, we and the public have been given scant detail by the government on this critical future regulation. The government has yet to provide the actuarial modelling for the indemnity insurance scheme, other than a very simplified explanation provided to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry by departmental officials. It causes concern that once again this minister has rushed headlong into legislation with the attitude, ‘We'll work out the detail later.' It is clearly not the responsible way to legislate and, as we have seen time and time again from this government, it leads to mistakes, oversights and bungling. The parliament and the public are entitled to the detail of the policy and legislation that is to be voted on. According to the bills, an eligible midwife is a person who: (a) is licensed, registered or authorised to practice midwifery by … the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; (b) meets such other requirements … as are specified in the Rules …; and (c) is not included in a class of persons specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph. We learn of possible excluded classes of midwives from the minister's second reading speech. The minister stated: … the Commonwealth supported professional indemnity cover will not respond to claims relating to homebirths. It is the intersection of these bills with the National Registration and Accreditation con- Scheme where serious and genuine concern has arisen. The exposure draft of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law 2009, bill B, under ‘Eligibility for general registration', states: (d) there is, or will be, in force in relation to the individual appropriate professional indemnity insurance arrangements, including a policy held, or arrangements made, by the individual's employer that will cover the individual, Under this exposure draft, in accordance with clauses 128 and 129, an individual who practises as a midwife without indemnity insurance and is therefore unregistered may be subject to a maximum penalty of $30,000. Come 1 July 2010, given the minister's current position, midwives will effectively be prohibited from providing birthing services outside of a clinical setting. This is an issue that is fundamentally about choice. It is extraordinary for a health minister to effectively prohibit mothers and parents around the country from having an appropriately qualified health professional in attendance at childbirth. I acknowledge that there is a great diversity of opinion on homebirthing, both within the medical and health fraternity and in the wider community. At every stage, though, all reasonable parties to such debate would rightly acknowledge that homebirthing is not an appropriate option for all women, and I would certainly strongly recommend that any patient, in particular expectant mothers, be properly informed and that they consult relevant health professionals. However, I am not here today to debate the merits or otherwise of homebirthing; that is for others. I am here to fend the right of intelligent, informed Austraperspective lian adults to have a choice-to be entitled to decide for themselves. To date, homebirthing is the choice of only a small proportion of women-in 2006 it made up 0.26 per cent of all births. However, it is naive to suggest that all women will simply surrender this option. The Minister for Health and Ageing knows that there are a small proportion of mothers and parents who will continue to choose not to enter the hospital system for a childbirth. choice. This measure will just drive homebirthing underground, with parents unable to access appropriate care, jeopardising the lives of not just the unborn babies but also the mothers themselves. Childbirth is an intimate and personal decision for families in consultation with health and medical professionals. It is not appropriate for the Rudd government or Minister Roxon to mandate the conditions of childbirth for all women across the country. This is a nanny-state Labor government treating with contempt the rights of mature adults to make informed decisions. Families currently privately contract with registered midwives for services outside of a clinical setting. They should be entitled to continue to do so in accordance with appropriate medical guidelines and on the advice of health and medical practitioners. I have received many compelling and reasoned pleas from parents across the country on this issue, as have many members on both sides of this House. I have met with a number of parents and their children in my electorate and in other parts of the country. Today I would like to read to the House, and specifically to bring to the attention of the minister, the concerns of Rebecca and Darryl Jenkinson, who reside in my electorate. I had the pleasure of meeting with Rebecca and her two young children in my electorate office. de- Rebecca provided an insightful and personal on the ill-considered effects of the government's changes. Rebecca and Darryl articulate the reasonable concerns that are so evident in this debate, and I quote in part what they wrote: We chose homebirth with a private midwife for the arrival of our two daughters, Indiana in 2007 and Saffron in 2009. It was an informed choice, made at the culmination of much research into our birthing options. While it is ‘the road less travelled' in Australia, homebirth is the right choice for our family and we feel betrayed by the That is their proposed legislation. To care for us throughout our pregnancy and birth journey, we chose a healthcare professional whose expertise is normal pregnancy and birth; we chose a midwife. Prenatal visits were as much about preparation for parenting as they were about the clinical progress of the pregnancy. We discussed the various unexpected outcomes that could arise and how we would respond to those and, when necessary, our midwife referred us to a doctor for further advice. After those consultations we always returned to our midwife's support for our ongoing care and it was that continuity which protected our safety. By the time ‘birthday' actually arrived, we could simply patiently allow our baby's birth to unfold and enjoy the experience. All the while, our midwife was the guardian of our safety and would alert us if we needed to activate any of our contingency plans. Every family is different. Every family makes different choices and those choices must be respected and treated equally by our government. Making continuous care from a known midwife more available to women is fantastic. But where we choose to give birth should not affect our ity to access that care. Our choice, homebirth a private midwife, is valid. As our elected government we ask you, simply, to sort this out and protect our right to birth where, how and with whom we choose. Rebecca and Darryl's experience highlights that through consultation and genuine collaboration between parents, midwives and doctors, decisions can be made that deliver good outcomes. It might be difficult for this government to accept, but the Prime Minister and the Minister Health and Ageing do not always know best-Australians are able to make informed, educated decisions that deliver good outcomes for themselves and their families. If the minister is unable to satisfactorily resolve the issue of indemnity insurance for midwives then at least the proposed registration requirements should be amended to allow existing services to continue-the so-called status quo option. In order to have an informed debate on the provision of indemnity insurance to cover affected midwives, the government needs to release the detailed actuarial modelling that it used for its proposal. I now turn to the PBS and MBS access for midwives and nurse practitioners. There needs to be a more holistic approach to health care in Australia, especially in the areas of preventive health and chronic illness. The skills of all health and medical professionals should be utilised to their full potential in accordance with appropriate scope of practice. Practice nurses, for some time, have been an invaluable and integral part of primary health care in Australia, and their role, skills and professional development will be central as we go forward. However, extending access to the PBS and MBS has significant ramifications in terms of scope of practice, patient safety and the economic viability of the health budget. The interest bill alone on the Rudd government's abilhuge debt will make it hard in future years to with meet extra expenditure on these schedules and other expenditure across the health system. It is important that PBS and MBS access for all professions is carefully considered and monitored in accordance with professional qualifications and experience. The coalition firmly believe that GPs are the cornerstone of primary health care in Australia and it is important that there is genuine collaboration between the other health professions and GPs in managing patient health care. We have not received any clear detail on the so-called collaborative model which is central to these bills. What we do not want to see is a two-tiered system in Australia. Anyone who wishes to see a doctor for their healthcare needs should be entitled to do so. We do not want to see a situation where Australians have to see a nurse not because they want to or because it is convenient but because it is an easier solution for this government. We need to see a genuine model of collaboration, with GPs working with other health professionals and specialist practitioners in managing patient care. It is important that there are appropriate guidelines for scope of practice, ensuring patient safety and the economic viability of the PBS and MBS. The government's current investment in the PBS and MBS is significant. As at 30 June 2007, the coalition government spent $6.4 billion per annum on pharmaceutical benefits. Coalition government expenditure on the MBS was some $11.7 billion as at 30 June 2007. This is a significant increase from 1995-96 amounts, under the last Labor administration, of $2.2 billion and $6 billion respectively. It is important that these programs are utilised as efficiently as possible and that they remain viable into the future. However, in order to consider that issue, the government needs to release the detail under which this legislation will operate. There is a conspicuous and concerning lack of detail behind these bills. The creation of referral rights for nurse practitioners to specialists another significant component of this legislation. However, once again, we need to be assured of the efficiency of such a model. Currently, GPs refer a only very small proportion of patients to specialists. We ask the government to release the modelling, or at least some sensible detail as to how this measure may affect the quantity of referrals, waiting times for specialists and the MBS. Whilst there is a logical argument for nurse practitioners and midwives to have some capacity to order pathology and diagnostic services attracting a Medicare rebate, the workability and efficiency of this proposal will entirely depend on the collaborative model, which we understand the government has not yet devised. Without a national e-health record, and without knowing how the government's planned collaborative model will work, there is significant risk of duplication and overservicing in this area. The health budget, provided by the taxpayers of Australia, is certainly not infinite and needs to be managed carefully to meet the worthy but almost endless demands placed on it. It is certainly one of the most difficult aspects of the health portfolio. There are many worthy causes that would benefit from funding in the health portfolio. However, the reality of the situation, and something which we all need to remind ourselves of, is that funding is provided by the hard working taxpayers of this country and the pie is only so big. There is a duty, an obligation in fact, on government to ensure that taxpayers' money is always used efficiently. Unfortunately this is clearly not something the Rudd government understands. We have seen billions of dollars of taxpayers' money squandered on populist cash handoutsracking up over $300 billion in debt for the youth of this country to pay off. As I say, the debt servicing requirements is caused by the Rudd government's reckless spending will cut deeply into key budget areas such as health in future years; and there are few portfolios where this obligation to ensure the best use of funds is more important than health. There is an opportunity cost to all initiatives. The stark reality of the situation is that taxpayers cannot fund everything. Policy needs to be considered and refined and there needs to be more consultation than what this government has committed itself to in the past. Taxpayers deserve, and the government is obliged to provide, the ‘best bang for the buck'. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry examining this legislation has received over 1,800 submissions and was due to report on 7 August 2009. The reporting date was moved to 17 August due to the overwhelming public reaction. Whilst we do not oppose the passage of this bill today on the basis of the homebirth outcome, we do reserve the right to move amendments in consideration of the recommendations of the Senate committee's report. We are opposed to making homebirth illegal and we will fight for choice. I put the government on notice that we are carefully considering the committee's recommendations that were released in this regard. The minister's bungled handling of this critical legislation follows this government's complete mismanagement of the health portfolio. Mr Rudd and Minister Roxon made numerous explicit and unambiguous promises that a decision to hold a referendum to take financial control of public hospitals would be made by mid-2009. For example, a media release by Nicola Roxon and Kevin Rudd on 23 August 2007 stated: If by mid-2009 the Commonwealth and the States and Territories have not begun implementing the National Health Reform Plan, a proposition for the Commonwealth to assume full funding responsibility will be developed Australian people. As of 30 June 2009, Mr Rudd failed to state whether he would honour this promise. However, some confusion is understandable in relation to this promise, as Mr Rudd has gone to great lengths to retract it. In fact, a paragraph referring to the referendum was removed from the Prime Minister's website between October 2008 and November 2008. Under questioning in this very parliament, the Prime Minister failed to respond as to why this had occurred. In addition, a heading ‘Fixing our hospitals' on the Prime Minister's website was replaced with ‘Improving our hospitals' during the same period. Despite Mr Rudd's promise to fix the health system, I am inundated daily with complaints about the Rudd government's ill considered policy decisions and savage cuts to successful health programs. Since coming to office, the Rudd government has introduced measures to have the Medicare rebate for patients undergoing cataract surgery, capped the Medicare safety net for a range of procedures, cut funding for chemotherapy drugs and slashed the private health insurance rebate. These measures will increase the cost of health care for many Australians and put more pressure on Australia's already overstretched public hospitals. We have seen as recently as this week, in question time, the minister's inability to guarantee her own comments that IVF patients who are charged $6,000 or less per cycle will not be worse off because of the government's cuts to the Medicare safety net. I issue the challenge to the minister, who is here in the chamber today, to live up to that guarantee, to repeat those words in this parliament. Minister, if you used those words in your second reading speech and you walked away from them during question time, why not come back and provide a guarantee to those thousands of parents right around the and put to the countryMs Roxon interjecting",55

36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I think the minister should do without the preamble. It would assist the House. Ms Roxon-If it assists the House, I withdraw.",59
37,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"The IVF parents around the country are delicate about this issue, because for them this is the difference between being able to start a family and not. This government has, unbelievably, cut the support to IVF parents around the country. Many people will not have the capacity to make a decision to have an IVF cycle. In many cases, people have to have several cycles. I have spoken in the House before about such instances where families have had to endure over a dozen cycles to make sure that they have every chance of bringing a child into this world. Ms Roxon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are 20 minutes into the member's speech. This is a bill about extending MBS and PBS to midwives and nurses. He has not yet brought himself to say anything positive about nurses. He is not being relevant to the bill and I would like him back to the debate. If he has nothing good to say about nurses, he should sit down.",59
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,Order! The honourable member for Dickson will relate his remarks to the bill.,60
39,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"The characterisation by the minister, just for the sake of Hansard, a complete misrepresentation. This is a minister who has championed the cause of women around the country-and, in particular, the rights of nurses-and yet in this very bill this minister is saying to nurses and to parents around the country who are making decisions about how they will birth their children, ‘You cannot have a midwife, because we are making the practice illegal and we are exposing people to a $30,000 fine.' This is a minister who would slap nurses in the face in this bill. Ms Roxon- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance again. As the shadow minister already indicated in his earlier comments, the bill that deals with ‘unlawfulness', as the member puts it, is not currently before the House. That is the registration and accreditation bill. If the member for Dickson has nothing more to say on what are momentous changes for nurses and midwives across the country then he should sit down. He is required to be relevant to the bill.",60
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I understand the point of order. The minister will resume her seat. I asked the member to direct his comments to the bill, which he did.",60
41,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Absolutely, Mr Deputy Speaker. The interjections by this minister are designed only to try and run the clock down. People should understand the strategy of the minister.",60
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Order! The member will resume his seat. The minister, to bring on a further point of order? Ms Roxon-Yes, it is, and I know that it is difficult as the chair in this situation to be across all of the detail of the bill. This bill does not have a $30,000 fine in it. He is speaking about an entirely different bill, which is not before the House. It just shows is the shadow minister's incompetence. Mr Randall-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the fact is that the member is very relevant, in that IVF cycles have a fair bit to do with midwifery, I would have thought.",60
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I have heard the arguments. I will continue to listen carefully to what the member for Dickson says. I repeat what I said before, and that is that his remarks should be related to the bills.",60
44,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not getting into some petty tit-for-tat with the minister, who obviously wants to distract from the message. This is a slap in the face for those 1,800 people who made submissions to the Senate inquiry on this very bill. These people were concerned about the fact that this government is going to, by way of this legislation before the House and the national registration and accreditation process, make it illegal for parents to have a homebirth with a midwife in attendance in this country. That is unacceptable from a government and from a minister, and it is no wonder that the backlash from the backbench and from her party has been quite outstanding. Ms Roxon- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. I am quite happy for the member to use other forms of the House to debate what is an important issue, but it is not part of any of the three bills that we are currently debating. The shadow minister, as a previous minister, knows that he should make his comments relevant.",60
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,It is my ruling that the member for Dickson's remarks are relevant to the long title of the bills.,61
46,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is no wonder that these patients, these expectant mothers, these mothers who have been through the process of homebirthing and who have experienced the benefit of having a trained midwife in attendance, are so frustrated at the approach of this government, when you see the minister's petty interjections in relation to this speech. I cannot believe that a Labor government with the people who sit opposite, who champion the cause of choice, of the rights of women, are effectively taking away the choice of those women around the country. It is no wonder that there has been revolt in the Labor Party caucus against the minister's decision. This is a bad outcome for those women who have a choice. Some people agree with homebirthing; others do not. But the reality is: they have a choice to make, and the fact that this government has taken that choice away is a very sad indictment of many people within the Labor Party-not just in this place but in the other place as well. I do not care what people in the Labor Party are saying in private to homebirth mothers; they are saying absolutely nothing in public. It is worthless for them to continue to show sympathy and to say that they are going to advocate behind the scenes on behalf of homebirth mothers when not one Labor female or male MP in this place, or Senator in the other place, has spoken out publicly against this minister's stance. I know that there are dozens of people within the Labor Party who are talking to homebirth mothers in their electorates, in Canberra and in other parts of the country, and they are saying to people in those conversations that they do not agree with what this minister is doing. She does not have the support of the caucus and yet somehow this has been rammed through on them. It is a pathetic example of representational politics by the Labor Party in this country that many of those women are not speaking up. Whether the Prime Minister has gagged them or whether the health minister has gagged them, if these people are going to stay true to the convictions that they commit to in private then they should be coming out to provide public support to their statements and they should be talking against this particular provision by Nicola Roxon. That is the important part: this provision is by Nicola Roxon, who has championed herself as some sort of advocate of nurses yet she is saying to midwives who want to continue in the practice of homebirth that effectively they are going to be fined $30,000. That is completely outrageous. In looking at the outcomes in this bill, I have spoken to the positive outcomes and I have addressed the issues which I think need to be addressed. We now have the benefit of the Senate inquiry report, and we will certainly be looking at the option of moving amendments until this government gets it right. Until this government gets it right, we will continue to advocate on behalf of those thousands of mothers around the country who are currently being ignored by Labor members across the country. We will listen and stand up for their rights. We will stand up for choice. We will listen to their concerns because those concerns are not limited to a handful of people. Even people who do not agree with homebirthing say that those who choose to take up such an option should have that right into the future. That this health minister would take that away certainly underscores some of the difficulties not just around this policy and around the bill that before the House but around the general approach to the issue of health in this country. This is a government that say one thing one day and do something completely different the next day. They have not altered outcomes for the better in health over the course of the last 18 months. All Australians know, particularly in relation to public hospitals, that the situation has got worse over the last 18 months. The situation has got worse for our good, hard working doctors and nurses around the country. They are working in conditions in hospitalsMs Roxon interjecting",61
47,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,This is a bill which relates to midwives and to nurse practitioners; these people are working in hospitalsMs Roxon interjecting,62
48,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Nurses work in hospitals, Minister. I did not think she was that far of touch, but nurses work in hospitals. Ms Roxon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The shadow minister is straying far and wide, but MBS and PBS items are not available to staff that work in hospitals because they are state employees and, again, he is being irrelevant.",62
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,Order! There is no point of order.,62
50,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"The point out of all of this is that despite all the promises, all the rhetoric and all the spin lines-the way in which it was rehearsed and put at the last election that Labor had a plan to fix hospitals-I would ask people all around the country, and those nurses and doctors and other allied health professionals who are working in terrible conditions: has anything improved in your hospital over the last 18 months? Of course it has not. This is a government that have now walked away from their commitment to fix public hospitals and is to make the situation better for nurses and doctors around the country. They are saying, ‘We cannot give you a guarantee-after 16 months of consultation with 10 of the country's best health experts and despite coming up with 123 recommendations-that we will introduce any reform in health today, tomorrow, next month or indeed for the next six months.' This is a prime minister who has now decided to go on a tour around the country for six months, visiting hospitals",62
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,Order! The member for Dickson is now straying from the issue before the chair.,62
52,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"He is visiting hospitals where the hard working nurses that we are talking about in these bills are working. These are people that deserve better working conditions and yet they have been condemned by this government to the same practices that have delivered bad health outout comes by Labor governments over the last 10 years. The pouring of more money into problems, which is always Labor's solution, is not the solution in health-without the reform of the system. We need structural reform. We do not need good money being poured after bad. Reforms need to be made to get better health and patient outcomes. This is a government which has to start thinking about the patients. We cannot continue in this country in the 21st century to have people dying on waiting lists and to have parents waiting a dozen hours overnight in emergency departments. This is a government which still condones waiting lists that are being doctored-that are publicly acknowledged as being doctored-and fraudulently put to the Commonwealth to extort funds from the Commonwealth to fund them. And the waiting lists grow longer and longer. No wonder nurses around the country",62
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,Order! The member for Dickson has now strayed beyond some reasonable bounds. I ask him to come back to the issue before the House.,63
54,Mr DUTTON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,No wonder they are expressing frustration. We need to continue to take the fight up in relation to this bill before the House. We will do that. We will hold this government to account because the Australian public knows that on health Kevin Rudd has only made the situation worse.,63
55,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Before calling the next speaker, can I remind the member for Dickson that in future he should refer to members by their title or their office.",63
56,Mr NEUMANN,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I would remind the member for Dickson that in October 2007 the Institute of Health and Welfare handed down a report, a damning critique of the Howard government's tenure on the Treasury benches when it came to health and hospital reform in this country. Even the member for Warringah, the former Minister for Health and Ageing, had to concede that he did not attend-at a time when he was available-a debate on health and hospital reform with the shadow opposition spokesperson, the now Minister for Health and Ageing. He had to concede that they had effectively defunded the health and hospital system in this country compared to the states and territories and the private sector, which took up the slack for the failure of the Howard government. The Howard government occupied the Treasury benches in this House from about March 1996 to November 2007. The real crisis when it came to midwives in this country developed in about 2001. We were not in office at that time. The Howard government had six years or more to resolve these issues. Did we hear any speeches from the member for Dickson in relation to the resolution of the issues concerning insurance, Medicare and PBS assistance for midwives and nurse practitioners? I cannot recall a speech on those issues during that time by the member for Dickson in relation to that. Due to the collapse of the insurance market after 9-11 and a landmark obstetrics birth injury case involving a payout of $11 million in 2002, this became a big crisis for midwives. With just over 200 privately practising midwives paying about $800 a year for insurance, there simply was not a large enough pool to fund a payout of that sort of magnitude. It is a bit rich for the member for Dickson to criticise us when those opposite did nothing for nearly 12 years to resolve these issues. It is almost like the slate has been wiped clean and the member for Dickson cannot understand what happened during that time. This is a good reform that we are seeing today. I did not know whether the member for Dickson was supporting this legislation, the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and cognate bills, or whether he had some concrete amendments he wanted to put to the House. We heard a lot of huff and bluff but we did not see much by way of reform. (Quorum formed) It must be a pretty sorry state for the LNP in Queensland when the National Party have to protect them. Ignorance and idleness: that is what the tenure of the Howard government was when it came to assistance to midwives. I was just talking about the failures of the member for Dickson and putative member for MCPherson at that time. He really does need to have a look at geography in Queensland if he wants to think about where to stand at the next election. He does not stand firmly on the side of midwives here. He might not be sure where he is standing geographically at the next election but he does not stand on the side of midwives. Midwives are supporting the three bills that are before the House. I have spoken to members of the Maternity Coalition in Queensland. I have spoken to a number of people involved in this industry-people like Teresa Walsh, a constituent of mine. I have met with a lot of midwives and other people who are involved in homebirths in this country. I also had the privilege of serving on the local health community council with Cas MCCullough, a very prominent person involved with the Maternity Coalition in Queensland. We have taken decisive action and early action in assisting midwives and nurse practitioners. It was the Rudd Labor government, in fulfilment of what we said we would do, that commissioned a report. In June 2008 the Minister for Health and Ageing directed the Commonwealth Chief Nurse and Midwifery Officer, Rosemary Bryant, to conduct a review into the delivery of maternity services in Australia. I talked about this when I spoke to the local Maternity Coalition people in the Barry Jones Auditorium in Ipswich, in my electorate, some many months ago. I support and have always supported the right of women to self-determination when it comes to issues of pregnancy and their birthing experiences. I believe, as a father of daughters, that it is my daughters' right to choose in the circumstances what they do with their bodies and how they control their decision making concerning pregnancy and the birth of children. I have always taken that view because I believe it is important that we give women as much autonomy and self determination as we possibly can. When it comes to this issue of midwives and the assistance given to them, the report of the Maternity Services Review, which was released in February 2009, noted that Australia is one of the safest countries in the world in which a woman can give birth. There were many submissions to the review. The AMA expressed very strong views in its submission, saying that if support for funding arrangements for midwives were to be expanded it would need to be done on the basis that the services and assistance were in a medically supervised model. Many other organisations made submissions, as did many women who are involved in midwifery and nursing. The review made a number of recommendations such as the interesting one found on pages 20 and 21 of the report. There the review advised against premature support for homebirths to avoid ‘polarising the professions' and noted that insurance premiums would be very high-and that is the reality. In the budget we committed $120.5 million over four years to maternity services reform and $59.7 million over four years to expand the role of nurse practitioners because we believe nurse practitioners fulfil an important role in the delivery of primary health care. The bills before the House will establish a professional indemnity scheme for eligible midwives, which we believe is critical to ensuring assistance by way of MBS and PBS arrangements. We believe strongly that this will improve efficiency, capacity and productivity when it comes to our health workforce and that it is important for health and hospital reform, particularly in rural and regional areas and places like my electorate of Blair. Nurse practitioners provide healthcare services already and prescribe medications in a number of jurisdictions. However, the legislation will enable their clients to access MBS and PBS subsidised services and medications. For midwives to be eligible to participate in the new arrangements, they will need to meet advanced practising requirements and be involved in collaborative arrangements with medical practitioners. We expect around 700 eligible midwives will participate over the next four years. We have listened to what the stakeholders, including doctors and the AMA, have said. We have taken note of their submissions and are following the recommendations of the review. We are not making homebirths unlawful and the various pieces of legislation before the House do not say that we are. But we are, as the minister said on 24 June this year in a speech to this House, removing barriers to the provision of care and we are ensuring that we improve services and the community's access to services. We believe this is very important to enable our nursing and midwife workforce to be able to access the kind of assistance that will ensure they operhave ate successfully in consultation with medical practitioners and the medical workforce, including in regional and rural areas. We have looked at a number of models of care and we think that being involved in a collaborative teamwork approach-particularly with obstetricians and GP obstetricians-is the best way to go forward. We think it is important to listen to what the doctors had to say on this and to take note of the more than 800 submissions. As the minister said in her speech, we have ‘listened to the collective voice of Australia's mothers' and also look forward to the viewpoints of midwives across the country. We are changing the laws to benefit women across the country, and I think an insurance scheme is very important. We see insurance schemes for all kinds of professional organisations: for example, lawyers, engineers and doctors have professional insurance schemes. One of the bills before the House, the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill, is important in providing insurance, as there has been no professional indemnity insurance product for midwives since about 2001. The legislation sets out thresholds that apply in claims against eligible midwives. For claims more than $100,000 but less than $2 million, the government will contribute 80c in the dollar and for claims of more than $2 million the government will contribute 100c in the dollar. That is important to ensure that people who have been injured or become ill as a result of, say, negligence by midwives get access to insurance. As someone who was a practising lawyer for a long time, I was involved in many medical negligence cases over the years. I can say that getting access to insurance funds and insurance assistance is critical in personal injury cases. This is particularly so where a child is injured during its birth. Such instances can catastrophic long-term effects for the child and involve a lot of very costly care. That child may suffer not just pain and suffering but also economic loss of a catastrophic nature. For example, houses in which that child may need to be cared for will need modifications and very specific requirements. There are issues concerning homebirths, and I have been one who has advocated strongly for homebirths in the past. My wife and I chose to have our children in a hospital setting, but I recognise the right of women to choose their own birthing experience. The Maternity Coalition in Queensland has provided me with some information concerning the rate of homebirths. According to the Australian Mothers and Babies report, in 2006 there were about 708 homebirths in Australia, but that report noted that homebirths are not always recorded. There were about 20,548 homebirths in the UK in 2007, which represents about 2.7 per cent of all births, according to the UK Office of National Statistics. The homebirth rate in New Zealand is estimated by the New Zealand College of Midwives at seven per cent and the rate of homebirths in the Netherlands is approximately 30 per cent. The situation is that women have the right to choose, and I believe that is the case. The minister has publicly said on numerous occasions that she recognises that a very small proportion of women would like to have homebirths, and she is currently investigating some way that this can be provided as an option, making it possible without making the indemnity insurance unaffordable. I urge the minister to work with all stakeholders to ensure that this issue can be resolved. The shadow minister, the member for Dickson, raised a number of issues outside the scope of this particular series of bills that is before the House. I have no intention of discussing those in the middle of this speech, but what I will say is this: this is a very significant reform by the Rudd Labor government. Despite nearly seven years of the Howard government knowing about the issue of insurance and knowing about the troubles and travails in this industry they did absolutely nothing, so it is a bit galling for the shadow minister to come in here and give us lectures in relation to this particular issue. I urge the minister to continue to work with stakeholders, with midwives, with women who want a homebirth and with doctors and nurse practitioners across the country to ensure that women have the option and the right to determine how they will undertake what is honestly a beautiful experience, the sort of experience that they will cherish for the rest of their lives-giving birth to their children. Those of us who are parents in this place can remember and will always remember, however long we live, those occasions when our children were born-holding a young baby in our arms and realising the responsibility that we have for that child. This is a sensitive and delicate issue and it needs a lot of attention and care. I commend the minister for this very significant reform and I urge further consultation to resolve any currently unresolved issues in relation to the matter.",63
57,Mr CHESTER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Gippsland) (12.40 pm)I rise to speak in relation to the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and two related bills. I note at the outset the very diplomatic way in which the member for Blair concluded his speech in relation to the need for further negotiations. Without wishing to put words in his mouth, I think he was calling for some further consideration of the issue of choice, which I will get to a bit later on. I note also at the outset that this is a complex and somewhat emotional issue for many people involved in the debate. Despite the fact that it is legislation which I do not believe adequately deals with the opportunity for Australian women to choose to have a homebirth in the future, I must say that I agree with most of the measures that are contained in the bills. During her second reading speech the minister highlighted the fact that the bills before the House will facilitate access by patients of appropriately qualified and experienced midwives and nurse practitioners to the Medicare Benefits Scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The bills seek to remove barriers to the provision of care and, like the minister, I am hopeful that this will lead to improved access to services for the community, particularly in regional areas, which I am most passionate about, where it is already very difficult to recruit and retain a range of health professionals. I see some opportunities coming out of these bills that may assist regional communities. On that point, I would like to highlight an issue of major concern to residents of the Sale district at the moment, the impending closure of RMIT University's nursing course in Sale. Like many other regional areas, Gippsland has a marked shortage of qualified health professionals. Just this week there was another letter to the editor in the local paper from a young mother who could not get her daughter into see a GP in either Sale or Maffra. The baby was eventually diagnosed with pneumonia. Lack of qualified health professionals is causing health issues, which are always of great significance in regional communities. Causing great distress in my community is the news that RMIT University will end its partnership with the East Gippsland Institute of TAFE and no longer offer a nursing course in Sale. It will not accept any new students from next year, which is a cause for concern, but there is also a long-term impact on nursing resources in our region. Of immediate concern, though, is the commitment which has already been made to the 40 students who are in their first or ond year of study. These students have committed to the three years of the course and are now being told they will have to travel to Churchill or Bundoora to finish their studies. The students are coming to me most upset by the changes, which have been made midcourse. Many are mothers who need to be in Sale to collect children from school or who have part-time work commitments that will not allow them to make the trip to Churchill on a daily basis. Common sense would suggest that we need to do whatever we can as a community to make sure that these students get to complete their course at Sale, as we can benefit from having 40 or more qualified nurses with ties to our local community. I have written to the state and federal health ministers to seek their support in this regard and I met with the minister's office today. I must say in commendation to the minister and her staff that the process of ing a drop-in centre regularly on the Thursday of sitting weeks is very much appreciated by backbenchers like me. It provides an opportunity to meet directly with her and her staff to raise issues of concern in our electornewsates. I commend the minister for taking the initiative and I encourage other ministers who may be listening today to consider the opportunity to do so themselves. It is a brief drop-in service, but the five minutes spent face to face with the minister can overcome a lot of concerns or issues within our communities. It helps to build a better bridge between the parties and also to inform the minister regarding issues on the ground, which I think is of benefit to her and her staff. As a backbencher I certainly appreciate the opportunity to raise those issues directly with her. Looking to the future, I believe there is a very real threat of not having enough nurses to service our local health systems throughout regional Australia. MPs from regional areas all understand that the evidence reflects sec- that with the opportunity to train our own kids in the health professions there is more likelihood that they will return to offer those services to our communities in the future. The cancellation of this particular nursing course has been compounded by the proposed changes to youth allowance, which will leave many locals unable to afford to attend university. We need to explore all the options we can to create more opportunities for our young people to be trained in the local community and to overcome the accommodation and cost-of-living pressures which place a disproportionate burden on rural and regional students. I urge the government to work with RMIT to allow those local nursing students to complete their studies at Sale and to work with the East Gippsland Institute of TAFE to secure future opportunities for nursing and other health studies at Sale. Returning directly to the legislation before havthe House: as the minister has stated, it is long-overdue recognition of our nursing and midwifery workforce. Coming from a regional area, I have seen first-hand the amazing contribution our midwifery workforce makes in maternity services. We have seen a situation throughout regional communities where there has been a gradual closing of birthing centres right across regional Victoria. I reflect on the situation I have in my electorate in the far east of the region, at bost. At a time when there are a lot of birthing centres being closed down around regional Victoria, the Orbost Regional Health service is taking steps in a completely different direction by increasing the number of births at Orbost. It has a very strong team of midwives leading the service, with professional support provided, I believe, through the Bairnsdale Regional Health Service. It provides a great opportunity for the mums in the Orbost community to not have to travel so much in order to give birth. I commend the Chief Executive Officer of the Orbost Regional Health service, Therese Tierney, and her approximately 150 staff based in Orbost and the services they provide to our community. I want to spend time-as I believe many others will-in this debate focusing on the one area where the bills do not really accommodate my real concerns, which relate to the issue of midwife assisted home births. Under the maternity reforms, the government is refusing to extend these new arrangements for midwives to include home births. I quote directly from the minister's speech: Medicare benefits and PBS prescribing will not be approved for deliveries outside clinical settings, and the Commonwealth supported professional indemnity cover will not respond to claims relating to homebirths. I accept again from the outset that there are many complex and competing issues to be addressed in this entire debate but we must, I believe, begin by setting aside our own personal prejudices. I come to this debate with only a small level of experience-four times in hospital for four healthy, beautiful young children. Our birthing experiences were very positive. I would suggest my wife and I did not even give a second thought to the idea of home birthing. It is something that certainly would not have crossed our minds as a personal choice. In both Sale and Bairnsdale, Orwhere we had our children, we had access to highly regarded obstetricians and an excellent team of nurses and midwives throughout the entire experience. As much as you can enjoy the experience, we did-perhaps me more so than my wife, I would have to admit. My wife certainly enjoyed the continuity of care that was provided. Being in a regional setting, we had close contact with the staff at all times, and the obstetrician was available at various stages during the labours. But the midwives in particular were on hand throughout each of our children's births, and we could not have been happier with the outcomes. But this is not always the case. I respect the right of a woman to choose, within reason, when, where and how she decides to give birth. This is a complex and-I agreean emotional issue, and far be it from me, particularly as a man, to be telling women what is best for them or how they should plan to give birth; I see that the member for Ballarat, who is in the chamber, is nodding in agreement. Unfortunately, that is exactly what these bills before us seek to do. The bills effectively rule out home births as an option in the future. There is a very real risk, I believe, that such births will continue and that they will be forced underground. I think that is a less than ideal scenario, which I believe the minister herself has publicly acknowledged. It is a genuine concern for the mothers, babies and the government itself. I do acknowledge the minister has been questioned on the topic in the media. I think she is very conscious of the concern in the community that, if this results in the practice of home births being forced underground, that is not a desirable result for anyonecertainly not the minister or the government. The question before us is how we can prevent getting ourselves into a mess in this regard. Under the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill, the minister claims that the bill prove the choices that are available to women in relation to maternity care. As others have indicated already-and I do again today-the one choice that is effectively being ruled out is home birthing. The bill establishes a scheme to provide professional indemnity insurance cover for eligible midwives at an affordable cost, and I think that a positive move. For the purpose of the bill, the definition of an ‘eligible midwife' is one who is licensed, registered or authorised to practise midwifery under a state or territory law. The failure to extend the cover to midwife assisted home births needs further explanation, I believe, by the government. Has that decision been made on the basis of cost alone? If so, what modelling has been done to support that decision and has it been released publicly? But if the decision is based on the issue of medical risks then that argument needs to be debated more in public. Like many others, I have read information from both sides of the debate and I am not convinced that the risks are as great as some people in the medical profession like to present. I believe there is an element of a medical turf war behind some of the rhetoric that is used to discredit home births at the moment. Again I indicate that, as a personal choice, my wife and I would never have chosen to put ourselves in that homebirth situation but that is a choice we had the opportunity to make. I am not convinced that we are doing the right thing today by the women who choose to have a midwife assisted home birth. I would like to spend a bit of time referring to the commentary about this issue as it has appeared in the popular press in recent times. In the Sunday Herald Sun there was a debate on the issue between a highly respected obstetrician, Peter Mourik, and the Homebirth Australia spokesperson, Justine Caines. Dr Mourik is, as I said, a highly rewill imspected obstetrician who has done some great work in regional Victoria. He supports the government's position and believes the ruling will stop women from taking unnecessary risks. Dr Mourik says: Women who choose to give birth at home expect everything to be normal but they don't consider how far they are from expert help or even is notify the ambulance service that they may need urgent assistance. 80 % of women can have their baby in a paddock but the problem is choosing these women. You just never know what will happen. I am not for a second going to argue with Dr Mourik's assessment. As I said, he is a highly respected obstetrician. But I will say that the midwives whom I have met with, and their clients, are also very aware of the potential risks. It is their belief that the continuity of care that they can provide allows them to follow a birth plan which acknowledges these risks and recognises when to seek further medical attention if required. They are absolutely passionate about the health of the mother and the baby and they make their assessments on whether it is appropriate to go ahead with a home birth at every step of the journey, in discussion with the family members. Of course, things can go wrong-they go wrong in hospitals too-but the midwives I have met with would never proceed with a homebirth if they assessed the situation to be at a higher risk than normal. These women who choose a homebirth are so passionate about that choice that I believe they will go ahead with it anyway regardless of the government's ruling on access to professional indemnity insurance for midwives. As Justine Caines argued in that same article I referred to earlier: Women will still choose homebirth. Many mothers have had bad experiences in hospital and won't repeat that. Why does the government fund women who are choosing to have c-sections but not women who are choosing to give birth at home? Homebirth Australia would like the government to present a package for pregnant women that works a bit like the baby bonus. Every woman would be given a sum of money to spend on her pregnancy treatment, then it's up to her whether she sees a midwife at home or an obstetrician hospital. It is putting the choice back into women's hands. Even under that scenario, there is no question in my mind that most women would still choose to give birth in a hospital, and that, of course, is their right. But I wonder: who are we to be taking away a woman's right to choose a homebirth, as we are doing with this legislation before the House? By excluding midwives practising homebirths from the professional indemnity insurance cover and making insurance a condition of registration, we are effectively, if not technically, making it unlawful. Being subject to a $30,000 fine is certainly a huge discouragement to the midwives. I hold grave fears for the health and safety of women and their babies if we do in fact force homebirths underground. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Legislation Committee received 2,000 submissions when it inquired into these bills. That is an amazing response, and it reflects, I believe, the level of community interest and the absolute passion in this debate. The submissions were primarily from midwives who provide homebirth services and from parents who described their experiences with homebirth and support for homebirths. The proposed legislation was generally supported in the submissions, but again the issue of the government's failure to accommodate people who choose homebirths was a stumbling block for many of the people who made submissions. I quote from that Senate report: Many submitters commented that homebirths will still occur but with an unregistered care provider who may or may not have qualifications or without any assistance. One submission warned: If homebirth is not available through registered midwives, the reality is that many women will still choose to birth at home either unsupported or in a with the help of nonregistered midwives-this will likely worsen outcomes for mothers and newborns. Concerns were also expressed by a number of witnesses to the inquiry that the proposed changes would lead to an increase in free birthing-that is, giving birth without a trained care provider on site. I would suggest that this would be the worse possible result. If a certain cohort of mothers feel their choices have been taken away from them and they are attracted to free birthing without any trained support, I fear for the safety of the mothers and their unborn children. I do not wish to be scaremongering on the topic by any stretch of the imagination, but that is a genuine and legitimate concern. Mrs Elizabeth Wilkes, from the Australian Private Midwives Association, commented: The disasters of women turning up bleeding, with babies unable to be born or whatever else that people are concerned about will certainly increase if this legislation goes ahead as it stands. We cannot say that we have not been warned when we have people in respected positions within the industry-if it can appropriately be called an industry-coming out and giving quite cautionary tales to members both on our side of the House and within the government. It is also fair to say that, much as we have been warned, the medical profession is deeply divided on this issue. The President of the AMA, Dr Andrew Pesce, stated to the inquiry: The government was absolutely correct when it decided not to extend these bills to cover births. The fundamental goal of maternity care must be a healthy mother and a healthy baby … It is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to introduce payment and insurance arrangements that encourage or sanction activities that inherently carry more risk. That position that it inherently carries more risk is disputed by many on the other side of the debate. There are many competing views, but the one point that they all agree on is that the welfare of Australian mothers and their unborn children must be paramount in our considerations. That is why I am uncomfortable with the failure of these bills to recognise the right of a woman to choose a homebirth with a qualified and registered midwife. If we do force this practice underground, we will regret the day that we voted to make it harder for women to choose a homebirth. In recommending that these bills be passed, the Senate committee acknowledged that the minister is currently working with the states and territories on potential options to prevent homebirthing from going underground. The committee says that this will include investigating indemnity options for homebirths that could be progressed without making the insurance unaffordable. But I repeat my earlier comments: I cannot recall the minister actually releasing any facts and figures to suggest that it is unaffordable or impossible to progress the issue immediately. I note that the Victorian government is attempting to come up with its own solution, and a report in the Age newspaper on 9 August describes a pilot program where the state government will work with two Melbourne hospitals to provide for midwives assisting in homebirths to be covered by the hospitals' own indemnity insurance. That does sound like a positive move, and it may be a compromise position that can overcome this hurdle that we are confronted with. The Victorian scheme is expected to start next home year, and homebirths will be restricted to low-risk pregnancies, although I must say that my understanding from discussions with midwives in my electorate is that homebirths are already setting that standard of working only with low-risk pregnancies. The pilot involves only two Melbourne hospitals at this stage and will not offer any comfort to the people in my electorate who are concerned by the legislation before the House. In any case, there are already midwives who have gone on the public record saying they do not want to work under that hospital system or situation again, so I believe it is an intractable position. In conclusion, I would like to express my support for that fundamental right of choice in relation to this issue. I acknowledge, as do the registered midwives I have met with, that homebirthing is not an appropriate option for all women, nor is it the choice of the overwhelming majority of women, but it is the choice of a small number of Australian women and, if it were properly accommodated in the legislation, there would be the possibility, indeed, that more women would take up the option in the future. It is not something, as I said, that I would aspire to with my wife, but we are kidding ourselves as members of parliament if we think that homebirths will stop as a result of these bills going before the House. I am genuinely fearful of the impact the legislation will have if it forces the practice underground or leads to the more risky practice of free birthing. It is not in anyone's interests for that to happen. I think the member for Blair put it very well: childbirth is an intensely personal experience, and the decisions which are made by expectant mothers need to be supported within reason. No disrespect intended, but I am unconvinced by the mainstream medical profession's more extreme arguments against homebirths. I accept there is an element of increased risk in some circumstances, but it is entirely manageable in the majority of cases with the care and attention of a highly qualified and registered midwife. I cannot escape from the fact that women should have choice when it comes to deciding what they do with their bodies, and that extends to the issue of childbirth. I strongly urge the minister to continue working with the states and territories to resolve the issue of indemnity insurance and amend the legislation to allow existing services to continue to be offered. I will give my final comments to the convenor of the East Gippsland Birth Support Group, Cath Lanigan, who has written to me in relation to these bills. Cath lives in Metung, a beautiful village on the Gippsland Lakes. She says: Only a small percentage of women currently seek homebirths but that doesn't mean it's not important or should be disregarded. It provides a choice which enables birth to be a very natural, normal event which in the vast majority of cases it is. It provides women with the choice to involve other family members, midwives they know and trust, have their own autonomy, and the chance to have one of the most intimate moments in their life in the comfort of their own home surrounded by people who are invited to be there. Cath continues: I had a home birth with my second child, here in Metung, and I know what a beautiful and positive experience it can be for mother, baby and family. It would be an absolute travesty if this option was no longer available as a choice.",66
58,Ms KING,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I rise in support of the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and associated bills. These bills facilitate the inclusion of nurse practitioners and midwives under the Medicare Benefits Scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The bills also enable the establishment of a professional indemnity scheme for eligible midwives, which is critical to support the new MBS and PBS arrangements. The purpose of the bills reflects the government's commitment to improve maternity and primary care services. I think it is disappointing that the many positive aspects of these bills, which will make a significant difference to women's access to midwifery services, have been overshadowed by concerns about homebirth. I will seek to address the issue of homebirth later in my contribution but I want to put on the record early my support for women's decisions to homebirth. I thank the many women-and, on one occasion, a man-and their children who have come to see me and share their very personal experiences. I understand their concern that some of the provisions of these bills have created an issue with regard to homebirth and that we, as a government, need to continue to work to find a solution. That said, I want to put it on the record that I absolutely support the extension of midwifery services in these bills. They will improve the health of women and their newborn children, and they give substantial support to women at one of the most wonderful but also challenging times of their lives. I think it is a great credit to the government that it has recognised that and is moving to allow the extension of midwifery services to a whole range of women who have previously not been able to access them. (Quorum formed) These bills improve health services for our community by utilising our highly skilled midwives and nursing practitioners. This government has come a long way since being elected. We have come a long way in delivering on our election commitment to develop a national plan for maternity services in this country. That is, in essence, what these bills represent. Our processes have been open and transparent. In June 2008, the government called for a review of maternity services. The review received hundreds of submissions. We heard submissions from individuals, health professionals, nongovernment organisations, academics and others. The entire nation wanted to participate in the consultation process. It is an extremely important issue. The level of community interest outlined the passion that Australian people have to participate in serious health reform. The report was delivered to the minister in February 2009, and it noted the great quality of our nation's health system, which can be accessed by women giving birth. But the report noted that there was room for improvement. The report noted that the government could put measures in place to further assist women in need of maternity care. In response to the review, the government announced $120.5 million for maternity services as part of the last federal budget. The announcement was part of our reforms to the health and hospital system. The package supports the maternity services workforce and assists Australian women with access to greater choices in maternity care. That is what the maternity services reform package is about: giving Australian women choice. We are working to provide Australian women with better access to services and a greater level of flexibility in the health force. This package recognises he central role midwives play as part of the birthing process. The package includes the introduction of an indemnity insurance scheme for eligible midwives, MBS and PBS benefits for services provided by those midwives, an expansion of the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program, an increase in scholarships for GPs and midwives to address this critical area of need and a telephone helpline and information service to provide women and their families with an avenue of communication to discuss maternity information. As part of our reforms we also announced $59.7 million in the 2009-10 budget to fully utilise our highly qualified nursing practitioners. On 24 June the minister introduced these bills into the House for debate in recognition of the importance of addressing long overdue reform in our health system. I support these bills as they allow for the inclusion of midwives and nurse practitioners under the MBS and PBS schemes. The legislation allows for nurse practitioners and appropriately qualified and experienced midwives to request diagnostic imaging and pathology services to be paid for by Medicare. The legislation also allows such nurse practitioners and midwives to prescribe certain medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As I have earlier said, even in the face of the global financial crisis this government has put health and hospital reform at the top of its priority list. I would like to commend the minister as she has worked hard since the election to address significant inefficiencies across our health and hospital system. This is certainly a step that will make a significant difference to the many women and families giving birth across this country. These measures seek to address some of the health workforce issues by utilising the expertise that currently exists among nursing workpractitioners and midwives. The number of nursing practitioners has steadily grown over recent years, with over 350 currently working across Australia. These highly qualified health professionals have proven crucial across our health system. Midwives play an integral part in our society. They work with women across all communities to give them vital support and professional advice throughout the birthing process, from pregnancy to labour and to post-pregnancy. I want to put on the record my own personal thanks to the midwives who cared for me when I gave birth to my son more than 12 months ago, to the midwives at my obstetrician's consulting rooms, to Ballarat Health Services, where I chose to give birth, and particularly to Kathy Taylor, who has been a midwife for a very long period of time. As a new mother, and as an older parent, I found the experience a very difficult one, and having a highly experienced midwife helping me throughout the processes, particularly afterwards, was certainly something I valued. I think that every woman should have the opportunity to receive that assistance. I engaged Kathy in a private capacity, and I think that other women would certainly benefit from having more access to maternity care. I would like to touch on the issue of professional indemnity insurance for eligible midwives and also on the issue of home birthing. Firstly, it is important to note that none of these bills make homebirth unlawful. Despite what is being said by those opposite, none of these bills actually make homebirth unlawful. Instead, these bills deliver greater support for nurse practitioners and midwives-support that will deliver greater choice for Australian women. The separate draft bill, to establish a national registration and accreditation scheme for health professionals, carries a proposal which will require health professionals from the 10 professions covered to carry insurance as a condition of registration. This draft bill has been developed by COAG and is not yet before any parliament. I think most people who have been involved in either the law or medicine, or who have been consumers, will know that it is really important that any professional have a form of public liability insurance. It is extremely important, as we get into a society that is increasingly litigious, or where things go wrong, that there be an insurance product around and that people be protected by professional indemnity insurance. It is the interaction between the registration and accreditation scheme, the requirement for insurance and the lack of any affordable insurance product for private midwives assisting women to homebirth that has created the difficulty for homebirths. There is nothing inherent in this legislation that makes homebirth unlawful. Whilst it is only a very small proportion of women who choose the option of homebirth, as I stated at the outset this choice is just as valid and important as the birthing choices of women who do not homebirth. I am assured that the government is currently working with the states and territories, and the minister is working with her department, on this issue. It is certainly an issue that I wish to keep a close watch on. That said, I want to again stress that in these bills the government is providing more choice and options for mothers than any previous government. I think it is unfortunate that the focus has been on the issue of homebirth, almost to the exclusion of the other really terrific things that are in this bill for women giving birth in this country. The whole issue of pregnancy and birth is fraught with politics-it always has been. It is important that this issue be regarded for what it is-it is not a debate about women's choices versus women's choices, and it should never be that. It is an issue about how to ensure that we have good access to maternity services across this country for women. The policy intention of the government in undertaking the maternity services review has been to make sure that women do have access to the best possible maternity services. That is what this legislation is about. The issue of homebirth has arisen and the government is seeking to resolve the issue. But the government's intention in these bills is actually to improve substantially the health of women and their children across the country. I would like to outline briefly some of the supportive things that other people are saying about this legislation. The Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, Ged Kearney, stated: The government has taken a practical, common sense approach to helping more people get safe, effective health care. Dr Barbara Vernon, the Executive Officer of the Australian College of Midwives, has stated: This national legislation recognises for the first time that midwives make a valuable contribution to maternity care in their own right. Evidence confirms that women who receive continuity of care from a known midwife have shorter labours, less need for surgical interventions during birth, reduced rates of admission to special care nursery for their babies, reduced vulnerability to postnatal depression and higher rates of breastfeeding. I am very proud to be part of a government that for the first time is providing access to the MBS and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for nurse practitioners and midwives. These bills are not only good news for nurses and midwives; they are also extremely good news for patients. These changes bring to patients equal choice and convenience in terms of their birthing experience. Patients will now be able to receive referrals and tests from qualified midwives and nurse practitioners. This change will dramatically improve our nation's maternity services system. I want to briefly reflect on just how fantastic those services are when you have some comparison to the experience of women in countries which are not very far away from us that the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, who is here at the table, visited. I acknowledge in my own electorate the work of Zonta and the Ballarat Health Services, who have been putting birthing kits together for a long time now for the women of East Timor. I think if anyone gets an opportunity to go and participate in that experience you will get a pretty short, sharp reminder of just how the birthing experience is for women in the Pacific versus women here. I think, whilst we are having this debate in this parliament, it is worth reflecting on just how lucky we are to be giving birth in this country. It is fantastic to see increased support being given to women's birthing experiences in countries who are our neighbours, and certainly we should take the opportunity to thank organisations like Zonta but also to recognise that not everybody's birthing experiences are as high quality as the medical care that we have here in this country. I just wanted to put that on the record. We are extremely fortunate in this country to have such fantastic access to maternity services. I think the changes that are part of these bills really do put our nation's maternity services in the top of any in the world. It is a fantastic opportunity for us to have such access, which we have not had previously, to midwifery and nurse services as provided in this bill. I look forward to the support of my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House and hope that members opposite can support our nation's highly skilled nurses and midwives that are represented in these bills. The government has proposed significant changes to the Medicare benefits schedule and the pharmaceutical benefits schedule to utilise our health system at a greater capacity. The government reforms are about providing a health system for the 21st century. These bills go a long way towards achieving this, and I commend them to the House.",72
59,Mr SIMPKINS,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"It is not my intention to speak for very long, but I will make a contribution to the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009, the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009. As a father, I have some appreciation of the subject of childbirth, am also thankful for not having had to have gone through the process. Not only do we as men not have to endure the pain-or as the medical professionals might call it, ‘discomfort'-but we do not have to endure the hormonal challenges that make a woman's pregnancy even more of a difficult experience. What I do recall is the sense of fear I had at the birth of my two daughters as to whether everything would be all right. The experience for a father is that of physical detachment, but with a great degree of emotional concern. What is abundantly clear is that a man faces very little in comparison to the woman. Therefore, in my comments today I will seek to empathise, but I could never speak with the authority that comes with a woman's experience and point of view regarding midwives and the bearing of children. Nevertheless, I take this opportunity today to make some comments on these bills. Like many others in this place, I support them in the main, but there are elements within this policy that I cannot say that I wholly support. However, I will be a little more specific later. Before I go to the substance of the bills, I would just like to reflect on my limited but nevertheless valid experience in two hospitals and with the midwives at those two hospitals. My eldest daughter, Emily, was born in 1998 at the John James Hospital not far from here when I was posted here in Canberra in the Army. I was keen for Emily, being our first child, to be born in a hospital ensure that, if anything went wrong, she and my wife, Kelly, would have access to immediate and substantial care. This was in spite of the fact that there was no indication of any likely problems. Being careful with my children's safety began then and explains why later, whenever Emily or her sister, Rebecca, were climbing on play equipment when they were toddlers, I was always right behind but I them, ready to catch. Similarly, despite no indications of any risk, there was no doubt in my mind or my wife's mind that our second daughter would be born in hospital as well. My second daughter, Rebecca, was born at Glengarry Hospital in Perth in 2002. Our experiences of both of these hospitals were outstanding. The midwives did all the medical and professional health work to support my wife in the delivery and in the days afterwards. I therefore have the very highest confidence in the skills, training and professionalism of the midwives and the nurses that we had contact with in those two hospitals. In our local area in Cowan I have never heard a complaint about the work of nurses. Indeed, that confidence extends to the Joondalup Health Campus, which is the major hospital in the northern suburbs of Perth. That being said, we never considered homebirth, and if we were intending to have more children we would still not consider homebirth. That is, above all, a matter of choice. I believe very much in free choice and the making of decisions by the mother and the father with due regard to and acceptance of the risks that are involved. I repeat that it is not a decision I would make, but there are very many people who stand by the advantages of homebirth. If that is a decision they wish to make, then no government should make that impossible or harder than it should be. Clearly then, while I support the majority of the changes foreshadowed into these bills and plans to come from the government, I see that amendments or changes would be required to those plans to maintain the options that some parents seek for having their children born at home. I will now make some specific comments about the bills. As I previously stated, I port the majority of the items in these bills. Access to doctors, access to diagnostic tests and access to treatment options are clearly detrimental to the best possible health outcomes if they cannot be achieved within reasonable time frames. The authority of midwives and nurse practitioners to assume responsibility for some of these needs should allow better time frames for action on health concerns. The legislation will give registered midwives and nurse practitioners the capacity to order certain diagnostic-imaging and pathology tests, for which a Medicare benefit can then be paid. The legislation will also allow these midwives and nurse practitioners to prescribe certain medicines under the PBS. The midwives and nurse practitioners will also, when they are working in collaborative arrangements with doctors, have new Medicare items and referrals listed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The bills that cover indemnity insurance matters will allow the Commonwealth to reach a contract with an insurer through a national tender process to provide indemnity insurance for midwives operating independently. Clearly there are significant changes provided for in these bills. It is known that not all stakeholders support every part of the legislation. That is why the coalition supported the consideration of changes by a Senate committee. Unfortunately, the workload and number of submissions, being more than 200, have caused a delay in the finalisation of the report by the Senate committee. I will now take the opportunity to mention some of the comments made by stakeholders with regard to these bills. I note that the AMA disagree with aspects of these bills, particularly where midwives and nurse practitioners would have access to the MBS and the PBS. They also believe that patient care supshould be coordinated by a medical practitioner. However, given the decision to pursue these changes, they want to have involvement in the details of the regulations to be created. On the other hand, the Rural Doctors Association have broadly supported the changes regarding access to the PBS and the MBS. However, they also ask for controls and guidelines to ensure good communication between doctors and midwives and nurse practitioners. Both the AMA and the Rural Doctors Association oppose homebirth. The Australian College of Midwives support the bills. However, they want provisions to allow homebirth options. It is worth noting that the college recognises that homebirth is not appropriate in complex or higher risk cases. The issues raised by stakeholders seem to be consistent. The points raised generally support midwives and nurse practitioners having access to the PBS and the MBS under certain controls and provisions. The division comes with the increased physical separation between the activities of midwives and nurse practitioners and those of doctors. Doctors are less inclined to support midwives and nurse practitioners providing patient care when doctors are not in the immediate area, which explains their complete opposition to homebirth under the supervision of midwives. The government have negotiated the middle path in this situation with the stakeholders. They have sought compromise on both sides. Where I object is that the choice of homebirth is basically prohibited under plans regarding registration and accreditation. I reiterate that my wife and I would never have sought the homebirth option, but some women do. If they examine and are willing to accept the risks involved in taking that decision then such a choice, which currently exists, should never be taken away from them. It is my view that the government should reconsider their registration and accreditation plans. To conclude, I thank my constituent Kiera Pedley and others within the electorate of Cowan for bringing to my attention their concerns and perspectives on homebirth. As I said right at the start, childbirth is certainly not an experience that we men ever have to go through-and I for one am pretty happy about that! Provided women understand the risks and the challenges of homebirth then they should always have that choice, and we on this side will always support that choice.",75
60,Ms JACKSON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"I am delighted to speak in support of the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and two related bills, all of which concern midwives and nurse practitioners. These are three progressive pieces of legislation which in my view go beyond tinkering at the edges to genuinely reforming our health system, which the Labor government has recognised is at a tipping point. Before dealing with the specifics of the legislation, I would like to say I am absolutely delighted with some of the federal government initiatives that we have seen in the health portfolio. Last December we saw $64 billion in the new health and hospitals agreement signed with the states. We have also seen the recent report of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, and I look forward to participating in discussions in my electorate regarding its recommendations. We have also had community consultations in my electorate regarding, in particular, the establishment of a GP superclinic, and I am pleased to say that the Minister for Health and Ageing has indicated that we can expect a decision on that soon. There is also intended to be consultation on the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission recommendations at the Swan District Hospital at Midland in my electorate. We will be very pleased to welcome that discussion at our local hospital. I was also delighted with the announcement in this year's budget of some $180.1 million of Commonwealth money going towards building a new Midland Health Campus in my electorate, a facility that is long overdue and that will ensure many more patients in my electorate get access to acute levels of care. I look forward to working with not only the Commonwealth government but also the state government and my local government in the City of Swan to see the Midland Health Campus come to fruition hopefully no later than 2013. I have some wonderful healthcare professionals in Hasluck many of whom have been very supportive of these reforms and of this particular legislation. They provide wonderful care to our community from cradle to grave. In particular, I refer to the Division of General Practice in my electorate, the Perth Primary Care Network, formerly the Perth and Hills Division of General Practice, and also to a particular practice in the suburb of Midland, the Swan Medical Group. These organisations have been in advance of many others in their profession in supporting, recognising and acknowledging the role of nurse practitioners. Indeed, they run very efficient and responsive practices in my electorate already using the professional wisdom and competency of nurse practitioners. They were early advocates for nurse practitioners and I know that they join with me in being very pleased to see this legislation put before the Australian parliament. I know how stretched some of their resources are. Sometimes, unless you are prepared to wait, it is difficult to get an appointment. Nurse practitioners are part of a strategy of ensuring that there is better access to those primary care services in my electorate. At a personal level I am delighted to see this legislation come to fruition. I was involved in the mid-1980s in discussions in my home state of Western Australia regarding the transfer of nurse education from the hospital sector to the territory sector. That was very important move in recognising the complexity of their work and the high level of tertiary knowledge required by our registered and enrolled nurses to practise competently in our hospitals and healthcare settings. That is 20-odd years ago now and in those days nurses were often faced with very heavy stereotypes and were, frankly, treated in some cases as the handmaidens of general practitioners and doctors in our healthcare system. I am very glad to have seen the changes in attitudes that have developed over the past 20 years. Unfortunately, some of those stereotypes have not changed with respect to the fixing of nurses' wages and conditions. Whilst again I acknowledge that we have come a long way in those 20 years, we are still a long way short of pay equity for nurses in all of their capacities. The ones closest to my heart are enrolled nurses who have an associate diploma and perform a very vital role in our healthcare system. They are often not recognised for their highly skilled contribution to health care. I have been very closely involved with this profession for over 20 years and it is with great pride that I speak favour of this legislation which will empower midwives and nurse practitioners to operate as professionals in their own right and to provide the best health care to Australian communities. This legislation has received wide-ranging support. It has support from the Australian Medical Association, the Australian College of Midwives, the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners and various associations of healthcare professionals. It is receiving this support because it facilitates a collaboraformed) tive model allowing the right healthcare professional to provide the health care needed. It is important to understand that these bills do not change the existing abilities through state and territory legislation for nurse practitioa ners to prescribe medication or to refer patients. Nurse practitioners are already able to do this and, to a varying extent in the state public health systems, they are in fact doing this. What is proposed is to confer access to services itemised under the Medicare Benefits Schedule and to confer authority to prescribe certain medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I had the privilege of meeting recently with a nurse practitioner in my electorate of Hasluck. He is one of two practising in the emergency department at the Swan District Hospital located in the suburb of Middle Swan. He is understandably passionate about the value that the role of nurse practitioners brings to our health system. He is currently in a position where he can make referrals and write prescriptions for medication autonomously within the public health system. He makes assessments based on his high level of skill and his experience in the nursing profession. At present, he sometimes identifies the need to refer a patient to a private professional or to a specialist, such as a maxillofacial surgeon, or to prescribe medication for the patient to obtain from a pharmacy. Dein spite this coming within the scope of his training and experience, he still must find a doctor in the emergency department to provide the necessary documentation. In essence, the immediate ramifications of this legislation for him and his role now will merely make those processes less complicated and give him the professional recognition that he deserves. I am proud to say that these changes are consistent with the Labor Party platform where we indicated again at our recent national conference-(Quorum I thank my colleagues. It is one of the small prices we pay for government and it is a pleasure to be in government. Thank you for popping in and listening to what I have to say on this legislation. I was talking about a nurse practitioner in my electorate of Hasluck, Robin Moon, who I am very pleased to say will see the immediate ramifications of this legislation for him in his role in the emergency department at Swan District Hospital Campus and also give him the professional recognition that he deserves. Unfortunately, in Western Australia it has taken some three years for Robin after he qualified as a nurse practitioner to be able convince his employing hospital that there was a role for nurse practitioners within the hospital emergency department. This is still a problem across my home state of Western Australia. We estimate that there are some 85 nursing practitioners currently registered, but around only 30 of those are working and recognised as nurse practitioners. This, in my view, is a great waste of a highly skilled and competent workforce and I encourage the Western Australian government to address this situation at the earlidevelop est opportunity. We have seen a much more progressive attitude in the private sector in Western Austraters lia where the benefits of this legislation will also be immediately utilised. The private sector in Western Australia is poised and ready to deliver community health care to Western Australians in ways that have never been imagined before. I have one large charitable organisation in Western Australia which is currently examining the concept of providing home services which are a virtual hospital. They can employ nurse practitioners and other health professionals to go out into patients' homes and provide Medicare subsidised elements of health care ordinarily available only in hospitals. We know that that will have some distinct advantages in assisting people to remain in their own homes. Most of us prefer to be at home than to be admitted to hospital. Another very exciting example of progressive change in health care in WA is shopfront health care. Appearing in WA shopping centres are what we call ‘revive' clinics, which are staffed by nurse practitioners to treat minor illnesses, including being able to provide prescriptions for medications such as antibiotics where necessary and to provide coaching in areas such as weight loss or in assisting with stopping smoking. In country and regional areas such as Port Hedland into the Pilbara of Western Australia where there are some four doctors available to service the population, the ability of nurse practitioners to access Medicare when operating from such clinics will enable them to fill a critical gap in the provision of health care, especially in areas such as immunisation. On the broader front of training these professionals, I am pleased that the government has recognised the need to invest in training for the future and that the government has already announced funding of $2.1 million to our nurse practitioner workforce. We have provided access to scholarships for up to $15,000 per annum for the two-year masdegree that it is necessary for nurse practitioners to undertake to get their qualification and recognition. I believe that when the WA state government finally starts utilising this resource we in the Commonwealth at least are ensuring that nurse practitioners will be ready, willing and available to fill this need. I want to talk briefly about midwives. I am a great supporter of midwives and have had the pleasure of being part of the birthing team when my sister gave birth to her four beautiful children. These births occurred in the birthing centre at King Edward Memorial Hospital, a fine facility which is staffed entirely by midwives. My sister created the record for being the first person to have her four children in the birthing centre. My lovely nieces Lauren, Jessica, Emily and Amy were all delivered by a wonderful and competent team of midwives at the King Edward Memorial Hospital birthing centre, and I pay tribute to them. What a fantastic experience it was to be a party to their births. For those of you who have been around at the birthing of children, I truly believe it is evidence that there is still magic in the universe and you will never forget that first breath that a baby takes upon being born. Being the stepmother of two children myself, I disappointed my mother when she asked me after I had been through this wonderful experience if I intended to have my own, to which I responded: ‘My goodness! Not now that I've seen where it all comes from.' Nevertheless, it was a beautiful experience and I am honoured to have been party to it. These bills will enable health professionals, midwives and nurse practitioners to work collaboratively with obstetricians and hospitals by giving them independent access to the relevant Medicare items and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and addressing the market failure in indemnity insurance for these people. Currently, midwives have been unable to obtain professional indemnity cover for midwife-led birthing as opposed to obstetrician-led birthing, despite estimates by the Australian Government Actuary that the incidence of claims is likely to be comparable to that of obstetricians and procedural GPs. This bill establishes a system whereby a private insurer will be able to offer a suitable professional indemnity product, with the Commonwealth assuming responsibility for a substantial part of the liability. I know that those opposite have criticised the legislation because it does not extend at this stage to supporting Medicare or PBS funding for homebirths. Can I say to those members present that none of these bills makes homebirths unlawful and none of these bills changes the current arrangement with respect to homebirths as they have always been. These three bills form part of the maternity services budget package. The Commonwealth is committed to underwriting midwives insurance to enable such an insurance product to be developed. I reiterate that we all look forward to seeing this come to fruitionMr Laming interjecting",78
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,Order! The member for Bowman will have his chance later.,81
62,Ms JACKSON,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"The Commonwealth had not intended that this new product would be feasible or affordable if it included homebirthing. I know this causes significant and wide concern among some people, but we know that the minister is working hard on this issue, through her department and with the states and territories, to bring about a result which will see that professional indemnity cover eventually applied to midwives and homebirths. I note the comments from members opposite, who held government for 12 long years and, in all that time, did nothing about the professional recognition or training of nurse practitioners-and I caution the member for Bowman in that regard. These are progressive pieces of legislation welcomed by professional nurse practitioners around Australia. I congratulate the minister on her legislation. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned.

63,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (1.47 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These minor amendments deal with administrative matters. They clarify that the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator, which administers the current Mandatory Renewable Energy Target Scheme and will administer the expanded RET scheme, will be responsible for administration of partial exemptions in relation to emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities under the RET scheme. When the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme comes into force, the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator will be absorbed into the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority, which will administer these partial exemptions. The proposed amendments simply replace several references made in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 to the ‘Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator' to the ‘Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority', as the authority will only come into existence once the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation passes. Consequential amendments in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation will give effect to the requisite change of reference from ‘regulator' to ‘authority' in the RET legislation at the appropriate time. These provisions are to commence on the day the bill receives royal assent. As this minor amendment deals with a purely administrative matter required to support the agreement reached in the Senate, I understand that those opposite will support it. I commend the amendments to the House.",82
64,Mr HUNT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Flinders) (1.49 pm)Australia will have real renewable energy legislation. Australia will have a 20 per cent renewable energy target and Australia will have the beginnings of a clean energy revolution. This is the legislation which the government itself delayed. This is the legislation that we have brought forward. This is the legislation that we worked to get passed. It is a great result for Australia. It is a great result for the clean energy industry. We support it. We have worked towards it. I am delighted also that it shows that the parliament can work at its best when the government agrees to negotiate and compromise. We have negotiated and we have reached an agreement. It is a tremendous result for the parliament and it is a tremendous result for Australia. I thank the minister for his work. I respect the fact that Senator Wong also came to the table, and I appreciate that process of cooperation. It is what the parliament can do. If the government wants work in relation to the emissions trading scheme, they should begin unconditional talks today. No conditions. No strings. Let us begin talking. Let us deal today with the question of green carbon. Let us make sure that burping cows are not taxed. Let us get the taxing of burping cows off the agenda. Let us get green carbon and agricultural offsets onto the agenda. Let us negotiate today without conditions. Ultimately, having this bill in this place on this day is a triumph for parliamentary process and parliamentary democracy. We support the renewable energy target. We support a clean energy revolution. It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the opposition to give our support and our agreement to the renewable energy target of 20 per cent.",82
65,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (1.51 pm)-In closing the discussion on this important piece of legislation, which has been through the Senate and is now back before the House for final adoption, it is important to reinforce the fact that the implementation of this legislation represents a commitment made by the Australian Labor Party to achieve 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply from renewable sources by the year 2020. We are pleased that the coalition has entered into discussions with the government leading to this agreement. It implements our policy position and can now, on passage through the parliament and after receiving royal assent, unlock investment in renewable energy and the jobs associated with it. It is a significant piece of legislation. Finally I would like to thank those who have worked extremely hard to achieve this legislation, including the officers of the Department of Climate Change and other departments. But most particularly I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, who has had a very difficult portfolio to manage and has managed it tremendously well. I would like to thank her staff on this important achievement as well. I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to.

66,Mr LAMING,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"Bowman) (1.53 pm)Few in this chamber will not be cheering that finally we have indemnity to support the great work midwives do for mothers around this country. But a very strange thing happened as this legislation, the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and the cognate bills, took shape. As midwives working in the community who do homebirthing were off to do their day's work, this government managed to slip a bit of rancid ham into the legislative sandwich and serve it up to the midwives, saying: ‘This is what we're doing for homebirths. We're going to make registration contingent on your no longer doing homebirths. If you contemplate a homebirth, there will be a $30,000 fine.' There is no plan to put that on the Medicare safety net, is there, Treasurer? No way. You are attempting to snuff out homebirths. We would be the first country in the world to do it. That is a ful shame. The government should have had this worked out long ago. The evidence speaks strongly to this. The Cochrane database tells us that there is no evidence that homebirths in a proper, hospital-supported arrangement cannot be achieved. We have the evidence from de Jonge and from Olsen. There has been meta-analysis in Denmark. A study of 529,000 Dutch mums has been recently published, as has Symons in the British Medical Journal and there are other sources. If it is done properly, if high-risk mums are taken out of the study and we look at the ratios, we know that there is no significant difference outcomes. You can talk to Hofmeyr, who authors the Cochrane collaboration, who says there is no difference in danger for low-risk mums to deliver at home or in a hospital. In fact, Cochrane, which is the gold standard for medicine, goes another step and says that, where a homebirthing service can be supported by a hospital arrangement, mums should be given the choice. But in this Labor legislation I see homebirthing being snuffed out. I can see lots and lots of people in the gallery, many of whom would never choose homebirth, but there are a proportion who would. For those mums out there, I am telling you: this side of the chamber is standing for your choice to do it in a safe environment with appropriate hospital support. Let us be completely frank about this. Not everyone is going to choose a homebirth. But, in every country in the world bar this one, it can still continue. In the Netherlands, something like a quarter of all births are done at home. Look at the history of midwifery. You can go right back through five centuries. There was a time when homebirth was safer than being in hospital. Back in the 1750s, when they opened the doors of hospidreadtals to mums of lower socio-economic background-and the other side of the chamber should be listening to this all of a sudden-it was actually more dangerous to go to hospital for a birth because of the lack of antiseptic measures. There was a time, in 1854, in Vienna when 13 per cent of mums died in hospital childbirth compared to two per cent with homebirthing. Obviously times have changed and technology has moved on, but here is one chance to stand up for homebirthing. What has happened? It has been snuffed out through this sneaky legislation. There is an evolving habit on the other side to sneak nasty bits into the in centre of legislation and make it difficult to vote against. But, mums of Australia, you need to know, if you are even contemplating a homebirth, that that choice is about to be removed. We have looked at risk. There is no greater risk. We have looked at financeafter all, actuarial analysis will tell you if it is or is not going to cost a fortune to indemnify home midwifery. Will the government release those figures? It is a big ‘n-o'. There is no chance of that. We cannot even look at what it would cost to indemnify home deliveries. This is for women who ask for home delivery and professionals who want to provide it. A funny thing happened on the way to work today. Someone turned to me and said, ‘Hang on, so it's your side of the chamber, the conservatives, arguing for harm reduction so that there can be trained midwives at homebirths, and it is the Labor Party fighting against that, with zero tolerance for homebirths?' I said, ‘That's right.' They said, ‘That's a bit strange; isn't it normally the other way round, with drugs?' I said: ‘That's right. Illicit drugs are illegal. There is nothing illegal about homebirthing, but it's about to become that way under this lazy government.' I do not know what the Minister for Health and Ageing has been up to, but she is developing this habit of turning up here with Treasury bills to save money in the guise of health reform legislation. That is right. Here comes a health bill but the real intention of it is to cut the guts out of health funding, save money for Treasury and start to pay for this Prime Minister's wobbly, wobbly $106 billion spending of the last six months. To take it out on mums who simply want a home delivery is a disgrace. You need to look at the choice, the quality of care and the fact that these home deliveries are done by committed professionals. This legislation is snuffing that out, closing down. What are you going to do? Are you going to achieve a complete elimination of homebirths in this country? N-o. Are you going to drive it underground? Probably. Are you going to take away the qualified midwives by denying them registration if they turn up to a home delivery? Y-e-s. So what are we left with? We are left with further marginalisation of homebirths, less support for homebirths and worse outcomes in a global context where home deliveries can be done safely. Health Minister, you have had plenty of time to get this right. This did not pop up on you yesterday. You have been lobbied consistently by those who support homebirths. In my electorate of Bowman, homebirths will be snuffed out. I am telling you, sneaking this rancid stuff into the middle of ALP legislation, sticking a bit of ALP dill on the top and trying to pass it off as a revolution in health care is a complete disgrace. It is not too late. I am asking this government to take another look at this legislation. It is time for you to support midwifery, whether it is at home or in a hospital. They are the same women, Health Minister, that need these services. They are no different. Some of them just have a birthing plan that involves delivering at home. Why don't you allow professional midwives to support them? Do not deny the midwives registration. Do not fine them $30,000. That is a complete disgrace. We are the only country in the world doing it. It is in the context of saving money. When it comes to health, that is an extraordinary shame. On behalf of every woman who chooses to deliver at home and every family who would like to see that happen, I say: why should you run them down? Why should you snuff them out in the guise of health legislation that is mere pennypinching? This is something that should be changed right now. It is not too late. Make an it amendment and allow homebirths to continue in this country.",83

72,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on developments in Afghanistan surrounding their elections?,86
73,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Today marks an important milestone for the people of Afghanistan with the holding of the first Afghan-led presidential and provincial council elections in 30 years-an opportunity for the people of Afghanistan, brutally oppressed under the Taliban regime until 2001, to have their voices heard. Credible elections are critical to strengthening Afghanistan's democratic process and institutions and consolidating the progress made since the 2004 elections. There will be something like 6½ thousand polling stations, including dedicated polling stations for women, across Afghanistan, which should give access to about 85 per cent of Afghanistan's 16 million regisbase tered voters. I note recent comments by the UN Secretary-General's special representative, Kai Eide, that the vigorous election campaign represents a milestone in the political maturity of Afghanistan. The government and, I am sure, all members of this place condemn the acts of violence that we have seen by the Taliban and others across Afghanistan in recent times seeking to disrupt this election process-in particular, Tuesday's suicide bombing in Kabul which claimed the lives of both UN and ISAF personnel as well as Afghan civilians. Australia, along with other coalition partners and our partners in Afghanistan itself, has worked hard over many months now in preparation for these elections. They are among the most complex and difficult to conduct anywhere in the world, simply because of the terrain of Afghanistan, the challenging geography, and the security environment. Australia has provided extensive assistance to support these electionsincluding some 120 troops to assist with election security and $9 million in funding for voter registration, education and public outreach activities-and has established the independent Electoral Complaints Commission of Afghanistan. The government is supporting a regional election observer mission, which will see 50 men and women from countries of the immediate region serving as observers throughout the electoral process. We have also supported the training of some 200 female Afghan election observers to allow women to participate more easily in the election process. The government is deploying a small team of Australian civilian observers, the precise role and deployment of which, of course, will be determined according to the security situation. Australia's mission in Afghanistan remains clear: firstly, strategic denial of Afghanistan as a training ground and operating for global terrorist organisations; secondly, stabilisation of Afghanistan through a combination of military, police, civilian and economic efforts; and, thirdly, to work with our partners in Oruzgan Province to strengthen the capability of the Afghan security forces so that they can in turn ultimately assume responsibility for their own security. The Australian government has a clear-eyed view in terms of the challenges which lie ahead, as do our coalition partners, and in this place and across the nation at large we must always be prepared for our nation to suffer further losses of our men and women in the field. This is a difficult, dangerous bloody operating environment, as I know all members in this place are aware. It is critical that the international nity remain engaged in Afghanistan. The events of recent years, starting with the attacks in the United States on September 11 and the subsequent attacks in Bali, Jakarta and Mumbai, highlight the absolute importance of continuing to tackle the threat of terrorism worldwide and, wherever we can, denying terrorists a training base such as historically they have had in Afghanistan. I also, on behalf of all members of this place and all right-thinking Australians, wish the people of Afghanistan every success on this historic day.",86
74,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"on indulgenceThe opposition wishes to associated itself with the Prime Minister's remarks. There is a bipartisan commitment to Australia's mission in Afghanistan. The elections are of vital importance and we support the efforts of the Australian troops and other personnel in Afghanistan in ensuring that the terrorist forces are suppressed, in enabling the Afghan national security forces to take over responsibility for their nation's own security and, in particular at this time, in ensuring that the election is conducted with safety and integrity. We commend the Prime Minister on his remarks and support the government in its efforts in Afghanistan. Taxation",87
75,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his refusal to tell the Australian people about the government's proposals to increase taxes by hiding behind the Henry tax review. Given that the government has already slugged taxpayers with increased taxes and charges on alcohol, cars, visas, overseas earned income, employee share schemes, and software, fringe benefits, superannuation, non-commercial losses and private health insurance, doesn't this just prove that the commu- Henry tax review is nothing more than a smokescreen for the government's plan to increase taxes?",87
76,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a bit rich coming from a member of a government that was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. They were a big taxing and very big spending government, and it has fallen to this side of the House to put some rigour back into the budget to deal with the structural issues in the budget that were created by those opposite. Over in the Senate they are opposing our proposals to means-test the private health insurance rebate. For them to ask this question at this stage, for them to come into this House and conduct a fear campaign on debt, just shows how hypocritical they are. They have not got a fiscal policy. All they can do is run these fear campaigns. They are running these fear campaigns because the only thing that unites those opposite is their hatred of the government. That is the only thing that unites those opposite: their hatred of the Labor Party. They cannot come together with the government in the national interest to support economic stimulus, to support the bank guarantees and to support all of those things we have done to cushion our economy from the worse impacts of a global recession. They are a rabble, and that has eventuated because of the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. It was on display in this House yesterday and it is on display in this House every time he asks a question where he puts forward a proposal to create a fear campaign. On this side of the House, there is no doubt that we take the nation's long-term interests very seriously, unlike those opposite who only act in their own self-interest. It is in the long-term national interest for this country to have a mature discussion about tax reform and that is what we are going to do. Liquefied Natural Gas Exports",87
77,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on developments in Australia's natural gas sector?,88
78,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House will be aware from the remarks made by the government and by the companies in recent days, there have in fact been good developments as far as Australia's natural gas sector is concerned. Of course, those developments hinge in part on Australia being viewed internationally as a reliable destination for large amounts of foreign investment. In that respect, I draw to the House's attention a Dun and Bradstreet global risk indicator, released just today, which describes Australia as a safe haven for business investment. Australia's rating was DB1d, which is the equal highest ranking achieved anywhere in the world. The only other countries to achieve this rating were Canada, Norway and Switzerland. Australia has the highest rating awarded to any economy in the Asia-Pacific region. According to D&B's CEO, Christine Christian: The latest GRI rankings show that Australia is low risk environment for business investment. Furthermore, she makes this observation: The world is continuing to change at a rapid pace and although Australia is faring well compared to other nations we cannot afford to stand still. She is right. She is absolutely right. This is good news in terms of international investor perceptions of doing business in Australia and, in particular, investing in Australia. That brings us back to the question of LNG investments and those at considerable scaleand it is good to have the Minister for Resources and Energy back from Beijing. Earlier this week in Beijing, Exxon Mobil and PetroChina signed Australia's largest ever export deal, a $50 billion contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China from the greater Gorgon project-a fact which, in itself, seems to have elicited a particular response on the part of those opposite yesterday. Mr Bowen-Yes, very unhappy.",88
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And they seem remarkably silent on it today. The project will have a 40year life and will generate export income and jobs for decades. The first 30 years of the life of this project will boost Australia's GDP by $65 billion in net present value terms. The project will return more than $33 billion to the economy through the use of Australian goods and services over the project. The project will generate 6,000 jobs in the construction phase and will run for around five years in construction. The return in tax revenue over the life of the project will be in the order of $40 billion. ",88
80,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt, characteristically, mindful that he has the national bipartisan economic interest at stake here, interjects in a most negative fashion and says that there is in fact no role for government in a respect of any element of this project. He is wrong on that point.  of order. I find it offensive that the Prime Minister would put words in my mouth that I did not call out and I ask him to withdraw them. It is called ‘verballing' and I ask him to withdraw. I said no such thing and he knows it.",88
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member will resume his seat. On his point of order, there are other avenues and processes of the House at his disposal to rectify the situation that he believes he is in. I would indicate to him, though, that it is a salutary lesson to members of the chamber about the way in which members place themselves in some trouble if they continually interject. ",89
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It would assist if members did not continually interject either other members or the occupant of the chair.,89
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps the member for Sturt could lead a South Australian walkout of the chamber today, given the success of the WA walkout yesterday! Mr Speaker, his interjection went to this question: what is the role for government in relation to these projects? I draw his attention to the fact that earlier this week I advised the House that there were three outstanding matters in relation to the Gorgon project which we have been working on with the government of Western Australia and the joint venture partners to resolve. The first was a commitment by government to indemnify the joint venture parties against third-party claims following the closure of CO2 sequestration, (2) the issuing of the necessary production licences of the project and (3) the finalisation of the necessary environmental assessments and approvals. On the first of these, I have today written to the WA Premier confirming the Commonwealth's agreement to share the long-term liability for the CO2 sequestered under the Barrow Island site. In relation to the production licences, I am advised that the Gorgon joint venture partners lodged an application for these licences with the Minister for Resources and Energy on Tuesday, as I understand it. Furthermore, on the question of the environmental proposals, that is what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and his WA state colleague have been asked to work on and they are continuing to do so diligently. It is important that these processes are attended to with all thorall oughness, as those opposite will recall from their previous engagement in environmental assessment processes. A referral under the EPBC act was lodged by Chevron in April 2008 and the environment minister and his officers have been working closely with the WA government since that time. The interjection went to the roles of government. There will be three sets of regulatory roles, the first of which involves an act of indemnification that is actually unprecedented in the country. Therefore, the decision taken conjointly by this government and the WA Liberal government to indemnify the project against CO2 sequestration liabilities long term has in fact been one of those factors which has underpinned this decision. This is what the government has embarked upon in its support of these resource projects. As I indicated to the House yesterday and the day before, there are other LNG projects alive not only in Western Australia but also in Queensland as well as off the Northern Territory. The government will continue to work positively, proactively and constructively with each of these major companies because it is all about long-term development of Australia's infrastructure and long term development of Australia's jobs. These development projects also dovetail with the government's long-term strategy of nation building for recovery and nation building for the future-nation building for the future and what must be a building decade for Australia, a building decade which involves not just the investment and public infrastructure-the roads, the rail, the ports that we need for the future as well as the high speed broadband-but also, in conjunction with our partners in the private sector, the long-term rollout of private sector infrastructure; hence, why we have developed Infrastructure Australia and hence its role in working out long-term plans for the proper provision of public infrastructure in Australia necessary for long-term productivity growth and, equally, to learn from the lessons from the past through the development of Skills Australia to work out the long-term skills needs which this economy will need, particularly given the tens of thousands of jobs which will emerge from these resource projects over time. We should be mindful of the fact that inadequate planning in this respect in the past led to excessive inflationary presTreasurersures through a failure to plan for long-term infrastructure and skills needs in the economy. That is the howling lesson from the end of the nineties through until the middle of the first decade of this century. We must learn by that. That is why the government is committed to a building decade ahead. That is why we intend to get on with the business of partnering with the private sector in advancing the Australian national economic interest. I would suggest to those opposite that they get with a national interest argument here, back the government and back the private sector in getting on with the business of building Australia's economic recovery for our long-term future.

99,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Will the minister advise the House about the outlook for Australian LNG in the Asia-Pacific region?,91
100,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck, a Western Australian who is proud of the announcements this week on achieving long-term export opportunities for Australia to the tune of $75 billion. The first ever long-term LNG supply contract with India was achieved on Monday of last week, and a $50 billion long-term LNG supply contract with PetroChina was achieved earlier this week. These contracts make a very strong statement that Australia is open for investment and, importantly, a very strong statement to the Asia-Pacific region that we are committed to developing our mineral and energy resources so as to not only maximise jobs and wealth in Australia but also meet the emerging needs of countries such as China and India. Let us deal with the recent history of the LNG industry and its potential in the very near future. In 2008-09, Australian LNG generated almost $10 billion in export earnings. That is nearly three times the value of LNG exports only three years ago. Today we have 20 million tonnes per year of production capacity on the North West Shelf in Western Australia and in Darwin. That LNG services key markets such as Japan, China and Taiwan and, in the foreseeable future, India and other Asia-Pacific nations. Perhaps more importantly, on achieving the Gorgon investment decision, with the good progress on Pluto 1, which is close to production, we have the capacity to double our export opportunities to the tune of 40 million tonnes and, in doing so, double our export earnings. I am also pleased to report to the House that the government will continue to work with the governments of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland in close alliance with the petroleum companies, because the race is on with respect to a number of other major LNG projects. I refer to Ichthys and its potential for the northern part of Australia, principally Darwin; Pluto 2 and Pluto 3 and the announcements by Woodside yesterday; Sunrise and our relationship with the Timor-Leste government; Wheatstone; Prelude; Browse; Scarborough; and Gladstone, the new frontier on the east coast of Australia, where there is great interest in seam methane based LNG, a new export opportunity for Australia. For Australia, that is not just about doubling or even tripling our LNG export opportunities; it is also about potentially achieving investments to the tune of $100 billion over the next couple of years. That creates wealth for the private sector and export earnings for the government to improve on the requirement to properly service the Australian community in areas such as health, education and basic infrastructure. It also creates real jobs on the ground. We should not forget that LNG is regarded as clean energy in the transition to a lowemission global community. By way of information to the House, for every tonne of CO2 produced in Australia when LNG is made, nine tonnes are saved when it is used for power generation in China. That is why I was also involved in a number of key conferences in China this week, going not only to the Gorgon export opportunities but also to our capacity to fuel their economy as they return to high growth and, in doing so, assist the global community to return to what we all want sooner than later: better economic growth. I am pleased to report that in meetings with the China National Petroleum Corporation-better known as PetroChina-the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC, and Chairman Zhang Ping of the National Development and Reform Commission they have been vitally focused on Australia's export opportunities-not only in LNG but also in the expansion of our uranium sector and, very importantly, our capacity to work with them on clean coal technology and also the renewables sector. From Australia's point of view, we are well placed not only to service the requirements of the Asia-Pacific region on LNG, with terrific coal export opportunities and jobs in Australia, but also to take forward the clean energy debate in a very close, cooperative way with our counterparts in places such as China, Korea, India and Japan. In conclusion, I simply say that the outcomes of negotiations over recent months, which will hopefully conclude in the finalisation of the necessary requirements for the Gorgon investment decision, are in Australia's national interest. I am pleased to say that the government has worked with Western Australia and the business sector so as to facilitate that investment sooner rather than later. Perhaps more importantly, I simply remind the House that there are a wealth of other LNG opportunities that will create further investment, wealth and jobs in Australia and in doing so will serve emerging economies such as China and India.

101,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Joan Child AO. Joan was the fourth woman to be elected to this House and its first female Labor member. She was the first female Speaker of the House and the only person to be Speaker in the provisional Parliament House and this Parliament House. August 22 this year marks the 21st anniversary of the first sittings in this House and Mrs Child taking the chair in this chamber for the first time after the move from Old Parliament House. On behalf of all members. I extend to Joan Child a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation",93
102,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer to his earlier request to have a mature debate where he does not give an opinion. Given that the government was able to rule out an increase in the GST but all week has declined to rule out the introduction of a capital gains tax on the family home, will the Treasurer today rule out the introduction of a capital gains tax on the family home?",93
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow Treasurer has a new-found interest in tax, and I can imagine why he is so embarrassed considering that some weeks ago he suggested that this year's tax cuts in the budget should have been cancelled. I think he would be fairly embarrassed about that performance. He is correct to identify that, in terms of the Henry review, we said we would not be looking at any change to the GST and tax-free super. We said that. Of course when the Australian ran a story on Saturday I made the government's view on capital gains tax on housing very clear. I made the point that we did not ask the review to look at it, that they were not going to recommend it and that we had not considered it. That is the point I made on Saturday, and I will say it again very clearly: we did not ask the review to look at it, they are not going to recommend it and we are not going to consider it. I went on to make the point that we were not going to be in the daily habit of ruling things in or ruling things out. But I have one suggestion for those opposite-I wonder whether they could get together enough energy, and whether they could get together enough unity, to put in a submission to the Henry review on tax. Emissions Trading Scheme",93
104,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. How important is it for the renewable energy target legislation and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to both pass the parliament, and is there a relationship between these two pieces of legislation?",93
105,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Just before question time the government secured passage of its expanded renewable energy target legislation through both the Senate and this House. That delivers on the commitment that the Australian Labor Party made to the Australian people to guarantee that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will be delivered by renewable sources by the year 2020. This is an extremely important achievement and it is one of the key institutional changes in the battle that the government is undertaking to deal with climate change. The passage of the legislation will help unlock investment in renewable energy generation and of course in jobs associated with those industries in areas like solar and wind power amongst others. It is important for the House to understand that, even with the expanded renewable target renewable energy target in place, Australia's emissions will continue to rise without the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Projections show that without the CPRS emissions will be 20 per cent higher in 2020 than they were in the year 2000. That is why we need the CPRS legislation to be carried by the Senate and by this place. It is the cipal mechanism by which we will go ahead to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country and play a constructive role in international negotiations over climate change. The opposition has attempted to present itself as ‘greening up' this week by supporting the government's renewable energy target legislation, which is important. But of course it retains a thoroughly incoherent position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme-and we know why they are so incoherent on this issue; there are still problems with climate change sceptics. They are hopelessly divided. The evidence that we saw yesterday in the House during question time was perfectly graphic on this issue. But the incoherence goes to the extent that, after spending all of last week and some time before arguing for the decoupling of the renewable energy legislation from the CPRS, the coalition has now agreed to amendmentswhich have enabled the passage of the renewable energy legislation-that provide a direct relationship between the renewable energy legislation and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Let there be no mistake about it: after guing for that decoupling, the renewable energy legislation provides for assistance or relief from the renewable energy target for industries in the emissions-intensive tradeexposed category on the same basis as the CPRS. That was the government's position in the first place. It is an acceptance of reality by the coalition at last on that issue-but not only that. The coalition has also agreed in the amendments to look at industries potentially affected by the renewable energy legislation on the basis that it will open up assistance under the Climate Change Action Fund-a fund, of course, which we funded by the establishment of the emissions trading scheme. So, firstly having argued to decouple everything, this is a double recouple. prinThere is a direct relationship between both pieces of legislation. There appears to be some confusion on the other side about this issue, and I refer to some comments reported in the Australian yesterday from Senator Boswell, and this is in view of the fact that we need the CPRS to go through to address climate change. Senator Boswell said the following: … our support for the renewable energy target in no way weakens our stand against the emissions trading scheme. It remains very, very doubtful whether we could ever vote for an ETS. The government has news for Senator Boswell, the National Party and the Western Australian Liberals. The agreement on the renewable energy legislation makes the case for the CPRS even more compellingabsolutely, fundamentally important. The time for vague principles, for reports from Frontier Economics and other consultants, for seeing the parade of sceptics on the other side of politics and for all of that is over. It is critical to have the CPRS legislation pass through this parliament and it is critical for the coalition to stand up in the national interar- est. They are behaving like a rabble on this issue. It is time to come forward with the specific amendments that the government can deal with to secure passage of the CPRS. Stand up for what is right. Taxation",93
106,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer to his desire to have a mature debate on taxation reform without him giving an opinion. Does the Treasurer agree with the International Monetary Fund that the current tax treatment of owner-occupied housing is too generous and that capital gains tax should be levied on the family home?",94
107,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question about tax. I also have now the statement he made to the House on 11 August this year. He said this: We look forward to the tax and welfare reform initiative of the Henry review. We look forward seeing that. Back then, only a few weeks ago, he was a full supporter of the Henry process. Today the Leader of the Opposition comes into the House and calls it a smokescreen-very sloppy, Joe, very sloppy. What it shows is just how divided",95
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,95
109,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It just shows how divided they are.  of order. Under standing order 64(c), you have twice asked the Treasurer to withdraw that remark this week, and I would ask you to ask him to withdraw that remark on this occasion.",95
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To progress proceedings, and offence to the expression being expressed, I will ask the Treasurer to withdraw. The more important thing that I would like him to have in mind is the need to refer to members by their parliamentary titles.",95
111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly. I do withdraw, but it was very sloppy of the shadow Treasurer to quote the IMF paper in the way that he just did in this House because the IMF paper is about tax policy. It does relate to housing policy but it is all about tax deductibility for home mortgage interest repayments. It is principally about that and its impact in a number of other countries around the globe, and it is not specifically directed to this country. So it is just another example of the lack of judgment and the sloppiness of the shadow Treasurer. Immigration",95
112,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister please outline Australia's approach to the admission of foreign citizens, to and are there any challenges to this approach?",95
113,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. The question goes to the rigour and the sanctity of Australia's long standing immigration procedures and processes. When people want to visit Australia-non-Australian citizens-they of course apply for a visa of some description. There are a range of assessments that are done in the course of that. For example, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship make assessments in respect of character. Our security organisations make assessments in respect of security. And from time to time under our arrangements it is open for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make assessments with respect to foreign policy matters and foreign policy implications. Ultimately, as a result of that law, that practice and our long standing procedures, from time to time it falls to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a judgment as to whether the issuing of a visa would be appropriate or not as the case may be. This, of course, is precisely the process which I followed in the recent issuing of a visa to the Uygur leader Rebiya Kadeer-a matter of some controversy and a matter of remarks in the chamber this week. I have detailed to the House that prior to the issuing of the visa, and prior to my decision to not disturb our long standing arrangements and to not disturb the normal processes of the issuing of a visa to her, I received representations, and Australia received representations, from the Chinese authorities at pretty much every level, including from my own counterpart. The representation from China was that this would not be something which China would welcome, and China asserted that Rebiya Kadeer was a terrorist. After exhaustive assessment, I came to the conclusion that I should not disturb the visa arrangements and the visa was granted. As I said to the House earlier this week, China responded to that by indicating it was most unhappy, and I have detailed to the House a number of measures which China has taken in response to that, which of course Australia regrets. The reason why we issued a visa and the reason why we did not disturb that is that we have values and virtues of long standing. We understand, respect and recognise freedom of speech. We value the capacity of someone to come to our country and say things even if we do not agree with them, and a range of things which Ms Kadeer said, including arguing that the western provinces should be under separate autonomy, is not something that the Australian government agrees with. We have a long standing position to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of western provinces so far as China is concerned and, as I have indicated to the Chinese authorities, just because someone comes here does not mean that Australia agrees with them. But it is part of our system-our values and virtues-that people have the right to exercise a view. Yesterday in the House, in response to a question, I said to the shadow minister for foreign affairs, and the Leader of the Opposition as well, that I was a bit unclear as to what the Liberal Party's position on the issuing of the visa to Rebiya Kadeer was. I said I was just a bit unsure as to whether they supported it or opposed it. That was in part confirmed by the press release which the shadow minister put out yesterday, 19 August, and I quote: “Most recently, the Rudd Government failed to work constructively with China regarding the visit to Australia of Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.” I said to myself, ‘Work constructively? I am not quite sure what that means. I listened to the representations of the Chinese authorities. I made a decision. And before that decision was made public, as I indicated to the House, I let the Chinese authorities know.' So I was a bit unsure as to what working constructively meant. Maybe this meant that the Liberal Party did not agree with the government's decision and the visa should have been refused? I was much edified this morning when I saw the transcript from the shadow minister's doorstop at Parliament House today, 20 August. In commenting on the China-Australia relationship, she said, ‘There was the bungling of the handling of the visa to the Uygur leader.' When you decide as a nation state to issue a visa you do one of two things: you either grant it or you refuse it. You either say yes or you say no. There is only one way you can bungle the issuing of a visa and that is if someone else the forms the view that the visa should not have been issued. I am just assuming, because of what the shadow minister has said and because of her and the Leader of the Opposition's deafening silence on this issue until the last couple of days, that the Liberal Party does not and did not support the granting of the visa to Rebiya Kadeer. So the Liberal Party does not believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Maybe that is just reading too much into it? Maybe there is a simpler explanation: incompetence and trying to take craven domestic political advantage. Maybe it is just incompetence. Maybe it is speaking before you think. Or maybe it is doing what I said yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had done: broken the long standing tradition of political parties on both sides of this House of a bipartisan approach to the Australia China relationship? Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, when we were in opposition for 12 years we did not seek to take domestic political advantage of our relationship with China. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition and unlike the shadow minister, we do not take a naive, crass, simplistic, miscalculated, misjudged view of China. So it is there for all to see: the shadow minister on the doors today saying that, when the Australian government issued a visa to Rebiya Kadeer, that was a bungle. It was a bungle because, according to the Liberal Party, the visa should not have been granted. So either they do not believe in freedom of speech in accordance with our long standing traditions or they are trying to take craven political advantage out of an important relationship. On the other hand, the government takes a long-term view of our relationship with China. In the last 24 hours we have seen the largest trade deal between Australia and China in our nation's history. We also have seen a range of difficulties associated with the relationship, crystallising with the issuing by the government of a visa to Rebiya Kadeer. And that was done because it was the right thing to do. If the Liberal Party had been in government at the time it is quite clear that the Liberal Party would not have issued that visa to Rebiya Kadeer. That would not have been in our nation's interest and it would not have been in the long-term interests of the relationship between Australia and China. Workplace Relations",95
114,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to media reports that she will intervene on behalf of the horticulture sector and possibly spare them from the job losses, business closures and other impacts of the government's so called modern awards. Will the minister also commit to providing a similar stay of execution for the workers and small businesses in the retail, pharmacy, aged-care and hospitality industries?",97
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, I commence my answer over the voices of those who support Work Choices on the other side. We are involved in a reform, an award modernisation reform, that when the Liberal Party was in office it said it thought was a good reform too. Indeed, the member for Menzies and others used to come into this parliament each and every day and talk about the compliance burden from the awards system and say that the awards system needed to be modernised. As it turned out, the Liberal Party proved too incompetent to get that done and chose instead to go down the route of Work Choices, where of course the award did not mean anything because you could always have an Australian workplace agreement forced on you that would strip the award away. But this remains an important reform for employers, called for by employers for decades, and I direct the shadow minister to views expressed by organisations like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry when they said: Workplace relations policy is too important for horse and buggy era approaches to persist. … … … … many businesses are subject to overlapping, multiple sets of regulation … within the one workplace. They went on to say that this situation creates: … profound difficulties in identifying workplace rights and obligations. When did they say that? It was in 2005. Who is fixing it? This government is. It is fixing it through an award modernisation request that went to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is well into this two-year task and it is on a journey to reduce 2,400 outmoded state and federal awards and industrial instruments into 130 simple, modern awards-2,400 complex, overlapping documents into 130 modern awards. That is an important reform and one I assume, from this question and the conduct of the Liberal Party, they are opposed to. They are opposed to lifting that burden from the shoulder of employers. As this award modernisation process has gone on there have been times when employers, and indeed unions, have raised with me concerns about the award modernisation process. I have said consistently to all groups, ‘This is a job for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which overwhelmingly is doing it well.' But if I become persuaded that an individual example raises legitimate concerns about the public interest and legitimate concerns about the implications of my award modernisation request and the framework of that request then I will consider those requests and respond to them if necessary. I did that in the restaurant and hospitality sector. The shadow minister has woken up this morning and read the Australian newspaper and has obviously seen that we have been in dialogue with the horticultural industry. We will continue dialogue with industries as necessary. What I can promise to the shadow minister opposite and the Liberal Party generally is, whilst they sit there turning their faces against reform, turning their faces against hard work necessary to achieve it, dreaming of the days of Work Choices and its reintroduction, over on this side of the House we are delivering the Fair Work regime complete for employers, with new, simple, modern awards. Building the Education Revolution Program",97
117,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the standing orders, I will fill the void.",98
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank you for your help!,98
119,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for the call, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on Building the Education Revolution and the responses to the program?",98
120,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his question, which did much more than fill the void; it is a great question. It enables me to celebrate with him and with members on this side of the House the fact that we have received advice from the Ouse district school in his electorate that it is the first Tasmanian school to complete construction in the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, so that is great news. The school received $250,000 and now has a new multipurpose hall, of which they can be very proud. I am also pleased to say to the member for Lyons and to the members of this House that supported this important program, building the education infrastructure that we need for the future while supporting jobs today, that this project in the member for Lyons's electorate has supported local jobs. It has supported a total of approximately 35 on-site workers in the member for Lyons's electorate and approximately 12 of those were apprenthe tices employed on the project engaged in carpentry, joinery, electrical work, mechanical services, plumbing, painting, plastering, glazing and concreting-and I think that is terrific news as well. I am asked about responses to the Building the Education Revolution program. For those who care about educationgovernment members and Independent members in this House-it has been a response of enthusiasm. On the other side we see the opposition in disarray and acting as complete rabble. They come to this parliament and criticise Building the Education Revolution. They go back home and they cannot wait to be associated with it. The shadow minister for education does not do much work on education. He gets on the internet occasionally and pulls up a photograph and then runs into this House and makes completely incorrect claims. Yesterday the member for Sturt came into this parliament and claimed, with props and all, that the Perseverance Primary School was going to receive $60,000 per student for their five students. Let me quote the words of the Australian newspaper on this.  order. Can it be relevant for the minister to tell untruths in her answer when yesterday I said they were entitled to $250,000 plus the $50,000 they had already received.",98

125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it just goes to prove how smart Tasmanians are. On the question of the Australian newspaper I know that the shadow minister does not like to be a revealed as a dud and a dissimulator, but this is what the Australian newspaper had to say today:  being granted to a Victorian primary school with only five students backfired after it emerged the school had not sought most of the funding. … … … Yesterday, the school's principal … denied it had sought the funding. Of course, the shadow minister, who does no work and has no policy, was not the only one making false claims yesterday. We had the member for Macarthur making a claim about Douglas Park Primary School. He made a claim that there was a quote for $285,000 for a new library. Of course, that too is completely untrue. There was never an official quote for $285,000 for a new library-claim not true. But, whilst they are in here as a rabble with their false claims about Building the Education Revolution, there are some people who cannot wait to get back home and associate themselves with this project. My attention has been drawn to a very extensive multipage brochure called From Andrew to you. From Andrew to you actually takes us in the beginning-with the youth shots and all the rest of it-right back in time to when there was only black-and-white film, apparentlyright back then. Mr Anthony Smith interjecting",99

127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have the member for Goldstein in a hard hat and a vest-imagine that! Then, as we keep going through, there he is in a construction site. There he is, helping with a bit of construction. And what construction is he claiming to be involving himself in, and is it of importance to his electorate? There are pages and pages of lists, and what is it? It is this government's economic stimulus package and Building the Education Revolution-pages and pages and pages of it, right here in Goldstein. Of course, this was published somewhat earlier this year, when the member for Goldstein's electorate had received $4.5 million through Building the Education Revolution. One can only imagine the width of the next instalment, when he records the $64 million that his electorate currently has under Building the Education Revolution. The poor old voters in Goldstein will not even be able to lift it! The opposition are a rabble with no unity, no discipline, no policy and no ideas, and the only thing they have to sell in their electorates is associating themselves with government programs, and here is the proof.

138,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member does refer to a major program that this government is committed to delivering on. We have announced that 750 new houses will be built in remote parts of the Northern Territory. It is a five-year program. There are 230 rebuilds that will be done. There will be 2,500 refurbishments of houses. This is the largest program of rebuilding and new housing development ever embarked on in the Northern Territory. It is also part of a major commitment by this government to reform. We understand that the old ways of delivering housing in remote parts of Australia have failed Aboriginal people terribly. What we see in every 18 part of remote Australia is terrible overcrowding, and we know that this has to be addressed. This government has decided that we will invest, over the next 10 years, $5.5 billion in housing for Indigenous people in remote parts of Australia. It is a very large program. We have also decided that we will make sure that we address some of the failings of the past. We are insisting on major reforms. We are insisting on secure tenure. Leases will be negotiated and agreed before we embark on building houses for Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia. This has never been done before. We are also insisting on proper tenancy management. We want to make sure that there is a very clear line of sight and responsibility so that it is clear who is responsible in the future for the maintenance of houses that we build. That has never been done before. We are also making sure that rent is paid and that tenants have to look after their homes. This sort of responsible tenancy management has never been clear before. Under this program, it will be. University Fees",100
139,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport. What are the consequences of the Senate's decision on the student services and amenities bill for regional Australia?",101
140,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would particularly like to thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know just how concerned she is about the impact of this decision on the University of Ballarat in particular, just as the member for Macquarie is particularly concerned about the impacts that the visiting students from Charles Sturt University have told us about today in the House-because we on this side know that the decision of the Senate is going to have a particularly devastating impact on regional campuses and regional universities. But the thing that I would like to point out today is that it is not just who realise this. Though they have failed to act and once again have toed the Liberal Party line, the National Party themselves know exactly how devastating this is going to be for regional universities. As I outlined yesterday, Senator Joyce said as recently as November last year that VSU has been a fiasco for regional universities. It is interesting that he also said in 2005 that he believed that universities: … should have the right to raise a fee to support facilities intrinsically part of a university. But today I can tell you that Senator Joyce is not on his own on this one; he is joined by his colleagues in the National Party. Just this morning another National, Senator Williams, said on ABC New England radio: ‘In the Nationals we support in principle a levy being placed on students.' Well, this is one of those occasions when supporting something in principle does not actually amount to anything. It is standing in this place and voting for it which will deliver for regional students. But once again they choose to talk the talk when they are on the radio and when they are talking to regional Australians but come into this chamber and betray them. Now they have to face the consequences of that, because there are almost 150,000 students who attend regional universities and campuses and it is those students who will be paying the price for the National Party's cowardice. I would like to draw attention to a couple of those students. One wrote to me last night-Billy, who studies at James Cook University, in the member for Leichardt's electorate.",101

142,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might want to listen to this one. Billy said, ‘VSU has smashed my campus. We lost our we welfare and academic help on campus and it was not able to support me and the other 3,500 students on campus. When we needed help we had to at some stages call or webcam Townsville just to receive some counselling.' Perhaps the National Party would like to stand up in this place and explain exactly why they do not think that regional students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time, deserve face-to-face counselling-but the National Party do not think that is important. Perhaps they can stop pretending to care for regional students who are moving away from home to commence their studies and listen to the likes of Marshall, who moved from the small town of Clonbinane in Victoria to study at Victoria University. I will tell you what Marshall said to me. He said, ‘Moving to the city from a rural area was honestly uncomfortable. To move from a place where everybody knows everyone by name to a place where you are recognised as a number was a very sobering experience for me. Coming to university, I was under the impression that there would be clubs for every interest, whether they be debating, music, theatre or sport. However, sadly, these programs all had to be cancelled.' But it is not just the students who are fering. We know that there will be a decline in jobs in regional Australia as a result of this. The thing is that at least the Liberal Party do not pretend to care. The National Party stand in this place, pretend that they care about regional students and, when we give them the chance to vote to prove it of Australia, they cowardly follow the Liberal Party line. If you would like one further demonstration of just how it is that the National Party have been using politics instead of policy in their decision making",101

147,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. In a great example of the inspired policy-making process that the Liberal Party follow, I would like to draw to the attention of the House some quotes from Senator Joyce. When he talked about just how he was going to make this decision, which is so crucial to regional Australia, he said, as is quoted in the Australian: I still believe that university is more than just the academic, it's the development of the person as a whole, but this issue is now secondary to the state election in Queensland … While the Queensland election is on, I'll have to fall into line … but (if the vote comes after the election) it's a different kettle of fish. Sadly, it is not a different kettle of fish, because the National Party are still just meekly falling into line with the Liberal Party, where sufwe on this side of the House will continue to deliver for regional universities, for regional students and for our higher education sector.",102

151,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Does the minister have any plans to change the government's proposal to cut funding for chemotherapy drugs given the strong opposition voiced by cancer physicians, pharmacists and patient groups to this budget measure?",102
152,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, I can inform the shadow minister and the House that we certainly do. As the shadow minister is aware, this is a measure that was announced in last year's budget. We have been negotiating for a period of time and we announced publicly that the introduction of the measure from 1 July would be delayed to 1 September. We certainly do intend to delay that further and we will provide the details in due course. Mr Dutton interjecting",103
153,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the shadow minister would understand that this is a very complex measure. We believe that Mr Dutton interjecting,103
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,103
155,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the shadow minister wants to have a serious answer to what is a serious question, I can tell him that the measure has not been implemented; it is quite wrong for him to suggest that patients have suffered in any way. There have been a lot of negotiations. I might just give members of the House an example of one of the issues that is being negotiated. One of the issues that is being negotiated is the cost of Herceptin. Many of you on all sides of the House would know that it is a very expensive drug and a very important treatment for breast cancer sufferers. In Australia, the pharmaceutical company Roche provides the vial in only one size. In other countries, Japan, it is provided in a range of different sizes, which means that the wastage is less. We have other pharmaceutical examples where the production process allows for some waste, and there are many other parts of the procedure where we believe that there is an extraordinary amount of wastage of highly expensive drugs funded by taxpayers. We believe that it is in the interests of taxpayers to ensure that we get value for money and that expensive cancer drugs are not wasted. We intend to pursue the measure and we certainly will advise the House and the shadow minister in due course of the timing of that. It will be delayed, and we make no apologies about that; but, unlike those opposite, we believe that taxpayers' money should be spent wisely. There should not be an abuse of processes. It is important to make sure that the health dollar goes as far as it can. New drugs, like Avastin, would not have been listed on the PBS because they would not have met the cost-effective test by PBAC unless this measure was in place. If the shadow minister would show just a skerrick of responsibility, he might just like to think about the sorts of drugs he wants taken off the PBS because he does not support these types of measures. Renewable Energy",103
156,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. What are the implications for Australian farmers of the government's plans to promote renewable energy, and what are the preconditions for these benefits to be available to farmers?",103
157,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for the question. The member for Dawson is very well engaged with the sugar industry in his electorate. There are very exciting times ahead for the sugar industry in Australia. Already we have seen record high sugar prices-28-year highs. My department like has advised me that the futures contracts have risen from less than 12c a pound in October last year to 22c a pounds now. With the passing of the RET legislation, we have a new opportunity for extra money to be going through to the sugar industry through cogeneration. The Sugar Milling Council has looked to potential co-generation sites up and down the sugar coast, from Queensland down to northern New South Wales. In Far North Queensland, in the seats of Leichhardt and Kennedy, they believe that there is now a capacity for co-generation to provide service of electricity to the same capacity of 70 per cent of the households in that area. In the electorate of Dawson, through North Queensland, in Herbert and the Burdekin, there are three mills to be upgraded. In the Whitsunday hinterland and Mackay in the central region there are two mill upgrades. In the first of those, in the Burdekin, we are talking about more than 140,000 households being able to be serviced with their electricity supplies through use of the bagasse back into the grid. That is more than the requirements for the total region, as a result of the RET now having been passed. These benefits go all the way down to the southern areas where sugar is grown, into Hinkler and Wide Bay, through the Wide Bay-Burnett southern region, and into northern New South Wales and the electorate of Page. To be able to turn this from an immediate advantage into a long-term drive for investment in renewables, it is not enough to simply have the renewable energy target in place; we also need to have the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to be able to continue to drive long term investment into renewables. To be able to deliver on this, we need to get the certainty which is only possible if the coalition resolves its differences. It was not long ago-just on a year ago-that the member for Higgins was quoted in the Australian as saying: In the Coalition agreement, there has never been a Liberal Party position and a National position … If you are in coalition, you have a Coalition position. That was what the member for Higgins said last year. This morning, on the doors, the Leader of the Opposition was asked, ‘Well, what if the Nationals vote differently to the Liberals?' Instead of acknowledging it as a fundamental break within the coalition, he said, ‘That is less than ideal.' What for decades on decades has been a cornerstone of that group-being able to say that they could be a coalition, being able to say that they could be an alternative government-is, instead, now simply something that is just ‘less than ideal'. In an article by Matthew Franklin in today's Australian, we read that the Nationals have found a strategic genius who has come up with the pathway back to recovery as a political party. Mrs Hull interjecting",103
158,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The new idea that was come up with today that the National Party member quoted to Matthew Franklin was: ‘We have to start talking to regional Australia.' A brand new idea for the National Party: start talking to regional Australia! I suggest that, on the way through, they start listening to regional Australia as well. There is no damage that any of us in this place can cause to the coalition that comes close to what they have been inflicting on themselves. They have become a rabble that makes Mal Meninga's political career look strategic. Budget",104
159,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Minister, how many families will miss out on IVF as a result of the government's changes to the safety net?",104
160,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the question, another question on an issue that is affecting many people and concerning many Party people. One of the main reasons that so many families are particularly concerned is because of a lot of the speculation before the budget that items were going to be removed from the Medicare safety net or in fact were going to be means-tested. I can assure your constituents, along with all others, that neither of those things is correct. The government is not removing any item from the Medicare safety net and is not means-testing any item on the safety net. The steps that are proposed from the budget measure are to limit the exorbitant fees that can be charged and are being charged by some IVF practitioners-not all of them but some. The answer to your question, to be honest, rests entirely on the providers of the services. Those who are charging an average fee for a typical cycle of $6,000 a year will have no increased expenses at all. I know because we have had very many representations from parents but also from providers to say that they do charge those fees and that they understand that we are taking a sensible move because there are some excessive fees, frankly, being charged by some providers who know that there are many families who are very desperate to be parents and quite rightly should be supported by the government, but that 78c in every dollar should not go into the pockets of highly paid health professionals preying on parents who are desperate to have children. People who are charged average fees will not be worse off. I have said that on the record before and I continue to say that. It is in the hands of those specialists, who can still make very good incomes, to make a decision whether they want patients to pay for this or whether they are prepared to moderate their fees. This is a sensible measure and the opposition should support it. Climate Change",104
161,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How has the response of local government contributed to the important objective of a united national response to climate change?",105
162,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. Indeed, responding to climate change was a theme at this year's Australian Council of Local Government meeting held in the last week of June in conjunction with the parliamentary sitting here. Local government is working constructively with the national government to deal with the impacts of climate change. Many of the local community infrastructure projects that are rolling out around the country are creating jobs as well as building sustainability at the local level. I am asked about the importance of a united national response to climate change. I have to report, Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, that a united response has been lacking. We have seen from those opposite chaos and division-not a single amendment proposed to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation because they could not agree between themselves. Those opposite have all week once again behaved like an absolute rabble. It is the climate change sceptics and the deniers who are controlling their party room, and the Leader of the Opposition has a very difficult task to bring his party, let alone the Nationals, into line so that we can truly have a united national position on climate change. We have seen some of the veterans of this House, the dinosaurs, in their position of climate change denial. I have to report that they are also coming up the ranks through local government. The leader of the Liberal Party in the inner west of Sydney is a local councillor, Nick Adams. He provides an insight into what the rank and file view in the Liberal Party is when it comes to climate change. Just a few days ago he declared climate change to be a crock. He said: The whole thing is a hoax-it's a swindle. He went on to say: Even if every single Australian simultaneously broke wind, it would have zero impact on the environment. He is a sophisticate, this bloke. He went on to say, in a criticism of people in his own party: Anyone that supports the ETS is not a true patriot. There was more: Anyone that supports the ETS does not want jobs for all Australians. They are traitors. That is the position coming up from the ranks of the Liberal Party that the Leader of the Opposition has to deal with. Yesterday we saw the extraordinary position whereby we had a walkout at question time over a deal that they said they support. The extraordinary thing was not the walkout-they walked back about three minutes later. It was like they had a collective dunny break and came back in. They came back into the chamber because they did not know why they had left in the first place.  order. Clearly this is unedifying in the national parliament but neither is it relevant to the question. I ask you to sit the minister down if he cannot rise above this pathetic gutter level.",105

164,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. We on this side of the House did not ask people to leave yesterday. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition was incapable of showing any leadership whatsoever.

NA AMENDMENT (MIDWIVES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2009 Cognate bills: NA INDEMNITY (COMMONWEALTH CONTRIBUTION) SCHEME BILL 2009 NA INDEMNITY (RUN-OFF COVER SUPPORT PAYMENT) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed.",108
178,Mr LAMING,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"The cruel subtext of the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 is that you are consigning homebirths to the underworld of health service delivery. That is the ridiculous position this legislation places us in. It will effectively do four things: (1) it will oblige registered midwives to sneak off and assist with home deliveries without anyone knowing and, in so doing, potentially make them reluctant to refer young mums for hospital care when needed; (2) it will potentially place registered midwives at risk of $30,000 fines purely for attending a homebirth; (3) it will lead to midwives not becoming registered, not falling under indemnity protection and continuing to deliver at home at greater risk, without hospital support; and (4)-worse of all-it will mean non-registered midwives operating parallel to if not in isolation from the health services. The one thing that we know is that the best way to incorporate homebirths in an overall obstetric plan for a nation is to have them supported by a functioning hospital system. Let us remember that Australia is not the Netherlands and it is not Denmark; Australia is the second most sparsely populated country in the world. Yes, that presents certain challenges in health service delivery and it means that often mothers are not delivering just around the corner from a fully equipped hospital. As was said by my colleague Senator Eggleston, who has also worked in the area, we need to remember that in this debate about homebirthing there is a third party involved-the baby. At a birth there is the clinician or the helper-the doula or whoever is involved; perhaps a midwife-there is the mother and the family, and there is also the baby. Austrarisk lia stands proud in having some of the lowest morbidity and mortality statistics in the world for birthing. If we look purely at the intrapartum neonatal mortality statistics for healthy full-term babies, Australia compares very well. Overall statistics for neonatal deaths around the world usually sit between one and two per thousand. In this debate we are excluding the highrisk pregnancies-women delivering earlier than 34 weeks, breech deliveries, twins, someone with a history of a caesarean attempting a normal delivery-from analysis. What you have left are what we call low-risk deliveries. You can read the volumes; you can go right through Cochrane, de Jong and Jules, and every one of the world's leading experts in this area say the evidence in this area is inconclusive-and I do need to note the exception of a recent Dutch study, which did have its own weaknesses-or that at best there are virtually comparable mortality statistics for low-risk children born at home. So we all need to cool down a little bit about the safety debate, because we in this chamber have access to the best possible studies and most of them are inconclusive. I have already referred to one that showed a slightly higher neonatal death or stillbirth rate, but overall through these huge studiesI am talking national cohort studies; I am talking anonymised meta-analyses; I am talking the US homebirth study-we can be fairly confident that we can send the actuarial analyses out to look at homebirthing and make a dispassionate decision on whether it is safe. Can I now approach this debate from the provider's point of view-and I need to acknowledge, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, your long involvement in medicine and obstetrics. Fundamentally, providers are not out there trying to do wacky things with highmums. Intrinsically, what midwives are doing, be they community midwives or working in a hospital, is looking after the interests of both mum and the baby. We do not have to fear that we will be promoting high-risk deliveries in the furthest corners of Australia. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is making provision for mothers in Australia who want a homebirth to be able to have one. Can I cast some light on two concerns that we have not yet mentioned. The first oneand it sounds awfully callous and very focused on cost-effectiveness-is that mums who deliver at home deliver an enormous saving to the healthcare system. That is not the pervasive consideration here, but let us remember that the thousands of dollars in bed days, the enormous risks of highintervention deliveries-the use of forceps and vacuum extraction-and the ballooning number of caesarean sections come at a cost. The savings from homebirths would more than pay for extending indemnity to those mums who seek it and who are low-risk. We are following a common-sense approach so that we pull home deliveries into the warm embrace of high-quality, hospital-supported obstetric care. I do not think, Minister Roxon, that that is too much to ask. I will make a second point that has not yet been made in this debate. In 1992 I walked the corridors of an obstetrics ward in Farnborough and Orpington in the UK fearful of my senior registrars, who brooked absolutely no deviation from obstetric protocols, and knowing that we operated there on a margin for error of 0.6 in a thousand deliveries. That is not a great deal of room for error. The term ‘margin for error' sounds very clinical, but what it means is that we do not want to lose a single life. When, as you have in Australia over the last decade, you have reduced mortality in low-risk deliveries from 1.2 to about 0.8 per thousand it seems only small but it is 224 babies every year, out of an enormous number of deliveries. So it is absolutely imperative that with every delivery we are thinking: how can we maximise safety in mum and baby, No. 1? We need a system that pulls homebirths into that view and says: what is going to work at home and what is simply too risky? I have outlined what is too risky, but quite often mums will say, ‘I can't handle the pain anymore; can I be transferred?' or, ‘Things are moving slowly with the dilation and in the progress of the second stage; can we transfer to a hospital? I think that common sense would dictate that if you were to provide indemnity to midwives they would simply say, ‘I accept the indemnity on the condition that I will do the following things.' I used to be a high-risk clinician and surgeon myself-not because I was not terribly good at it but because I did high-risk operations-and I was told, ‘If you move into this clinical area you will pay more for your indemnity.' So it is only reasonable that in homebirthing, were you to choose to deliver high-risk mothers at home or to deliver further from a hospital obstetrics unit, your premiums would rise. My point to those on the other side of the chamber is a simple one: let risk be paid for; let risk find its level the healthcare system, as it does for every other clinician. Think of what the other side are achieving in government. They are effectively proposing that any clinician can practise at home except for a midwife. It is an extraordinary proposition: a doctor can prescribe and any other allied health professional can practise from home but a midwife cannot; it is all because of some confected idea that it is either unsafe, that it needs to be driven underground or, most concerning off all, that it cannot be afforded. I think that is the subtext of this legislation-for some reason they believe they cannot afford to extend indemnity across to midwives. I want to go back to 2001 for a moment. Back in those days, when we used to work under claims incurred rather than claims made, we basically had doctors being indemnified through mutual organisations. They did not fall under APRA and they did not fall under the Insurance Act 1973. Over the nineties the gradual demand for state tort law reform, which never came, meant that premiums started to rise. Eventually clinicians had calls made upon them by their insurers to try and pay for an explosion in payouts. Let us go back a step. There are 2,000 payouts a year. The majority of them are under $100,000. About five per cent of medical indemnity cases where a plaintiff takes a doctor to court are for over half a million dollars. Those massive cases comprise about 40 per cent of indemnity cases. So it is no easy task to be able to work out the number or the size of claims in any one year. That is why you cannot leave a small number of midwives out on their own. It makes eminent sense to incorporate midwifery with medicine and with the range of other indemnities available, as it does to include homebirths. Back in 2001 I was flying across the Gulf in of Carpentaria when our party received a satellite phone call saying that United Medical Protection had gone into liquidationthat it had collapsed. That was a turning point-a lightning rod for the reform of medical indemnity, which many thought could never be fixed. This problem festered like a sore under both governments for over a decade until it was fixed in 2001, and I give credit to Kay Patterson, former Minister for Health and Ageing, and the state ministers who brought in tort law reform. What we knew was that the incurred but not reported cases had to be covered; that the ultra-high costs had to be covered; and that we needed a provision for practitioners who had retired, become ill or taken maternity leave. We needed a roll-on cover provision for those who were no longer covered. Of course in the old days it was simple: the practitioner, when they were potentially being sued, simply phoned up their insurer and said, ‘I used to be a member when the case occurred. Can you cover me now?' And that was usually obliged. No longer. The government stepped in in 2002 and said, ‘We need to have roll-on cover and it needs to be at a cost that does not actually make insurers unviable.' The result again was roll-on cover that protected all practitioshift ners, as it does to this day, even after they finished practising. That is important, as I said, because it is very difficult to determine when these cases are going to come forward and how large they will be. It is impossible to forecast how litigation changes over time. Cases that may not be prosecuted now may well be in years to come. It is very challenging for insurers. But we know that a study has been done-the actuarial analysis of covering homebirths has been done but has not been released by this government. It is truly disappointing that we cannot actually have informed debate of that actuarial analysis of homebirths. What has become more important than anything for mums in the last two decades, if I can make an observation first hand, is the emergence of perinatal testing, neonatal evaluation and birthing plans in the suite itself. Can I say that the one strong signal that was always there for me as a clinician was, when that mum was sitting there, often surrounded by family, in those final moments of labour-and they are often of course forgotten in that miasma of celebration when a healthy baby arrives-just how important it is to adhere to that birth plan. Families go to great trouble to develop a plan, and I recognise hospitals in this country for making sure that they are carried out to the letter for mums. We know that by doing that we improve the odds of a successful second stage. Reducing stress often means a more successful labour, less need for surgical and other forms of medical intervention, and less pain relief. That has always been the banner flown high by supporters of homebirth-that, no matter what study you look at around the world, the degree of intervention and the need for pain relief is far lower. A mother is far more likely to have a normal, uncomplicated delivery when birthing at home. We tend to take our focus away from that and it onto neonatal death and stillbirth, issues which are still very difficult to prove. One thing is clear: the importance of delivery at home for mothers who choose it-for mothers who are mentally ready to deliver at home and who actively seek out that kind of service. I can see people thinking, ‘Would that be me? Would I choose to deliver at home?' The thing is that Australia is a nation of choice. But this is a Labor government taking the choice away. I cannot put it any more simply than that. Delivery at home should be a right. We have the hospital service that can support it and we should be fighting hard to make sure that indemnity is extended to the lowrisk deliveries cohort. Of course we need provisions for high-risk deliveries. I acknowledge that. We may have to look at ways to achieve that in a large nation like this. But let us not become the first country in the world to effectively liquidate, to tively airbrush away or to effectively snuff out the right to deliver at home. For those who choose it and know they can do it successfully, and for the professionals who make it as safe as it is anywhere in the world, we on this side of the chamber stand up for the rights of women to decide.",109
179,Mr BEVIS,MIDWIFE PROFESSIONAL,"This has been a very interesting debate to listen to on the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and related bills. I think there have been a number of very good contributions made on both sides of the chamber. Indeed you yourself, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Washer, are someone who is well regarded on both sides of this chamber, for a lot of very good reasons not least of all being your expertise and judgment in matters to do with health. A lot of the debate, perhaps understandably, has focused on homebirthing-and I too will be making a comment about that. But before I turn to that I think it is important to recognise that this bill contains very significant positive improvements in the recognition of midwives. If you listened to much of the debate from many of those opposite, you would have the impression that this bill somehow attacks the standing of midwifery in this country. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill is a significant advancement in the recognition of midwives and providing them with access to the necessary support mechanisms to enable them to do their work. This is a bill which has been crafted after a good deal of consultation, and I want to congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, on her preparedness to engage in very extensive consultations, across her portfolio but particularly in respect of this bill, with those engaged in the birthing process. The maternity services review which she effecoversaw had more than 900 submissions, and that is an indication of the interest in Australia in the laws governing the arrangements for birthing. But this bill contains major acknowledgements of and improvements for midwives. For the first time, it will grant access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to provide benefits for services from eligible midwives. This has been a major issue for many in this section of the health industry. Like, I suspect, most members of this parliament, I have had regular and long standing discussions with midwives in my electorate, with mothers in my electorate and also, in a related sense, with breastfeeding mothers, and in some cases there is an overlap. Some of the people who come before you to talk about these issues of access to midwifery are also engaged in activities associated with the Breastfeeding Association. I think it is a substantial recognition of the importance of the work of midwives that this bill will ensure access to medical benefits and also to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The bill also sees a government supported professional indemnity insurance scheme for eligible midwives being put in place. The previous speaker, the member for Bowman, concluded his contribution here by referring, quite rightly, to the problems that occurred with the entire professional indemnity industry-and indeed the insurance industry as a whole-after 9-11. Those of us who were in this place at that time, and indeed those who were in one of the professions affected, realised that indemnity insurance was becoming unattainable. It did not matter whether it was indemnity insurance for a midwife, a doctor or a lawyer, or if it was some small town country hall that the CWA wanted to operate. To get indemnity insurance of any kind was a major obstacle in the aftermath of 9-11. It is a serious issue and a complex issue, and this bill addresses many of the problems which confront midwives which are associated with that issue. It does not address all of the lems, but we should acknowledge that it does address many of them. Importantly, the government has also committed to extra scholarships both for GPs and for midwives, and that is going to expand the maternity workforce. That is going to be a benefit for all Australians. As the member for Brisbane, in an inner city area, I want to acknowledge that I think it is going to be of particular benefit to those in rural and remote areas who presently do not have the sort of access that many of my constituents do-who invariably have a choice of hospitals, a choice of specialists and a choice of midwives. This is an important improvement in genuinely providing access and choice for women in many parts of Australia. Providing access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the MBS, and also the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, for nurse practitioners is going to cost somewhere in the order of $60 million over the next four years. That is a substantial commitment from this government to ensure those new procedures are put in place. That is going to improve the flexibility and the capacity of Australia's health workforce and it is going to improve patient access to services that in the past would not have been available. The government is also committed to providing eligible midwives with access to those two schemes for the first time, expanding choice for women, at a cost of some $66 million over four years. These are substantial commitments. I was a bit annoyed, I have to say, at some of the contributions from those opposite, who tried to focus on other areas that for 12 years they took no action to fix and, in the process, ignored the improvements that this bill does make. There can be no question that the commitment this government has made and the provisions that are in this bill and in this budget are a dramatic improvement in probensuring the availability of midwifery to more Australians than would otherwise be the case. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Health and Ageing said: At this stage, the Commonwealth is not proposing to extend the new arrangements for midwives to include homebirths. That has been the focus of a good deal of comment from a number of people opposite. Understandably, the nature of debate in this place tends to mean that we focus on the things we disagree about rather than the things we find in common, but it is nonetheless a serious issue. I have had a number of meetings with constituents in my electorate concerned about the homebirthing option and I think there is genuine cause for concern. We need to look at some additional adjustments to ensure safe, viable homebirthing options are available. At the moment, homebirthing is done at some financial risk to the midwife engaged in the activity. It is not as though the current system is a desirable final outcome. I received a letter from one of my constituents a month or so ago that I think puts the case that many have put to me, and it puts the case quite well. I want to read a couple of paragraphs from that letter. My constituent said: The intersection of this legislation with the national registration and accreditation of health professionals from July 2010 will prevent registered midwives from attending homebirths. I believe this to be an unintended consequence and ask that you, as my representative, take steps to ensure home birth remains a viable option. Interestingly, she then referred to the experiences of some of her friends. It draws, I think, a useful comparison. She said: Two days ago a friend of mine gave birth via a planned-that is, from conception-elective caesarean section. Her first child's birth some seven years ago caused her great psychological distress. She grappled with depression and her desire to have more children for five years before finding an obstetrician who would provide her with an elective caesarean birth, giving her choice and control. She has now experienced two planned caesarean births in 18 months with the same care provider and is a very happy woman. Society has supported her choices through taxpayer funds for surgery, hospital stays and by indemnifying her health carer. She went on in her letter to say: Next Friday, the wife of an employee of my husband will give birth by a primary planned elective caesarean section for no medical reason. It's their first child. She doesn't like vaginal birth so she found an obstetrician who would support her right to the birth she wants. As a society we support her right through taxpayer funds for surgery, hospital stay and possible special care nursery for her baby and by indemnifying her carer. Any day now I'll give birth too. All going to plan my baby will be born at home, as my daughter was eight years ago. I will be attended by two registered midwives. While currently society accepts my right to birth at home, I am not supported by taxpayer funding, nor are my midwives indemnified. And yet I'll save those same taxpayers thousands of dollars. She concluded by saying: Women should be at the centre of their care and hold primary responsibility for the decision making. It's not that the baby is unimportant or doesn't have needs, but no-one has a greater interest in a healthy baby and a happy outcome than the pregnant woman herself. I share those views. I think she has quite fairly put the case and drawn the comparison from her own personal experience. And I think it is time that we recognised in Australia the validity and importance of homebirthing. The sort of statistics that the previous member spoke about, which I have to say the people who have come to lobby me have also inundated me with, do demonstrate that there is a lot of empirical evidence to support the view that homebirthing in most circumstances, under proper supervision, is no more a health risk than birthing in a hospital environment. For some of us that may seem an alternative that we do not wish to consider and that is fine. But it is clear that homebirthing is very much the option that some women choose, and choose very strongly. Indeed, I have met with women who have had homebirths and who are now pregnant-I am thinking of one lady in particular who is now pregnant and intends to have a second child by homebirth. She is-I hesitate to use the word but I think it is the appropriate one-actually scared of going to hospital. She does not want to give birth in the idea of labour and hospital. For some of us that may seem odd, but I am reminded of when my first child was born. My eldest son is now 30 and when my wife was pregnant and we were considering the options for the birth of our first child, we wanted to both be in the labour ward together-it was a hospital birth. It was not easy to find obstetricians and hospitals that would let you do that. That may seem strange-and 30 years ago is really not that long a time-but 30 years ago a number of doctors would refuse to have the father in the delivery room. Some hospitals would refuse to allow you to be there. The expectation was that you would wait down the corridor in a room doing the sorts of things that you saw in movies from Hollywood for decades prior to that. We did actually thankfully have a very good obstetrician who was quite welcoming of the thought that I should be there, and not long before that one of the major hospitals in Brisbane had changed its policy to allow partners to be present in the labour ward. (Quorum formed) Quorums are indeed a very small price to pay for government; I am more than happy to sit on this side of the chamber and endure quorums as often as you like. If the tactical high point for those opposite is to call quorums and get their happies and jollies out of doing that, long may it stay the same. The only sad thing about this particular quorum is that a number of members were engaged in a function paying respect to a former Speaker, who was acknowledged here at question time. It is a pity that the tactical team on the other side of the chamber could not comprehend that perhaps quorums could have been called at a time that did not involve disruption to what is a proper function in the Speaker's suite to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the first female Speaker of the Parliament of Australia. People can make their own judgments about the efficacy of those opposite in doing that at this time. Before the quorum was called I had just completed reading a passage from a constituent of mine. I think the points made by my constituent are legitimate. There will still be many women who seek to have homebirths and we are going to need to look at the best way of dealing with that. This is part of a much broader issue. Yes, there are complexities with indemnity-which even the previous speaker on the other side of the chamber raised-which cannot just be swept away or ignored. The indemnity risks involved with homebirthing are different to those involved with hospital birthing. But these are not insurmountable problems. We need to ensure that women do have proper choice and that homebirthing is properly supported. Another thing that has concerned me is the number of caesareans that occur in Australia. When you look at the statistics, it is hard to believe that they are all performed for medical reasons. The OECD average number of caesarean sections for every 100 live births is 22. In Australia that figure is 29. Only three countries have a higher rate: Korea, Italy and Mexico. In countries like Sweden, Belgium, France and Finland the figure is 17. There is a substantial difference between the rate of caesarean births in Australia and other countries that makes me wonder whether or not all of those caesareans are done for good and proper reason. This was one of the issues that were looked at as part of the national study that was overseen by the Minister for Health and Ageing. I think it is also part of the mix of options that we need to look at. At the moment, as my constituent correctly points out, the arrangements allow indemnity, public funding for hospitalisation and all of those services to be supported by the public purse. We need to look at doing the same for homebirthing. But we should not forget that this bill provides very substantial improvements in the recognition of midwives. It is a good bill and it deserves to be supported by both sides of the chamber. Debate interrupted.
