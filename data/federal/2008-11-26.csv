4,Mr RAGUSE,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"This is about developing standards. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 is another historic Labor initiative. I spoke in the House the other day about a number of initiatives over the years, understanding and remembering that back in the Keating era the establishment of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, was very much about our push as a Labor government to increase and improve the social infrastructure in this country-our view and understanding of education, the importance of education, and certainly the establishment of a standards committee, of an authority, to then manage this process of curriculum development around the country. Certainly the Rudd initiative, creating the vision for the education revolution, is very much a part of the Labor vision. I have said before in this House that the opposition do not quite understand what we as a government mean when we talk about a vision and a future. Nation building is not just infrastructure; it is also the soft infrastructure we put in place. So when you look at building frameworks, particularly in education, it is about establishing the standards, providing resources and supporting the professional development of staff-teachers out in our communities in different states at different times doing different things but having some common understanding of where curriculum should be placed, certainly as a national approach to curriculum development. It is interesting that a few members who have already spoken from the other side have suggested that it is all simply terminologythat we are beating our chests with throwaway lines. The reality is, of course, that Labor governments have a history of building and developing social infrastructure, particularly in education. All of us would remember the Whitlam era. The Whitlam government in a very short period of time in government introduced free university education. In that era no more than three per cent of our community ever got the opportunity to go to university. In this day and age over 35 per cent get fairly easy and direct access to university. In some states up to 95 per cent of people have post-secondary educational opportunities, whether it is in university, vocational education and training or other areas of skills development. This is not something new. We have not just thought this up as something that might fit the time and have some political outcome. This is really a continuation of what Labor governments have established in the past. In the Whitlam era there was not only access to university education. People may or may not remember Myer Kangan and the Kangan report of 1974. Most people would understand and know a lot about the TAFEtechnical and further education-system. Mr Speaker, you would probably be aware that it was the Kangan report to then Minister Beazley, Kim Beazley Sr, as Minister for that Education, that developed our modern understanding of the TAFE system. Thirty-four years later and the TAFE system is still strong, albeit in the last 12 years coming under threat from the former Howard government. I will talk a little bit about that shortly, but the reality is that we started with major reforms in the Whitlam era in education, certainly at the tertiary education level with vocational education and training and the establishment of the TAFE system. If we take that into the Hawke era it was very much about skills and productivity linked to industrial rewards. It was all about people gaining more skills, better curricula, a better approach to training in a structured way and linked to the opportunity to not only enhance skills but get proper remuneration for those skills. We go forward-and I have already spoken about this-into the Keating era and the establishment in 1992 of what was ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. That was the next step in the development across the country of the TAFE system, the technical and further education system. I gave examples previously of what happened before the establishment of ANTA and of national training standards. I will make ages with our secondary school system and the need for a national approach to curriculum development. I used the example of people in trades. An electrical contractor working in Queensland-that is, who had the skills and the licensing-could not work in Victoria simply because a national approach did not exist. ANTA established and reformed our whole approach to vocational education and training. In the nearly 12 years between the Keating period and the Rudd government coming to power and into the position of being able to roll out our education revolution, we saw what was essentially the dismantling of the TAFE system. We saw the establishment of the New Apprenticeships system and the weakening of the TAFE system. We can link the standards put in place by previous governments and to the Rudd government's education revolution. It is not just about computers; it is not just about physical resources. It is a philosophy and an ideology. It is about all of those things ing together to change the way that we understand our training and our training future and how that should be rolled out. This is about empowering teachers. I will talk more about that and about the conversations that I have had with members of the teaching fraternity in my electorate. Change is always met with concern. I have had lots of conversations with teacher groups about the need for a national approach to curriculum. A lot of teachers are concerned. After 12 years of the previous government, they are suspicious of change. They are suspicious that fiddling around with the processes will mean they are going to lose something. I would like to assure the House-and I understand curriculum development, having been an educator and having done a lot of work in curriculum development, particularly in the vocational education and training linksector-that this can only mean good things for our country. I will continue to work with and talk to those teachers. This authority will be set up for the purpose of transparency. It is about the ability of all people-that is, those in the education sector and others who have linkages to industry-to come together to work out and understand what the education standards in this country should be. We talk about the education revolution and we talk about better resourcing. If we do not have a road map for rolling out the resources, if we simply throw funds at individual schools, at individual systems or at individual states without an understanding of how we tie all this together, then it simply will not work. The establishment of this authority is an absolutely necessary first step in taking our education revolution forward and in rolling out and achieving the outcomes we want for our kids around the nation. The wonderful thing about a national curriculum is that we will get over that problem experienced by people who move around our comcountry-people in some of the government services or in our military-of different education systems. That has been a problem for families who have moved from Queensland to Victoria to Western Australia. There is no commonality. It is very hard to link a student who has travelled around from different states into the appropriate level of syllabus or curriculum. It is essential in finally overcoming the differences between the states. We have a model. We have the ANTA model. A national curriculum was rolled out from 1992 to 1996. The continuation of the national approach, albeit under-resourced through those 12 years, has meant that we have some very good national standards in the vocational education sector. I have spoken to our local teachers about their ability to engage in the process. Members in this House, and certainly those members who have an interest in education-and I presume that is all of us-can actively engage their local constituency and the teachers and educators in their community. I want to pay tribute to a number of people in my electorate-principals and teaching staff-who actively involve their schools in so many activities. There is the argument about what is curriculum and what is extracurricular. This is not about a tick-and-flick list. It is about understanding the core of a curriculum and making sure that people have access to many opportunities within the education system. Whether a school is private or publicly funded should not matter. If our curriculum is the basis of the way we all progress and gain our skills, then all the other skills extracurricular activity that can be written into programs are acceptable. I would like to pay tribute to a number of principals: Suzanne Jolly from Eagleby State School, Mike O'Connor from the Eagleby South State School and Marilyn Moballe from Beenleigh State High School. In fact, the Prime Minister back in September visited the Beenleigh High School, and I know he was very impressed with the way that school is progressing, particularly in what are at times very difficult circumstances. I also tribute to Alison Crane from Loganlea State High School. Alison's school has a very high percentage of students with a learning disability. The practices in that school are very good. A national approach to curriculum would allow schools in the nation to gain information about how other schools are dealing with particular problems. That is one example. In Queensland, areas are broken up into regions, and regional directors and regional assistant directors manage the school communities. I would like to pay tribute to Samantha Knowles, who is an assistant executive director, and Glen Hoepner. I have worked closely with them in bringing their community together. I would also like to pay tribute to Michael Shyne, from the Tamborine Mountain State School. He is a very hands-on principal who understands the value of curriculum development. In fact, I know he will be leading the charge to ensure that all of the teaching fraternity within my community come together to talk about the opportunities that the education revolution will bring. I want to pay special tribute to John Hammond from St Bernard State School on Tamborine Mountain. After a long career of teaching John is retiring. As excited as he is about a national approach to curriculum, he has decided to bow out after a long career. But I know that people like John will remain and in our community and be very much part of our P&C and P&F network so that we can bring together their expertise. I talk to many in our community about opportunities. They understand the record that Labor governments have from the Whitlam era through Hawke and Keating and now with the Rudd government-with that sad 12-year gap in between where we saw dismantled, essentially, lots of the opportunity that was there before 1996. The teachers who I talk to-and, being an educator, they cerpay tainly have some trust in where I am taking this-are fearful of change simply because of the experiences of the last 12 years. They are concerned that change does not mean good things. I can say to them that the education revolution of this government is about driving education forward. It is about not only the hard, physical resources but also building new social infrastructure. We talk about nation building certainly in physical infrastructure, but nation building is also about bringing communities, infrastructure and resources together to make Australia a better country. I believe that this is the first step in establishing what will be a national approach to skills development, certainly in the secondary schools sector. We have done it with TAFE-we created TAFE when in government. I believe this is the final chapter in our establishment of the education revolution.",19
5,Mr SLIPPER,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I understand the honourable member for Forde said that this was the final chapter in the education revolution. Educational improvements are of course ongoing and a work in progress. I suspect that as long as this country exists we will be constantly endeavouring to improve our education system and to better our curriculum to make sure that young people, who are our nation's future, do in fact receive the education which will fit them out to be good citizens and will also enable them to get a job and make a productive contribution towards the future of Australia. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 enjoys the support of both sides of the House in principle. Many honourable members would have heard me talk over the years about the importance of a solid education for giving young Australians the very best start on their life's journey. There is no doubt that the aim of a national curriculum is desirable, and was a policy initiative of the former HowardCostello government. It is a policy initiative which I am pleased to see the current government adopting. It is particularly important that young people have a sound education and that that education includes an understanding of the three Rs because there is an undeniable link between being able to read, write and count and obtaining job and being a productive member of the Australian workforce. Over the years we have had discussion concerning differences in curriculum and education programs from state to state. Most honourable members, like me, have had approaches from people who have moved from one part of Australia to another complaining about the fact that one education system appears to be half a year ahead or behind that in another state. We have seen young people disadvantaged by being put into a class where they are behind or losing a year by being kept back. The former government endeavoured to forge a national curriculum, but in a federation it is always difficult to get everyone to agree. The situation seemed to be that the states agreed in principle that there ought to be a national curriculum but felt that their curriculum was the best curriculum and should be the one adopted right across the nation. The Labor Party was not particularly cooperative at state level when we were in government in helping to bring about a national curriculum and I am hopeful that the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 might break that logjam and move the debate forward because, let us face it, the education of our young people is far too important to be a matter of party politics. One of the legacies of the former government will be that we brought about for more Australian families the economic opportunity this to choose the school and education that is most suited to their children. In Australia, we have always had non-government schools and government schools and parents have had a legal right to be able to choose the school that is best for their individual children. But, given the cost of some private schools, many parents do not have that economic choice. What the former HowardCostello government did was to bring within the economic reach of so many more people the opportunity to choose either a government education or a non-government education-a Catholic education or other independent school education. It is really good that people are able to choose the right school for their children. On the Sunshine Coast-which, Mr Speaker, you would be aware is the most desirable part of Australia in which to livewe have a range of government and nongovernment schools. I must say that we have good government schools and good nongovernment schools. I do not think we really have a bad school of any sort on the Sunshine Coast. Parents are able to vote with their feet and choose the education which is right for their children, and that is fair and appropriate in a democracy in 2008. I mentioned before that there are substantial differences in the educational curriculum and programs in the various states. I think it is just so vital that we put aside all of the differences of the past and that we move forward with this national curriculum. It may well be that in 1901, when the colonies federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia, people were not terribly mobile. People were born in a particular part of Australia and for generations their families lived in that part of Australia. But increasingly we are part of a global village; people are moving to countries throughout the world. And, more and more, it is common for people to move from one state or territory to another state or territory, and it only fair and reasonable that their children should not be disadvantaged as a result of what is in many cases quite a natural move from one part of this country to another. Often parents who move from one jurisdiction to another do have the dilemma of a child having to go up to the next grade or go down to the previous one, and it really is unfortunate that so often their children are disadvantaged. And, when the parents move back to where they came from, as often happens, they again have that dilemma to consider. This bill creates a new government body, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, that has among its tasks the development of a common curriculum across all of the states, which will hopefully put to an end once and for all the situation where children in different states receive different educational programs. This body will also be responsible for the administration and collation of data at a nationwide level as well as setting achievement standards for students, collating and publishing comparative data on schools, providing resources and support for the teaching profession and so on. The idea of a national curriculum is of course, as I mentioned before, something that the previous government initiated. I just want to digress briefly, Mr Speaker-not in a way that will incur your wrath-to place on record my admiration for the teaching profession and my regret that teachers do not seem to be remunerated anywhere near the level they should be remunerated at given the important role that they play in helping to create productive young Australians. In my own family, I have two brothers-in-law, Mr Jon Hall and Mr Michael Hall, who did various things until their early 30s, when they elected to do is teacher training. One has just graduated. This is very important, because it is also vital that we try to encourage more men into teaching, particularly into primary school teaching. With so many families, sadly, confronting family breakdown, often there is the absence of a male role model. If we could encourage more men into teaching, that would be very desirable. I know that that is a view that is shared by both sides of politics. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for your indulgence in allowing me to place on the record my admiration for teachers and the fact that I believe that efforts should be made by governments around the country to encourage more men to go into teaching. The national curriculum aims to bring all students in line in a number of key educational streams: English, mathematics, history and science. This one, common curriculum will help do away with the problems of measuring the relative success and achievements of the states. All of us know about these national testing arrangements and how difficult it is at times to compare results in one part of Australia with results in another. suppose some might suggest that a national curriculum is one step away from a federal system insofar as we are removing from the individual states the opportunity to determine curricula within that particular state. However, as time goes on we increasingly appreciate it is important to have the same rules right across the nation, and I do not see that anyone could seriously suggest that a national education curriculum would sound the death knell for the Federation. It ought to be recognised, however, that the national curriculum will shift the responsibility for educational programs away from each of the states and onto a central body. The establishment of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority will also ensure that data is generated that will have relevance and value for all states. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, this bill does enjoy-as do many other bills debated in the parliament-the support of both sides of the House, but there are some concerns on the part of the opposition that there is no requirement that there be anyone with actual teaching experience on the board of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority or involved in the process of drafting the national curriculum. I would just ask the minister that when she is making appointments she look very closely at the need for there to be people with actual teaching experience. It is important that those who understand what it is like to be in a classroom, what it is like to teach an existing curriculum, have input into what will be the national curriculum right across the country. Such a person, who has in fact had experience at the coalface, would be eminently suitable for working out what changes ought to be made, what ought to be adopted and, indeed, what ought to be rejected for the national curriculum. There is also concern about the requireI ment for schools to provide information-to be collected and used in the creation of the curriculum, the drafting of policy and the collating and the processing of data and statistics-including information relating to funding sources. It would certainly be wrong, and I believe most honourable members would accept this, for a school that works hard to generate additional funding to be penalised when it came to the allocation of government funds. There is also concern in the private school sector that they are in fact being coerced into this national curriculum without actually knowing what it will include. I would like to commend to the House an editorial on page 20 of the West Australian of 20 November 2008 which is headlined ‘Schools are entitled to resist coercion'. It says: Private schools are perfectly entitled to resist the bullying demand made on them by the Rudd Government to sign up to its so-called education revolution until they know its detail. By making acceptance of the proposed national curriculum a condition of $28 billion in grants for such schools, the Government has shown its ideological hostility to them. Details of the national curriculum are still being worked out and private schools do not know what they are being told to accept and how it would affect what they taught and how. The Government should stop this coercion and accept that schools are entitled to know what's in the curriculum before they agree to it. I certainly support that editorial and I consider that there ought to be some flexibility to preserve the diversity we have in the educational marketplace. In summing up, it is absolutely true that the creation of a national curriculum for schools Australia-wide is a positive move. It will have enormous advantages. The former Liberal-National government had the foresight to initiate the process and create the move towards a standard curriculum. This bill introduces the body responsible for that curriculum and I am very pleased to commend this bill to the chamber.  Could I just correct the record on something the member for Fisher said earlier: while the Sunshine Coast is a wonderful place to visit, obviously the electorate of Moreton is the best place in Australia to live. But I do thank him for his contribution. I also mention the earlier contribution by the member for Forde, especially the spotlight he put on to TAFE and higher education. My background is in teaching in high schools, so it was great to hear his comments about TAFE and higher education. My background is in teaching English, geography, history, religion and even science. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 does signal a new era in Australia's education system. For those listening who have a thesaurus in front of them, another word for a new era is a revolution. The Macquarie Dictionary defines ‘revolution' as ‘a complete or marked change in something' and that is certainly what we are seeing here today. The education revolution by the Rudd government is about raising the quality of teaching in our schools, it is about ensuring that all students, especially those in disadvantaged areas, benefit from schooling and it is about improving transparency in, and the accountability of, all our schools. There is agreement on all sides of the House that quality education is a basic right for all children. Only a fool would argue otherwise. Thankfully, the class wars and arguments about funding for religious schools and the like are long over. All children deserve access to the same education opportunities regardless of their parents' bank balance, where they live or their faith. Education provides young people with the tools and know-how to enter adulthood, succeed in life and then contribute to society. Next Sunday, 30 November, will be exactly 11 years since I taught in public and private schools, where I taught for 11 years. I also worked as an organiser with the Queensland Independent Education Union for five years and since being elected I have visited many schools in my electorate. I do know a lot about schools and spend a lot of time in schools. I spend a lot of my time teaching civic lessons, and as a former teacher it is great to go into schools now, teach a lesson and not have to mark anything. It is a great way to maintain my love of teaching. I also participate in tuckshop duties throughout my electorate. When it comes to curriculum I am not as experienced as many others, but I have found in my dealings with our education system that on the whole it is very effective and our schools are places of great learning and great opportunity. Certainly, if we look around this side of the House, there are many people that only got their break in life not because of their parents' bank balances but because of the education provided to them by the state or private systems. The overwhelming majority of students are performing at a high level in our schools, and our teachers and the rest of the staff in schools, parents and other volunteers work very hard to make that happen. Nevertheless, the reality is that there are still children who are left behind, who struggle to rise above their circumstances and complete their education on par with their peers. This tells us that more can be done to ensure a quality education for all and to ensure that no child is left behind. This bill ensure, for the first time in the 107 years that the federated states of Australia have existed, that we have a national curriculum. It follows the historic COAG agreement last month to establish the new national education authority. The horse-and-buggy approach that applied at the time of Federation is over. It reminds me of the poem by Judith Wright, Bullocky. Judith Wright was a muchloved poet in Australia. I think she was born in Sydney but, being a Queenslander, I note that she spent much of her formative years in Brisbane and I think her first book of poetry was actually published while she worked at my alma mater, the University of Queensland. Much of her poetry was written when she lived at Mount Tamborine in Queensland, and I think she was even a founding member and President of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland. I note that shortly before she died Judith Wright marched for reconciliation here in Canberra as an 85-year-old-she must have lived in this vicinity. She was certainly a passionate character, as well as a great poet. I will read a part of Bullocky that indicates how much things have changed-this was from someone who was born in 1915: Grass is across the wagon-tracks, and plough strikes bone across the grass, and vineyards cover all the slopes where the dead teams were used to pass. O vine, grow close upon that bone and hold it with your rooted hand. The prophet Moses feeds the grape, and fruitful is the Promised Land. The days of Bullocky are long over and the days of the horse and buggy are long gone. We are now in the digital age and teaching has changed significantly. Back when bullockies were around teachers had a completely different role. They were called the will sage on the stage. They had all the knowledge and they tested people's ability to retain that knowledge. It was almost like they flipped their students heads back and poured knowledge into the students. Now teaching has changed significantly. Even in the 11 years since I taught, instead of being the sage on the stage teachers are much more like a guide on the side helping people learn through the internet and the like. I am sure that all Australians are pleased to see their state and federal governments working together and getting on with the job to improve the quality of education around the country. The people who would especially appreciate it are the 80,000 students or more who move interstate each and every year. Imagine that-80,000 people. It would be like moving every single person in Toowoomba every year. Those people will benefit from us having a national curriculum. It has been too long coming. State and territory governments will also benefit from reduced duplication and improved efficiency in education governance. The taxpayer dollar will obviously travel further and there will be many other efficiencies that come with having a national body. As its name suggests, the authority will develop and implement the national curriculum and establish a framework for assessing and reporting student and school performance. The authority will drive common national priorities in education from kindergarten through to year 12. Its first order of business will be to revamp the important subjects of English, mathematics, science and history. Whilst I taught science for one year, my passion has always been English. I gained a bit of notoriety recently for one of the books that I have written, but there is one benefit that comes from having my name known for writing. That is, people that I did not know will now come and talk about literature with me. At touch football in the morning, where there are all sorts of people from different political parties, it is almost like there is now a secret handshake. They will come up and talk about literature even though it is not something that they would normally do publicly. It is great to have added this silver ing to my writing endeavours. It is not for governments to impress their own agenda and ideology on a national curriculum. That is why the authority will be established as an independent statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. We saw during the Howard-Costello reign how governments can try to tinker with our schools. This is a very dangerous precedent. I think it is best that we leave education and the curriculum to the educators, not to governments and their political agendas. The independent statutory authority will ensure that there is fierce independence from the Commonwealth and appropriate performance and financial accountability to the state and territory education ministers. The national curriculum will be available from January 2011 and all schools will be required to sign up to it by 2012. A national curriculum will drive substantial improvements in our children's education. It will put an end to the confusion experienced by students who move interstate and have to deal with changing subject matter. They would mainly be New South Wales people and Victorians coming to beautiful Queensland, but that is our contribution to the rest of the Commonwealth! The national curriculum will also ensure that all students, no matter where they are, are learning similar material-as I said, there are over 80,000 students a year who move between school systems. It will also help teachers by giving them a clear idea about what is to be covered, but with the flexibility to adapt the curriculum to local context. To paraphrase former shadow minister Bourke on the national curriculum, we will have a national dish but it will still have local flavours. There will be a national curriculum but around the country we will be able to have distinct local flavours. As a prac student linwhen I was studying teaching, everyone in geography studied the wheat and sheep belt on the Darling Downs. I do not want to upset the agriculture minister and I am not taking anything away from agricultural endeavours like this, but the people on the Darling Downs obviously might not want to study the wheat and sheep belt on the Darling Downs. They might want to learn about something else, such as Victorian agricultural endeavours or the like. It is important that we maintain the national dish but have the local flavours so that schools can adapt to their environment when deciding what people need to learn. The national curriculum will also give parents a better idea about what their children should be learning at each stage of their education and about the skills that they should be acquiring. It will do this by developing a national assessments program and managing data relating to schools and comparative school performance. For the first time, this will give parents and school communities throughout Australia a clearer picture about how their local school is performing. I stress that much of this data is already available, especially in my local state schools. Anyone moving around Australia can go on the web and look and see much of this data, especially in state schools, although not necessarily for private schools. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, if she has the data, why can't we trust parents to also access this data? There should be no presumption that parents, the people who are most responsible for and care about these children, should not have access to the data about how their school is performing. The national assessment and reporting framework will also enable governments to identify where resources are needed to improve school performance. For the first time, we will be able to make informed decisions about comparable school achievements and target resources to schools that need it most. As well as leading to improved performance across the board, these new reporting measures will ensure greater transparency and lift public confidence in education spending. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill is not about naming and shaming underperforming schools. I know this is a concern raised by many teachers-certainly in my electorateand by many of the teacher unions, but it is not about naming and shaming underperforming schools, and neither is it about league tables or grading schools. However, it is about ensuring that no student is left behind. It is about supporting our teachers, teacher aides and all the other support staff, school volunteers and parents who slog their guts out to ensure that our kids get a quality education. It is about ensuring that schools can overcome disadvantage to give their students the best possible education. The authority will also provide resources and assisbillion tance to teachers and schools to help them improve school performance. As I mentioned earlier, I spent five years as a union organiser-a union thug, I guess I would be called-in the private schools, those radical workplaces like the Catholic schools, grammar schools, Christian schools et cetera. In that role I had a lot to do with teachers who also happened to be union members, from both the state school system and the private school system. My union, the Independent Education Union, looked after all schools that were not state schools. What many people do not realise when they hear the word ‘union' is how much these unions devote their resources to lifting the professional standards of teaching. So many people are passionate about their union because they look after professional standards, and that is what many people opposite would not realise. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority is a key part of the Rudd government's education revolution. Firstly, this revolution will see a half-billion dollar investment in early childhood preliteracy and prenumeracy. Whereas the damage was done by the time they got to me in high school, now we will be investing the money where the dollar will go furthest. Secondly, we will have HECS halved for those who are studying maths and science at university and then halved again if they choose to pursue a career teaching or working in maths and science. As a former English teacher I commend this initiative, and certainly maths and our science subjects are good for commerce and the economy, but I would stress that English teachers provide another role, which is that we nourish the soul, and that makes for a much healthier community. Thirdly, we will have a new National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy. Fourthly, there will be a $2.4 education tax refund. That fantastic policy puts the focus back on parents looking after their kids. It puts education in the spotlight, and it has certainly been very well received by the parents of primary and secondary school students in my electorate of Moreton. Fifthly, the Rudd government will bring in a $1.2 billion digital education revolution to give every year 9 to 12 student in Australia access to a computer. Sixthly, there will be a $30 million boost to education for remote Indigenous children, including a trial linking family and welfare payments to school attendance. These are great initiatives. These six initiatives are not just ideas that the Rudd government has run up the flagpole; they are actual policies that will help kids in classrooms, some of them right now, where those computers are already on desks in many schools around Australia. We have moved from talk to chalk, or nowadays, I suppose, to be a bit more modern, we have moved from speak to squeak-that is, with whiteboards. This side of the House has a real commitment to education, whereas the other side of the House, the Liberal Party and the National Party, seems to have a fundamentally different approach to education. I guess I would say as a former teacher that, if we approached those opposite as teachers, they would only teach to the top of the class. That is very rewarding and fantastic, especially for the people in the top of the class, but fortunately there is also a great middle and occasionally a tail, and good teachers try to bring the whole class forward. If I look back over the last 11½ years and look for the great educational ideas that came out of those opposite, what ideas did they run up the flagpole? I would commend one: the chaplains initiative, which is certainly one that has led to the great chaplains whom I have met in my electorate. I do commend those opposite for that initiative. No. 2 is some aspects of the Investing in Our Schools Program. If they had maintained funding for the states properly then it would not have been necessary, but there are some aspects of that. The third one is flagpoles. That was a great initiathe tive. Fantastic! In terms of that education revolution, you have flagpoles. That is fantastic! But, thankfully, this side of the House does have a much deeper commitment to education. So in closing I want to congratulate the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and all the state and territory governments for making student outcomes the top priority, rather than just flagpoles. I commend the bill to the House and look forward to seeing the national curriculum rolled out in schools from 2011.",23
6,Dr STONE,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I rise to support this Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008. It further evolves the work which the coalition did and has done over a great many years, and it further evolves the whole educational structure and form in Australia over the last 100 or so years since Federation. Of course, I am the member for Murray, and as the name suggests we are on the border of two states, Victoria and New South Wales, with the Murray River running along-not running so hard at the moment, but certainly separating us from our fellows interstate. So for us the issue of a national curriculum is of critical concern. We have what we call twin commuun- nities right along the Murray, like EchucaMoama, Yarrawonga-Mulwala and Kerang and other communities across the river, where students and families readily move. There are some 80,000 school-age students moving interstate each year right across Australia, and it has long been a problem with different rules about ages of students, commencing school, leaving school and curriculum content. The ways that school students can move and slot easily into similar class levels have been so problematic that some children have really been handicapped because they have had to be moved interstate. That is quite clearly a nonsense in a country like ours, where mobility has always been way for families generation after generation. In regard to my own background, I have spent a lot of years of my professional life developing curriculum for schools, particularly in secondary schools, and in particular relation to Australia's social history and race relations. I spent a lot of time training teachers, too, particularly in early childhood education. We still have a very long way to go in Australia. This bill, as I say, is a further in the right direction; it is an evolution. not a revolution and it leaves a lot of work still undone. For example, there is no point having a national history curriculum if that curriculum is a dud or if it is so contentious that teachers refuse, in different parts of the system, to teach it, because the unions have had their way, saying you cannot talk about, for example, early pastoral history or our early evolution of labour law in this country. We have had a nonsense in Australia where ideologues have dominated curriculum development, dumbing down what is taught in schools to the point where, I have to say, I have employers absolutely amazed to find year 12 graduates-this is the final school year in Victoria-coming to them to take up an apprenticeship and they cannot read and write. They have been passed right through the system and have apparently attended school often enough but they do not have basic literacy or numeracy, they certainly have no knowledge whatsoever of Australia's history and their science background is simply non-existent. This is a great shame because these young men and women wanting to set out in their careers are stymied and handicapped because the school system has failed them. I think there is a real need to address excellence in education in a way which is not intimidating to teaching staff who themselves have often been poorly educated in teacher training. I will never forget being amazed to find a faculty of teacher training had to teach remedial English to their firstyear intake of teacher trainees. It is not the teachers' fault necessarily that the curriculum has been dumbed down but it is the teachers' fault when they simply give up too often and retreat from being energetic, enthusiastic, innovative teachers who do their very best for their students even though they themselves might have been deprived of a proper step framework in which to shape their own lesIt is sons or even deprived, initially, of decent teacher education back in their universities. In terms of where we go in the future with Australia's education, I am particularly concerned about early childhood education. Each state, as we know, still clings tenaciously to ownership of early childhood education. It varies from being compulsory to being absolutely not compulsory in a state like Victoria, with fees charged to parents and with volunteering of parents to help the preschool teacher almost the only means for that the preschool to raise money for toys and educational aids, to prepare milk and to cut up fruit for the children's morning teas. You have a nonsense in Victoria where early childhood only goes for a small slot in the morning-from, say, nine to 11 o'clock-so a working parent or couple has no chance of being able to drop off and collect their child in a two-hour slot. In an electorate like mine in Murray, which is in its seventh year of severe drought, where there is enormous poverty and financial distress across the electorate and where, of course, the piping of the water to Melbourne is going to be the last straw, permanently droughting that area, families have two options: they can find over $100 per term to send their child to preschool or they can keep their child in fully subsidised family day care where their threeor fouryear-old does not receive early childhood education and then misses out on that first year of education and, very significantly, in that early socialisation to a classroom milieu. They do not get the early preparation with their reading or with their colours and numbers work. But that is what is happening across my electorate of Murray in response to bad state government early childhood policy and poverty. Quite self-evidently, we need to have a national system of early childhood education as well which slots seamlessly into the earliest years of primary education and which is compulsory and free and which it is not, at the end of the day, accessible only to the ter off or those with a parent at home. That should not be the determinant of whether or not a child has early childhood education access. I am also concerned that a bill like thiswhich is, as I say, an important evolutionstill will not be addressing issues like poor teacher training and of course the poor motivation for some of our brightest and best to enter the teaching profession itself. That, too, needs a lot of serious thinking and a revolution, not just more evolution. We also have to address issues like singlesex classes for teenagers in our schools across Australia. We know that students do best in their teenage years when they can learn in girls classes and boys classes. They may be in the same school for other social interaction, sport and so on but certainly single-sex classes for the essential subjects of English, maths, science and history should be seriously contemplated and provisions made for them. We also have to make sure that there is lifelong learning and that there is adult education built into our sense of new purpose in relation to national curriculum, assessment and reporting frameworks. A lot of younger people, especially from rural and regional backgrounds, missed out on their education and were forced to leave school early. This particularly applies if they were Indigenous children. I am also concerned about how our new-look schools system is going to make it more possible for what may be classified as a mature age person re-entering the system, not necessarily at the TAFE level but even back in the secondary school system because often TAFE is not accessible in rural and regional areas either. As shadow minister for immigration I am concerned about our refugees. We have numbers of refugees who have no literacy bet- and numeracy background in their home languages and whose own education has been completely interrupted by war. I refer particularly to those from African countries, people like our Sierra Leoneans, our Sudanese, our Congolese. They come to Australia with a desperate need to be given urgent education so that they can take advantage of the opportunities for employment, social integration, and better enjoy the peace and tolerance offered in a nation as great as ours. Unfortunately, too often when our refugees arrive they are already older than the school system is ready to recognise for schooling. And too often we put these students into classes for English language learning which are not good enough, with no real assistance being offered, although it is recognised that they need to start from a very basic level and might need culturally appropriate learning in the first instance. I am also saddened about one of the changes that is being made to the citizenship test which the coalition introduced some time ago. This test will still be offered in English, which is the only sensible way to go, given that English language speaking is essential to take full advantage of and participate in our economy and our society. So I am very pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Evans, understood that it was essential to retain the citizenship test in English. What I am concerned about is the removal of the history component of the test questions that the coalition introduced. Any relationship or reference to history is to be dropped from the test, and I think that is a real shame. On the one hand we are saying that history is an important and essential part of the new national curriculum, but when it comes to our new citizens we are not expecting them to have any idea of how our democracy was formed, of how our governance arrangements work, of how we come to be at peace now-the history of how our fighting men and women participated in the world wars and are now participating in peacekeeping. None of that is to be tested in the new citizenship test. I wonder why not and I think it is a great shame. I would like to think that perhaps our new citizens will volunteer themselves to learn about Australian history and in that way will come to better understand the culture of our country. If new arrivals are of Asian background, for example, they may come to know how Australia has already had in its history, some 150 years ago, an enormous Asian population on the goldfields and so they are not entirely the newcomers in country facing for the first time Australian cultural experiences. I am very concerned that this government is still not addressing the problem of rural and regional students who are increasingly less able to take up any offers of tertiary education. In my electorate-which I have already explained is in the worse drought on record; we are up to our seventh yearfamilies have had to face the fact that they can hardly afford to put food on the table. I want to thank Heinz and their food factory in Echuca for donating, just two days ago, a huge volume of their food products and baby food to give to my farming families who are having trouble putting food on the table. I restate that the despair that is coming with the drought is exacerbated by the north-south pipeline which is to be built to take our remaining water to Melbourne, which has other options, and which will put them in drought permanently. One of the outcomes of this extreme economic distress in northern Victoria, once one of the most affluent agricultural regions in Australia, is that the number of school leavers taking up university offers or attending university has dropped by 50 per cent. This is extraordinarily serious. It means that the drought is not only causing the loss of thirdand fourth-generation investment in farm properties, it is destroying their futures and their chances of taking up agribusiness. If students cannot afford to take up university places, which typically require them to live away from home, in Melbourne, Bendigo or Wodonga, a lifelong deficit will result, caused by this government not understanding that we need more than just access to rent assistance or Austudy for rural school leavers. I have to tell you that the rural Liberal members in this House have been very seriously looking at a policy for a fund, which may not necessarily be based on means testing because the family farm asset this often knocks out the opportunity for these families to be specially supported. It will address how far rural, regional and remote students have to go to get their tertiary education and the costs that are needed for their accommodation, travel and communication to back home. Our policy would deliver them sufficient to live on so that they can take up offers of tertiary education. It is one of the tragedies of the economic decline in rural and regional Australia that there is a contraction in the number of rural students able to take up tertiary education. And I have to say the situation is not much better when it comes to apprenticeships or traineeships. This is an issue that is not addressed at all in this Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill, but I beg the government to turn their attention urgently to this problem. It is about investing in human capital. It is about being able to have our own skilled workforce developed here at home. Not only do we have this human tragedy of individuals not being able to develop their own personal full potential; the nation is missing potential of our human capital. We also have to look at what people do and not just what they say. Parents in their droves are walking away from state school systems at the moment and paying fees to have their children attend private schools. That has to be a loud warning siren for this government. Of course, independent schools or private schools-they are named differently in different states-will not come under their new reporting regime. These schools will be quite independent of the various moves that are being made to make sure that parents have information about the ranking of their schools and so on. I think it is important for this government to watch whether or not there will be an even further clamour for private school education when families look at data about their local state schools, which might show that they are having a bit of a struggle, and make their final decision to exit the system altogether. I want to commend the government for taking education seriously, as we did. Quite clearly we have a huge disparity in the performance of students and schools across the nation. We have a public disgrace in the form of the quality of schooling offered to many of our Indigenous communities, particularly in remoter areas. The school retention rates in those places and the fact that students cannot even speak, read or write in English, condemns them to unemployment and marginalises them for life. A lot has to be sheeted home to the Northern Territory government in particular, which has chronically neglected infrastructure investment in those remote Indigenous schools. The Northern Territory has also allowed the Commonwealth to pay their teaching staff through CDEP by allowing teachers' aidesIndigenous women, largely-to do the teaching in those schools even though those women often do not have any English lanout on the full guage facility. So I am afraid that, while this bill is a further evolution-and I commend it-there is a lot of work to be done. We have to have in Australia, world best education. We have to have education that looks our history in the face and teaches it accurately and fearlessly so that our multicultural, rural and urban populations can understand where we have come from and, therefore, the potential for where we can go. Our English, maths and science teaching, as we know, has to be so much better. We are in despair about our paucity of maths and science achievements across the board. We have some stars in very schools but across the board our maths and science teaching leaves an enormous amount to be desired. As I began by saying, too many employers are shocked at the poor English language understanding and the ability to communicate effectively or even to use effective grammar, in students who have just completed 13 years of formal education. So I support this bill but there is a lot more work to be done. I request this government to address those issues that I outlined as outstanding and very serious when it comes to equality of opportunity for education in this country.",30
7,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"Before I call the member for Lyons, I notice that we have, in the gallery, a school visiting Parliament House. I am sure they would have listened with great interest to the debate. I rather feel that it may even be a school from my electorate, the South Burnett College. I can see that it is the South Burnett College; I could not join them for hospitality.",34
8,Mr ADAMS,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"It is a shame that the previous speaker is leaving the chamber. I was going to say that that side of the House never understands education very well. Blaming teachers, teachers unions and state governments is not the solution to finding the answers. Of course the employers that the previous speaker spoke about now demand a higher standard of literacy and numeracy. There are higher standards because the world needs higher skills, and our workforce needs to meet those same standards. So, with regard to people who have literacy and numeracy issues, there are not the holes that there used to be for people in community and in our country. So we do need to work harder-I agree with the member for Murray, and she did get the issue about refugees spot on. We need to make sure that we have a learning capacity for those people who come to our country. Adult education and lifelong learning need to be high on our agenda. The purpose of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 is to establish the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA. ACARA will be an independent statutory authority. It will manage the creation and implementation of the national curriculum, national student assessment and reporting of school education outcomes. Specific functions, as provided in section 6 of the bill, will include developing and administering a national school curriculum, including content of the curriculum and achievement standards for school subjects as specified in its charter; developing and administering national assessments; collecting, managing and analysing student assessment data and other data relating to schools and comparative school performance; facilitating information-sharing arrangements between Australian and state and territory government bodies in relation to the collection, management and analysis of school data; publishing information relating to school education, including comparative school performance; providing school curriculum resource services, educational research services and other related services; and providing information, resources, support and guidance for the teaching profession. ACARA goes back a long way. It is the accumulation of a long period of policy debate which dates back to the eighties. Yesterday John Dawkins, a previous Treasurer and member for Fremantle, was in the gallery here and was acknowledged by the House this and the Speaker. When he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training he called for a common curriculum framework that would set out the major areas of knowledge and the most appropriate mix of skills and experiences for students in all their years of schooling. So it has been a long time to get this bill into the House. Education is so important to the development of a nation. It cannot be left to the individual states and departments to set the syllabus for each state, as they may all be different. With the population being so mobile in today's world, children from one state can often end up in another state, either in front or behind in their education pathway. There has been much discussion about the way subjects are taught and about how there must be flexibility in schools, catering for different groups of students to achieve these standards in different ways. I think it is perfectly possible to maintain flexibility while keeping to standards of education that reflect the needs of the nation. Other concerns include the system of reporting to parents, in which schools are required to provide parents with their children's national literacy and numeracy test results against national benchmarks, showing how they are rated relative to their peer group in their school. I do not believe this is for purposes other than for parents to see how their child is progressing and as an early warning system to alert the school when a child is falling behind and needs some special attention. For too long, children managed to get all the way through the education system without meeting any benchmarks, because they were not identified. If they manage to get through primary and secondary school, they then have difficulty in picking up enough skills for work purposes. As the current Minister for Education and Deputy Prime Minister said: … to lift performance and direct new resources to where they will make most difference, we need unprecedented rigour and openness in the collection and publication of schools data. We also need to ensure that we have a basis for fair, consistent and accurate analysis of how different schools are doing. This allows resources to flow to those schools that need the most assistance. Rupert Murdoch, in the recent Boyer lectures, put his finger fairly and squarely-sadly, I believe-on our problem. We need to set high standards for our students, teachers and schools. We pride ourselves on our passion for equity. But, as Murdoch says: … it is getting harder and harder to square Australian pride in equality with the realities of the Australian system of public education. While there has been some criticism of the outlaying of computers to schools, it allows students to access the tools of the 21st century to undertake their work now. But this should not be seen as the only thing they learn. Basic literacy and numeracy are vital to making the tool work properly for the student. Murdoch says: … the best path to success is through an education that will allow us to fulfill our potential. begins by setting high expectations, adhering to real standards, and ensuring that when you do leave school, you leave with the tools that will help you get ahead in life. My interest, too, has been in the early learning years which, in my mind, are the most critical in the learning processes. They can set the foundations for the rest of life learning. I have been following the work of Professor Fraser Mustard, who has recently been working in South Australia. He said in his report Investing in the early years: closing the gap between what we know and what we do: To achieve reasonable equity in the competence, capabilities, coping skills, health and well-being of populations will require societies to apply the new understanding of how experience in the early years of life affects the development of the brain and related biological pathways that set trajectories that affect health (physical and mental), learning, and behaviour throughout the life cycle and can contribute to social and economic inequities and violence in societies. At a seminar some years ago, held here in Parliament House, Professor Mustard spoke of education delivery being like a river. The kids who manage the scheme well swim strongly up the middle of the river. The kids who are finding school difficult for various reasons are clinging to the bank and progressing very slowly while some of them are slipping off the bank and some of them are treading water. Some of them get swept backwards, never to catch up to where the cycle should be. Professor Mustard was attempting to show us that children learn at different levels and at different rates and that our scheme is geared very much for the ones that cope the best, the strong swimmers. Although it is relatively easy to measure these groups, it becomes more complex when one is trying to measure the other groups, as so many different factors come into play for all of them. These factors include social and That economic background, health and well-being, an ability to mix and all sorts of other factors. So, whatever scheme we put in place for assessment of students around the country, there needs to be some ability to check in a positive way how to keep children encouraged to continue learning, even if they are not at the front of the line. It may require programs that reflect the natural abilities of individual students, including hands-on type abilities as well as academic varieties. Both are equally valid in the workplace. Often it is more a question of approach, of how to deal with an individual's capacity to take in information. Sometimes this requires innovative ways to stimulate the student. Going back to Murdoch's Boyer lecture on education, he points this out in a different sort of way by explaining: Talent and skills and judgment are part of what economists call human capital. Human capital is a broad term. It includes formal skills-for example, a degree in computer science or the ability speak a foreign language. But human capital is much more than this. It also includes such things as good work habits, the judgment that comes from experience, a sense of creativity, a curiosity about the world, and the ability to think for self. Free societies succeed because the people who have these skills are free to use them to advance themselves, their enterprises, and society. These are not easily taught, but still part of the learning process and need to be included in any program of learning. I know that many teachers have concerns about the changes that are taking place in education. In my own area, some are very concerned with the constant reporting changes. In Tasmania there have been some unfortunate circumstances in that area and they are rebelling in various ways. It is hard to incorporate change while you are busily trying to achieve the best you can in the present system with the tools that you have in your school. But life is changing very fast and so what we know now is not what we might need to know in the future. All we can really do is to open the pathways to change to make it as easy as possible. We need to provide schools with the tools, with the spaces and with the best teachers possible to ensure that our children can keep up with the pace of change. This bill provides the broad framework within which the development of the national curriculum, the collection and analysis of student assessment data and the reporting of school performance will occur. As is noted in accompanying papers to this bill, there is considerable work to be done not only in developing and implementing the national curriculum and determining the methodology for collecting, reporting and comparing student and school performance but also in achieving stakeholder consensus about these matters. Still remaining and underpinning the success of the goals towards which the bill's main measures are directed-that of raising to the educational performance of all students regardless of where they are located and their socio-economic background-are the critical issues of teacher supply and teacher quality. one- It is well accepted, and supported by research, that teacher quality is the paramount factor influencing student outcomes. Typical of this research is that conducted by Michael Barber, former adviser to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. His research into why the world's best-performing school systems outdo other school systems concluded that the three most important factors were getting the right people to become teachers, developing them into effective instructors and ensuring that they deliver consistently for every child. Ultimately, ‘the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers'. This is a big ask in any job description, but the future of our children depends on the effectiveness of their teachers and we have to value them as we have valued them in the past. There are going to be opportunities to contribute further to this debate as it proceeds, but from my point of view in Lyons we have suffered from the state's way in the past of moving teachers around and saying that teachers are rewarded when they have done their time in the country by going back to city schools. This has to become a thing of the past now. Teachers must become part of their communities, live in their communities and be the role model for their charges. Pay, conditions and promotions of teachers should reflect the greater importance of our rural and regional educational facilities and they should be on a par with their city counterparts. I want to see teachers clamouring to go into the country and be part of the development of regional areas, because the rewards both financially and emotionally are so much greater. Perhaps it is wishful thinking, but with this electronic age it is possible to participate in all those educational upgrading processes while living in more isolated areas. Other professions are doing it. Why not the teachers? Tertiary education should not mean a big upheaval for families at often difficult times. It should be part of post-school learning and we should use the underutilised school infrastructure to provide it. It might mean some time changes, but we are in a new world and we should face those changes. I also believe that we should find ways of bringing the work of many academics, education thinkers and writers do together and have a way to make that easily accessible for classroom teachers. There seems to have been very good work done over many years which never really gets down to where it can influence and help teachers improve their own teaching opportunities. There is also the issue of young teachers starting their early teaching life. They need time to reflect and time to observe other teachers in the process. They need to have mentors work with them to assist the learning process. Not having this is not only unfair on those younger teachers whom we put into the schools but unfair on some students as well. There are many things to do, but the Minister for Education and the Labor government have gone on and succeeded. I have spent some 15 or 16 years now in this House, and I have heard conservative ministers for education blame teachers, state governments and everybody else and never really achieve anything in tackling some of the real problems. This bill does go towards finding some of the answers. It sets national goals and performance standards. As the Acting Prime Minister said about bringing in rigour, it is rigour that will drive a better education system. That has to be done fairly and decently, and I am sure that we can do that. I have used some lengthy quotes in my speech. I thank the Parliamentary Library for their assistance. This is a very complex subject and requires a lot of consideration. It is probably one of the most important parts of our society. Education gives people great opportunities. I commend the bill to the House.",34
9,Mrs HULL,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I rise to speak on the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008. I concur with the previous speaker in the debate, the member for Lyons, that this is a very complex bill. It affects students currently in the Australian education systems, both public and private, and also the future of all of our children-and, indeed, our parents and grandparents. Anybody who is interested in education would most certainly be interested in this bill. I have discovered that enormous numbers of people are interested in the bill, and there has been a campaign of continual letter writing by a variety of people that has concentrated on the need to fund public education in a more significant way. I am a strong supporter of the public education system. I educated my children in the public education system, as have been my grandchildren, and I was educated in the public education system myself. Public education is of enormous concern to me, and the way it is funded, both by the states and by the Commonwealth, has always been one of my priorities. I will run through some of the areas that I consider have been abandoned by this bill and where it fails miserably the people I represent in the Riverina. I go first to the issue of the axing of the Investing in Our Schools Program. The Investing in Our Schools Program was hard fought for by backbenchers in the previous government. To their credit, the former Minister for Education, Science and Training and the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, listened to their backbenchers to understand the issues that were confronting the mums and dads in the P&Cs and the school communities across our region. It was then that the Investing in Our Schools Program was established, and it was enormously successful. In fact, the Investing in Our Schools Program delivered over $11 million to public education and about $1.2 million to private education in my electorate of Riverina. This was an enormously popular program-so popular that I note that the Labor members who opposed it when the previous government implemented it are now gung-ho to go out into their electorates, have their names put on the plaques and take all the credit for the money that is being delivered into schools. They stand in front of you and you think about all the hard work that you have put in as the local member with the school community and the P&Cs. When the Howard government brought in the program, we applied for much needed funding, which was a process of working cooperatively with teachers, headmasters, P&Cs and community leaders-and that funding was delivered. The program was, of course, opposed by the current government, formerly the opposition. But, as I said, now they take great delight in talking about ‘their funding' that has delivered ‘these benefits' to communities. In speaking on this bill in the House today I want to highlight what I believe are its deficiencies. The deficiencies include the fact that the Investing in our Schools Program has been abolished. I have had contact with many in the public education system, including the teachers, and their complaints about this bill have been extremely scathing. In the past, they launched scathing attacks on the Howard government, the role that I played as a member of the coalition in the Howard government years and the way in which we handled education, but they have now concluded their attacks on the former minister. With the new government, educators believe they have been promised much and have been delivered little. They thought that there would be a change in focus and direction from a new Labor government. They said that they went out in droves to man the polling booths in the last election in order that there could be a change of government and of education policy. But the complaints that I am getting now are that there is no difference between the policies of the past government and those of the current government. These are legitimate concerns that have been raised with me and that I have raised with the current Minister for Education. Mr Sidebottom-Have you had a look at the bill? You'll discuss the bill, will you?",38
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,Order! The member for Riverina has the call and she is addressing the bill very eloquently.,39
11,Mrs HULL,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I have had numerous meetings. I am certainly not going to mention the name of the person who came into see me in case he would be dealt a savage blow for commenting as he has. I have recently met with this local teacher, who has discussed various issues in relation to education, and I believe that the teacher has communicated his thoughts and made some very valid points. I want to pass these on to the minister. The teacher felt that there is a funding ity required for public education, and I am certainly always in support of that. The teacher went on to say that it is not an education revolution if Australia copies a failing system and that the government needs to look at systems that are actually working. The teacher identified areas such as Finland. He said that the government needed to remove high-stakes tests, school comparisons, performance based pay and the view that testing equals achievement. In addition, the teacher said that he had worked in the UK system, which has a national curriculum, and this meant no freedom for individuality. He felt that structuring time is counterproductive and students only apply themselves to their interests. He believed that curricula needed to have space to move to accommodate various issues. These are the kinds of disturbing comments that we had apportioned to us in our terms in government, but it is interesting to note that the prospect of this education revolution brought out teachers en masse to support the election of a new government. Now the very same people who were standing handing out pamphlets against me at polling booths are in my office complaining that the revolution simply did not happen. I find it ironic and I believe it is worthwhile to point that out in relation to this bill, which is relevant to the issues that the teachers have raised. I will go back to the coalition's Investing in Our Schools Program that has been removed in order to accommodate this bill. In order to accommodate the ideas within this bill, some very good policy was destroyed for no other reason than political gain and political point-scoring, with no thought given as to how important this program was. It will lapse on 31 December this year, and I am sure that in the meantime dozens of Labor parMPs and senators will be running around electorates right across Australia taking enormous credit for the enormous amounts of money that have been delivered in both public and private schools for these very important projects like air conditioning, shade and grass for kids to be able to play on rather than dusty bowls and grounds. Due to the funding from the Investing in Our Schools Program that is still current until 31 December 2008, this coming summer there will be more schools in my electorate of Riverina where, in 45 degree heat, the children will have the comfort of air conditioning and shadecloths to do their learning. In addition, they will have their covered outdoor learning areas to protect them from the skin cancers and the problems that the sun presents across the Riverina, and when it rains they will collect the water that will run off the roofs of those covered outdoor learning areas into the drains down into tanks that we got from the community water grants. It was such a boost to these communities because, before this, the P&C mums and dads had to fund this. In my electorate, South Wagga Public School had been trying to save for their covered outdoor learning area for around 30 years, and I think they had around $30,000 in their account. They ended up with $150,000 very for their covered outdoor learning area and water tanks from the community water grants, and they thought it was Christmas. So I think that the minister has erred most particularly in ensuring that she vetoed what was an absolutely sensational program, no matter who brought it in. I believe that if anyone, whether government or opposition, has a good idea then it is worthy of support. There are issues that I would like to raise in reference to the public education system. In the last election it was my personal mission to fight for added resources, particularly for public education for the education and advancement of disabled students in the disability sector. It is a fact that we have increasing disabilities in Australia. With the emergence of new technology, the increasing ability to save lives and the ability to save babies at 20 and 21 weeks of gestation who have ongoing issues in the future, we will continue to have an emergence of a variety of special needs in the education system. Quite rightly, mums and dads, families and students want to enter into mainstream education. When they enter into mainstream education, at times private schools have the option of accepting or rejecting a person with special needs if they do not have the resources to offer that child their full potential in learning. In the public education system that is simply not doable. Every child is accepted and every school should have the role of accepting children and providing them with an education in all its forms. I am terribly concerned that in the public education system there are not the resources or the money available to educate our students with special needs to their full potential. That is an indictment of our society because that is picking and choosing. I believe that parents, students and families, teachers and headmasters deserve better attention to the way in which they inevitably have to deal with these issues when they are under-resourced. I cannot see anything in this bill that includes an education revolution for all Australian students, including those with disabilities. I cannot see anything in this bill that gives intent for all Australian children, because if that were the case you would have clearly identified and put in place a program of funding that enables resources to be applied for children with special needs. Not only do the children with special needs deserve this program but every child deserves this program. What we have now is teachers struggling with children with special needs and spending the majority of their time trying to fulfil their obligation and role, because they have a need and a desire to have all of their students reaching their potential. The danger of having no resources-and this is certainly not the fault of teachers, schools or children with special needs-is that the other children are left to fend and manage for themselves. If there were a true intention to have an education revolution, the revolution would recognise students with special needs and succinctly hive out money to ensure that their full potential is able to be reached and enhanced through their education programs. It is proven that, through early intervention in schools, students with special needs go on to achieve great things in their community. It is an absolute indictment that this bill does not include many of Australia's children who are also entitled to have an education. I will go on to talk about the issues regarding the Australian history unit, that have been raised with respect to the bill. I believe that there has to be an option for Australian history to be taught. When I was at school I knew nothing about Australian history except for the fact that Captain Cook landed. I knew all about American history, I knew all about American presidents, but Australian history was not taught in my little Guyra Central School. I really feel that that diminished my ability to understand the issues about Australia. We all know that history repeats itself, as we see right now in many of the things that are happening across Australia. I think that we need to ensure that there is a separate unit of Australian history, particularly the history since Federation in 1901. There certainly must be an identified and complete unit so that all Australians can be proud of their history, can recognise their history and are accomplished to speak about our history and nation building when they represent this country, or at any given time, so that they understand their place and the way Australia has been shaped and formed. I am quite concerned about any move away from the central focus of Australian history. We need to have an intelligent balance between both our Indigenous heritage and the history of our European settlement. I hope that the history curriculum will encourage this to continue. I feel it is very important to maintain the history unit and ensure that it is ramped up rather than dumbed down. As we move into our education revolution, which is part of the bill, we talk about the rolling out of computers. I am in New South Wales. New South Wales has pulled out of the computer rollout. Right from the beginning, during the election campaign, school principals were saying, ‘This simply can't work because we don't have the resources for the on-costs.' The capital rollout was going to be the least expensive part; it is the on-costs that they were going to be left with. It was again going to be mums, dads and principals who were left to pick up the shortfall. I cannot see how this revolution has revealed anything other than failure. (Time expired)",39
12,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I just remind the member for Riverina of two things. She is leaving the chamber. That is bad manners. I listened to her as much as I could. Firstly, the Investing in Our Schools Program, as she well knows, was terminated in public by the former Prime Minister in 2007 and was not part of the coalition's education or financial policy. Secondly, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 is not a financial bill. This bill is for the tion of a new education authority. If she had actually read the bill and then discussed it for the public record and for her electors in Riverina, we might have been a bit more enlightened. In my humble way, I will try to enlighten the House on this very important piece of legislation. This legislation, like most legislation in this House, is a direct result of an election commitment given by the Labor government. For the record, on 2 October 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, made a very important decision. That was to establish a national education authority. The bill that we are discussing, which the member for Riverina totally ignored, gives effect to this historic recommendation. The new National Education Authority will bring together for the first time the important functions of curriculum development, assessment and reporting at the national level. It is a common-sense policy for the 21st century to bring some form of continuity, consistency and conformity to our nation's various education systems. The bill establishes the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA, as an independent statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It is important to remember that this governance model is consistent with agreements reached by the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, on 12 September 2008. It is in effect the result of cooperative federalismand over many years people in this place have sought to have our federal and state governments genuinely cooperate to achieve important national outcomes. This is one such attempt to do that. So, contrary to the member for Riverina's comments, this is part of a revolution. A revolution starts small and will build and gather momentum. This is creaabout producing good educational outcomes for all students throughout Australia. It is an attempt to provide a means to promote, measure and support that. The bill establishes some very important functions for the authority which will operate under the following principles. The authority will be responsible for the coordination of curriculum, assessment and reporting, including the management and analysis of school data at a national level. The authority will have its policy direction set by education ministers through MCEETYA, not through the federal government. Some of the functions include developing and administering a national school curriculum, including content of the curriculum and achievement standards for school subjects specified in the charter, and I would like to return to that later; develmade oping and administering national assessments; collecting, managing and analysing student assessment data and other data relating to schools and comparative school performance; and a number of other functions, particularly in relation to the sharing and storage of this information amongst relevant parties. The authority is accountable to the Commonwealth and the states and territories through MCEETYA. MCEETYA will be responsible for setting the authority's work program, in line with the functions that I just outlined, through a charter. The authority must perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with the charter, not the whims of whoever may be the current government. The charter will set out the authority's annual work program in relation to discharging the core functions set out in the bill. The bill sets out the core functions for the authority. The charter will give MCEETYA the ability to confer additional functions so long as they are in relation to the core functions of the authority set out in the bill. The bill also outlines provisions covering the composition of the authority, which will be made up of 13 persons as a board of directors. The authority will have a chief executive officer and staff. The board of directors will consist of a chair, a deputy chair, one member nominated by the Commonwealth minister, one member nominated by the National Catholic Education Commission, one member nominated by the Independent Schools Council of Australia and eight other members, with each state and territory education minister nominating one each. The CEO will be responsible for the day-today management of the authority. I notice that some members opposite have the point that they hope that there will be teacher representation on the board of directors. I, too, would expect that. I could not see that, where the charter asks for persons who are adequately and properly trained to give advice to the authority, they would not have an educational background. I would find that very unusual. I would join with those opposite if they were genuinely interested in that side of the argument. The board members will be appointed by the Commonwealth Minister for Education. Board members will be appointed to their positions on a part-time basis for a maximum period of six years. MCEETYA, I would add, must agree to all board appointments and be satisfied that there is a balance of professional expertise in the membership of the board across a whole range of issues, including matters relating to school curriculum, school assessment and data management, analysing and reporting in relation to school performance, financial and commercial matters, the management of educational organisations and corporate governance matters. Finally, the bill provides that the authority will report on its functions to all Australian education ministers through MCEETYA. It must report in particular on its activities during that year to the extent that they relate to the charter and it must provide any other information relating to the discharge of its functions that MCEETYA directs. The Australian government has committed $37.2 million over the next four years to support the work of the quality schools authority. This will also be complemented by state contributors. We made a commitment during the last election campaign, which is given effect in this legislation, to bring about and develop a world-class national curriculum from kindergarten to year 12, starting with the key learning areas of English, mathematics, the sciences and history. In April this year, the government set up the independent National Curriculum Board to take on the challenge of developing Australia's first national curriculum in the areas I have just mentioned, headed by the ‘two macs': Barry MCGaw and Tony Mackay. The view is for the new national curriculum to be implemented by 2011. The new national curriculum is being developed collaboratively between the government and non-government education authorities, teachers, students, academics, professional organisations and business groups. Framing papers on the new English, maths, science and history curricula were released earlier this year. The consultation period for these framing papers opened just recently and will continue through until February 2009. In establishing each framing paper, the National Curriculum Board recruited a writer, who worked with a small advisory group to draft an advice paper that provides a rationale for students studying the curriculum and a broad-scope sequence of material to cover the years from kindergarten to year 12. Discussions on these framing papers were held last month at a series of national forums and about 200 people attended each of these forums. It is anticipated that the National Curriculum Board will post its final recommendations on its website in early 2009. The national education agreement will also be established through COAG before the end of this year-hopefully this weekend. This agreement will establish for the first time the shared national targets, outcomes and policy directions that we need to achieve a world-class school system serving the needs of every Australian student. Following the current consultation period, the National Curriculum Board will determine its final recommendations and post them on its website in term 1 of 2009. By March 2009, the board will develop detailed writing briefs for the writers it will recruit to develop the detailed curriculum documents. The board will organise extensive consultation that during the development phase-particularly with practising teachers-and will recruit a panel of schools across the country in which to trial material being developed. By the end of 2010, the board is to develop a national K12 curriculum in English, maths, the sciences and history. To bring about curriculum development and change in our country is a very comprehensive process-and I find it absolutely fascinating and exciting. However, what I find disappointing is that many on the other side have actually attacked some of the people, and one in particular, chosen to develop the curriculum. I note the member for Sturt in his contribution to this debate attacked Professor Stuart Macintyre and his competence. I find it extraordinary that one would single out an individual who has been invited in a group to put together a curriculum for this country. I note that the Australian, as it always does in its development, nurturing and continuation of the culture wars in this country, was happy to run the headlines of those opposite attacking the character of some of the individuals involved because it did not suit their agenda. Professor Macintyre has never suited their agenda. I found it very disappointing. They have chosen Dr John Hirst as one of their champions in the history and culture wars and in the right of history teaching. I am happy to read Dr Hirst. I have got his many articles on Australian history by my bedside at the moment. I thought it was terrific that he, who is part of the development group associated with the history curriculum, came out in response to the comment of the Australian in its continuation of the cultural wars and said: The appointment of Stuart Macintyre to draw up the history section of the national curriculum should not re-ignite the history wars … I have seen his first draft and can assure you that fears expressed in your pages about his ment are misplaced. This slur should belong in history, but it is resurrected and then trotted out in template papers given out to members opposite for something to say on this bill. It was indeed alluded to by the member for Riverina. Let me assure members that the history curriculum that is being developed will be rigorous, inclusive, demanding and representative of our origins, of where we are in the 21st century and of all those forces that have been at work to bring this great country about. I have no hesitation in arguing that it will be a fair and balanced process. It is not the work of one man but the work of many. As a former history teacher, I am really pleased to see that history will take its proud place in the curriculum again as a subject, as a discipline and as a very important component in education. A second area associated with this bill, and certainly one which has raised a good deal of controversy and ire, is the whole question of transparency in reporting. The whole basis of this is to achieve better educational outcomes for our kids no matter where they are or what school they go to. The basis of this is that the data collected should be used to improve educational outcomes. We need the data at a national level-that is, data collected in a consistent and comprehensive manner from all schools, whether they be public or private. The principle behind that is not only will it have good educational outcomes-certainly that is the intention-but also that any school receiving public money should be accountable for what goes on in it. There is nothing to fear in that at all, but we have to be open about it and say it as it is. No teacher in our schools should feel threatened by this measure, and nor should any principal or school community. The intention behind it is to gather the data necesthe sary to determine what factors can improve a appointschool and what factors may be at work holding that school back. That is the intention of it. I can assure you that many educators that I know, many former colleagues, want to know this information. I can tell you that the great majority of parents in Australia want to know this material. They are not scared of it. We need to use this material carefully and selectively and to compare like with like. I draw the attention of those who might like to follow this further to a Treasury paper authored by Andrew Leigh and Hector Thompson, which I believe was released this year. They were looking at the factors at work in Western Australia, particularly trying to determine whether socio-economic factors were the main factor in determining student outcomes in schools or whether there were other factors at play. I found it really interesting and will share it with the House, because I think it goes to the heart of what we are trying to do here. Their conclusion says: … 20 per cent of Western Australia government schools outperform those of a similar socio-economic status by more than 5 percentage points. That is quite considerable. It goes on: Assuming that these schools would otherwise have been at the state average, this means that these schools, at least one-third of students who would otherwise not have made the benchmark, do meet the benchmark. This highlights that for students who are at risk of not meeting the benchmark, being in a better performing school can make a difference. We want the information to identify better performing and underperforming schools so that we can direct our resources to those schools that are underperforming. We need to know.",42
13,Mr ROBERT,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I note with interest that the Deputy Prime Minister, when she introduced the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 in her second reading speech, said: This bill is yet another illustration of how this government is getting on with the job of delivering an education revolution to Australia. I suggest this education revolution might as well be dashed on the Bay of Pigs for all that it will achieve for the nation. When looking forward we must look back at where we have come from before discussing education going forward. Look at what the coalition achieved. It increased funding for state schools in every budget, delivering a funding increase of 70 per cent in real terms between 1996 and 2007. It put the interests of children and parents ahead of bureaucrats and teachers unions. It enhanced the capacity of parents to choose between public and private schools. It established better formulas for schools to get funding from the federal government. It ended the Keating government's new schools policy, which placed severe restrictions on establishing new nongovernment schools. I guess Labor does not like private education. The coalition also attached conditions to Commonwealth education funding to the states, which enabled the introduction of literacy and numeracy tests for all students, and testing trials were in also introduced for year 9 students in 2007. Labor promised an education revolution. Interestingly, it has also promised 11 wars on everything from unemployment to food and fuel this year. There is something about war and revolution that a Marxist based party seems to enjoy. Labor promised to deliver an education revolution that would increase productivity and provide better outcomes for all children. Yet the Prime Minister's education revolution is unfortunately creating losers as well as winners, particularly in private schools, where Labor has cut funding by abandoning the coalition's $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools Program. I was recently at the Coombabah State School where the headmaster lauded the Investing in Our Schools Program for giving much-needed funds to put in place the infrastructure that the state was not providing-in this case, a range of dongas that were used for students to learn in, because the state would not provide established classrooms. The Investing in Our Schools Program also provided the funds, the means and the capability to provide internet connectivity in those classrooms. Labor says it will divert almost all of the $1.2 billion from the Investing in Our Schools Program into trade training centres, and of course that huge failure of a white elephant, the computers in our schools program, yet these programs benefit secondary schools only. Only $800,000 goes to primary schools, who clearly are the biggest losers. Despite the claim of an education revolution, in its first budget Labor cut almost $400 million in specific programs targeted at improving standards in literacy and numeracy. The $700 Even Start tuition vouchers for students who failed to meet minimum standards have been scrapped. The $70 million summer school program has been scrapped. The $50,000 in rewards for schools that improve literacy and numeracy has been scrapped. Far from bringing an education revolution, Labor has increased spending on education by less than one per cent. Cracker of a revolution, boys-well done! Labor has simply replaced successful and very popular Howard government programs with new bureaucracies delivering the failed computers in schools and trade training centres programs. Let us look at our computers in schools as we are discussing the wide range of education. The Prime Minister, at the ALP campaign launch, said: … Labor will undertake a groundbreaking reform by providing for every Australian secondary school student in Years 9 to 12 access to their own computer at school. So how has Mr Rudd gone on this central education policy that is primary to the education revolution? He has abandoned the promise to provide every year 9 to year 12 student with access to their own computer at school. Now they will have access to a computer for every two students. Less than 10 per cent of public schools have benefited from the program; less than 10 per cent of the total computers have been delivered. Yet we are a third of the way through the government's term. State and federal governments are yet to agree on who pays the something like $3 billion for installing and maintaining computers, software, networking and all of the ancillary air conditioning and infrastructure that go with it. By not meeting these costs, the Prime Minister is providing only 20 to 25 per cent of the funds needed to pay for his election promise, insisting that parents pick up the rest. A fabulous revolution, I say! Round 2 of the computer program closed on 9 October this year, with 1,900 schools invited to apply. Many schools indicated that they will not be applying, and it appears that the New South Wales government, that great pinnacle of democracy, has instructed its schools not to apply. A fabulous revolution! You can be truly proud of that great revolution and where it is going! Labor promised not to alter the Howard government's SES funding model in the 2009 to 2012 funding period, yet the Schools Assistance Bill currently before the Senate inquiry gives extra powers to a minister to stop or delay government funding for a range of what can only be construed as spurious reasons. It mandates that schools comply strictly with a national curriculum, putting funding to Steiner, Montessori, special needs, faith based and International Baccalaureate schools under some degree of threat. It introduces new disclosure requirements that will discourage fundraising. Currently, all external sources of revenue that a school raises are disclosed to the minister but not to the general public. Labor has now changed the bill to say that they must all be disclosed to the public. Why? What interest do I have in what the fundraising regimes of a private school in Tasmania are? The answer is none. But I have asked the wrong question. As I look at the former secretary of the ACTU across the table, the question should be, ‘What interest does the teachers union have in getting information about fundraising and sources of funding for private schools?' Labor has announced plans to review school funding in 2010. On the evidence, it appears clear that they intend to return to the politics of envy and class warfare and to the policy of Mark Latham's private school hit list. Why? Perhaps Labor does not like private schools. Let us move on to Labor's trade training centres. It promised new trade centres built in all of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools, part of its 2007 election policy. The reality is that, because the funding is only $900,000 to each school on average, schools are forced to pool their funds to build something that resembles a trade training centre. In the first round, just 34 projects were successful. If we move into the higher education space, the coalition increased funding to the higher education sector from $4.2 billion in 1995-96 to $6.7 billion in the 2007-08 year, a 13 per cent increase in real terms. It increased the higher education loan repayment threshold. Additional funding for universities was provided. There were new loan schemes and boosted funding for regional campuses. It presided over a 58 per cent increase in the number of students. Thankfully, it introduced voluntary student unionism and established the $6 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund. Now let us look at what Labor promised with respect to voluntary student unionism. The current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, said at a doorstop: I'm not considering a compulsory HECS-style arrangement and the whole basis of the approach is one of a voluntary approach so I'm not templating a compulsory amenities fee. That is what he said-a senior member of the Labor cabinet and front-bench. The Deputy Prime Minister said in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 August: We committed before the election that we would not reintroduce compulsory student unionism. Those are two definitive statements that are unequivocal: there will be no compulsory amenity fee and there will be no compulsory student unionism. But let us look at the facts, because they are always a little bit more ing than the rhetoric. The government announced on 3 November this year that it would introduce a $250 service fee for Australian university students to be compulsorily paid by a deferred HECS-style arrangement. That is the height of duplicity. The Deputy Prime Minister and the current foreign minister were both unequivocal in their statements that they would not introduce compulsory fees, and here they are. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, only three months earlier, said, ‘We committed that we would not introduce compulsory student unionism,' and three months later-less than 100 days later-there it is: a compulsory fee. It is a betrayal. It is looking the Australian people in the eye, saying one thing and blatantly doing another. I guess that was not in Labor's 70-page glossy brochure paid for by taxpayers' dollars to celebrate the first 12 months of the failed Labor Rudd government. So that is the past; that is where we have come from. We have come from duplicity, broken promises and farce. Let us have a look at where we are going. The current bill is establishing a new Commonwealth body, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA, to develop and implement the new national curriculum and to collect data and provide analysis and con- research to governments. The government had initially committed separate funding to develop a new National Curriculum Board and a new independent National Schools Assessment and Data Centre. This bill aggregates that funding and incorporates both bodies into ACARA. The development of a national curriculum began under the Howard government and had its obvious support. However, the opposition has expressed reservations about the direction that the curriculum has now taken tellunder a Labor government. Minister Gillard appointed an interim National Curriculum Board to work on its development as this legislation was being prepared, and that board included working groups in each of the four subject areas being covered by the curriculum: mathematics, English, science and history. The development of the history curriculum, in particular, has caused a little concern. The new authority, ACARA, will assume powers over curriculum and assessment that are currently with state governments and it will further be empowered by its secondary role as the primary data analysis and research centre. ACARA's clearest role, though, is the development of a national curriculum. We support that; we support a national curriculum. It certainly makes sense. We are concerned, though, that, should it be anything other than a useful framework, the national curriculum may be hijacked. We are concerned there is a danger of a national curricuwith lum being taken and straddled with left-wing ideological views. It would be a disaster for Australian students if the Labor Party and its left-wing friends used the national curriculum as an opportunity to skew and hijack schooling in Australia. We will take the Labor government on its word-which we have done a few times this year, which has only led to catastrophic failure. But we will take them on their word that ACARA will do the right thing and will develop a class curriculum that is free from ideological bias, with a strong foundation in the basics. We will take them on their word that that will be achieved. We are concerned about any move away from the basics, any move away from literacy and numeracy and any move away from Australian history that incorporates an intelligent balance between our Aboriginal heritage, the history of European settlement and modern Australian history. We are concerned that balance is provided in the curriculum. We will closely monitor the establishment of the curriculum, we will encourage wide consultation and we will not allow perspectives to be captured by a small group of ideologues. We have seen in the Schools Assistance Bill that the Labor Party wishes to mandate the introduction of the national curriculum before the end of the funding quadrennium in non-government schools as a condition for non-government schools to receive funding from 1 January, even though we have little idea what the national curriculum may actually look like. The Deputy Prime Minister has refused to confirm that schools currently delivering alternative recognised curricula will be able to continue to do so. This makes it very difficult for a range of high-achieving students, special students and those with different educational philosophies to continue, some faith, going forward. It puts at risk those faith based schools who teach faith based components within their schooling. The Deputy Prime Minister's refusal to provide comfort to these schools by accepting the opposition's amendment to the Schools Assistance Bill to remove the mandatory application of the unwritten national curriculum has certainly not helped matters. In a speech on 10 November 2008, the Deputy Prime Minister deferred any decision about whether alternative curriculum based schools will be able to continue under ACARA. This means that, under the current government, ACARA will have the final say as to whether the following curricula are allowed: Jewish, Islamic and Christian schools; the unique Steiner schools, of which I have one in my electorate, based in Nerang; the Montessori schools; the University of Cambridge International Examination; and the International Baccalaureate. Government has moved away from its responsibility to provide guidance and support for those curricula and is allowing ACARA to decide if they should continue. I would contend that, for a national curriculum to succeed, ACARA and the government will need to be able to convince all of the state education departments, all the state governments and the non-government sector that the national curriculum will not interfere in those aspects of the present curriculum of which they are most proud, which differentiate their schooling and which mean that parents know full well what the students are being taught and accept that by virtue of placing their child into a school like Steiner or Montessori. Members may draw their own conclusion as to how the government will be successful in this endeavour. But the opposition will watch carefully and will not allow the national curriculum to be hijacked by left-wing ideologues for their own purpose. We are looking for a balanced curriculum, a curriculum that meets the needs of all Australians. The opposition will hold the government strongly accountable if anything other than that is delivered.",46
14,Mr ZAPPIA,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"I rise to support the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008, which brings in the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. I do so because this is good public policy. It is one of a series of measures which forms the Rudd government's education revolution beginning with an investment of $19.3 billion in education in the May budget, an investment that is central to building a stronger future for Australia and a fairer Australia and preparing Australia for future challenges. I will not waste my time responding to the comments and the paranoia of the member for Fadden but what I want to do is respond to one of the allegations and comments that is continually made by members opposite in respect of the Investing in Our Schools Program and how this government supposedly ended that program. The program, as other speakers on this side have pointed out, was ended by the previous coalition government. What I have before me, which quite clearly spells that out, is some press statements put out by the coalition government about 12 months ago and in the lead-up to the last federal election. I want to quote from a press release put out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who at the time said: Details of the continued support for the Investing in Our Schools Programme will be announced in due course. That was on 28 August 2007. More than a year later, we are still waiting for those details. But more importantly and more specifically, subsequent to that press release from the Liberal Party's website where they talked about their policies in the lead-up to the last federal election, they listed 10 objectives that they would commit to if they were elected. Not one of them talks about the continuation of the Investing in Our Schools Program. So if they want to come in here and talk about that policy ending then they ought to turn around and look behind them and look to the people who in fact did end that program and not accuse this government of having done so. Australia is now ranked 20th amongst the OECD countries for the percentage of 25to 34-year-olds who have completed upper secondary education or its equivalent. Access Economics estimates that young people who leave school before year 12 are six times more likely to make a poor transition to postschool activities than those who complete senior schooling. I note that each year of schooling is associated with an increase of around 10 per cent in earnings. I also note that a study published by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum and the Business Council of Australia estimated that a 10 per cent increase in year 12 or apprenticeship completion by 2010 would boost annual GDP by 1.1 per cent by 2040 as a result of increased labour force participation and improved workforce productivity. Those are some of the benefits that come from better education. When members come into this chamber and talk about the so-called proud record of the coalition for its commitment to education, perhaps they need to look at some of those statistics which in fact paint a very damning picture of what happened to education in this country under the watch of the coalition government. I said earlier that the Rudd Labor government has committed $19.3 billion to education in its first budget. That includes $1.2 billion for the digital education revolution, and as part of that spending the government is providing $11.5 million to support professional development for teachers in information and communications technology and $32.6 million over two years to supply students and teachers with online curriculum tools and resources. I also point out that million has already been provided to 896 schools across Australia to fund 116,820 new computers. So the program is being rolled out, contrary to what other speakers have said, and it is being taken up by schools around Australia. I have yet to find a school that does not want new computers. The $19.3 billion also includes $2.5 billion for trade training centres in secondary schools, and $90 million of that has already been provided to 34 lead schools across the country. There will be $62.4 million over the next three years, commencing in the 2008-09 year, for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program. This is important, given that our strong trading partners in the years ahead will be Asian countries. There will be $625.8 million over three years, commencing in 2008-09, to reduce HECS rates for maths and science students. New maths and science graduates will also be eligible for a 50 per cent reduction in their HECS if they pursue a career in those fields, including in teaching. To add to my earlier points about the need for the policies included in the education revolution, it is the aim of the government to ensure that by the year 2020 the percentage of Australians aged between 20 and 64 without qualifications at the certificate III level and above will be halved. It is the aim of the government to ensure that by 2020 the number of diploma and advanced diploma completions will have doubled. And it is also the aim of the government to ensure that by the year 2013 there will be universal access to early learning for all children. I also note that there are nearly 6.5 million Australians who have no post-school qualifications and that every year some 45,000 to 50,000 early school leavers do not go into full-time work, full-time learning or a combination of work and learning. To return to the substance of the bill, we live in a global community where people not $116 only travel frequently to places around the world but take up employment and career paths in different parts of the world. As we all know, transnational corporations set up businesses in many countries with the same job specifications and professional training requirements for the staff they recruit, wherever they are to be based. That is even more the case with respect to employment opportunities and qualification requirements within Australia. It makes little sense to have education providers around Australia setting individual standards and curriculum in each state and territory. The Rudd government recognises that, and the state and territory governments recognise that. That is why, on 2 October, there was a historic COAG decision to establish the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority as an independent statutory authority that will bring together the functions of curriculum assessment and reporting at the national level. I believe this decision will be welcomed by families and industry around Australia. The Rudd government has highlighted time and again the significance of education to future prosperity and opportunity for individuals and future prosperity for our nation. A good education is dependent on a number of factors, and curriculum setting and assessing form part of those factors. This bill is a long overdue measure and I welcome the intention to commence this process on 1 January 2009. The bill also provides for a national assessment of student performance. Knowing how students compare with other students around the country is important for students, parents, employers and the teaching profession. Importantly, it is essential knowledge for governments because it will assist them in the allocation of education and social spending and in the provision of targeted funding. It is widely accepted that education outcomes are not simplistically determined by the school environment or the quality of teachers; other social factors can and do determine education outcomes. It is very important for governments to know how students from different communities are performing by assessing them against the same curriculum. Governments can then identify underlying social issues which may need addressing. In that context I want to refer to a report entitled How young people are faring 2008, prepared by the Foundation for Young Australians and released earlier this year. I referred to this report in a previous address on education, but this statement in the report is absolutely relevant to the point I am making at the moment: Social disadvantage promotes lower rates of attainment among some groups of young Australians … 19 year-olds from low SES backgrounds attain Year 12 or its equivalent at a rate 26.1 percentage points lower than that of those from high SES origins. At age 24, well over one-third of those from low SES backgrounds have not completed Year 12 or equivalent, compared to about one in seven of those from high SES backgrounds. This is the important paragraph: Achievement levels in school also affect attainment, and since school achievement is highly correlated with social background, policies developed to target improvements in Year 12 completion will need to address the issue of social disadvantage. That is the critical comment made in that report, and it is the critical point of this bill. If the government can provide those assessments and those comparisons of how students are performing in different parts of the country it will enable the government to target specific spending, because quite often those performance levels are not directly related to the school, to the teachers or to the subjects that are being studied, but to other factors which also need addressing. Of course, a national assessment will increase the level of accountability on both schools and teachers. The important issue here is to ensure that all relevant factors are taken into account when drawing conclusions about student performance and, therefore, school performance. I link that with the previous comments I made. You cannot judge a school by its performance if you simply take into account the performance of the students. You have to make a judgement on the basis of other, external factors as well. That applies if you are going to make judgements about the teachers who are teaching in those schools. I am sure that those matters are well understood by the minister. The COAG agreement which underpins the implementation of this bill will also address a critical decision for families when they consider moving from one state to another. Each year about 340,000 Australians move interstate, and I would expect those figures to rise in the years ahead. About one-quarter of those 340,000 Australians are students. Not having uniformity in the school system across Australia raises two matters of concern. Firstly, parents sometimes reject a worthwhile opportunity to move from one state to another because of the impact on their children's education. They will make a conscious decision, perhaps, not to take up a better position for themselves because they do not want to disrupt their children's educanew tion. They put the children's education first. Secondly, for those who do move, considerable readjustment is required for children still at school. If a child has to go from school to another, sometimes in another state, it disrupts them to the point where it might affect their social well-being. Importantly, they may have to pick up months of learning as part of the adjustment process in the new school. Because of that they may not perform as well as they might otherwise have performed. It does have an impact on their children's schooling so I can understand why parents are sometimes reluctant to move from one area to another. In my own state I have known of parents who have moved from one part of the City of Adelaide to another part-or even out into the country-but have continued to send their children to the same school, even if there is considerable cost, just so that they will not disrupt their children's schooling. Having a national curriculum overcomes many of the difficulties associated with relocating from one school to another. For that reason alone it is an important bill. In recent weeks I have attended end-ofyear ceremonies at many of the schools in my electorate. I am always impressed by the extraordinary talents I see in young people throughout our community. I am equally impressed by the commitment of so many of the teachers in those schools, and how they, in turn, always find innovative ways to make school life more meaningful and more interesting. I want to take this opportunity to speak about one such example. I refer to the Banksia Park International High School. I attended their end-of-year presentation a week ago, but some three weeks earlier I attended the launch of a very special program. The program is referred to as the Banksia Park International High School international football program. This is a brand concept. It is a concept that was put together by the school as a response to a need from within the school community. It goes a long way, I believe, to providing real opporone tunities for young people, not only in their school but in schools across Australia. Banksia Park International High School, as the name says, is a school that has students from all around the world. The most common sport that all of those students can identify with is soccer. That is why they focused on soccer as the basis for this program. There are opportunities for students from year 8 to year 12 to get involved in the program as part of their school curriculum. This is not just a recreation or a hobby program; this forms part of the school curriculum right through from years 8 and 9 to years 10, 11 and 12. The details of the program, particularly with respect to years 11 and 12, are still being finalised but they have already launched the program and it is underway. It is available to both girls and boys in the school. You may well ask: how does this fit in with the school curriculum? Soccer is an international sport. In order to get the program up and running the school has been working with the South Australian Football Federation and with Adelaide United soccer club, which is the dominant soccer club in our state-and which, I might say, if I can digress, has performed exceptionally well this last season-and they are working with the local soccer club, Modbury Soccer Club. They are also working with the person who sponsors the Adelaide United soccer club, Mr Nick Bianco. The whole concept is about getting students involved from the early stages of the game right through to the end. It teaches the children about refereeing, coaching, sports training, administration and, if they want to pursue it as an individual, even becoming a player. All of those areas today provide opportunities for employment later on. All of those are career opportunities. In fact, when you consider how dominant and important sport has become in our daily lives, it really is a huge employment sector. If you want to get work in that sector, there is no better way than to devise a course that enables a pathway into sports administration, sports coaching, sports participation or refereeing. All of those areas provide opportunities for our young people. They are being pursued, but quite often they are being pursued without the proper training. I commend this program because, as someone who has always supported sports participation in the community, I know there are benefits that go far beyond just education. Young people who get involved in sports and in this kind of program learn about leadership. They learn about taking responsibility. They learn about being committed. It is a healthy activity that they get involved in. They learn to work as a team and in conjunction with other people. It makes better people of the young people who get involved. I have seen it time and time again in those who participate in sports, even just at local sports club level. To see a school pick up all of those pieces, put them together in the form of a curriculum and then offer it to its students is commendable. I certainly look forward to working with the school in the years ahead as it rolls out the program. I understand that in the first couple of years the program will run only for a few weeks but as students move on through years 10, 11 and 12 it will become a full semester activity. As I said, it actually forms part of their school curriculum and they will be assessed accordingly. As I said at the outset, this is part of the series of measures that the Rudd government has introduced as part of the education revolution. It is an important part and one that I believe will make a real difference to the opportunities for young people in this country. I commend the bill to the House.",50
15,Ms MCKEW,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (11.47 am)-I would like to thank all of those who spoke on the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008. Certainly, the level of debate shows the very strong interest that we all have in ensuring that all young Australians have the best education and the best start in life. I think it is healthy that the foundations of the education of all young Australians are being vigorously and openly debated not only here within the parliament but also in the media, in schools and in local communities. The Rudd Labor government came to office knowing that world-class education is the foundation of a competitive economy. We are committed to delivering an education revolution. The government is making new investments in schooling and building a modern high-quality education system which will ensure that all young Australians achieve their potential and have the skills to participate actively in society. We are investing up to $1½ million per high school to create trade training centres in all of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools and $1.2 billion in the digital education revolution and computers for secondary schools, supported by digital content resources, professional development and broadband connections. On the matter of investment, I want to correct some of the misleading statements made by the opposition regarding the Investing in Our Schools Program-the IOSP. That was an initiative of the previous government. On 19 February 2007, the former Prime Minister issued a press release noting a fourth and final round of funding. The former government decided that there would be no further funding for the IOSP and even returned $26 million of funding for government schools to the surplus, as they claimed there was insufficient demand. Then, on 28 August 2007, Julie Bishop announced that the Howard government would continue support for the IOSP and that details of the continued support would be announced in due course. Despite this promise, the coalition stayed silent on that continued support during the election campaign, and no additional funding was ever allocated to that program. But, as I have outlined, this government is investing $2½ billion over 10 years for trade training centres, $1 billion over four years in the tal education revolution and $62 million over four years under Local Schools Working Together. But simply spending more, of course, will never be enough. Our investments will be underpinned by stronger emphasis on equity, on excellence, on transparency and on cooperation. Together with state and territory governments, we have embraced a new national vision for Australia to become the most educated country and the best skilled economy, with the best trade workforce. This bill establishes the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. It presents a significant and systematic advance to our education system that replaces the ad hoc and part-time approach over the last 12 years of the Howard government. It ensures that all governmentsstate, territory and Commonwealth-will work together to improve education throughout the country. It is a real example of collaborative federalism working at its best. As the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister have said, we want nothing short of transformational change in our schools. We must continue to work together to improve the quality of teaching, to ensure every child benefits and to mandate transparency and accountability. The new authority will play a crucial role in delivering on all of these goals. It will be responsible for delivering the national curriculum and the transparency and performance-reporting agenda at the national level. It will build on the significant work that has already been achieved by the Interim National Curriculum Board. When we came into office, the Australian government committed to the development of a rigorous world-class national curriculum from kindergarten to year 12, starting with the key learning areas of English, mathematics, the sciences and history. For 30 years Australia has needed a single, high-quality national curriculum. The national curriculum digiwill benefit teachers by giving them a very clear understanding of what needs to be covered in each subject and in each phase of schooling. It will also bring benefits to parents by giving them a clear and explicit agreement about what it is that young people should know and be able to do. And it will also allow teachers the flexibility to shape their classes around the curriculum in a way that is meaningful and engaging for students. On the matter of teachers, I was very interested to hear members of the opposition come out and support the interests of teachers. Of course it is a bit too little too late after over a decade of neglect of the teaching profession. Unlike the opposition in government, this government has the greatest respect for the many talented and hard working teachers in our schools and we are backing up that respect with greater support for them and their profession. That is why on Monday the Acting Prime Minister announced that the Rudd government is prepared to invest half a billion dollars in a national partnership between the government and the states and territories. This investment will ensure that teachers are supported to ensure that all young Australians get the very best education. But teaching, a critical part of the story, only part of the story. We need a rigorous curriculum with the right level of flexibility. And we need to ensure that the curriculum leads to depth of understanding. There has been debate in this House about the dangers of the national curriculum being influenced by certain ideological positions. I want to be clear on this matter: the task to develop the curriculum is a matter for the experts. It is not for politicians. The Interim National Curriculum Board has gone about its work to develop the national curriculum in an open and transparent manner and has drawn on expertise as it sees fit. And they are to be commended for their efforts to date. There will always be debate regarding this area and what is in and what is not. This government welcomes and encourages that debate. Through the processes the Interim National Curriculum Board has been using, all Australians can contribute their ideas online about the national curriculum. There has been significant debate on the dangers of the national curriculum stifling creativity and flexibility and restricting choice. The national curriculum, once agreed and completed, will be compulsory. But let me be clear on this point: this does not mean that every school will be required to teach the same subjects, line by line, in the same way. It means that there will be determined content and achievement standards in the learning areas of English, mathematics, the sciences and history. By content, I mean what it is that students are able to know and to do-the knowledge, the understandings and the skills. By achievement standards, I mean how well achievement is measured and reported. The national curriculum will not mandate the practices that schools or teachers use to deliver that content and the achievement standards. Schools and teachers will continue to use their own professional judgement is about what to cover and in what sequence and how best to reflect local and regional circumstances, different philosophies and different learning environments. As the Acting Prime Minister stated a bit earlier, she recognises that some schools use a specialised curriculum, such as the International Baccalaureate, and that some, such as Steiner and Montessori schools, have particular educational philosophies-quite prized educational philosophies-which involve different approaches and different ways to deliver the curriculum. Clearly, there are a number of approaches that are internationally and educationally recognised and used by schools that can show their approach to curriculum is well structured and of high quality. One of the key tasks of this new authority will be to advise on the most effective method for confirming the recognition of well-established alternative curriculum frameworks in line with the existing curriculum accreditation arrangements that operate within the states and territories. It will do this by working in collaboration with the states and territories, which have constitutional responsibility for curriculum offerings in their jurisdictions. It will make sure that, for the first time, there is a national recognition process that delivers transparency about the curriculum that is being delivered across Australia and one that is not overly burdensome. The new authority will also play a key role in implementing improved transparency and public accountability of school outcomes through the introduction of a nationally agreed reporting framework to identify school needs and achievements. That includes moving to a new level of transparency in the reporting of student and school performance. Lack of transparency can hide failure. It feeds a culture where all the adults involved-the teachers, the principals, the community leaders and the members of parliament-avoid accountability. And lack of transparency prevents us from identifying where greater effort and investment are needed. Importantly, transparency and accountability are overwhelmingly supported by parents. Last month, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, with input from the Australian Council of State School Organisations, conducted a major survey of parents' attitudes about the information they want from schools. The results are striking, with 83.2 per cent of parents in all school systems agreeing that important information relating to school activities and performance should be made public. Parents are hungry for information about how they can help their own children to learn better, both at home and at school. And they understand the importance of information for producing systematic school improvement. And it would certainly appear from the debate in the House on this bill that most members on both sides understand the importance of the right kind of information. Real progress has already been made in working with state and territory governments to develop a framework for publishing consistent, accurate and appropriate information. But there is much more that can be done through this new authority. We will be insisting on comprehensive information, which will be put in its proper context. Specifically, we will be comparing how the performance of a school compares to that of other like schools serving similar student groups. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority will be at the forefront of the government's commitment to provide all young Australians with better opportunities and the best start in life. It will be the engine room of reform and a key driver of our education revolution. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",54
16,Ms MCKEW,ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (11.59 am)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (SHORT SELLING) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.  this morning to make some remarks on the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008. The bill introduced by the government which is currently before the House represents some positive outcomes but also, regrettably, some dangerously negative outcomes. We in the opposition strongly support an appropriate disclosure regime and the resultant enhanced market integrity that goes with that. We support measures that enhance greater disclosure and transparency. The strength and the integrity of the Australian financial markets are of course of great importance not only to so-called ‘mum and dad' investors but also to institutional investors and superannuation funds, to mention a few. It is of the utmost importance that disclosure that provides the basis for a strong and honest marketplace exists in this country. However, we will not support ambiguity and uncertainty, nor will we support a circumvention of proper parliamentary process. Whilst supporting schedules 1 and 2-to which I will return shortly-the opposition will move to amend the bill to remove schedule 3. I will move this amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the debate. Schedule 3 is an empty vessel which vainly attempts to provide a legislative base for the disclosure of covered short sales. The matter at stake goes beyond the adequate regulation of the market. At the heart of this schedule is the principle of sound governance. This principle will be done great harm by the Rudd government's poorly conceived and grossly inadequate attempt at legislation in schedule 3. It has become absolutely clear through our discussions with industry and other stakeholders, together with the evidence presented at the recent inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, that there is enormous concern with the way in which this particular schedule has been constructed-that is, its immense lack of detail, clarity and substance. Make no mistake: schedule 3 is a dangerously lazy outline which threatens the very certainty and strength which our market relies heavily upon. After holding an extensive process of consultation, all the government has presented to the parliament is this inept schedule which will create more instability and uncertainty than the current status quo. The opposition wants the government to do the work that needs to be done and then come back to the parliament with a schedule in a new bill which has the detail and certainty required within it. The opposition is in agreement with the government over the actions represented by schedules 1 and 2. Schedule 1 clarifies ASIC's power in relation to short selling. ASIC is given the authority to regulate all aspects of short selling. Any confusion over which entity has regulatory oversight for short selling would be removed. We support this measure. Schedule 2 bans so-called naked short selling, which becomes the default position. I note that ASIC is left with a regunot latory carve-out to allow naked short selling where it sees fit. It is my understanding that naked short selling represents less than two per cent of all short sales conducted in Australia. It therefore clarifies and provides certainty to the broader marketplace. These first two schedules are clearly positive measures. ASIC and the ASX have already been able to ban and regulate short selling through issued orders. They nonetheless deserve our support for the purposes of clarity. I will now come to the reasons why the opposition intends to move an amendment to omit schedule 3 from the bill, the most important of which is that we want to ensure the marketplace has certainty and stability, something that this skeleton or, if you like, the bare bones schedule in the bill does not provide. One of the most ridiculous claims asserted by the government on this schedule is that it is a matter of urgency that this bill be quickly passed. ASIC and the ASX are able to continue regulating short selling indefinitely; moreover, schedule 3 of this bill does not come into operation until regulations are tabled in the parliament. The government itself has said that the regulations are yet to be drafted and yet to be consulted upon and will only appear some time in the future, most probably months away. Considering that the Treasury has indicated that it needs more time to consider the nature and the structure of regulation, there is absolutely no justification for running the media line and the media spin that this schedule in the bill should be rushed. Undue haste without proper attention to detail and substance, as the member for Maribyrnong would know, is not good law making and, frankly, is quite dangerous in this context-and he would know that as well. The government has invented a deadline to appear to be doing something. Just because you say you are doing something does mean that you are actually doing what is right or indeed what is good. Being decisive demands taking a decision to present a properly detailed bill for the parliament's consideration. This should not be an unattainable goal, considering that the government have just conducted what they say has been an extensive consultation process. The most important aspect of this schedule is the procedure for the disclosure of covered short sales. Schedule 3 has a complete lack of detail in relation to how the disclosure requirements would actually work in practice. This means that the key issues and concerns for the industry stakeholders remain undetermined and unresolved. There are no legislative provisions on how disclosure should operate in terms of time, regularity and stock measure to be used. Most troubling is that there is neither framework nor principle espoused; therefore, there is no indication of how any regulation is to be approached. The lack of certainty is most concerning. The very point of having a parliament is that ters of national importance can be considered and debated in this place. The parliamentary legislative process provides the opportunity for interested stakeholders to scrutinise the proposed measures. In relation to schedule 3, there is a complete lack of transparency which arises from the circumvention of the parliament. As the bill currently stands, there is no capacity scrutiny and consultation in relation to schedule 3. If it were passed in the government's proposed form, the government would be able to continue ignoring consultation with industry stakeholders and could simply table binding regulations in parliament, regardless of the consequences. Once again, parliamentary democracy suffers under the Rudd government. The government's contempt for this place is unprecedented",57
17,Unknown,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Government members interjecting that the members opposite agree. There is also the government's exposure draft, which was released in September during the now forgotten consultation period. Key industry groups, including the Investment and Financial Services Association, the Australian Financial Markets Association and the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association, do not agree with the government's preferred option 2 in the exposure draft. There is significant opposition to the disclosure of covered short sales to other brokers as proposed in option 2. Industry advocates that positions should be disclosed to the ASX, as market operator, and not to other brokers, so as to protect commercial advantages and prevent price distortion. Key industry participants support the implementation of a permanent disclosure regime where the market participants-investors and fund managers-report their short sale posimat- tions directly to the market operator, the ASX, on a company-by-company basis. The information would then be published by the ASX on that basis. Once again, this position is contrary to the government's selected option 2 in the exposure draft. Industry largely has a preference for disclosure of positions to occur one to two weeks after the short sale, not on the followfor ing day as proposed by the government's favoured option 2 in the exposure draft. Industry concerns include the proliferation of ‘copy-cat' style behaviour, where speculators would derive great benefit from the publication of daily short-selling data. In addition, a next-day disclosure regime may expose commercially sensitive and active investment research to other participants, which could further distort the market. It has also been strongly argued to us that an exemption threshold for small traders should exist within the legislation. This would reduce unnecessary costs for small market participants. I also note that there are no legislative provisions for stock lending, despite stock lending being heavily featured in the now forgotten exposure draft. Not only does industry have issue with schedule 3 but Treasury officials stated during the Senate Standing Committee on Economics hearing the other day that it was not ideal that the particulars on how the disclosure regime would actually operate are not invested in the main legislation. The Australian Financial Markets Association were one of the few industry groups-indeed, one of only two-that were allowed, that were actually given permission, to present to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. This is despite many requests to appear before the committee. AFMA strongly asserted that the type of information that would be required for disclosure should be in the legislation, not left to regulation.",59
18,Mr KERR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"This is giving me a headache.  from the Investment and Financial Services Association, who stated that regulation should exist only to fill in the detail and the law itself should have the basic requirements within. IFSA held that such basic requirements must exist in order to provide direction and guidance to the detail. And I am sorry that the member for Denison is getting a headache, but he will have some empathy with the industry and the financial markets, because this bill will give them a headache. Most damning, IFSA went on to state on the public record that the disclosure regime is the very structure which must be in the legislation for certainty's sake. This issue of no detail being in the schedule is particularly highlighted when one refers to the government's own explanatory memorandum. In the explanatory memorandum it says: The amount of the compliance cost impact will be determined by the details to be prescribed through Regulations. As such, it is not possible to quantify the costs until the Regulations are made. So there you have it for all to see: this government, because it has not done the work required, is admitting openly that it has no idea of the cost implications because it has no idea what it wants to do in terms of the important-indeed, the incredibly important-implementation and practical details of this requirement. One does have to ask the question: why has the government decided to present only a skeleton schedule, devoid of detail and substance, after it has had so much time to do the work and to get it right upfront in the legislation? Why would the government not want to detail the implementation requirements and details in the main legislation, thereby providing absolute certainty and clarity to the market? Clearly, the answers to these questions are because the government does not know what it wants to do, it has not done the work required and it simply just wants to say that it has done something for that the sake of having said it has done something. The participants in the market in this country want certainty. They do not want requirements to change at the whim of a government long on rhetoric but short on substance. If schedule 3 as it currently stands is not omitted, it will only cause instability in the marketplace, and I am sure the member for Maribyrnong does not want to create instability in the marketplace. The market needs certainty, not ambiguity. It would be negligent of any opposition to not highlight and draw attention to such an inept schedule. Again, the opposition wants the government to do the work that needs to be done to provide certainty and substance to the market and then present it to the parliament for consideration. Our amendment will allow the government to achieve the aims of schedules 1 and 2 as our amendment, if passed, will allow schedules 1 and 2 to become the bill. Our amendment also provides the government with yet another opportunity to get schedule 3 right, an opportunity to actually work out what it wants to do and to articulate this upfront in the main legislation and to represent it to the parliament for consideration.",60

20,Mr SHORTEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I thank the shadow minister for the offer of his notes but, as I not agree with anything he said, his notes would hardly enhance my case. Global financial markets have experienced substantial difficulties in recent times. Every country has been touched by the tough economic conditions at the moment. Although we are better placed than many other countries in the world, we are not immune to this crisis. We are suffering its impacts now and will be mauled by its impacts long into the future. So the challenges ahead remain great and there are many tests that lie before us. The Rudd government is taking decisive and early action to protect the interests of Australian working families. Globally banks have failed or been bailed out, the latest being the largest bank in the worldCitibank-and there are countries in recession. There are no easy solutions or quick fixes to this global financial crisis. This will be a long, drawn-out crisis which will have a real impact on Australia. For the world to drag itself out of the crisis requires strong action by governments and a lift in business and individual confidence. It is to be hoped that the recent election of Barack Obama as US President will assist, as well as the actions taken in recent days by the Chinese government and past and future decisions by the G20, at whose meetings Prime Minister Rudd has been present. The Rudd government has injected $10.4 billion point of order understanding order 76. I know that when members begin their speeches they are usually given the chance to make some general introductory remarks but this is a bill about short selling and the member should be required to come back to it.",61

23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,The member has mentioned the name of the bill. He is continuing with his speech. I am listening carefully. He is in order.,61
24,Mr SHORTEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"The Rudd government has injected $10.4 billion as part of the Economic Security Strategy to stimulate economic activity and protect vulnerable groups in our society, especially pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and low-income families. This strategy builds on the decision already taken by the government to guarantee the bank deposits of all Australians. It shows true leadership by the Rudd government. As defined by the ABS, covered short selling refers to the practice of short selling curities one does not have-to settle the trade, securities need to be purchased or borrowed. There is a general concern that short selling drives down equity values. A variety of independent studies have been published on this and the consistent conclusion is that short sellers tend to be contrarian in nature. Generally studies have demonstrated that as equity prices fall short-selling activity increases. Regulators globally continue to regard short selling as a legitimate investment technique that contributes to price efficiency and liquidity. Short selling can protect investors from purchasing overpriced assets. However, it is fair to say that short selling has become synonymous with hedge funds and the loss of money by financial interests. Some of this criticism is exaggerated. Short selling is part of the system. Short selling can enhance market competition by allowing the pricing process to fully benefit from the insights of investors, with negative as well as positive opinions. Short selling is often used to support the following strategies: arbitrage trading, such as yield enhancement, dividend reinvestment plans, convertibles, pair trading and relative value; directional play; active extension strategies, such as 130/30 longshort mandates; merger and acquisition activity; support for derivative products, such as futures and options; and index rebalancing. The Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 contains three key measures: (1) it clarifies the ability of ASIC to regulate short selling and puts beyond doubt the validity of ASIC's recent class orders in relation to short selling; (2) it bans naked short selling-ASIC has the power to grant exemptions from this ban; and (3) it establishes a disclosure regime for covered short-sale transactions-that is, short sales supported se- by securities lending arrangements. This bill is urgent as a means of enhancing market confidence during a period of significant international market volatility. The amendments will provide certainty to the market regarding the scope of ASIC's powers to regulate short selling. That makes the opposition's reckless but failed attempt yesterday in the Senate to delay the passage of critical legislation a disgraceful event. The opposition's political play on this bill was revealed yesterday when they asked a series of questions during a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics under the pretence of genuinely seeking to form a view on the bill. But an overzealous opposition senator got ahead of himself and hours before the evidence was even complete lodged a notice of motion to delay the bill-ah, the benefits of telepathy! As the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law said yesterday: At a time when the global financial crisis is hitting real people hard, such as through their superannuation accounts, this measure will deliver the certainty that is required … The Corporations Act grants ASIC the general power to omit, modify or vary certain parts of the Corporations Act through declarations. These amendments will specify how this general power applies to short selling. The amendments make it clear that ASIC has the power to regulate all aspects of short selling, including prohibiting these transactions and imposing or varying requirements on these transactions. These powers will extend to transactions with the same or a substantially similar market effect as short selling. The amendments also expressly state that the short-selling declarations made by ASIC earlier this year were within the scope of ASIC's general power. These declarations had the effect of prohibiting covered short sales on Australian financial markets subject to some exemptions. They also introduced a disclosure regime for covered short sale transactions taking place under exemptions to the prohibition. ASIC's actions were necessary in light of the high levels of volatility being experienced in Australian and global financial markets, and international regulatory developments occurring at the time. These amendments are for the avoidance of doubt. They provide both ASIC and industry with certainty over the scope of ASIC's powers in relation to short selling. This is necesrequired sary to ensure the effective regulation of short selling in Australia. The bill also amends the Corporations Act to prohibit naked short sale transactions. A naked short sale is a transaction where the seller does not have a presently exercisable and unconditional right to vest the product in the seller at the time of sale. Various concerns have been expressed in relation to naked short selling. Transactions of this nature may have a higher risk of settlement failure because the seller does not have the capacity to vest the products at the time of sale. They may also distort the operation of financial markets by causing increased price volatility and potentially facilitating market manipulation. In addition, the perceived activity of naked short sellers may damage market confidence, particularly among retail investors. For these reasons, it was considered appropriate to remove the general ability for people to enter into naked short sales under the Corporations Act. However, ASIC has the power to allow naked short sale transactions if it considers them appropriate. It is envisaged that ASIC will use this power to allow some non-speculative naked short selling. This is necessary to ensure the continued ordinary operation of Australian financial markets. It is appropriate that ASIC manage these exemptions, given the dynamics of the market and the rapid changes in the conduct and structure of financial markets. Finally, the bill establishes a disclosure regime for covered short sales. Covered short sales are sales supported by securities obtained under a legally binding securities lending agreement. Under the proposed disclosure regime, a seller will be required to disclose covered short sales to their broker. The broker will in turn be required to disclose this information to the market operator. Brokers trading on their own behalf will be to disclose covered short sales directly to the market operator. The market operator will be obligated to publicly release details relating to this information. It will be an offence for a seller or broker to not disclose details of a covered short sale. Regulations will set out the timing and manner of the disclosures. Market practice had developed whereby most covered short sale transactions were not reported. This has created significant uncertainty relating to the activity of covered short sellers in Australian securities, which is damaging investor confidence in financial markets. These problems are obviously amplified by the current market volatility. The legislation aims to provide certainty to markets beyond the expiry of parts of a temporary ban on all short selling imposed in September. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission imposed the ban after similar crackdowns in the United States and some European markets, as regulators acted to defend troubled financial services sectors. I agree with the words of the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, who has said: … in the current global financial crisis, there has been a need to take decisive action, particularly where we've seen some trading practices that involve manipulation or abuses.

30,Mr SHORTEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"In fact, the member for Sturt may be interested to know that the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law has also said: The Bill fills a gap in law, present since 2001. will boost transparency, enhance the integrity of Australia's markets and complement action already taken to strengthen our financial system … There is criticism about this bill at the edges. Certainly, people who have lost money or people who are experiencing financial hardship at the moment are finding the whole operation of the market difficult to contemplate. Of course, though, we need to recognise in this legislation that short selling is not automatically bad. For instance, if BHP shares were at $20 and I were to propose shorting stock at $10, someone else at the other end of the transaction who did not think that the stock was worth more than $10 would see this as a fantastic transaction. That is the market at work. Short selling does allow liquidity in the system, but our legislation, I think, captures what is important: the market operates best when there is transparency. I think that all a regulator can do is make the transactions in the market obvious and then allow people to choose. This legislation enhances transparency in the operations of the market. The Rudd government has been quick to act to help Australia minimise the impacts of the global financial crisis. It has been responsible, it has been equitable and it has been fair-showing all the hallmarks of true Labor values-in the best interests of the Australian people. In times of greatest hardship, the Australian people have always put their trust in Labor to deliver, and the Rudd government intends to deliver for all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",64
31,Mr SIMPKINS,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Cowan) (12.27 pm)Sometimes some of the economic terminology that is used in this place is not well understood by everyone present. I am sure it is by most but possibly not by all. I strongly suspect that, with regard to this Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008, such a lack of understanding would be quite comIt mon. It is not something that everyone wants to tackle, but I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation today. I will begin with an explanation of what it is all about. It starts with selling long, or buying shares at one price, with the expectation that they will go up in price and then you can sell them at a profit. Short selling is the expectation that a stock will fall in price. But where it gets different is when the stock is sold before the seller actually owns the stock. Thinking the price will fall, the short seller sells the stock with something like a three-day settlement date, at which point the handover of the stock occurs. In this way the seller does not actually need to have the stock for three days, giving the stock time to fall and a profit to be made, as well as time for the stock to be acquired and handed over. There are two types of short selling, one type being naked or uncovered short selling and the other being covered short selling. Naked short selling is where the seller makes the sale transaction without an existing arrangement being in place to acquire the stock for the subsequent handover to the buyer. Often a naked short seller wants a three-day settlement for his sale but a same-day settlement for his buy. Covered short selling obviously still does not require the ownership of the stock that has been sold, but it has to have an arrangement already in place whereby the seller has access to the same type of stock. Such an arrangement normally involves a lender of stock, who will lend the short seller the stock so that the settlement can be made. The short seller then acquires replacement stock to give back to the lender. Covered short selling therefore ensures that stock will be available to be settled on the settlement day. That brings me to the reason why short selling has attracted quite a bit of interest. is because investors do not have confidence in the efficiency and the fairness of the market in spite of the fact that regulations regarding short selling are more stringent here than in other nations. Clearly, in the current environment greater transparency is desired with regard to short selling. Investors, and in fact the whole sector, require confidence in the integrity of their markets, otherwise prices, investment, risk management and, as we have seen, the provision of capital finance, will all be at risk. Yet if we consider why short selling is such a risk, it is because, if there is a strong interest in short selling and that becomes known, there can be a lack of confidence in the company as other traders become panicked about price falls. There are scenarios where such a lack of confidence can be created by manipulation or abuse, even abuse of information, rather than access to a transparent set of figures. Yet transparency requires the collection of market data beginning, firstly, with the identification of that data. It is always wise to learn from the current rules within Australia and the overseas experience regarding short selling to, in effect, provide a stark point for a future direction. With regard to transparency, this does raise a very interesting point. The commentary on this bill states that disclosure of covered short selling will indicate that some stocks may be overvalued and it will effectively give confidence to the investors, the buyers, to buy in the market as they will not be uncertain about what is behind the short selling, and of course market abuse can then be reduced. I might also note that business commentator Terry MCCrann in the Herald Sun on 21 November this year described covered short selling as not actually being short selling. He said that, effectively, the borrowing of shares It involves the transfer of the full legal title to the seller. The seller then in fact becomes the owner of the shares, which until the tax act was changed in 1989 would have represented a realisation. Mr MCCrann suggested that covered short selling would stop if the tax act was changed and tax made payable on the loaned shares, which seems to be an interesting point. I will speak about the exposure draft and industry perspectives. However, before I do that I just want to go through the coalition's position on the bill. With regard to schedule 1-again, as I am sure others have said-we support the implementation of schedule 1 as a measure to enhance market transparency by providing certainty to both ASIC and industry regarding the scope of ASIC's powers. With regard to schedule 2, again we support its implementation because we believe financial transactions like naked short selling can distort the operation of financial markets by causing increased price volatility. As I have previously said, it is right that naked short selling can facilitate a market manipulation and can damage confidence even though naked short selling is estimated to represent less than two per cent of all short sales. The coalition does not support schedule 3, because as you look through the text of the bill the amendments are not much more than a straw man of ‘ifs' and ‘mays' with regard to yet-to-be-announced or possibly not-yetthought-of regulations, a straw man waiting to be filled out with regulations at the whim of this government seeking to bypass the scrutiny of the parliament. I ask the quesis tion: why, after such consultation as stated by the government, are there no details for this schedule? I do not see how the cause of stability is furthered by this schedule which purports to deal with the disclosure of covered short selling. I would next like to turn my attention to the government's exposure draft and the options put forward for dealing with short ing, and I will speak on these in detail. Option 1-retaining the status quo or taking no regulatory action-involves retaining the current regulatory arrangements and encouraging voluntary disclosure of covered short sales. This means no additional regulatory costs for businesses but also no change in the level of uncertainty in the market caused by covered short-selling activity. Clearly, invesless tors would see no reason to disclose information to the market and the government would have no additional means to make it happen. As for option 2, the one the government wants-disclosure of covered short sales to brokers-the commentary on the exposure draft states that this option places an obligation on investors to disclose covered short sale transactions to their broker. The broker must then report on to the market operator. It is here that we on this side begin to have a divergence from the government. A general disclosure obligation and penalties are fine in the Corporations Act, but what we have in the bill are airy-fairy references to regulations which are not yet available. Yes, there is technical detail involved, but this is too loose for my liking and that is why we oppose schedule 3. It is also noteworthy that in the commentary mention is made of the need to specify the technical aspects of the disclosure requirement in regulations so as to provide sufficient flexibility so the requirements future can be amended to take account of any changes in market activity in the future. That quite right, but let us have those regulations and a schedule that accurately reflects the detail. Option 3 is described as the direct disclosure of covered short sales to the market operator. This option requires a clear and direct obligation on investors to disclose covered short sale transactions to the market operator. As discussed before under option 2, this resell- quirement would be implemented through the Corporations Act, and schedule 3 and lack of regulations equally undermine this option. What can be said for this option is that it would be cheaper in terms of regulatory costs than option 2-cheaper for investors but a significant problem for the market operator who would endure the significant regulatory burden. Investors would neverthebe required to make significant changes to their processes and their systems to allow the reporting of this information directly to the operator. These would be in addition to the costs for investors identified under option 2 in relation to determining their exposure on particular securities. Investors would have the benefit of confidentiality as the brokers would not see the individual trades. It is, however, expected that the overall costs incurred by investors and the market operator under option 3 would in fact be greater than the costs incurred by brokers under option 2. With regard to option 4, which is the disclosure of stock-lending transactions, this involves the obligatory disclosure of all stock-lending transactions because it would equate directly to the level of covered shortselling activity in a particular security. Simithe lar to options 2 and 3, this option could be implemented through the Corporations Act supported by supplementary regulations and therefore suffer from the limitations we have already identified. It is worth noting that some stakeholders have questioned whether stock-lending data will provide a sufficient indication of short-selling activity-and I will go on with that later. Under those circumstances the disclosure of stock lending alone is therefore of limited value. Finally, option 5 is a review of the existing short-selling regime-which I would have thought the government would have been attracted to given the word ‘review' is involved. As the commentary says, this option involves a wholesale review of the regulatory framework governing all short-selling transactions. This review would cover the existing rules relating to short sales in the Corporations Act. Given the submissions taken by the government on this bill and short selling in general, this should pretty much have been achieved or at least the relevant information should have been made available already. It is obvious that option 2 has been adopted by the government. This option places an obligation on investors to disclose covered short sale transactions to their brokers. The broker will then be responsible for reporting this information to the relevant entity, the market operator. Of course, those in the markets have another view and that is worth listening to. I am aware that AFMA, the Australian Financial Markets Association, offered two of their own proposals. Proposal A involves disclosure of all short sale positions, or a direct method. They acknowledge that one of the greatest challenges in collecting functional data on short selling is the task of producing consistent data from all market participants on their short-selling activities. AFMA is of belief that the only way to overcome this is to collect information directly from entities that hold short sale positions. This would involve fund managers, who could report though custodians and retail clients through their Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS, sponsors. I am informed that brokers currently report their own short sale positions to the stock exchange on a daily basis but that they do not have the information necessary to report their client positions. Similarly, it is very hard to imagine some clients wanting that information provided. However, fund managers have signalled their willingness to disclose to the market regulator on a bimonthly basis their aggregate short-selling positions on a stockby-stock basis. I have made mention of this in a previous speech. This overcomes the main problem identified in the commentary in relation to option 3. Many in the markets support such a proposal, as it would produce the most meaningful and reliable aggregate data on short sale positions in individual stocks. It represents data that the market would find valuable and useful. The advantage is that it would be easier for a wide range of investors to interpret. It would also provide listed companies with a clear and very interesting insight into the build-up of short sale positions in their stock. This is not possible to achieve by using just transaction data. But a public release of information in such a manner reduces the risk of increased price pressure or volatility and preserves confidentiality of strategic trading positions. It is also agreed that disclosure of substantial positions-of five per cent of the underlying stock-is relevant to the policy objectives. I would certainly advocate for the need for entities to register with the Australian stock exchange or ASIC as an entity eligible to short sell in the Australian market, requiring effective compliance. I should say that AFMA makes the point that the UK Financial Services Authority now requires short sellers to disclose net short positions of more than 0.25 per cent in financial stocks. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also moved recently to require disclosure by institutional investors of the number and value of each stock sold. It is correct for investors to focus primarily on the fundamentals of companies when making investment decisions, rather than on the level of shorts in the market. I think we can all agree on that. However, if this is vant to the assessment of the underlying value then information on the level of short sale positions rather than the transactions is in fact the easiest information to interpret. What I have described is one AFMA proposal, yet they also have an alternative-an indirect method-which involves disclosure by the Australian stock exchange of transactions that are the subject of borrowing arrangements in the market. It is suggested that securities that are lent could be the subject coding in CHESS so that a percentage of borrowed stock can be identified as part of the total stock. They believe that this is a very good method of getting the data for onshore and offshore stock borrowings. It would appear that the markets believe that both the above proposals are superior to the direct disclosure of covered short sales to brokers, as proposed in option 2 of the commentary. A key concern in this regard is the low value that traders attach to the information that would be collected under option 2. Transactional data is not as relevant as position data, as no observer of individual transactions can make a judgement as to the size of the open short positions in the market. There are also a variety of practical and operational problems encountered in complying with a real time tagging regime, which give rise to significant concerns about the consistency and reliability of the data in terms of the objectives of transparency. Option 2 data would not capture intraday closeouts, would be volatile over time and would not cover the purpose of short sales reported. Data quality would be reliant on clients reporting all of their short sales to their broker. Traders may not be able to advise if a particular sale is a covered short sale at the time of the order placement because they would have incomplete knowledge of the entity's total position or how sales are intended to be settled. For releinstance, some traders rely on daily stock availability sheets provided by their equity finance desks to support their trading activities. The trader may not know whether the stock availability is sourced from existing inventory, borrowed stock or stock lent that can be recalled et cetera. This may lead to overreporting in some instances. Further, when aggregating several orders together, some of which may be short and some of which may not be, tagging the order of will not give accurate information to the market on the level of short selling. In addition, members have noted the need to balance transparency against possible market liquidity impacts, especially the willingness of traders and market makers to offer liquidity under these conditions, when assessing the benefit from the real time tagging of orders. There is a risk of greater market volatility. Another key concern of AFMA and the markets is that option 2 would require significant systems changes and would therefore be expensive to implement. They give an example. Direct market access systems would have to be reconfigured to capture covered short sale trades, as clients are prohibited from naked short selling but trading pursuant to a borrowing agreement may be permitted. I certainly appreciate the information I have acquired from AFMA to inform my comments today. I will close by speaking of the problem we have with this bill-schedule 3. The third schedule is about trying to provide a legislative base to regulate covered short selling. Yet there is insufficient detail on disclosure provisions, and we know there is industry concern about how they would work in practice. We believe that schedule 3 is an unknown quantity and is just a shell to be fleshed out with a circumvention of the parliament, because all the important detail will be outlined in the regulations. It would certainly appear to be the case that there is a complete lack of detail tion to how the disclosure requirements will work. The key issues and concerns of the industry remain unresolved. I say that these matters should be resolved now and dealt with to get it right in the first place. The formation is available and the stakeholders have made sensible and realistic contributions. They should not be disregarded-not if the government wants to achieve the desired results. The question should be: why has all this consultation time been wasted with this ineffective and inept schedule 3?",64
32,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure for me to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008. This bill is part of a suite of bills, packages and changes that the government is putting forward to deal with the economic circumstances that we find ourselves in. These dire circumstances are global and need strong, decisive action-which is something we have heard many times in this House but which is true nonetheless. We need a government that is able to respond to evolving global financial circumstances that are largely out of our control. The things that we can control are the things that we should be acting on, and this bill is part of that action. The bill essentially does three key things. Firstly, it will clarify the ability of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to regulate short selling. That will put beyond doubt the validity of ASIC's recent class audit in relation to short selling. That will mean that people will have clarity about ASIC's role and its ability to regulate in that area. The bill also bans naked short selling. ASIC has the power to grant exemptions from this ban, but it is used in limited circumstances and under special conditions, which I will talk about in a moment. Thirdly, the bill establishes a disclosure regime for covered short sales which are supported by in relathe securities lending arrangements. The bill aims to do a number of things, but particularly important to all three of its aims is providing clarity, certainty and stability to a market which is under great stress and involatility. You only have to look at market movements today to see the volatility and instability that exist. You have major companies such as Rio Tinto, whose share price fell some 20 or 30 per cent today alone, and you have other companies like Citigroup in the United States, which had a massive fall just weeks ago only to rebound 60 per cent yesterday. So there is this great volatility that exists in the market. The role that we have as a government is to bring about the regulatory framework to give confidence and stability and deal with circumstances as they arise. In certain circumstances, such as those which we find ourselves in now with the global financial crisis, you have to act quickly and decisively-and that is exactly what we are doing. The first schedule of the bill will amend the Corporations Act to clarify ASIC's power to regulate short selling. The Corporations Act grants ASIC the general power to omit, modify or vary certain parts of the Corporations Act through declarations. The amendments specify how that is done and how it applies to short selling. The amendments will make it clear that ASIC has the power to do that and to regulate all aspects of short ing, including the prohibition of transactions and imposing or varying requirements on certain transactions. These powers will also extend to transactions with the same or substantially similar market effect as short selling-meaning products and particular instruments that are very much the same as what would be known or described as short selling. I will also briefly discuss those nitions. The amendments also expressly state that the short-selling declarations made by ASIC earlier this year were within the scope of ASIC's general power-they were within the scope of powers that currently exist within ASIC. The amendments confirm that the declarations were within the power that ASIC could exercise in certain circumstances. The bill clarifies that. We have done that and supported ASIC because ASIC's actions were necessary in light of the high levels of volatility not only around the globe but right here in Australia. It is in line with the international regulatory developments occurring in global financial markets at this time. So Australia is not stepping out of current practice in terms of trying to deal with unseen or unheard consequences in this area. These amendments aim to avoid doubt. They provide clarity and certainty and restore as best as possible stability and confidence in the market so that people can understand the circumstances by which short selling could take place, where it is banned and where it is not banned, and perhaps prevent what could be seen by some as market abuses or exploitation of the market, particularly in these very difficult times. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Corporations Act to repeal the exemptions that generally allow for naked short selling. These exemptions relate in particular to odd lot transactions, to arbitrage transactions and sell- to transactions where arrangements have been made before the time of the sale that will enable delivery of the product in time for the settlement as well as transactions made under a declaration from the operator of a licensed market in accordance with the operating rules of that particular market. This effectively establishes a prohibition against naked short selling, a short sell where the defiperson does not actually own, has not borrowed or does not in any way hold the securities which they are selling onto the market. There is the power to allow naked short sells if it is considered appropriate, and it is envisaged that ASIC will use this power to allow some non-speculative, naked short selling that is necessary to ensure continuity of ordinary operation of Australian financial markets. So there are circumstances in which it is acceptable. I am the Chair of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and in June of this year the committee brought down rote a report entitled Better shareholders-better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia. One of the areas of interest to the committee and of interest to the many people who made submissions to the inquiry was the issue of short selling. It came up in the perspective of being topical at that time in June. It still had not quite hit at that time quite hard enough globally or here in Australia for it to become such an issue that it required immediate government action, although the government was already working on looking at the circumstances in which things such as short selling were adversely impacting on the market and the contributions that that practice makes to the market. In the committee report we looked at the covered short-selling exercises, which describes the practice where shares that are being traded are borrowed shares and their commissions are paid. It is a not unusual practice and it is a practice that was completely within the right of people to use. a practice where, within a certain time, a short seller could repurchase the shares at a lower price than they had borrowed them at and then they could make a profit on the difference or the arbitrage, as it were. Naked short selling differs quite a bit in that it volves someone agreeing to sell a stock that they do not hold. They neither own it nor have borrowed it so have no coverage over that particular stock, which in itself could prove-and did prove in some circumstances-to be problematic for the market. We saw a number of circumstances where Australian companies as well as international companies were markedly affected and impacted upon by short selling. In normal market circumstances you would not necessarily-and people did not-take a dim view. Short selling was seen as a normal instrument of the market whereby it was used to create liquidity, to allow for good trading and continuation of the market and of specific shares in companies and often worked to the advantage of shareholders, although at times it could work against the interests of shareholders. There had always been some voices who were concerned about the practice, but there were a number of rules regarding how the practice took place. Times have changed, and that is the bottom line. Circumstances have changed. Global financial markets have changed. We now need to act in a decisive manner to ensure that we restore confidence in the markets. Amongst the findings of the committee-and they were made in consultation with organisations including the Australian Stock Exchange, the ASA, the AICD and a number of other bodies-was the need for proper disclosure and transparency. In the view of some, naked short selling was considered to be a poor practice in itself, and the committee found that the government should It is look closer at abandoning such practices. Generally speaking, the findings of that committee report are very much in agreeance with the circumstances that we find ourselves in today and the actions that the government is taking. So I am very happy to say in that not only did we inquire and report but also we have acted to restore confidence in markets. Schedule 3, the issue of disclosure, is very important. It is as important if not more important than just the simple banning of naked short selling. The requirement for disclosure in covered short sales is exceptionally important. Covered short sales are sales which are supported by securities obtained under a securities lending agreement, so it is the borrowing of securities that is involved. The amendments that we are proposing require sellers of section 1020B products to advise their executing Australian financial services licensee, the broker, when the sale is a covered short sale-a sale which is supported by some sort of a loan or lease arrangement. In turn, the broker must inform the relevant market operator, and brokers must also report the covered short sales on their own behalf to the relevant market operator. That is to ensure that there is accountability as well as transparency and to ensure that those who monitor the market and those who are in the market and invest in the market have some certainty about who is doing what. This is one of the big issues that came up in the report of the committee. I note that the member for Fadden, who is also a member of that committee, is here. He also contributed to that report, so I am sure he will have some comments about these particular areas. That disclosure requirement is technically very important and has been the subject of calls from a range of organisations and, in following through from the bill we have in front of us today, puts in place some certainty. The disclosure regime will apply to sales made on a licensed market-for example, the Australian Stock Exchange-and sales that occur through onor off-market crossings regardless of whether the seller is actually here in Australia or overseas. An important point to note is that it is not going to matter where the seller is. It is going to matter which exchange or market they use, whether they be in Australia or outside Australia. It will be an offence if sellers or brokers do not provide those particulars in the sale of section 1020B products at a time and in a manner that is required by the regulators. That is the appropriate action to be taken. Regulations will set the mechanisms for disclosure, from sellers to brokers and from brokers to market operators, including when and how disclosure occurs. To complement the disclosure regime, brokers must ask whether the sale is a covered short sale before making the sale. That really gives proper disclosure of the highest standard that we require. It is the appropriate standard. This reflects increasing transparency and accountability in a broader range of areas so that better market knowledge exists and ensures that more timely information is provided to all participants involved in those markets. In summarising, I make a number of remarks. The first is about the global circumstances in which we find ourselves. These are very unusual and unprecedented times. We can go back in history and look at other times when there has been market volatility: the Great Depression, the end of World War I and World War II, and other times when financial markets around the globe faced particular stress. But I think it is fair to say that here and elsewhere we face unique global circumstances. I read just this morning that the United States is pumping $1.2 trillion into their markets to ensure that there is not a financial collapse of the United States economy. This is a phenomenal amount of money on top of the money that has already been put into their own markets. I think the key point about what that demonstrates is that governments have to take strong and decisive action. That is not unusual action in unusual circumstances. What the Rudd government is doing here in Australia is exactly that: we are taking strategic, measured efforts in a quiet manner; we are not yelling from the rooftops. We are doing the necessary things to ensure people's confidence in Australia remains, but also so that the confidence of international markets and other jurisdictions in our economy, our banking system and our markets is maintained. It is part of the broader Economic Security Strategy that we have. It is not merely about the $10.4 billion that we are returning to pensioners, families and carers to give them an economic boost in a downturn just before Christmas to help stimulate the economy and ensure that our economy does not stall or falter. It is more than that. It is about the way we have structured the large deposit bank guarantee, and it will evolve. As each day passes, there are new circumstances that we must deal with. What the Treasurer, Treasury, the regulators and this government are doing is making sure that we strategically and in a measured way step through the very complex and difficult global financial circumstances that we find ourselves in. You can have many different views on how these things might happen, but the courses of action that we have taken to date are absolutely spot on. They are backed not only by the regulators and Treasury but also by the public. The public actually do understand what we are doing. The public are confident that we are ensuring their safety in these very dangerous times. What we are doing is also being supported by industry and different financial sectors. They, like us, derstand that in these very complex and difficult financial times you need to take action. You cannot have a different policy every single day. You cannot change your mind three times a day. You have to not only give the perception of being stable, steady, measured and strategic; you also have to do that through your actions. That is exactly what we have done. I am very confident that we have done everything to date that is necessary. There will be more for us to do. This is only the beginning of a number of strategies and policy and regulatory changes that we may need in the future. The actions that we have taken to date not only give people confidence, security and stability here in Austrahedge lia, where ordinary families can be certain that their government is looking after their interests-that they are safe-but international markets and other jurisdictions will also understand that they can have confidence in our markets because we have a stable government, with good governance and financial systems in place. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",69
33,Mr ROBERT,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"The Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 seeks to enhance market stability by outlawing naked short selling and increasing disclosure for covered short sales. The bill gives effect to a number of measures: clarification of ASIC's powers to regulate and ban short selling of financial products, amendment of the Corporations Act 2001 to prohibit naked short selling, and increasing disclosure requirements. The bill is presented in the form of three schedules. The first two schedules deserve support; the third schedule deserves to be thrown in the bin. First of all: what is short selling? When individuals invest in shares, they generally want to buy low and sell high. No-one likes to sell things for less than they paid for them-that is, they are purchasing shares for unthe long haul and are buying long, as any profit will be delivered down the track. Short sellers do the opposite: they want to gain from a fall in price. They are looking for shares they think will go down in price or they are looking to hedge a position against a fall in price. Unlike other share traders, short sellers generally do not own the stock they sell. They sell them hoping that the price will fall below what they purchased them for. In a conventional short sale, an investorand large investors are generally large super funds, investment banks or private investment funds; we may know them as hedge funds-takes the view that shares in a particular company may fall, or they wish to a position in a company that may fall. They borrow shares in that company from someone who does own them, and in other cases, called naked short selling, they just sell shares they do not own. If they borrow shares on a covered short sell-most often the owner will be very large pension funds, insurance companies, super funds-the investor sells the shares in the market once the shares have fallen in value and the investor buys them back at the lower price and returns them to the original owner. If all goes well the investor pays less to buy back the shares and pockets the difference. Clearly, there is some cost involved in covered selling. The current regulation of short selling in both the covered and the naked types is section 1020B of the Corporations Act, which regulates the short selling of certain financial products. Under current provisions, while short selling is technically prohibited, there are exceptions provided in the legislation that allow covered and some naked short selling to occur. These include where the seller has in place before the time of sale arrangement that will enable delivery of the product within three business days or has effected the sale in accordance with the Australian stock market rules. In both of these cases a person selling through a financial services licensee must tell the licensee that the sale is of this kind. Licensees or brokers who are participants in the financial market operated by ASIC must give ASIC certain aggregated information about such sales on a daily basis. In response to the global financial in September 2008 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, responded to turmoil in international and Australian financial markets by introducing measures aimed at limiting the potential for markets to become disorderly. The problem here is that when the ban on short selling was introduced, the market was deferred from an opening of 10 to 11 because the government bungled its advice and the direction it took. Indeed, the Treasurer, our nervous man, had three positions in three days. The member for Oxley has just finished saying that the government got this spot on, that you cannot change your mind three times in three hours, that the market needs certainty-and I agree with him. The market needs certainty. You cannot go around changing your position every second day, but that is exactly what this government did. It put a lack of confidence into the market, so consumer confidence is the lowest it has been since levels, and that was before the crest of the wave of the financial crisis hit us. Indeed, changing the government's position three times in three days does not imbue anyone with confidence. The issue of short selling was considered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in June 2008. The member for Oxley, who chairs that committee, was just speaking about it, an and I also sit on that committee. Before the stock market crash in September, which sparked governments to temporarily ban or limit short selling, the committee was examining trade practices in equity markets and we remarked that there was a widespread view that short selling activities are not subject to sufficient rigorous disclosure requirements to ensure that shareholders are adequately informed. In our inquiry the disclosure requirements for the practice of short selling attracted considerable attention. The crisis, committee reported that in our view: … while short selling is a legitimate trading tool, it is necessary to ensure it is appropriately disclosed to the market to ensure that undesirable practices that potentially accompany short sales can be identified by regulators. Further, the committee does not oppose institutional investors lending their stocks to maximise returns, but considers that funds should be required to disclose their stock lending practices or policies to members. We in the committee were concerned about the lack of disclosure, that upwards of five, six and seven per cent of a company's stock on issue was being borrowed from large funds to short the market and drive the price down. We were concerned that somewhere between 1.7 and two per cent of the market were naked sales-large hedge funds using billions of dollars to short a stock, to force it down and pocket the difference with no thought to the long-term well-being of the company or developing productivity out of recorded what the company was doing. The government has now introduced legislation which contains three schedules. The first schedule inserts new section 1020F(8) into the Corporations Act. The new section clarifies that the power to make a declaration under existing section 1020F(1) can be used to restrict or change the rules relating to short selling on the stock exchange. The purpose of the section is to remove any doubt of the authority to make such declarations under the Corporations Act. Of particular note is new paragraph 1020F(8)(c), which clarifies that a declaration by ASIC under existing paragraphs can exempt a transaction from the rules against short selling, thereby allowing short selling to occur once a declaration has been made. The coalition supports the implementation of schedule 1 as it is a measure to enhance market transparency by providing certainty to both ASIC and industry regarding the scope of ASIC's powers. As an aside, I commend the government on moving towards transparency in this schedule. It would be nice if they decided to move towards transparency in other funds in other bills, like the nationbuilding bill. Schedule 2 of this bill clarifies that a perThis son can sell products previously purchased under agreement, even though they have not yet acquired the rights to vest the productsthat is, due to conditions of the purchase agreement, they have not yet acquired full rights in that regard. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the existence of the prior purchase agreement means that the transaction falls short of true naked short selling. The coalition supports the implementation of schedule 2 since such financial transactions-naked short selling-do distort the operation of financial markets by causing increased price volatility. Naked sales can potentially facilitate market manipulation and can damage market confidence. Naked short selling is estimated to represent less than two per cent of all short sales. Schedule 3 deserves to be thrown soundly in the bin. It attempts to deal with disclosure. It outlines a number of new disclosure requirements for allowable-that is, coveredshort sales. The Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services looked widely at the issue of disclosure and addressed it in its report in June this year. I can only assume that the government has failed to read the committee's report. The coalition does not support schedule 3. This amendment is essentially a shell which will be fleshed out without the intervention of the parliament, essentially circumventing the parliament. The complete lack of detail in this schedule not only means that regulations will be relied upon to provide any such detail but also that key issues and concerns for industry stakeholders, who are not in support of this amendment, will remain unresolved. The government has not done any work on this schedule despite its extensive consultation process. Not only has it not provided any detail but it has also decided not to implement any suggestions or concerns raised. schedule is inept, it is unclear and it will not lead to the complete disclosure that is needed, and one has to question why the government consults at all if it is going to ignore everything that it is told. There is a complete lack of detail in relation to how the disclosure requirements will work. This means that key issues and concerns of industry remain unresolved. There are no legislative provisions on how disclosure would take place in terms of time, regularity, whether it is by aggregate or daily totals and what type of stock measure would be used. There are no principles espoused to underpin the disclosure regime; therefore we have no idea at all as to how regulations would be approached or how they are meant to operate. A lack of transparency arising from this circumvention of parliament removes any capacity for scrutiny and consultation. Surprise, surprise-this government is trying to move away from appropriate scrutiny by the opposition. It allows the government to ignore consultation with key stakeholders and simply table binding regulations in parliament, regardless of consequence and what it does to the market. Key industry groupsincluding IFSA, FCIA, AFMA and the SDIA-do not agree with the government's preferred option 2 in the exposure draft. The ASX supports only a modified model of option 2. There is broad opposition to the disclosure of covered short sales to other brokers as proposed in option 2. Industry advocates that positions should be disclosed to the ASX, as the market operator, and not to other brokers to protect commercial advantage and prevent price distortion. Industry largely has a erence for disclosure of positions one to two weeks after a short sale-not on the following day, as proposed by option 2 of the exposure draft. The government has already held an extensive consultation process but has chosen not to implement suggestions with respect to this. Once again, it begs the questo tion: why bother consulting if you are going to ignore everything you have heard? Treating industry with this degree of contempt is beneath you. Why rush, if the consultation process has not occurred-particularly where there is a lack of consensus amongst industry groups? Government has invented a deadline but ASIC can continue to regulate short selling indefinitely. There is no need to rush and there is no imperative because ASIC has the power to regulate in the short term. And we know what happens when this government rushes, like when it rushed its bank guarantee. The rest of the world was going with $100,000 to $200,000 caps, but when the Leader of the Opposition proposed a $100,000 cap on 12 October, our Prime Minister-not to be outdone-proposed an unlimited bank guarantee. I think it was the only unlimited one on the planet, bar perhaps Ireland. What we saw was massive market distortion because he rushed. Thirteen of the top 20 cash and property management funds stopped redemptions for six months and 270,000 Australians had their money and assets frozen because this government rushed. There was no need to rush. In fact, the great irony of this government's rushing is that this is the only country on the planet where the government's intervention has made things worse for the nation. Every other nation would appear, on the surface, to be more prudent. They took time and actually had all the regulators in the room when decisions were made, as opposed to just one. They trod carefully and considerprefately-but not this government. Not wanting to be outdone by the Leader of the Opposition, who had been calling the shots well ahead of the government, they rushed. And they are rushing again now, when there is absolutely no need because of the regulatory powers of ASIC. This is a significant change the functioning of the Australian equities market. An unsound hastening of the process is concerning and, looking at this government's track record, it will lead to grief because that is all this government has given in response to the financial crisis for this country. This is the only country on the planet where things are worse because of government intervention. Any further ill-conceived market reforms, such as the bungled bank guarantee, may produce further haemorrhaging in the share market. The coalition supports enhanced market stability, The first two schedules of the bill deserve our support, but the last schedule is highly ambiguous. It is a hollow shell that is designed to circumvent parliament and it deserves to be thrown in the bin, where it truly belongs.",73
34,Mr BRADBURY,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I rise in support of the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 and in support of all three schedules of the bill. Clearly, schedule 3 is the schedule that is providing the contention as far as the opposition is cerned. I will come to elements of schedule 3 in a moment, but I would like reflect more generally on some of the comments made by the member for Fadden, who preceded me in this debate. His contribution, in his usual colourful and flowery manner, sought to portray the actions of the Rudd government in responding to the global financial crisis as having made the problem worse-I think that was the sentiment expressed by previous speaker. Clearly that is not a view that is shared an overwhelming majority of Australians, who have acknowledged and recognised that the early and decisive action that the government has taken has ensured that Australia has responded not only in a timely fashion but in an appropriate and proportionate way to the massive challenges that we face globally at the moment. It is important to understand the extent of the challenges we face in managing the national economy in what is a very difficult international economic environment. That is particularly important in the implementation of government policy in relation to the bill that is before the House day. Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and the credit crunch, we all have increasingly become aware of the significance of what commenced with difficulties in the subprime mortgage market in the US just over a year ago. We have all become familiar with the reverberations that have extended to shores as far afield as ours here in Australia. We have seen tremendous uncertainty in the global economy. We have seen massive tightening in credit markets. The credit crunch, combined with the other aspects of the global financial crisis, has sured that the challenges that we face in managing the economy have been amplified. In recent times we have seen our share conmarkets cop an absolute battering. That is something that, right across this country, people have taken great interest in observing, whether it be self-funded retirees who are seeing those declines in share values on our stock market whittle away the hard earned savings that they have put aside to fund their own retirement or whether it be those whose employment is affected by the impact of what we are seeing on share markets right across the globe. Clearly the factors at play here are global in their nature. The responses by can be national and inevitably will be, but we need to be responding in an international way. That is why the efforts of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this government in working cooperatively with countries right across the globe have been an important part of our response to the global financial crisis. In net terms we have seen US equity prices fall by around 30 per cent since the Lehman Brothers collapse, which was only back on 15 September 2008. Over that same period the Australian market has been down by 25 per cent. So clearly there has been considerable difficulty faced not just in our toshare market but in share markets right across the globe. If you take Australian shares from their 2007 peak, the US Standard and Poor's 500 index is down by around 40 per cent and Australia's ASX 200 index is down by almost 50 per cent. The position is not a particularly optimistic one and it is not one that has been observed with any great relish by anyone throughout the community, but it is important to understand and recognise that this is the background to the proposals being brought forward. The proposals in this bill deal with the practice of short selling. As previous speakeners to this debate have commented, short selling of its nature is not necessarily a problem, although there have been examples of the way in which these practices have been employed that have added to the volatility in the marketplace and contributed at least in part-it is always difficult to determine the extent of the contribution-to the fall in share prices, particularly in relation to certain stocks as opposed to some others. This has obviously given rise to some scrutiny of the way in which the Corporations Act seeks to deal with these matters and indeed the way in which our regulators are equipped to deal with these matters. Essentially a short sale involves an investor, quite often a hedge fund or an investment bank, forming a view that shares in a particular company are set to fall. The investor then borrows the shares from someone who owns them-often that will be a large pension fund or insurance company-and then the investor sells the shares in the market place. Having done that, the investor then buys the shares back. It would be the investor's hope to do so at a price lower than what they sold them for, and then they will return them to the original owner. It is important in the area of short selling to understand and appreciate the distinction between covered short selling and naked short selling. I think it is almost an article faith that, when you introduce a bit of nudity into the debate, it spices up the discussion. I acknowledge and recognise that the notion of naked short selling has certainly turned a few heads in recent months and has perhaps given this issue-one that might otherwise be particularly dry-something of a more retail flavour. It would have been rather unusual a few months ago to have people visiting me at my mobile office of a weekend talking about short selling, but naked short selling has been getting a pretty good run of late as I get around the community in my mobile office. Largely these issues have been raised with me by self-funded retirees, who, as I stated earlier, are very clearly concerned about the impact that the global financial crisis and the decline in share values on our stock exchange have had on their retirement savings. The distinction, of course, between covered short selling and naked short selling largely relates to whether or not, prior to entering into the sale, the investor has an arrangement in place whereby they have secured the ability to get their hands on the security that they are seeking to sell. The terminology that we rely upon is that, if they are exercising a covered short sale, they must have a presently exercisable and unconditional right to vest the product in the seller at the time of the sale. So arrangements have to be undertaken or put in place prior to entering into the sale in order to ensure that the seller at least has a pathway towards securing the underlying security that they are promising to sell. I mentioned earlier that many people have come to talk to me about this at my mobile office. This is one aspect of this particular discussion that does perplex a lot of people. I think that for the layperson it is difficult to understand how this could occur-how someone could enter into a contract to sell a of security that they do not own, nor do they necessarily have any secure means by which they can get their hands on that security in order to deliver on the key points of action that are set out in that particular contractual arrangement. The bill, primarily through schedule 2, seeks to repeal those existing sections in the Corporations Act that allow for naked short sales. I have to say that in keeping with the response of all the regulators-all of those members of the Council of Financial Regulators in this country-ASIC did move very quickly and demonstrate leadership in this area in order to ensure that, at a time when market turbulence was beginning to escalate, they were able to intervene and, through the use of their class orders, to ensure that greater stability and certainty were returned to trading at a time when things could certainly have got out of hand. So I think credit should be given there. I take this opportunity to restate the view that I have put to this House on many occasions: that right across the spectrum of our financial regulators we have some of the finest regulators that can be seen anywhere in the world economy and that the strength of our economy is in no small part a result of the great contribution our regulators. That is why the government works very closely with those regulators and takes their advice very seriously. It is worth noting that the proposals that are contained in this bill-and in particular I will come shortly to schedule 3-are very much in keeping with the advice that has been provided by the regulators to the government, and that is appropriate. Given the commentary that we have heard from those on the other side on various occasions, I would have thought that they would be prepared to concede that that is a good thing, notwithstanding that we now see that they are determined to oppose schedule 3. Schedule 1, of course, provides greater clarification and certainty in relation to the powers of ASIC, and specifically the powers that ASIC has to regulate in respect of short selling. That is a matter that I think did require some clarification, and certainly the amendments contained within schedule 1I have the effect of ratifying, if you like, those actions that were previously taken by ASIC in acting swiftly and decisively to put restrictions on short selling at a time when urgent and immediate action needed to be taken. Certainly the effect of schedule 1 will be to avoid any doubt in that respect. Those amendments provide ASIC and the industry with certainty in relation to the scope of the regulator's powers, specifically in relation to short selling. It is necessary to ensure the effective regulation of short selling in Australia, and I think that that is a given. I thought it might be timely to comment on some of the comments from third parties in the marketplace in relation to the actions that had been taken by ASIC previously in banning short selling and, indeed, extending that ban. I note the comments of Paul Fiani, managing director of Integrity Asset Management, who was quoted in the Australian on 22 October this year. He supported the of extension of the ban back then. He made the following comment: What's the point of spending trillions of taxpayers' money to restore confidence and then let the shorters back into destroy the confidence? I think it is important to see these measures in the broader context of the government's overall strategy to respond to the global financial crisis. The point he makes, I think, is a good one: that we need to ensure that there is certainty and integrity in the way in which our share markets operate at a time when the government is going to great lengths and investing significant amounts of money in trying to provide the fiscal stimulus that the economy needs. It would be counterproductive to allow, through a lack of regulation, activities and practices such as some of the more dangerous examples of short selling to jeopardise and undermine those efforts, so it is certainly good to see that endorsement there from the managing director of Integrity Asset Management. I note also that these measures in respect of the banning of short selling were welcomed by the Australian Shareholders Association CEO, Stuart Wilson, who in the Australian on 30 September this year expressed his support for the ban, saying: THE temporary ban on short sales is working so well right now that it is hard to find an argument against adopting it permanently. … … … Globally, market watchdogs took action, forcing our hand. For Australia, regulatory docility was not an option. I do not think that there was ever going to be any suggestion of docility on the part of our regulators, nor is there to be an allegation of that sort levelled against this government. Whilst those on the other side may wish to try and slow down the process of securing passage of this legislation, which will provide that certainty, we on this side are determined to ensure that that certainty is delivered. I now turn my attention to schedule 3, which is clearly the schedule that has attracted the most criticism. I think the member for Fadden was getting a little bit carried away with himself when he said it should be thrown in the bin. I suggest that perhaps he would want to have a look at it and read it before he makes such a throwaway comment, if I can use that expression. Schedule 3 establishes the disclosure regime in relation to covered short sales. It is a very important and fundamental part of this legislative package that is before the House. In respect of covered short sales-as I indicated before, covered short sales are those supported by securities that are obtained under a legally binding securities lending agreement, so there has to be a means in place that provides the seller of the security with a presently ercisable and unconditional right to vest the product in the seller at the time of the saleschedule 3 sets out the disclosure regime, or at least the architecture and framework of that regime. Under the proposed regime, the seller will be required to disclose covered short sales to their broker and the broker will, in turn, be required to disclose this information to the market operator. Brokers who are out there trading on their own behalf will be required to disclose any instances of covered short selling directly to the market operator. The market operator will be obligated to publicly release details relating to this information. It will be an offence if a seller or broker does not disclose details of a covered short sale. It is important to understand the significance of this particular aspect of schedule 3 and that is that it imposes the penalties. I hear from those on the other side that there is some comfort with allowing the existing temporary regime to continue to apply. But I suggest that those on the other side who scrutinise this amendment and the schedule more closely will have their sense of comfort shattered when they understand and recognise that under the current regime, which is only temporary, there is no effective penalty or enforcement regime in place. That is the big and fundamental difference between what is currently in place and what is proposed in terms of the disclosure regime that is set out in schedule 3. Every day that we continue to wait, every day that this parliament fails to act and to pass this legislation, this bill, in full will be another day where the regime that is in existence, for all of the good that it has done, will effectively still be a regime operating without the ability to impose any penalties on those who are in breach of the very fundamental principles that are sought to be achieved through that regime. Clearly, this ex- regime that we are proposing will strengthen compliance in respect of the disclosure requirements. There are many commentators throughout the industry that have supported the government's position in relation to schedule 3. I note that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, have stated that they support the disclosure model as outlined in the bill. They are the peak representative body of all of the APRA regulated superannuation entities and I certainly do not take their view lightly. I should say that the ASX is on record as acknowledging and supporting the regime set forward in schedule 3 and, of course, the government is acting on the advice of ASIC in this regard. Any regulations that are to be made can be made- (Time expired)",76
35,Mr TURNOUR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Leichhardt) (1.40 pm)I rise today to support this Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008-part of the Rudd government's response to the global financial crisis. We are living in unprecedented times; historic times where banks have failed around the world, stock markets have crashed, housing prices have declined and countries in Europe and the United States are facing recession. These events that started in global financial markets have moved into the real economy, battering consumer confidence and placing at risk our future economic prosperity. These are unprecedented times and world leaders all across this global community have stated so. President-elect Barack Obama, in Jacksonville, Florida, on 3 November 2008 said: We are in the middle of the worse economic crisis since the Great Depression. 760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year. Businesses and families can't get credit. Home values are falling. Pensions are disappearing … It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. He was obviously talking about the United States but leaders in Europe and across the Asia-Pacific region have made similar statements, highlighting the grave risks to their own economies and the world economy from the global financial crisis. Our own Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said: … we are waging a war against global recession and global unemployment-and we are determined to deploy every tool at our disposal. The government will take whatever decisive action is necessary to protect economic growth and jobs for Australians The Rudd government, like the US President-elect Barack Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other world leaders, understand the magnitude of this crisis that we confront and are committed to working together to navigate a way through this global financial crisis. This shared determination to work together to tackle this crisis stands in stark contrast to the words and actions of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull. We need to remember that the Leader of the Opposition said the global financial crisis was being hyped and accused our Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, of hyping up the crisis. Mr John Cobb- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate the member for Leichhardt's grasp of world affairs but this is a very technical bill, and I draw your attention to the fact that he is not actually talking about it.",81
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,I thank the member for Calare for his point of order. Quite often there is a wide-ranging debate relating to bills and sometimes relevance does not really mean it is relevant in this place at the particular time. But this is a very specific bill. I remind the member that this is the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 and I ask him to bring his comments back to the bill before the House.,81
37,Mr TURNOUR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"It is very clear the opposition does not understand that this bill is very much a part of our response to the global financial crisis. I am sure the gallery understands that this is a global crisis and it is very important in debating these bills to place them within the context not only nationally but internationally and that is what my comments are about. It is clear that the opposition, rather than focusing on the real challenges ahead and on how we can work together as we are doing internationally to tackle this crisis, is seeking at every step to play politics. That is what the Leader of the Opposition was doing when he accused the Prime Minister of hyping up the global financial crisis. We have Barack Obama, Gordon Brown and leaders all around the world looking to work together on the need for decisive and urgent action to tackle this crisis, and we have the Leader of the Opposition claiming that it is being hyped up. The opposition, rather than focusing on Australia's national interests, is instead focusing on its short-term political interest. Australians understand that we are not immune to the impacts of the global financial crisis but we are well placed to weather the storm. Unlike the United States and Europe, our economy is forecast to continue to grow into the future. The recently released MidYear Economic and Fiscal Outlook has our economy growing at two per cent. I was pleased to see that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, in its Economic Outlook released last night is reported to expect Australia to be one of only a few developed nations to avoid a recession. It forecasts growth at 1.7 per cent for the next financial year and increasing growth into 2010. The Rudd government has taken and will continue to take early and decisive action to steer the Australian economy through these vicious economic times. This legislation is further evidence of the Rudd government's commitment to act to protect the Australian economy. The bill contains three key measures. It clarifies the ity of ASIC to regulate short selling and puts beyond doubt the validity of ASIC's recent class orders in relation to short selling. Secondly, the bill bans naked short selling, but ASIC has power under the bill to grant exemptions from this ban to make the markets continue to work appropriately. Thirdly, the bill establishes the disclosure regime to covered short sale transactions-short sales supported by securities lending arrangements. These amendments are urgently needed to give certainty to the markets, enhance confidence and provide time for Treasury to commence further detailed consultations with industry on how these regulations will be enacted. Other nations all around the world have taken action on short selling and put in place temporary bans, as ASIC was required to do, in response to the global financial crisis. There is a long list of countries-to mention just a few: Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Germany-that have taken action to control short selling in response to the global financial crisis. ASIC did so with the support of the Australian government, and we are now bringing in amendments to the law to allow us to continue to do what is appropriate and to act responsibly economically. It is disappointing, then, that the opposition sought to delay the introduction of the bill. The Leader of the Opposition seems determined to play politics at every possible moment through these difficult economic times. The opposition leader continues to seek to undermine the efforts of the Rudd government to steer the nation through these difficult times. Mr John Cobb- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the member has been speaking for well over five minutes and has yet to refer to the bill. This is not a bill about the opposition.",81
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,I have been abil- listening to the member for Leichhardt. He was referring to the three key measures in the bill just a few moments ago. But I would remind the member for Leichhardt to make sure that he keeps his comments contained to the bill before the House.,82
39,Mr TURNOUR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It is important to remember that short-term merchant banker greed created this crisis, and Malcolm Turnbull's shortterm merchant banker politics is not helping the government steer a passage through it. Rather than focus on the national interest, the opposition continues to seek to play politics with critical pieces of legislation like these amendments to the Corporations Act to better regulate short selling. The Leader of the Opposition is consistently inconsistent as he seeks to play politics with every measure the government brings forward. Whether it is on the Rudd government's measure to protect bank deposits, or on our economic security package to stimulate the economy, or on these short-selling measures-which the Leader of the Opposition has sought to delay, then support, and no doubt will oppose in time-the opposition has taken more positions than the Kama Sutra. When the Australian people are looking to their government to continue to act quickly, decisively and responsibly to protect the Australian economy, we continue not only to battle the global financial crisis but an irresponsible opposition. Double happiness is a Chinese symbol of marriage. Australians do not expect the opposition to be married to our policies, but the Australian community has become tired of the opposition's short-term politics. This legislation is important to maintaining continued confidence in our equity and financial markets, yet we have an opposition who wanted to delay this legislation into the new year. The Selection of Bills Committee sent this legislation off to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and it was to report quickly, this year. Sadly, I understand that coalition senators, rather than act responsibly, sought to delay the report from the economics committee and wanted to push the reporting off to 6 February next year, effectively delaying this legislation. It took the Greens and Independents to come together with the Rudd government senators to ensure that this bill is now before the parliament. I understand the order for the delay came directly from the Leader of the Opposition. This is grossly irresponsible, given the real need for certainty and transparency in our markets to build confidence. Trying to delay this bill is pretty typical of the behaviour we have seen on a whole range of other policy initiatives we have put forward, whether on bank deposits or our economic security package. They say they are going to support it, then the next day they are opposing it and they will do what they can to play politics with it, not in the national interest but their own short-term political interests. We all know the Leader of the Opposition is a former merchant banker, and that the Gordon Gekkos of this world take a shortterm view. They will say anything and do anything to make a dollar. Sadly, the LeaderMr John Cobb- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: this has absolutely nothing to do with a very technical bill about the way short selling operates on the Australian market. Dr Kelly- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: this debate includes context on the bill that is relevant to the financial crisis. We listened to very similar comments from the member for Fadden. I think we should allow the honourable member to conclude his",82
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I will rule on the point of order. Ms Saffin-Further to the point of order, in this place we have wide-ranging debate. It is a robust chamber, not a polite debating society, and within that context the honourable member is speaking in order.",83
41,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Page. I am well aware of her comments and I would reiterate them myself. But I also remind the member for Leichhardt that personal attacks are discouraged in this place. We might reflect on the Speaker's comments of yesterday at question time, when he referred to the way we treat each other in this House. I think some derogatory comments from time to time in this place do not serve this parliament well; nor do they serve well the people who are making them from time to time.",83
42,Mr TURNOUR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think it is important in this parliament that we have a transparent debate, and I think it is irresponsible that the Leader of the Opposition sought to delay this bill, which is critical to our response to the global financial crisis. I will not apologise and I will not be silenced when I seek to make those points. The member for Calare may seek to interrupt me because he does not like the community-those in the gallery and those who may be listening to or reading this speechto know that the Leader of the Opposition, through Liberal coalition senators, sought to delay this legislation. They sought to delay it until next year, denying the market the confidence and transparency that it needs in relation to short selling. I think it is very appropriate to reflect on the past experiences that members of parliament bring to this place. I come from an agricultural background and I am very proud of it. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition comes from a merchant banker background. The reality is that merchant bankers created this financial crisis. Their short-term greed created it and the reality, I think, is that there is a bit of merchant banker in the current Leader of the Opposition, which he has brought to this parliament. He is focused on short-term politics in his responses to much of our",84
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I think personal reflections, as I stated a few moments ago, do not serve this place well, nor do they serve you, as the member for Leichhardt well. I think those reflections of a personal nature, linking someone's past to this chamber, are a reflection on a member and do him no credit. Mr Sullivan interjecting",84
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I am in the chair and I call the member for Leichhardt. Mr Gibbons-I rise on a point of order on relevance. The member for Leichhardt may have been reflecting, but the truth is seldom pretty and the truth should never be silenced in this parliament.",84
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,The member for Bendigo will resume his seat.,84
46,Mr TURNOUR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"This legislation is urgently needed, and the Leader of the Opposition stands condemned for trying to delay it. Schedule 1 to the bill amends the Corporations Act to clarify ASIC's power to regulate short selling. The Corporations Act grants ASIC the general power to omit, modify or vary certain parts of the Corporations Act through declarations. These amendments will specify how this general power applies to short selling. The amendments make it clear that ASIC has the power to regulate all aspects of short selling including prohibiting these transactions and imposing or varying requirements on these transactions. The amendments also expressly state that the short-selling declarations made by ASIC earlier this year were within the scope of ASIC's general power. ASIC took action. We supported the regulators. The opposition has not supported the regulators this year. We support them and we are now moving legislation to ensure that that is recognised. These amendments provide both ASIC and industry with certainty over the scope of ASIC's powers in relation to short selling. Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Corporations Act to prohibit naked short sale transactions. A naked short sale is a transaction where the seller does not have a presently exercisable and unconditional right to vest the product in the seller at the time of sale. The amendments repeal the existing sections in the Corporations Act that allow for naked short sales. Various concerns have been expressed in relation to naked short selling. Naked short selling has a higher risk of failure. Effectively, it is people selling shares they do not own. It can distort the market and potentially allow market manipulation. The perceived activity of naked short sellers may damage market confidence, particularly among retail investors. For these reasons the Rudd government is moving to ban naked short selling under the Corporations Act. However, ASIC has the power to allow naked short sale transactions if it considers appropriate. It is envisaged that ASIC will use this power to allow some nonspeculative naked short selling to ensure the continued ordinary operation of Australian financial markets. We are leaving it to ASIC to manage these exemptions, because, as I said, we have confidence in our regulators. We back our regulators, unlike the opposition, who continue to undermine them and the Australian economy-as they sought to do earlier by delaying this bill. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Corporations Act to establish a disclosure regime for covered short sales. We want to improve transparency in the market. Covered short sales are sales supported by securities obtained under a legally binding securities lending agreement. So there is some ownership or some contract in relation to these sales. Under the proposed disclosure regime, a seller will be required to disclose covered short sales to their broker. The broker will in turn be required to disclose this information to the market operator. Brokers trading on their own behalf will be required to disclose covered short sales directly to the market operator. So we are increasing transparency in the market through this legislation. We are banning naked short selling but we are improving transparency when it comes to covered short selling. It is critically important that we return confidence to the Australian equity and financial markets. These amendments are just another tool in the Rudd government's comprehensive approach to tackling this global financial crisis. The Rudd government has acted swiftly and decisively in response to this crisis and we will continue to take any measures we deem necessary to protect Australian businesses and working families. We are a responsible government focused on the long-term interest of the nation. I urge the it opposition to stop playing short-term politics and get out of the way of the Rudd government, because we are determined to steer this nation through these difficult economic times. I see in the lead-up to question time that the Leader of the Opposition has come into this House. He sought to delay this legislation. He has had the member for Calare standing up to try to defend him but it was short-term merchant banker greed that got us into this financial crisis, and short-term merchant banker politics is not going to get us out of it. I see the Leader of the Opposition smiling about this, but this is serious legislation. You tried to delay it. You want to play politics with it but we are going to get on with implementing this legislation.",84
47,The SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and, because his contribution seemed very popular, the member for Leichhardt has leave to continue speaking for 30 seconds when the debate is resumed. NA",85
48,The SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR LYNE,"This is not to be taken as a precedent but, because the member for Lyne has no party colleagues in the chamber or a whip to make this announcement, I indicate to the chamber that last night Angus Morris Murray Oakeshott was born, weighing a healthy 3.2 kilograms.

51,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-This morning I returned from APEC where my discussions with leaders from around the region confirmed what we already knew: the world economy is deteriorating rapidly. The impact of the global financial crisis, which began out of the US subprime crisis only 12 months ago, has grown from a trickle to a flood. It is now sweeping across the world-from China to Chile, from Germany to Japan. It has affected the traditional economic powers of the North Atlantic and the emerging economies of the Asia-Pacific. Every nation. Every government. Every economy. Or as many leaders said in discussions over the weekend: we're all in this boat together. There is no point in sugar-coating the situation. The global economic downturn is accelerating. It will get worse before it gets better. Every morning we wake up to more sobering developments from abroad: - bank bailouts-30 and counting; - diving share markets-down 50 per cent and counting; - government rescue packages-from 15 countries and counting. Major developed economies, like dominoes, are falling one by one into recession. Japan; from Germany; Italy and the eurozone have already fallen. Other major economies have already experienced quarters of negative growth this year, including the United States; United Kingdom; France; Italy; and Canada among others. And the projections emerging for the United States for the fourth quarter are not good. These are all fundamentally strong economies. But all have been unable to sandbag their economies against the worse financial and economic crisis the world has seen in over three-quarters of a century. The Australian government has been upfront about the global financial crisis from the beginning. As the world's 14th-largest economy, we experience the good and bad of economic globalisation. For the past decade and more, globalisation has served Australia well. For 10 years we have ridden the wave of a commodity price boom which has filled the Treasury coffers. We sailed through this period with record terms of trade, leading to low unemployment and high growth. But the global tide has changed-and the good times have now turned to bad. And our economy is now being pulled in a new direction. It is important to continue to be absolutely upfront with the Australian people about the challenges we face and the strategy we shall prosecute to see Australia through. The impact of the global financial crisis on our economy will be real. Its impact on our businesses will be real. Its impact on our families will be real. Its impact on our workers will be real. Its impact on our country will be real. Today my intention is to: - update the House on recent developments in the global financial crisisespecially the most recent outlook for the global real economy; - to outline the possible effects on the Australian economy for the period ahead; and - to reaffirm the government's commitment to continue to take whatever action is necessary to support growth and jobs and to protect Australian families from the worse effects of an economic crisis that they did not create. Economic impact of the global financial crisis The global financial crisis began in the mortgage markets in the United States where easy money, lax regulation and excessive risk-taking led to an extraordinary asset bubble. The unwinding of that bubble brought heavy losses for the network of financial institutions involved in the origination, securitisation and ownership of mortgage assets. The cancer in the system-in this form of extreme capitalism-has been the operation of credit default swaps which led to a collapse of trust between financial institutions, as no-one could say with confidence who owed what to whom. This assault on transparency-and the perversion of reward structures that gave rise to greater and greater risk decoupled from any direct sense of responsibility for that risk-caused this crisis in the US mortgage market to spread throughout the global financial system. This in turn has created a crisis of confidence both in the financial sector and more broadly in the real economy. The government has been acutely aware of the profound effect that the global financial crisis was already having on economic growth now and the risks that it has created for the global economic outlook for 2009. - Already by the end of October, global share markets had fallen by 37 per cent over 2008. This represented a massive destruction of wealth-of some US$27 trillion. - Each of the world's seven largest advanced economies had recorded a negative quarter of growth in the first three quarters of the year. - And government budgets around the world were being battered-with every member of the G7 bar Canada having already gone into deficit. Australia is not isolated from events abroad-and our forecasts have reflected this fact. - Global funding conditions had affected borrowing costs here at home, with households and businesses facing sharply higher interest rates as banks passed on up to 60 basis points of their higher costs of funding. - Our stock markets had fallen by 38 per cent in the year to October-similar to other comparable stock markets around the world. - Quarterly household consumption had fallen for the first time in 15 years in the June quarter. In addition, MYEFO indicated that the global financial crisis has also had a profound effect on our budget position. - The government projected that tax receipts would be nearly $40 billion lower over the forward estimates than had been anticipated at the time of the May budget. The last six months of the global financial crisis has resulted in a quantum shift in Australia's economic and financial position-as it has in practically all other economies Effect on Australian families Beyond the economic statistics, the global financial crisis is imposing a very real personal cost on Australian businesses and Australian families Put simply, the global financial crisis means tough times ahead for many people. - It means more challenging conditions for older people whose incomes derive from share market investments - In - It means harder conditions for the more than two million small businesses and independent contractors who form much of the backbone of the Australian economy and employment. - It means a tougher employment environment for many people who will find it more difficult to find their first job. A few weeks ago I received a letter from a shop owner in regional Queensland. I write to you at my wits end. The people who shop in the shopping centre I'm in are struggling … my business has dropped 65 per cent in sales over the last 3 months. I have already had to lay off 3 of my 7 staff … I'm scared I'm going to lose my business to bankruptcy. I'm scared my parents are going to lose their family home as it is security for my business loan. I have received many other letters like this one. I am sure many other members have as well. They show the unfolding personal dimensions to an unfolding international economic crisis. Deterioriation in economic conditions In recent weeks, the global economic crisis has taken a further turn for the worse. The most recent data released in November indicates that the US is unlikely to avoid a deep and protracted downturn. - US equity markets have fallen dramatically in the last month-now down 50 per cent from before the crisis. Data released on 19 November showed US housing starts fell in October to the lowest level since 1959 and building permits fell by a massive 12 per cent in the same month. - Data released on 14 November showed US household consumption has slowed sharply, with October nominal retail sales experiencing the sharpest monthly fall since the series began in 1992. the year to October, the big three car companies of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler have seen their sales fall by at least a third. - Data released on 7 November indicated that the US unemployment rate has jumped to 6.5 per cent, up 1.7 percentage points from a year ago and the highest rate since March 1994. More than half a million American workers were added to the ranks of the unemployed in October alone. - And, as of this week, US financial giant Citigroup now appears to be joining the list of US companies requiring a federal bailout including AIG, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch. Both the IMF and the OECD are predicting a prolonged downturn for the US economy, with growth contracting sharply until at least the middle of 2009. The deterioration in other advanced economies has also been rapid. The OECD warned in its Economic Outlook published overnight that: ‘Many OECD economies are in or are on the verge of a protracted recession of a magnitude not experienced since the early 1980s.' In our own region, the IMF expects growth in emerging and developing economies to slow to 6.1 per cent in 2009, the slowest rate of growth in more than six years. The latest economic data from Asia paints a sober picture of economic activity. - Growth in China has already slowed by 2.5 percentage points over the past year The global slowdown has had a heavy impact on Chinese businessesespecially in coastal export zones where the Chinese Minister for Social Services described the employment situation last week as ‘grim'. - Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have all recorded negative growth tember quarter - Credit - Singapore and Hong Kong are already in recession. I wish I had better news to report to the House from my discussions with global and regional leaders, but the truth is that these discussions have reinforced the gravity of the challenge we all face-and reflect the gravity of the data released during November. It is important to remember that the Australian economy has so far fared well relative to our peers in advanced economies. However, the global events of the last few weeks have brought further bad news for the Australian economy. - In the last three weeks Australian share markets have fallen by a further 17 per cent, bringing losses since the start of the year to over 50 per cent, the same as for the United States. These falls have been coupled with falling house prices, which have now dropped for two consecutive quarters. - Consumer confidence data released on 12 November shows confidence remains at levels not seen since the early 1990s. - Retail sales data released on 17 November shows volumes grew only marginally in the September quarter, after falling for the previous two quarters. - Car sales data released on 19 November also fell sharply over the quarter by eight per cent. Building approvals data released on 5 November show that approvals plummeted in the most recent data, September, to the lowest level since April 2001-indicating that housing investment is likely to be very weak over at least the next six months. The outlook for business investment has in the Sep- also deteriorated. conditions continue to be challenging, with the ACCI-Westpac survey of 21 November showing that the incidence of businesses reporting difficulty in obtaining finance has grown to a 26year high. Weaker global growth will make it more difficult for our exporters to find markets. - Of all of our major trading partners that have reported growth numbers for the September quarter, only Korea has published positive growth. - Countries to which we send nearly half of our exports are in recession and the others are slowing. - The deteriorating outlook for the global economy, particularly the slowdown in China, has also seen expected demand for commodities soften, resulting in sharp falls in spot commodity prices. As a result of falling commodity prices, the outlook for Australia's terms of trade is weakening. - As detailed in MYEFO, we are forecasting a fall of 8.5 per cent in the terms of trade in 2009-10. - A sharper fall cannot be ruled out if the global downturn intensifies, and this would further reduce national income growth. Government action to date The Australian government has already taken swift and decisive action across a range of fronts to support growth, families and jobs during these troubling times. The government has been proactive in addressing the effects of the crisis. We have sought to be ahead of the curve from the start. And to the extent that it is humanly possible, we intend to remain ahead of the curve for the future. The government's economic strategy this year has been framed against the background of this unfolding global financial crisis. In May, the government delivered a strong budget; in the budget the government delivered $9 billion in tax cuts to help ease the cost of living pressures facing all Australian taxpayers, and to create further incentive for individuals to participate in the workforce. The budget built a strong surplus which has proven to be a crucial buffer-giving the government the flexibility to respond to the global financial crisis as it has unfolded. - This equates to about one per cent of GDP in July 2008. In October the government acted to strengthen the economy further and deliver much needed support to Australian households through the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. - As part of the strategy, Australia's four million pensioners, carers and seniors will receive lump sum payments. Around two million families who are entitled to family tax benefit A will receive a one-off payment of $1,000 for each child in their care. As part of the ESS $1.5 billion has been allocated to first home buyers. At the end of November, the government intends to make a third investment through the substantial but responsible proposal it will put to the states and territories in education, health, and other critical services. The Commonwealth is prepared to invest more than $11 billion more into critical government services over the next four to five years, starting in 2009. Not only is this designed to prosecute the government's long term economic reform agenda-in particular its productivity agenda-it also provides further stimulus to the economy now by creating more jobs and better paid jobs in health, education and beyond. As a general principle, a further $10 billion in public investment will add 75,000 additional jobs. These measures are in addition to the $6.2 billion the government will invest from 2010 onwards to support the long-term future of Australia's auto sector. This sector is under great stress globally-as recent developments in Detroit and Washington have demonstrated. And while much global uncertainty lies ahead, the Australian government has decided to do its part to co-invest with this industry long term to help support the more than 200,000 Australians who are employed directly or indirectly in this sector. Beyond all these measures-short, medium and long term-the government remains ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to help steer Australia through this current crisis. The financial system Throughout this the government, ably supported by the economic regulators, will continue to keep a weather eye on the continuing stability of the financial system. We have weathered the first part of the storm well. But as recent events overtaking Citigroup demonstrate, we are by no means through the storm yet. Furthermore, deterioration in the real economy in turn can produce a further round of effects on the balance sheets of the banks and non-bank financial institutions if loans arrears become more of problem. The government maintains the closest possible rolling consultation with the financial sector on both continuing and any emerging problems that arise in these unprecedented times. Once again, the government has throughout the year acted ahead of the curve against the deepening global financial crisis. Throughout the year, the RBA has responded to the uncertainty in financial markets by providing additional liquidity to the market as required. In May this year, the government announced that it would increase its issuance of Commonwealth government securities (CGS) to the tune of $25 billion. - In September ASIC acted in concert with regulators around the world to put temporary restrictions on short selling. In November ASIC lifted the ban on short selling of nonfinancials, while the ban on financials continues. - In September the government also announced that the Australian Office of nancial Management (AOFM) will be authorised to purchase Australian residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). - In October the government secured final COAG agreement for a seamless national consumer credit regulation funded by a government commitment of an additional $71 million. - In October also the government provided a guarantee for the deposit and wholesale funding liabilities of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs). In addition to the measures I have just outlined, the government continues to operate task forces in conjunction with most branches of the financial services sector to deal with the range of other practical problems that continue to arise as a result of the a massive dislocations caused to that sector by the global financial crisis. International action Domestic policy action by the government on the financial system and the real economy is necessary. But to be fully effective, this must be accompanied by decisive international policy action as well. At the G20 summit on 15 November in Washington leaders made three fundamental decisions. First, having taken extensive and, in some cases, radical action to stabilise financial systems, leaders agreed to take whatever further actions were necessary to stabilise the financial system into the shortand long term future and agreed on a concrete action plan to that effect. Second, as global economies slow down because of the financial crisis, global governments need to step into stimulate aggregate demand and stabilise the economy through coordinated macroeconomic action. G20 economies committed to further use Fitheir national budgets to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect, given the different economic needs and budget flexibility available to each government. Around the table, leaders agreed that the best way to protect jobs is to sustain aggregate demand. The mathematics are like this. The reality is that the global financial crisis is projected to cut global growth by three per cent of global GDP, which means that in a US$60 trillion global economy, coordinated government macroeconomic action is necessary to inject some $1.8 trillion into the global economy at a time when the private sector cannot be relied upon to act. The alternative is larger scale global unemployment. The third decision made at the G20 was to open global trade and investment further. The G20 leaders agreed that we must not put up new barriers to investment and trade. Moreover, we resolved to conclude the WTO's Doha Development Agenda this year with an ambitious and balanced outcome. Furthermore, APEC leaders directed their ministers to meet in Geneva in December to conclude the round. The road ahead The government, based on the data available, has been upfront about the impacts of the global financial crisis, on the economy, on budgets and on jobs. But the emerging data on the global financial crisis continues to evolve in unpredictable ways. We face great uncertainties ahead. There are great volatilities in the data, meaning it is ble to predict the future with absolute precision. If global growth continues to deteriorate in the period ahead, consistent with the economic data that is emerging during November, then there will be a further slowing of growth in the Australian economy-as surely as night follows day. If Australian economic growth slows further because of a further deepening of the global financial crisis, then it follows Australian government revenues will reduce further. Under those circumstances, it would be responsible to draw further from the surplus and, if necessary, to use a temporary deficit to begin investing in our future infrastructure needs including hospitals, schools, TAFEs, universities, ports, roads, urban rail and high-speed broadband. Under those circumstances, such action would support growth, families and jobs and would be undertaken in the national interest. In fact, failing to do so would be irresponsible and would sacrifice growth and jobs. But any such action would need to be temporary, consistent with the discipline of maintaining a surplus across the economic cycle. These circumstances do not prevail in Australia at present. Our current circumstances do not require us to embrace such a course of action, and the government will do everything possible to swim against the global tide to support both growth and the surplus, but this is becoming tougher and tougher. The government will continue to be candid with the Australian public about the volatile global economic environment that has been created by the global financial crisis and the uncertainties that, therefore, lie ahead. Amidst these uncertainties, the government remains prepared to take whatever action is necessary in the future to support impossi- economic growth, families and jobs. Conclusion Over the decades ahead, historians will write the history of this global financial crisis in three chapters. Chapter 1 will be the impact of the global financial crisis on international equity and debt markets. Chapter 2 will be the impact of the global financial crisis on the real economies of developed and developing countries around the world. Chapter 3 will be the impact of the global that the financial crisis on employment. The challenge for the leaders of today is to do everything humanly possible to ensure this period is recorded as a snapshot in history not an enduring memory; that we deliver decisive policies which stimulate demand and lead to a strong rebound in growth; that we deliver policies which create jobs and boost long-term productivity growth; that we put the mechanisms in place to ensure a financial crisis of this scale does not occur again as a consequence of extreme capitalism out of control; and that through our actions to deal with this crisis and the sharp temporary measures necessary to deal with it we do not sow the seeds of the next. This is the government's mission. This is the nation's mission. This is also the mission of the international community to be candid about the challenges, to prosecute a coherent strategy in response to those challenges and create a rational basis for confidence in the future. This is the course of action to which this government is committed. I present a copy of my ministerial statement for tabling purposes.",86

54,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Experience and history tell us that Labor deficits are never temporary. The last Labor deficit lasted for six years. It was not temporary. It went on for six long years, destroying jobs, and it only came to an end with the election of a coalition government determined to do the hard work to clean up the mess that Labor committed. The Prime Minister has today in his 22minute address-which he was kind enough to give us a copy of 45 minutes before he started-sought a leave pass to abandon fiscal discipline. Only two days ago on 24 November the Prime Minister was asked whether he was prepared to push the budget into deficit and he said twice, ‘We do not see the need to borrow.' On the same day his finance minister was asked the same question and he said, ‘We're committed to keeping the budget in surplus.' Forty-eight hours on and that has been completely abandoned. The key to managing difficult times is discipline and the willingness, the guts to take tough decisions. All through this year the Prime Minister has made no hard decisions. The Prime Minister has mismanaged our response to the global financial crisis. Right at the beginning of the year when the rest of the world was focused on the looming threat of the credit crisis coming out of the subprime crisis in the United States and fuelled by a collapse in housing prices, when the rest of the world was focused on that, our government in Australia declared a war on inflation, which it continued in its rhetoric right up until September and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The reality of the global financial crisis only dawned on the Prime Minister in midSeptember. Until then he was still waging war on inflation. If honourable members on the government benches doubt me, let us look at what the Prime Minister said about the budget. Remember, the government is now claiming that the budget was designed to ward off the damage from the global financial crisis and they put it together with the global financial crisis in mind. There is no doubt that the opposition had the global financial crisis in mind. We said again and again that we should not be rushing into measures, be they monetary or fiscal, that could overdo the downward pressure on economic activity that is coming in from the rest of the world. That is what we were saying consistently from the very beginning of the year. The Prime Minister on 13 May said: That is why as we embark upon this budget our first responsibility is to fight the fight inflation… And on 2 May the Prime Minister said: … our job is to produce a responsible budget for the overall economy and that means fighting the fight against inflation. We are waging a war against inflation at present… Of course, from the beginning of the year when inflation was three per cent and had moved outside of the target band of the Reserve Bank, it was the Treasurer who said inflation was out of control. He said the inflation genie was out of the bottle. He egged on the Reserve Bank to put up rates, and rates went up twice at the beginning of this year. As honourable members are aware, monetary policy has very long lags. It is not a quick fix. When you put interest rates up or down, it takes a long time for that to take effect. The government was the only government in the developed world that was ignoring the global financial crisis, ignoring the global impact of that crisis and declaring its own war on inflation, when much darker storm clouds were on the economic horizon. The impact of those rate rises is being felt in the economy right now, just when we need it least. That is the consequence of the government's failure to take account of the reality of the global financial crisis-a terrible error of judgement. Why did they make it? They made it because, throughout this whole year, the Prime Minister has not had an economic strategy; he has had a political strategy. His aim was to blacken the economic reputation of the Howard government. When he looked at the economic metrics, the numbers that he inherited-be it the money in the bank at the Treasury; be it the fact that all of Labor's debt was paid off; be it the fact that the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, had put aside money in the Future Fund to take care of the previously unfunded pension obligations to public servants and defence peragainst sonnel-including record lows in unemployment and strong economic growth, he could only find one which was not ideal, and that was inflation, so he said, ‘This is what I will use to blacken the reputation of the Howard government.' He went after that with a purely political strategy and, as a consequence, talked up inflation and interest rates and did so at precisely the wrong time. Is there anybody in this House or in this country who believes it was in the national interest for us to feel the consequences of monetary tightening today? Of course not. Everybody should be focused on the three most important priorities of the government, this House and every member of the parliament: jobs, jobs, jobs. That is the focus. That is what the government should be focused on, and yet they put pressure on the economy, downward pressure on economic growth at the beginning of this year, and they did it purely for political purposes. Always politics, always spin. If the government want to claim that they have had a coherent economic strategy, let me ask this: how could they claim to be coherent if waging war on inflation was the No. 1 priority-if the overwhelming and overriding mission was the war on inflation because it was out of control at a little over three per cent? Now that it is five per cent, that war seems to have been abandoned. Obviously the campaign was not going very well, so new wars have been declared across the board. We now come to the question of how we should address the global financial crisis. In the here and now, from the time Lehman Brothers collapsed and the crisis reached a new level of intensity in September, we have made the offer to work with the government on a bipartisan basis. We have invited the government to sit down with us; we have invited them to collaborate. We have not had the courtesy of any response to that other than contempt.",93
55,Unknown,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Government members interjecting,95
56,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Government members are mocking and sneering but they should be reserving their mockery for their own front-bench. Let's not forget it was the opposition who said-privately, in briefings, directly to ministers and then publicly-that the wholesale term funding guarantee would not be effective unless there was an appropriation law passed by this parliament. That was so blindingly obvious to everybody familiar with financial markets but apparently not to the Treasurer. He had to be begged by the banks to provide that simple piece of legislation-in effect a boilerplate-to ensure that the government guarantee could be described by credit rating agencies and others as irrevocable, unconditional and timely in terms of payment, and he was pressured by the opposition. Then, when he stood up in parliament last night, he had the audacity to blame the opposition for drawing this defect in his own plans to his attention. What a joke! That is like somebody complaining that a helpful passer-by has drawn attention to a hole in his boat before he puts it in the water. The reality is: if the Treasurer had not nally woken up to the consequences of his own mismanagement and if we had not proceeded to pass this appropriation bill, the wholesale term funding guarantees upon which our banks, big and small, are relying to get the money they need to lend to Australians, to keep people in jobs and to keep the wheels of industry turning, would not have been able to be used and they would not have been effective. The government admit this now, because they have proceeded to bring the appropriation bill into the parliament, and yet they complain that we are lacking in bipartisanship. We have consistently made constructive proposals throughout this year. We were right about inflation at the beginning of the year-so much is very plain. We were right about the need to appropriate. We recommended that the retail deposit guarantee be set at $100,000. That was not a particularly original number. That is where it is in most countries around the world, and there is a reason for that. When you guarantee deposits, you obviously have a distorting effect on the market regardless of where the guaranteed level is set, because you plainly benefit those institutions and funds which have the guarantee versus those that do not, and that is why historically governments that have provided deposit insurance or deposit guarantees have set them at levels that are high enough to provide comfort to households and small businesses in terms of their deposits but not so large as to distort financial markets. That is essentially the global norm. What did the Prime Minister do? When this matter came up for decision he did not sit down with the Reserve Bank governor. He did not sit down with the one regulatory agency that not only has the greatest expertise in this area but is actively involved in the financial markets. He did not sit down with fi- the Reserve Bank. He did not call the Reserve Bank governor. No, he went for the big, grand gesture. He went for an unlimited deposit guarantee-in other words, the maximum possible distortion. You could not distort markets more than by having an unlimited guarantee. And what have we seen? We have seen adverse consequences around the country. Let us just walk through some of the things the Prime Minister has done by taking that step. Two hundred and seventy thousand Australians have had their savings, mortgage funds, cash management trusts and similar investment institution funds frozen to redemptions. That is because of the distortion that has been created by the government. Finance companies who provide the money to fund motor vehicle and equipment dealers' floor plans-in other words, to finance the sale of cars and equipment-have not been able to raise money in order to continue funding their operations. Why is that? The cash management trusts that were the largest investors in the short-term debt obligations of these finance companies and in what is called commercial paper are investing overwhelmingly, if not entirely, in guaranteed bank deposits. The largest cash management trust, which is run by Macquarie Bank, has announced that it is only investing in guaranparliament, teed deposits with banks and other guaranteed institutions. So what this step did was dry up sources of finance for important parts of our economy, important parts of our financial system. We are seeing real hardship every day-jobs at risk, jobs being lost. jobs, jobs-those are the three top priorities. The Prime Minister's response has been costing us jobs already. When the problem with this deposit guarantee became apparent-and that was within a few days; I think the Treasurer has made that clear-what did the government do? Nothing. They did not lift a finger. They were terrified to admit they had made a mistake. Too gutless to admit that they got it wrong, the government did not make a move until a letter from the Reserve Bank to the Secretary of the Treasury found its way into the media, and there we learnt that the Reserve Bank governor himself, within a few days of this unlimited deposit guarantee having been announced, was so concerned about the adverse impacts it was having, of the kind that I have just described, that he the government to set a cap, and he said ‘the lower the better'. We have seen bank chief executives, leaders in the financial community, saying, ‘The government must lower the retail deposit guarantee, with a cap of around $100,000.' We know the government will not do that, because that would result in the Prime Minister having to concede that he was wrong and that maybe the opposition has a point. We know what the government really think about bipartisanship and collaboration. They have no interest in that. Despite our frequent efforts to sit down and work constructively with the government, which are always rebuffed, with scorn, we are told in this House by the Deputy Prime Minister that the opposition should, and I quote her, ‘Just get out of the way.' What a commentary on what a commentary on the way government feels about parliament: ‘Just get out of the way.' The Treasurer's comment was that the opposition is completely irrelevant. Apparently we have nothing to add to his enormous sum of economic wisdom, the Jobs, amplitude of which he demonstrates every time he rises to answer a question! We have continued and will continue to offer constructive proposals for the management of the response to the global financial crisis. Earlier this week, I raised the very important issue of insolvency laws. The Prime Minister read part of a letter from a business owner in Queensland who is fearing the prospect of bankruptcy. There are many Australians who are concerned about these difficult times, and we receive the same letters and emails and calls and we are aware of that concern in our own communities. Over the years, one of the major criticisms of Australia's corporate or business insolvency laws has been the fact that secured creditors have so much say-secured creditors almost invariably being the major banks-that they urged drive companies and businesses into a speedy fire sale liquidation receivership, destroying jobs, jobs, jobs, the three top priorities, and at the same time destroying businesses and indeed paying scant regard to the claims of other creditors, not least of which are trade creditors and so forth. So that has been a matter of concern for many years. I have seen that happen in my own experience over the years with many receiverships, which have resulted in the destruction of considerable value. One of the great strengths of the economy of the United States, which I think we all admire, is its extraordinary resilience. The Americans have a capacity to take terrible blows and then bounce back and dust themselves off, and the great engine of the US economy gets going again. We look forward to that happening in the wake of this particular crisis. One of the reasons for that is that their insolvency laws are very much focused on restructuring, reorganisation and rehabilitation of the businesses that have found themselves in difficulties, in bankruptcy in fact. There is an opportunity right here, right now, to look again at our insolvency laws to see what we can learn from the US experience. There has been plenty of work done on it and there are plenty of people in the insolvency industry who are very familiar with both jurisdictions. We could pull together some changes which I believe would preserve jobs. Those jobs need to be protected; we need to do everything we can to protect jobs. We call on the Prime Minister-if he has an ounce of bipartisanship in him and an ounce of genuineness in his commitment to bipartisanship-to sit down with us and look at how we can take reforms of that kind forward quickly. That will have a very material impact on how we respond to this crisis and how we ensure that, above all, we protect the jobs of Australians. This is the greatest priority of this parliament and it should be the greatest priority of this government to preserve the jobs of Australians. We recognise there are challenges there. The government has made mistakes in its handling of the global financial crisis to date. From the very beginning of the year it has made a number of wrong calls, and we cannot afford to have any more wrong calls. We cannot afford to have any more decisions which are supposedly swift and decisive but which turn out to be rushed and bungled. The Prime Minister gave us a tour of the global economic horizon, and there are many things he said which I think commentators and writers will find rather surprising. But the one objective of the speech he gave was the deficit he is planning to deliver. He wants a leave pass for economic laziness; he wants to be able to drop any pretence of fiscal discipline. He wants to be able to spend and he wants to be able to take whatever action he can-as long as it is not hard and as long as it is not tough. He is not interested in taking hard decisions. He is determined only to take the easy decisions and in doing so-with that lack of courage and discipline and with that political strategy-we are going to see not a temporary deficit but one that goes on for as long as we have the Rudd government leading this country.

58,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's admission a moment ago that the government is preparing to go into what he describes as ‘a temporary deficit'. Given that the last time a federal Labor government went into a temporary deficit it lasted over six years, how many years will the Rudd government's temporary deficit last?",98
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My response to the honourable member's question is that what I said was that current circumstances do not require any such course of action. I referred to the deterioration of the global economic environment and the fact that global leaders have a view of these circumstances which suggests that the situation is going to get worse rather than better. I also note a statement from the honourable member's old bank, Goldman Sachs, which says the government should: … pick up the baton of stimulating economic growth in 2009. If conditions deteriorate the government should advocate the need for a deficit and build a catalyst for economic recovery. The combination of aggressive central bank easing and judicious fiscal stimulus will leave Australia better placed than its global peers in avoiding a deep and prolonged recession. I suppose, though, if you have already made your motza out of Goldman then you do not have to listen to what they say anymore. The key thing is this. I said clearly in my statement to the House just before that the current circumstances which prevail in Australia do not require any such course of action. I have simply reported to the House the consensus emerging from global leaders both at the Washington G20 meeting and at the APEC leaders meeting that the global economic conditions are deteriorating further. I reported further that a large number of economies-in fact, all of those of the G7, bar Canada-have entered into deficit financing. I have indicated that for the future Australia must remain vigilant and, I say this again, take whatever action is necessary to support growth and jobs. Economy",98
60,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the findings of the OECD's Economic Outlook released overnight?,98
61,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The OECD's Economic Outlook released overnight is sobering reading. It is a sobering assessment of very difficult global conditions. The OECD says: Many OECD economies are in, or are on the verge of, a protracted recession … The US, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all recorded at least one quarter of negative growth, and the OECD expects more countries will follow. All up, the OECD expects that 19 of the 30 OECD member countries will contract over the calendar year 2009. That is pretty sobering news to contemplate and, as the Prime Minister pointed out in his remarks before, there has been a marked change over the past month. The OECD does expect modest growth for the Australian economy, modest growth similar to that predicted three weeks ago in MYEFO. But as we said then, if global growth continues to deteriorate in the period ahead, we will see slower growth, and this of course is where the OECD report comes in again. The OECD has identified a further deterioration in the global economy, a further decline in our terms of trade and weaker growth in China as significant risks to growth in this country, surplus? and of course the OECD has joined the IMF in calling on governments to deploy all arms of policy, including fiscal policy, to strengthen growth. Of course, we on this side of the House understand the importance of fiscal policy, and that is why we put forward our Economic Security Strategy. Those on the other side of the House deny the enormity of the international financial crisis. The Leader of the Opposition said it has all been overhyped. Well, what the OECD has identified, what the IMF has identified and what all international organisations have identified is the need for very strong action when it comes to fiscal policy. This government has reacted with the Economic Security Strategy, and of course we now have fiscal policy and monetary policy working in tandem, unlike what occurred under the member for Higgins. He was out there spending like a drunken sailor, forcing the Reserve Bank to put interest rates up. That is what was going on. We on this side of the House understand that when conditions change, when global growth turns down, governments must act. This government is acting and will continue to act in a responsible way. Those opposite can stick their heads in the sand and deny the enormity of the global financial crisis, but we on this side of the House will act and act decisively. Economy",98
62,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Prime Minister's admission this afternoon that the government is preparing to go into deficit.

68,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"MYEFO forecast modest growth and modest surpluses. What we said at the time of MYEFO and what the Treasury observed in MYEFO was that all the risks were on the downside and that if global conditions did deteriorate further then that would have an impact in the future. Of course, things have changed again dramatically in the last few weeks, and that is what the Prime Minister has reported upon today. But those opposite cannot accept the enormity of the global financial crisis, do not understand its magnitude and therefore cannot be part of the solution. We had the Leader of the Opposition here before talking about the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which was on 15 September. Around that time he was saying the magnitude of the crisis was all hype. Now he accepts it. Do not listen to what he says; listen to what he does. He comes into the House and calls for bipartisanship, and then he opposes the Economic Security Strategy.

73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"MYEFO showed that the global financial crisis has reduced government revenues over the forward estimates by about $40 billion, and of course events in global economy since then will have had a further impact on those estimates. That is obvious to everybody in the House, and of course the outlook for trade and the outlook for commodity prices have both taken a turn for the worse again in recent weeks, so that will have an impact on the budget bottom line. There is no doubt about that. The point that the Prime Minister made is that we must take every action we possibly can to strengthen our economy in the face of these global events to protect jobs. This government will do everything it can responsibly do to strengthen our economy-as we have done through the Economic Security Strategy-and to have monetary policy supporting fiscal policy, and we will take further actions if necessary to support Australian jobs and Australian growth. Workplace Relations",100
74,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the importance of delivering fairness and flexibility to Australian workplaces? Mr Hockey interjecting,100
75,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I noticed that the question was greeted by scoffing from the member for North Sydney. I thought those opposite said that Work Choices was dead. It seems to be undergoing a slight case of resurrection on the part of certain members opposite, led courageously by the member for Bradfield. The member for Bradfield, the former Leader of the Opposition, is a principled man who stands by the principles to which he and his party have been historically committed, unlike those who have taken, it seems, a more opportunistic course of action in recent times. Furthermore, I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has voted on 12 occasions in support of extreme Howard government industrial relations laws, but that seems to the have changed yesterday-or at least we think it has changed. I am still quite interested in the distinction between not supporting legislation on the one hand and not opposing it on the other. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could give us a dictionary definition of the difference. For those opposite, I am sure the consideration of this in recent days has been a unifying factor in the joint party room, but again I commend the member for Bradfield for at least sticking by the principles for which that side of politics have stood for the better part of a decade and now pretend that they have walked away from. We know one fact for certain: when it comes to the interests of working families, given half a chance, Work Choices will be back, inflicted upon working families across Australia because that side stand for those principles on industrial relations, just as we on this side of the House stand opposed to those principles. The first thing I would do is to commend the work of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister has shepherded through an extensive consultation process with unions and with business leaders across Australia a very complex piece of legislation to produce a fair, balanced and flexible industrial relations system for the future. When you have both business and unions coming out in support of this piece of IR reform, I say you have it about right, and the House should record its thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for the excellent job that she has done. The bill establishes a stronger, enduring safety net through the National Employment Standards and modern awards for all Australian workers. Furthermore, the bill ensures that any workplace agreement must make all employees better off against the relevant award minimums. Furthermore, the bill also ensures that all employees, including in the three million workplaces with fewer than 100 employees, are protected from unfair dismissal. The safety net that we are building also protects employees' entitlement to redundancy pay in the very difficult experience of losing their job. The Fair Work Bill also underpins ongoing business investment. It is a much simpler piece of legislation than Work Choices. Work Choices delivered, as the member for North Sydney will well remember, 600 pages of legislation. Mr Briggs-So does yours.",100
76,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have 600 pages against their 1,500-page Work Choices legislation. If you want to make the difference between 1,500 pages on the one hand and 600 on the other, I would say that most people could understand the difference. Small businesses will have the confidence to employ new staff with the balanced fair dismissal laws and, by encouraging productivity based enterprise bargaining, the fair work legislation will over time foster both productivity growth and wages growth, to the benefit of both employers and employees and to the long-run benefit of economic growth and job creation. Beyond the detail of the legislation, what this is about is a question of principle. For a long time, we on this side of politics have stood for fairness in the workplace. For a long time-a very long time-those opposite have stood for a set of industrial relations laws which would rip away basic conditions from working families. That is why, when they got half a chance with control of the Senate, they did it; they ripped those conditions away. Each one of those sitting opposite who were in the parliament at the time stood up here and voted for the passage of Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, did exactly the same, and now he pretends he does not believe in those principles. As the Treasurer said before, with the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, watch not what he says but what he does. What he did on 12 occasions was to vote for this extreme industrial relations legislation. What he said yesterday is that he will not do it again, and I think the people of Australia would understand the difference between those two sets of principles. The difference is clear on this, and working families across Australia know this very well. At last we have the prospect of fairness and balance in the workplaces of Australia, which gets the balance right between working families and workers, and their employers on the one hand against the Work Choices regime that it has replaced. But, if those opposite ever chance to be back on this side of the House and in government again, we know for certain, given the debate that goes on internally, that this political posturing which they have engaged in, which says that they will not bring in Work Choices again, is purely that-political posturing. Any return to the treasury bench would guarantee a return of Work Choices, however they may posture on the way through. I would say to the House, and through the House to the nation at large: working families under the legislation which has been introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister will have a fair and balanced set of laws for the first time in a long, long time. The only way to ensure that those laws are properly passed is for them to gain speedy passage through the Senate and for those opposite not to engage in the normal double-timing tactics that they have engaged in in the past, pretending to be supporters one day but in their heart of hearts resolving to oppose it when next they get the chance to do so.

77,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question today-which is now Deficit Day-is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his own midyear economic forecast, which states that the government projects that it will increase its tax collection from individuals this year by over $2 billion more than was projected only in May in its original budget. I ask the Prime Minister: if you are collecting $2 billion more from individuals, why do you need to run the budget into deficit?",102
78,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that this government replaced the highest taxing government in Australia's history. I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that tax as a proportion of GDP has been reduced as a consequence of the first budget introduced by the honourable the Treasurer. And I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that when it comes to high taxing governments those opposite have rendered a gold medal performance. The second point I would make to the honourable member for North Sydney is this: the current circumstances which pertain in this economy do not require the course of action to which he has just referred. What I would say to the honourable member for North Sydney is that every responsible government in the world is currently looking at the real challenge of what you do if this global financial crisis deteriorates further through the real economy and jobs. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is: do nothing. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is: if people join the ranks of the unemployed, do nothing to stimulate the economy. The prescription of those opposite is not to invest in infrastructure-in fact, a course of action for which they have an ample historical track record. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is that the global financial crisis through the global economy drives down Australian economic growth. The course of action that you recommend is to do nothing. The course of action recommended by this side of politics is to take whatever action is necessary to continue to support positive economic growth and to support jobs in this economy. This government has so resolved to do. I would suggest that those opposite get with the project to support the interests of working families, as this financial crisis threatens their future. NA",102

Of course, she would know that there were no group of workers who suffered more in this country under Work Choices than women workers, and the statistics clearly showed that. Yesterday it was my pleasure to introduce into this parliament the Fair Work Bill, which guarantees for Australian workerseach and every one of them-a safety net that cannot be stripped away, national employment standards they can always rely on and, for employees who earn $100,000 or less a year, simple, modern awards that they can rely on. Compared with Work Choices, this is a safety net that will always be with them, because there are no individual statutory employment agreements, no Australian workplace agreements, which allow the safety net to be stripped away. Of course, it was Work Choices AWAs that did so much damage, costing people their penalty rates and their overtime without a cent of compensation. Shortly after I introduced the bill into parliament, the Leader of the Opposition went out and said, ‘Work Choices is dead.' I thought to myself, ‘Gee; that's a really familagreements, iar form of words; I've heard that before.' I know there is a sort of a fever of plagiarism over there on the Liberal Party benches, so I thought I would check that Work Choices is dead. Of course, it was the then Leader of the Opposition who, on 19 December 2007, first used those words. He first said, ‘Work Choices is dead.' Let us just remind ourselves what has happened since Work Choices was dead, according to the Liberal Party. We know that the person who is now the Liberal Defence spokesperson went out and said, ‘We are prepared to die in a ditch over individual statutory employment agreements.' That happened since the then assist- Leader of the Opposition said, ‘Work Choices is dead.' Then, of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the then spokesperson for workplace relations in this parliament, in the course of dealing with the transition bill, defended individual statutory employment agreements. If that was not enough, every member of the Liberal Party came in here and voted against a government motion that said individual statutory employment agreements could not be part of a fair system-that is, they voted in defence of individual statutory employment agreements. Then, as recently as September this year, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party told an audience in Melbourne that statutory individual contracts must form part of a modern workplace. All of this has happened since the first time a Leader of the Opposition for the Liberal Party said, ‘Work Choices is dead.' What has happened since this current Leader of the Liberal Party has said that Work Choices is dead? Well, we know that they spent yesterday brawling in their party room over support for Work Choices. Helpfully aided by the Australian newspaper, we the know that the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield, is out there defending individual statutory employment the thing that was at the heart of Work Choices-and he is nodding his head to verify that that is right; he is defending individual statutory employment agreements. And he is not alone. He is aided by the member for Mackellar. He is aided by the member for Menzies, who of course was the minister who was involved-and he is nodding too, another Work Choices supporter right there on the bench. He is aided by Alby Schultz-yes, Alby is giving the thumbs up to Work Choices; there he goes. And of course there are a group of senators who I cannot, in this chamber, call on to indicate their support for Work Choices but they did in the party room. So do not watch what the Leader of the Opposition says; watch what he does. Called on to vote for Work Choices, he voted for it a dozen times in this parliament. He now leads a political party full of Work Choices supporters who think that, just for the moment, it would be better if they pretended they were not. But this is pretence, and we know it. We know that if the Liberal Party were ever the government again in this country it would be back to Work Choices, back to AWAs and back to the rip-offs, because that is what they believe in and they always will.

83,Mr RUDD,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," Mr Speaker, this is slightly unusual but, on indulgence, I want to add my remarks to those you made just before to the visiting parliamentary delegation from Singapore led by the Speaker. Singapore and Australia share many interests. We have an excellent relationship with the republic and, most recently, I was with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the APEC meeting. APEC will be hosted next year in Singapore, and that is my particular interest in extending my good wishes to the parliamentary delegation on their visit and to underline the importance which Australia attaches to the bilateral relationship between the two countries.",104
84,Mr TURNBULL,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition shares the very warm sentiments the Prime Minister has quite rightly expressed to the parliamentary delegation from Singapore.

88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I simply say to the member for North Sydney that what I am doing is giving the opportunity for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to repeat her question. Really, I think that the best that one might do is ignore-just as I have to ignore at times-things that happen behind him. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call.",104
89,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement on 1 May this year when he said: … our job is to produce a Budget which reinforces responsible economic management by producing a substantial surplus. With the Prime Minister now admitting to driving the budget into deficit, isn'the admitting to irresponsible economic management?",104
90,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question as it goes to the question of responsible economic management. Responsible economic management is about how we support this economy and jobs and families during the greatest financial crisis that we have seen in three-quarters of a century. That is the practical question on people's minds right across our nation today. What can government do to fill the gap which is left by private companies currently in retreat? What has happened with the unfolding of this crisis is as follows: the global financial crisis going through stock markets, going through property markets, going through credit markets, hitting the real econjobs. omy and, as a consequence, hitting businesses and their ability to provide employment opportunities and therefore hitting jobs and, through that, hitting families. Responsihappen, ble economic management says families are facing increasing difficulties for the future. Responsible economic management lies in a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy: a security strategy which makes one-off payments to pensioners; a security strategy which makes one-off payments to families; a security strategy which says to first home buyers, ‘Here's some help on the way through to help you get your first home,' as well as providing support for the construction industry in the residential sector which is under such duress at present. That is what responsible economic management is about. Responsible economic management is also about taking that $10.4 billion, equivalent to one per cent of GDP, and injecting that into the economy as quickly as you can-going hard, going households, going early-in order to ensure that we can try and fill the gap when it comes to growth and activity in the economy. Can I say to those opposite who find the Economic Security Strategy amusing that if you sucked out one per cent of economic activity from the economy right now, the consequences for jobs would be devastating. And let me say this to the member for Curtin: when it comes to the future, responsible economic management means putting an absolute premium on anything governments can do to support jobs into the future. If you read the OECD report on the impact of unemployment across the developed economies in the period ahead, the further revision down of growth, projecting-I believe, from my reading of the report-significant negative growth across those OECD economies across the year 2009, the impact on employment is something like eight million people losing their That is the impact which has registered. So the strategy which is available to any government and any legislature across the OECD is this: to stand back and let it all let the damage be inflicted upon households, families, individuals trying to hold onto a job or to get their first job, or to do something about it. Our approach is to do something about it. Mr Costello-You're telling us about jobs, are you?",104
91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would suggest to those opposite that they reflect long and hard about the course of action which they are currently advocating which is, in effect, to do nothing. And I would suggest to the member for Higgins that he could have begun this process some time ago, taking the advice from Access Economics, by investing in the nation's infrastructure in the past, because now we are confronted with a double challenge. We have to overcome the infrastructure deficit left by those opposite over a 10-year period when the member for Higgins was rolling in the cash, as it came in the door off the back of the resources boom, but not investing a single dollar in the nation's infrastructure. What we must do now as a responsible government is this: invest in the nation's infrastructure-in our ports, in our roads, in our urban transit systems, in our rail, in our high speed broadband, in our hospitals, in our schools, in our universities, in our TAFE colleges; support investment in the nation's infrastructure and, through doing that, support growth and jobs and help families on the way through. That is a strategy for responsible economic management. And I suggest to those opposite they get with the project. Child Care",105
92,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister inform the House of the latest developments in ABC Learning childcare centres?",105
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question on this important topic in which I am sure all members of the House are interested. Can I inform members of the House that this afternoon the receiver of ABC Learning Ltd, Mr Chris Honey, of MCGRATHNicol, wrote to ABC parents and staff confirming that a majority of the group's childcare centres will continue operating in 2009. This is obviously a welcome development for thousands of parents and ABC Learning staff who have been waiting for news. In a statement made to the media just a short time ago the receiver has identified 656 ABC Learning centres will continue to be open and trade as normal in 2009. This represents almost two-thirds of all ABC centres, which provide care for around 80,000 Australian children, or more than 70 per cent of children in ABC Learning centres. The receiver says he sees a positive future for ABC Learning, and I am sure that news is a relief to parents and to staff-particularly those employed in these centres. It is a big step forward that the receiver has been able to provide certainty for so many parents and employees less than a month after ABC Learning went into receivership. The receiver has said that this afternoon a full list of ABC Learning centres and their status will be available on ABC Learning's website, which www.childcare.com.au. When posted the list will also be accessible from the Australian government's website, which www.mychild.gov.au. That is the website that we have been using to inform people of ABC Learning developments, each and every step of the way. So parents and employees who have used it can go back to the website to find these further details. The Rudd government understands how important it is for families and ABC Learning employees to be kept informed of developments in these uncertain times. That is why we will continue to be as open as possible about the information regarding this situation. Can I confirm that our childcare industry taskforce has been there every step of the way, working through this complex process, and will continue to work closely with the receiver to ensure continuity of care at ABC Learning centres. Can I also say that ABC Learning's receiver MCGRATHNicol has notified that 656 will remain open in 2009 and of the other centres he expects a proportion will also stay open. But the receiver that needs more time to examine the centres in detail so that a correct decision can be made on their future. The receiver has written to parents and staff at those centres to emphasise that this does not mean that their centre will necessarily be closed. It simply means that more time is needed to look at possible improvement initiatives at these centres. The government and the receiver are conscious that for staff and parents using those centres this will cause a further period of uncertainty. Can I say to those staff and the parents who use those centres that the receiver has indicated that he expects to make a further announcement in respect of these centres in a week's time. This will mean that in a week's time parents at all ABC Learning centres will is know what is happening in 2009, and people who use 656 of the centres will have the assurance today that their centre is going to is continue. I reaffirm that for all centres the government's arrangement with the receiver continues to be in place, and all centres will remain open until 31 December this year. Economy",106
94,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and I refer him to his earlier statement that he is taking the Australian budget into deficit. I refer the PM also to his earlier statement about ‘going hard, going households, and going early'. Does the Prime Minister stand by his decision in the May budget to go hard, go households and go early by introducing $20 billion in increased and new taxes? How much higher, Prime Minister, would Australia's growth rate be if the government had not taken decisions to increase taxes and other revenue by $20 billion in May?",107
95,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the benefit of the member for North Sydney I return to an answer I gave to an earlier question from him, which is how tax as a proportion of GDP changed between the member for Higgins's last budget and the first budget for the member for Lilley, the current Treasurer. The answer is this: tax as a proportion of GDP went down under this Labor government. Can I say something? We are proud of that fact. We are proud of that fact because it provided greater incentive out there in the economy. On top of that I would say that the government also, consistent with its pre-election commitments, has gone about implementing a $44 billion tax reduction program across the forward estimates. As a consequence of that the first tranche has been delivered in the budget in May. The second tranche will occur on 1 July next year. That is a responsible course of action because it actually adds to the overall ability of working families to deal with the challenges which lie ahead. I would also draw the honourable member of North Sydney's attention to this, as he is so interested-at least temporarily-in tax matters. For the first time in the history of the federation, are introducing an education tax refund, which will enable working families to claim, at the end of this financial year-as of 1 July next-an amount back for primary and secondary school kids for their basic education outlays. That is what I call acting on tax reform-helping working families to deal with the cost of education and helping the family pay packet through introducing stage 1 of a $44 billion tax reduction strategy. On top of that we are providing additional assistance to families and to pensioners through the $10.4 billion, one per cent of GDP, Economic Security Strategy released only last month. That, I would say to the honourable member for North Sydney, is properly supporting working families under the current circumstances. That is what I call acting responsibly in terms of the tax inheritance we received from those opposite-quite apart from the spending frolic in which they were engaged, which this government had to engage in, through its own expenditure review process, upon taking office. The member for Higgins smiles benignly as if all was well with the state of Denmark, forgetting the fact that tax as a proportion of GDP reached the highest level in the history of the federation under his stewardship. Investment in national infrastructure reached the lowest level in the history of the federation. Two great report cards for the member for Higgins; two great report cards for the Liberal government! This government is getting on with the business of providing support for working families and will continue to do so into the future. NA",107

97,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government doing to assist Australians affected by disruptions at Bangkok International Airport?,108
98,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and for her concern in relation to the events in Bangkok. Antigovernment protests in Bangkok have disrupted flights in and out of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport. As at 11.45 today, the international airport was closed by Airports of Thailand. The duration of the closure is not known at this stage. There have also been demonstrations at the Don Muang domestic airport. Some Australians, including those in transit, have been affected by flight disruptions. The Australian embassy is maintaining close contact with local authorities, and sular officers have been stationed in Bangkok International Airport to assist and liaise with the airlines. The travel advice for Thailand was reissued this morning and continues to advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution because of the uncertain political situation and the ongoing political unrest. Australians are advised to avoid demonstrations, to avoid political rallies and concentrations of military personnel and to continue to regularly monitor local media and travel advice. The situation in Thailand, and in particular Bangkok International Airport, is being continually monitored by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Any changes in the situation or increased threat to Australians in Thailand will be reflected in the travel advice. Australians in Thailand or planning to travel to Thailand should remain in close contact with their airlines and travel providers, follow any instructions issued by local authorities and monitor DFAT's travel advice at www.smartraveller.gov.au for any updates. Australians in Thailand who require consular assistance can contact DFAT's 24hour consular emergency centre on (61)(2)62613305. Here is another number for you: any family in Australia with serious concerns may call 1300555135. The consular centre has put on extra staff to handle inquiries from Australian travellers and their families. Unemployment",108
99,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. I refer the minister to the OECD Economic Outlook, which has forecast that there will be 200,000 more Australians out of work by 2010. Is the minister aware that it has taken more than six years to reduce the number of unemployed by 200,000? What is con- the government's comprehensive strategy to keep unemployment as low as it was under Australians the coalition government?",108
100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I think the member would be aware that a global financial crisis has occurred and it is having, as the Prime Minister outlined comprehensively in his statement to the House, implications for economies all around the world, including implications for our own economy. As a result of the fact that this nation is not immune, when we published the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal at Outlook we did publish a new prediction for unemployment. I know that the OECD prediction that the member points to is slightly higher, though I would ask him to note that it is for the calendar year and not for the financial year. So it is a prediction made on a slightly different basis. In the face of the global financial crisis and its implications for the Australian economy, this government's first and foremost priority has been to protect the jobs of ing Australians. That is why we acted decisively with the economic security statement-to stimulate the economy, to make sure that we were doing what we could to be in front of the curve, keeping the economy moving and growing. The estimates of the jobs impact of that fiscal stimulus is around 75,000. In that package, we committed to 56,000 new productivity places-new training places for jobs. This was against a backdrop where our new training places for jobs had been oversubscribed because there were so many Australians who wanted access to those training places. So we invested in 56,000 more. That was coming off the Liberal government's track record of failure to invest in training, leaving this nation with a skills crisis and leaving us underprepared to meet the needs of the future, including the training of Australians. The member may be aware that the government has moved the employment services model so that it will be a more responsive model that will provide people with services when they need that assistance. As the Prime Minister outlined in his statement today, our foremost priorities are protecting jobs and keeping our economy growing. That is what the Prime Minister's statement was about. That is what we are aiming to do. That is why we are investing in places such as our productivity places to assist those Australians who need that assistance. I would also say to the member that he ought to be aware that those productivity places are aimed at giving people the skills that they need to get into those sections of the labour market where employers are still crying out for skilled bour. It is consequently a very important assistance for those Australians. Australian Council of Local Government",108
101,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, work- Regional Development and Local Government. How has last week's Australian Council of Local Government meeting been received by local governments? Has there been any criticism of the council and its outcomes?",109
102,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, last week's Australian Council of Local Government meeting has been well received by local government, including by ALGA, Council of Capital City Lord Mayors, Local Government Managers Association and local mayors around the nation, who came to Canberra for what was an extremely successful dawn of a new partnership between the Commonwealth and local government. Regional mayors welcomed the event. Sandra MCCarthy, the Kiama mayor, told the Illawarra Mercury: For the first time. I feel we are a genuine part of the overall demographic of government in Australia and it's long overdue. The opposition did what it usually does: it came out and welcomed the event and the funding, and then it went to work undermining it; then it went to work walking both sides of the street. Perhaps the best example of that was the member for Cook, one of their shadow ministers for local government-they have two-saying that the community of Wollongong, because they are under administration, should not have received any local government funding. He argued that the ratepayers of Wollongong should be punished for the actions of some rogue councillors from Wollongong. The good people of Wollongong did not react kindly to that. The paper ran an la- article headed ‘Shadow minister for silly statements' and the subheading said: Scott Morrison says he's appalled at a $2.15 million grant for Wollongong council. (Yeah, we've never heard of him either) But it was not just the full page splashthere was more. The Illawarra Mercury had a bit to say about it in their editorial on half of the people of Illawarra. They said: The corrupt actions of one of our developers some councillors were enough to bring a slur on the … good name of Wollongong-we didn't need a numskull .. MP to compound the situation …",109

105,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some objections to the administration of the Wollongong council have been raised in interjections from those opposite. It pays to have a sense of history and a bit of memory going back more than a day; more than 24 hours. The night before the Australian Council of Local Government meeting, we had the National Local Government Awards, at which were presented awards to local government for best practice during the last year. Mr Hockey-The DAs of Wollongong?",110
106,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, DAs at Wollongong were rewarded-by the previous government. The then Minister for Local Government, Jim Lloyd, issued a press release on 23 July 2007. The award from the Howard government for asset management for foreshore development went to Wollongong council. So it pays to have a bit of memory. But the member for Cook did not remember that and nor did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when they opposed the good people of Wollongong receiving any funding for local capital works. It gets even worse, because you do not have to go back a year; you can go back a month. There is another council in New South Wales that is under administration: the Port Macquarie Shire Council. We know about Port Macquarie because there has been a bit of focus on it. We had a by-election just a month ago which returned an outstanding be- representative in Rob Oakeshott to this parliament. They did not object to Port Macand quarie council getting funding of over a million dollars as part of the $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I wonder why? I wonder why they are having a go at Wollongong even though last year it was the award-winning council from throughout the nation but for Port Macquarie they are hands off? How inconsistent are they? I thought back. I visited the electorate of Lyne during that by-election and I remember that the mayor who was dismissed for corruption, Rob Drew, was the National Party candidate just one month ago.

It is the case that the Indonesians have approached a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, and also have approached the Australian government for some assistance at a time which is very testing for many emerging economies. This is part of what we have been talking about in this parliament over the last month or sothe spread of the global financial crisis around the world from developed countries to developing countries. As has been the case in the past-I think back in 1998-the Indonesians have sought some assistance from Australia in conjunction with multilateral organisations. That request is currently before the Australian government. It is receiving our thorough consideration, and if a decision is taken it will be reported in a transparent way to the Australian parliament. Carers",111

119,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. This is a special day for her but an even more special day for one of her constituents. Seventeen-year-old Sam, Ballarat region's Young Citizen of the Year, is here at Parliament House for the Young Carers Forum. Sam is completing year 11, working part-time, looking after his mum, who has MS, and supporting his two younger brothers-I think, as every single member of this House would say, a truly remarkable young man. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",112
120,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are 32 young carers who have come to Canberra todayand will be here tomorrow-and some of them are up in the gallery and we welcome them here. They have come to the ‘Bring It!' 2008 forum. There are four from each state and territory and there are young people from the country and from our cities. There are 170,000 young carers under the age of 17 around Australia-thousands of young people growing up with at least two jobs: going to school, sometimes working as well and being carers. This forum that they are participating in is helping to shape the policy of the future, to make sure that all us provide better support to young carers. This year, the government has provided $7.6 million to the Young Carers Respite and Information Services Program, and today I announced an extra $15.7 million for a further two years. In my meeting with some of the young carers earlier today, I was told by them how this program really gives them somebody to talk to, someone to call at a time of crisis when they need advice or sometimes just when they need somebody to talk to. It certainly helps them stay at school or at universtantial sity while also balancing their caring responthat sibilities, which are so important to their families. The young carers I met today also emphasised the need to identify carers, to make sure that those youngsters that do not even know they are carers get to understand that they have these responsibilities and that there are many supports out there available to them. As well as the challenge of staying at school or university, we know that it can be very tough to make ends meet. That is why the government will be paying all recipients of carer payment a lump-sum payment from 8 December of $1,400 for each single carer. Those young carers who are receiving the carer allowance will also receive an extra $1,000 for each eligible person in their care. I am sure that every single member of the House is delighted that these young carers could come to Canberra. We all congratulate them for the outstanding work that they do. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Banking",112
121,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Having caused a freezing of funds in non-bank financial institutions by its action in guaranteeing bank deposits, what is the government planning to do when on 30 November GE Finance ceases to operate in of Australia, leaving Bob Moulton and the partners of Booleroo Agency, a large agricultural dealership in the electorate of Grey, with a $2 million floor plan and no prospects of refinancing? What does the Treasurer and his government suggest that Mr Moulton and his business do; and how many motor and machinery dealers does the government expect to close their doors as a result of the paralysed finance sector?",112
122,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. There was a similar question yesterday and it is the case that there is a subissue to do with car financing and is an issue which predates the bank guarantee and the guarantee for wholesale funding. Indeed, one of the major providers of finance announced they were pulling out well before the bank guarantee was put in place, so we should have very clearly in our mind that there are many areas out there in the finance sector, whether it is car finance, whether it is mortgage trusts or whether it is cash management trusts, that are all impacted upon by the global financial crisis and the impact on the cost of borrowing. What the government has been doing in this case, when it comes to car finance through David Murray and the Treasury, is working very closely with financial institutions and industry to see whether we can get an arrangement in place which provides finance from institutions which are liquid. Those are discussions which are happening at this moment. I cannot predict the outcome of those discussions, but we understand the importance of the car industry and the importance of car finance, and the government is doing everything it possibly can, working with the private sector and working with the industry to get a positive result. That is an ongoing process and I will report back to the House on that process at a later stage. Tourism",112
123,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Tourism. Would the minister update the House on the actions the government has taken to assist the tourism industry in tropical North Queensland to address the reduction of air services into Cairns from Japan from December 2008?,113
124,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He is a member who not only understands the nature of his regional seat but also understands the importance of the tourism industry to tropical North Queensland. As we appreciate, the seat of Leichhardt is one of Australia's iconic tourism destinations. It has the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropical rainforests. Tourism is exceptionally important to the economy of Northern Queensland, representing in the year to June 2008 more than $2 billion spent by visitors to the region. This spend is exceptionally important not only to the tourism industry generally but especially to smalland medium-sized operators. It is for that reason that the government in association with the Queensland government was concerned about the decision for commercial reasons by Qantas to cut its services from Japan to Cairns, a traditionally important market to tropical North Queensland,. That represented a major blow to the tourism industry in tropical North Queensland. It effectively represented the withdrawal of many thousands of seats for an industry that has historically relied on the Japanese market for prosperity. For those reasons, the Australian government allocated a transition package of $4 million in association with financial support from the Queensland government to try and assist the transition from tropical North Queensland's heavy historical reliance on Japan to not only look at new opportunities out of Japan but also look at markets which should be part of its future. I am also pleased to say that Tourism Australia is able to redirect an additional $2 million to assist in advertising in Japan to try and assist Cairns through this period of transition. To date we have been able to allocate $640,000 as a first tranche to assist with charters. That has translated into 6½ thousand seats, which will come during the next couple of months following the cuts of December with respect to Qantas's traditional servicing of Cairns. I am also pleased to say that last Friday I was able to announce an additional amount of $1.25 million, an amount well received by the industry in tropical North Queensland for the purposes of further consumer support and trade marketing in Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand and southern China. Mr Ciobo-Not much is it? Peanuts! What a token effort!",113
125,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note that the member for Moncrieff is questioning the government's commitment to assist these smalland medium-sized operators. I simply say that the shadow minister for tourism has clearly shown to the tourism industry in recent times that so far as he is concerned as the shadow minister for tourism there is no care or responsibility for the future prosperity of the tourism industry during this very difficult period. I am also pleased to say that we are trying to assist the industry to make the transition into future market opportunities rather than maintaining an ongoing reliance on Japan. That is about the industry having a serious look at new markets such as India and China, and also trying to assist them in having a look at the quality of the product and the need for accreditation to lift standards to guarantee that they can compete in a tough global community. I say in conclusion to the Australian community at large that the tourism industry at the moment is doing it exceptionally tough. The global financial crisis is not only having an impact on tropical North Queensland; it is also having a serious impact on the tourism industry Australia wide, as the member for North Sydney appreciates as the former minister for tourism. I therefore remind Australians at large that, with the holiday season fast approaching and the Australian government's economic security package kicking in on 8 December, we as a community, if we are going to have a holiday, should seriously think about having a holiday here at home. In that context I also remind Australian employers that it is their responsibility to actually assist in managing their workforce. I do not think it is acceptable that Australian workers presently have 129 million days of accrued leave, representing an estimated wage value of $29 billion. Tourism Australia is currently working with the business sector to try and encourage employers to support workers to actually take their accumulated annual leave and long service leave, to have a break here at home in Australia and assist all those hard-working small and medium sized tourism operators to survive the impact of the global financial crisis. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation",114
126,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the derisory response of APEC leaders to his plan for a European Union style Asia-Pacific Community. Can the Prime Minister confirm that this personal crusade is costing Australian taxpayers, including Ryan taxpayers, almost $50,000 a month yet rated only a single dismissive sentence in the six-page communique at the APEC summit? Prime Minister, is this the most expensive footnote in the history of Australian diplomacy?",114
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Ryan, of course, has extensive familiarity with various countries in the region, particularly in and around Hong Kong, but we will leave that to one side given the notorious history of his branch structure in Brisbane. Going on to the broader question of the future of the region, I say as followsMr Johnson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of relevance. I am not sure what part of the question the Prime Minister did not understand, but I am happy to ask",114
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Ryan will resume his seat. I will listen carefully to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,114
129,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, it was both Hong Kong and Taiwan that I should have referred to in the earlier answer. The Asia-Pacific Community is a proposal of the Australian government which looks at the question of where we want to be in 2020 in the Asia Pacific region. It simply asks this: do we want to shape our region's future or simply respond to events; do we want to repeat in this region the mistakes made by Europe in an earlier century; do we want to allow conflicts to arise or do we want to form the structures necessary which will support cooperation and the habits of cooperation to bring about a common sense of security in the period ahead? When I launched this proposal in an address to the Asia Society earlier this year, said that there would be a long process of discussion with the region. We have dispatched Dick Woolcott, an eminent Australian diplomat of great standing and who is, I believe, respected by both sides of the parliament-I would have hoped by the member for Ryan as well-to various capitals across the region to solicit their views on how such an Asia-Pacific Community could be shaped into the future. That process of consultation continues. Furthermore, it has been the subject of considerable discussion between myself and various heads of government, both in capitals and most recently in Lima at the APEC summit. The bottom line is this: either you can be reactive in your foreign policy, as those opposite have been for so long, or you can have an activist approach which says, ‘Here is the region we would like to see in 2020; here are the building blocks to get there; here is how we preserve peace into the future; here is how we preserve stability in the future; here is how we actually support economic growth into the future; and here are some structures and suggestions about how that might be done.' Similarly, this government has done the same on the question of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation: either you can stand back and allow the forces that have been at work for some time to simply have their play and have no results produced or you can put your best foot forward and have a go. We have done that with a joint commission, chaired by ourselves and the Japanese, which is currently co-chaired by a former foreign minister of Australia, Gareth Evans, and a former foreign minister of Japan. That work will have its report by the time we get to the NPT review conference next year. I simply make the point: you can either play a passive-reactive game in terms of Australia's voice in the world or engage in an activist foreign policy which seeks to I shape our region and the global order to maximise not only the interests of Australia but also the interests of peace and security in the 21st century. That is what we are on about when it comes to foreign policy and we are proud of it. Binge Drinking",115
130,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister outline to the House any new developments in the government strategy to tackle binge drinking?,115
131,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. I know that as a health professional and as a young woman that she has been particularly interested in our campaign to tackle binge drinking. I would like to announce to the House and draw their attention to the fact that our new binge drinking campaign was launched last Friday in Melbourne with a team of paramedics who pick up the pieces and consequences of binge drinking every day of their working lives. The campaign is called Don't Turn a Night Out Into a Nightmare. As was promised by the Prime Minister when this was announced, the campaign is hard-hitting and in your face. We have had a number of young women contact us to say that it is a very confronting campaign, and we make no apologies for that. When we are dealing with young people, many of whom think they are bulletproof, we do need to take this very strong tactic to tackle this problem. If there is anybody in the House who still doubts the importance of tackling binge drinking-I know that some opposite have had their doubts-I invite them to consider some of the images that have been on our televisions in the past few days as schoolies week is occurring across the country, or perhaps they might contemplate the figures that are being used in the campaign. Four Australians under 25 die due to alcohol related injuries in an average week. That is four young people we are losing every week. On average, one in four hospitalisations of people aged 15 to 24 happen because of alcohol and 70 Australians under 25 will be hospitalised due to alcohol caused assault every week. These terrible figures translate into harm and enormous hurt, and for some the grief and pain that they cause will last a lifetime. It our dedicated police, doctors and ambulance workers who see the worse of it day in and day out and I think that we should acknowledge and thank them for the work that they are doing. This campaign does not tell people not to drink. It does not tell them not to have a good time. It tells them to take care. It tells them to have a good time in moderation and not to turn their night out into a nightmare. We hope that it will have some impact and that everyone in this House can support it.

148,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have the pleasure to make a ministerial statement to announce to the House the government's intention to join an important initiative to promote free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. On 20 November 2008 at the APEC ministerial meeting in Lima, Peru, I announced that Australia will participate in negotiations on a comprehensive trans-Pacific partnership agreement alongside the United States, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore and Peru. We also understand that Vietnam is considering possible participation. This initiative confirms Australia's strong commitment to regional integration, underlines Australia's support for APEC, promotes the vision of an Asia-Pacific community and contributes to the government's objectives in ensuring free trade agreements also support the multilateral system. Strategically, this is a most important development. The rapid growth in the number of bilateral and regional free trade arrangements internationally shows no sign of abatement; this is now a well-established part of the trade policy landscape. It is therefore essential, in our view, that bilateral and regional free trade agreements support, rather than undermine, the multilateral system. The government has made absolutely clear its commitment to reinforcing the primacy of the multilateral trading system-and ensuring that free trade agreements support the multilateral trading system. We are strongly committed to ensuring the success of the WTO Doha Round of world trade talks, which has been given added urgency by the global financial crisis. The strong political commitment expressed by world leaders at the G20 and subsequent APEC leaders meetings in the past two weeks is testament to the commitment of the international community, including of course Australia, to making Doha succeed. The language that came out of the APEC leaders meeting over the weekend, instructing ministers to meet in December to conclude modalities, amplified and strengthened the commitment made by G20 leaders earlier in the month. If we can conclude a framework package on Doha, we will significantly strengthen the multilateral trading system. But our commitment to multilateralism does not stop in Geneva. We are in favour of high-quality and comprehensive free trade agreements, as I have said consistently since coming to office. We are in favour of initiatives that ensure that bilateral and regional trade arrangements are more consistent with the multilateral trading system. Our announcement to join negotiations on the trans-Pacific partnership is perhaps the most important initiative the Rudd government has taken to fulfil that aim. This initiative has the potential to spread the benefits of comprehensive and highquality FTAs-that is, their speed and depth as a vehicle for liberalisation-to a wider membership. It has the potential to reduce trade discrimination by broadening its coverage. It has the potential as well to serve as a base for a wider exercise in multilateralising free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region. It therefore has the potential to serve a viable building block to even greater regional integration in the Asia-Pacific. The current members of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement between Chile, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei-known as the P4-have invited Australia, Peru and Vietnam to join the negotiation. The United States confirmed its intention to participate comprehensively in the initiative in September this year. The announcement made last week at the APEC ministerial meeting that Australia would join the negotiations has highlighted the significance of this initiative and we hope it will stimulate others to join in due course. We went to the last election with a commitment to transparent and inclusive trade policies. Our approach to entering this set of negotiations honours that commitment. We have ensured and have provided extensive opportunities for public input from all segments of the Australian community on this proposed initiative. I announced on 23 September that Australia would actively consider participation in the initiative. In October, public consultations were held with industry, business, academics and labour and community organisations, as well as with other government agencies and state and territory officials. Those consultations allowed us to hear directly from each of the sectors in our community on their views on Australia's possible participation. The input to this initial consultation has been positive. The widespread view is that Australia should participate in this agreement and be involved from the outset, to ensure that we are able to help shape the agreement in a way that benefits Australia. Taking into account this input, the government has formed the view that we should proceed. This view is supported by the Mortimer Review of Export Policies and Programs, comas missioned by the government and released on 22 September 2008, which recommends as part of a package of trade reforms that Australia participates in the trans-Pacific agreement. With the confirmed participation of the United States, Peru and Australia, there is strong potential for the trans-Pacific partnership to develop into a broad based and highquality free trade agreement. Our public consultations have showed this view is shared by many stakeholders. Stakeholders have also pointed to the potential for real commercial benefits from the agreement in the long term. One priority of the government will be to maintain and build on existing standards in our current free trade agreements and retain the flexibilities that we presently have in those agreements. I now table a document-together with this statement-outlining the views that emerged in the consultations on the costs and benefits of our participation in the transPacific partnership, and views on priorities and objectives for the negotiations. Taking these views into account, the government's priorities include: - to promote trade and investment flows with partners of the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations; - to ensure that the trans-Pacific partnership provides a platform for comprehensive liberalisation across goods, services and investment; - to substantially improve trade and economic integration with Peru, with which we do not currently have a free trade arrangement, given our growing commercial interests, particularly in services commodities trade; - to pursue commercial interests more broadly in the Asia-Pacific region as other countries start to take a closer interest in the trans-Pacific partnership process; - to build on WTO rules covering goods, services and investment; and - to provide a model arrangement which might stimulate other initiatives to multilateralise bilateral FTAs. While the government can see significant opportunities from participation in this agreement, we are also conscious of the need to retain control over the setting of domestic policy in a range of areas. The first meeting of the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations is planned for March 2009 in Singapore-which, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, will also host next year's APEC meetings. Following that meeting, we will engage further with stakeholders as Australia develops its approach to achieving a high-quality regional free trade agreement. The existing free trade arrangements between these members should also allow us to work expeditiously. The meeting in March will be important to build the foundations of the initiative-because if we are to encourage others to dock on to the agreement, we want to make sure we have got the foundations right. The trans-Pacific partnership initiative may be the most viable bridge to generating a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific region. But it has got to be a wellbuilt bridge. The government will seek to ensure that the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations do not detract from our negotiations with other trading partners and that all our free trade agreement negotiations continue to achieve and promote ongoing trade liberalisation and across the Asia-Pacific region and exemplify Australia's strong commitment to open markets. Australia has or will soon have existing free trade agreements with all P4 participants and with the United States. The consultations revealed that we could build on these commercial gains with countries like Peru, and potentially with other members as participation expands. During the consultations there were, understandably, also a number of commercial sensitivities expressed in some of the submissions. Reflecting the government's commitment to transparency, we have indicated to all those who have made written submissions that we intend to table their submissions should they agree. I am also pleased to make those submissions public today on my department's internet site. We will not stop at this point in our commitment to inclusiveness and transparency. As the negotiations get underway, which I anticipate will happen from March next year, the government will continue to consult fully on the terms of its participation and to convey feedback on the course of the negotiations. APEC is our leading forum for trade and investment cooperation, and cooperation in this important sphere binds our region together. Membership of APEC expands Australia's focus beyond the domestic market and provides tremendous opportunities to create jobs and income. Australian business has access to over 2.5 billion consumers and around 60 per cent of global income in 21 APEC member economies. These economies also purchase around three-quarters of Australia's merchandise exports. In the last decade, APEC exports have more than doubled to nearly A$5 trillion, and APEC economies have generated 195 million new jobs and 70 per cent of the increase in the world's economic growth. The region accounts for nearly 60 per cent of world GDP and over 50 per cent of international trade. There has been a substantial increase in trade and investment between countries in the region over the last two decades, which has contributed strongly to economic growth and cooperation. Australian trade with parties to the transPacific agreement negotiation amounts to more than 20 per cent of Australia's total two-way trade in goods and services and is growing at an average of nearly five per cent each year. The trans-Pacific partnership initiative has the potential to make a positive contribution to continued economic liberalisation and integration in the Asia-Pacific Region. It will, importantly, allow us to engage the United States, under the new Obama administration, in the evolving economic architecture in the Asia-Pacific region. These are early days with the initiative, but it is my firm view that we have to be part of it. Extending the principles of openness and multilateralism will lead to less trade discrimination, lower trade tensions, less trade diversion and higher global economic welfare. We are pursuing these goals vigorously through our efforts to secure a successful conclusion to the Doha Round. We also need to start knitting together bilateral trading rangements if we are to make progress towards our goal of ensuring FTAs, free trade agreements, are truly consistent with the multilateral system. We need to start harmonising the rules in these various FTAs for the benefit of our business communities. Apart from laying firm foundations for trade reform, this initiative will also help position Australia to sustain its economic future, which is particularly pertinent given the current global economic uncertainty. The fact is that Australia is one of the few developed countries forecast to continue to grow. We are also well positioned because of our trade focus on the Asia-Pacific region, which is in our time zone and which is also forecast to grow. But we must build the framework which strengthens the role of trade reform for economic growth and which underpins the principles of multilateralism. Australia's participation in the trans-Pacific partnership is an important step in this direction. I table the priorities and objectives for participation in the trans-Pacific partnership and a summary of the views expressed in public consultations, and I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Leader of the Nationals to speak for 16 minutes. Leave granted.",117
149,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss speaking for a period not exceeding sixteen minutes. Question agreed to.,120
150,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The opposition supports Australia's participation in discussions to establish the so-called trans-Pacific partnership. This proposal builds on a trade ararrangement already put in place known as the P4, which was put together by Chile, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei. In a sense, the P4 would not have been one of the most difficult agreements to put together, because most of the countries have limited trade with one another and, in addition to that, the range of issues would have been small. It was perhaps something of a surprising agreement because, again, the countries concerned do not especially have a degree of geographic affinity or, for that matter, a lot of commonality. Nonetheless, I think that emphasises the point that the Minister for Trade made in his statement that there has been a rapid growth in FTAs, and some of them have been quite curious partnerships. I think that the fact that the P4 has put gether countries from a range of different geographical areas and with different interests provides an interesting foundation for a potentially wider arrangement. The proposal now to extend the P4 to P7, P8 or maybe even a wider agreement is potentially quite exciting. Of course, it would be a gigantic step to bring into an arrangement like that a country like the United States, because it would be a much, much bigger partner in that kind of arrangement than any of the other current participants, or, for that matter, a country like Australia, which has considerable ambitions in relation to our export opportunities in many of these countries. I am somewhat concerned that there has been an emphasis, perhaps, on quantity rather than quality in free trade agreements around the world. Some of the things that are labelled free trade agreements are clearly not consistent with the WTO's rules in relation to what can be called a free trade agreement; in fact, they are probably a direct breach of the members' commitments to the WTO, but this seems to have been overlooked for a period of quite some years now. Everyone takes some degree of pleasure out of incremental advances in free trade around the world, but some of these agreements are really just that-at best an incremental advance. They do not provide the comprehensive breakdown of trade barriers that is expected from a WTO-consistent free trade agreement. In fact, what is obligatory for a WTO-consistent free trade agreement is that it be WTO-plus. Many of these are WTOeven or sometimes even WTO-minus. There are a lot of agreements around, and some countries are able to boast that they have a very large number of agreements, but they do not necessarily have a particularly freetrading regime. So I think it is important that we also emphasise the importance of quality-that there be real advances. Let us not to do deals for the sake of clocking up additional numbers of agreements and getting certificates on the wall. What we actually have to do is to deliver fairer and freer trade around the world. Let us not sign up to an agreement just for the sake of improving relations with the country if there are not any real advances in the opportunities for Australian industry and new initiatives which lead to genuinely freer and fairer trade. A bad deal is worse than no deal. A bad deal is one which enables high levels of industry protection and barriers to trade to be entrenched. In fact, when we agree to a free trade agreement that leaves in place significant levels of protection, we provide a comfort zone for the country that signed the agreement. They can stand behind, sit behind or, even worse, relax behind or lie down behind the legitimacy of a free trade deal and feel as though they do not have to take any further steps. So we should not be prepared to accept deals that are bad deals and that do not in fact make significant advances. The minister said in his speech: Our announcement to join negotiations on the Trans Pacific Partnership is perhaps the most important initiative the Rudd Government has taken to fulfil that aim. That may well be the case, although it might be said that there have not been many other initiatives so there was not much competition. The statement then goes on to say that the reason for that somewhat flamboyant statement is about the hope for the futurethat this agreement might lead to a more significant Asia-Pacific free trade agreement. You see, the most significant countries in this latest round of discussions-countries like New Zealand, Singapore, the United States and Australia-all already have free trade agreements generally with one another, so one would expect that this agreement will need to go beyond those arrangements so that there is some additional benefit. Our trade with Brunei, for instance, is about $1.1 billion, but all of that except $32 million is oil imports from Brunei, so the trade is quite small. When it comes to Peru, our total trade is $152 million. When you talk about Vietnam the trade is much larger, but again two-thirds of that trade is oil imports from Vietnam. I think that, of the countries involved in this initial round of discussion, the potential for us to have a stronger trading relationship with Vietnam is perhaps the most important, although I welcome any breakdowns in barriers and any new trading opportunities, whatever country they might be with. The clear hope is that the P4 might expand to a P7 or P8 and then perhaps something broader covering a significant breakdown in tariff barriers. If we can in fact achieve the 90 per cent elimination in tariff barriers across all the countries that are involved on entry into an arrangement, that is certainly a worthwhile advance. I know that there have been discussions over recent months-in fact quite a few years, but the new government has taken up the mantle-in relation to the ASEANAustralia-New Zealand free trade agreement. Having been a trade minister for a while, I appreciate some of the difficulties that there have been in those negotiations. Good progress was made and we thought we were close, but when most of the Asian countries went home they found a whole range of new difficulties that had to be addressed. I am aware of statements that have been made that some kind of agreement has now been reached, although the text of that is not available; we have been told that the agreement has been made even though certain issues are not resolved. I do not even know what those issues are, although my guess is that one of them might happen to be the car industry, which would be a bit of a sensitivity for the minister himself and obviously is of some interest to all Australians. I think that, if there is to be an ASEAN free trade agreement with Australia and New Zealand, it needs to set the example. It must be a good deal and not a poor deal. For it to be a good deal, the countries of the ASEAN group will have to be prepared to open up their markets for Australian goods. It cannot be a one-way deal where Australia and New Zealand provide opportunities to the countries of ASEAN without getting anything in return. There must be genuine progress towards reducing industry barriers and protectionism in the countries of Asia so that the merits of a free trade agreement can actually flow through to the economies of Asia as well as to our own. This does create some sensitivities, I appreciate, in the countries of Asia, who are of keen to protect their own industries and have been very, very slow to wind back protection measures. In addition to that, there has been a desire for Australia to break down quarantine barriers, for instance, which is simply unacceptable. We cannot put issues like biosecurity on the table when it comes to discussion about trade, and that has been an issue that many of the countries in the ASEAN group have had difficulty accepting. I am looking forward to hearing and learning a bit more about what has allegedly been agreed in relation to the ASEAN-AustraliaNew Zealand FTA. I think it is an important grouping which can also play a key role as a building block to a wider Asia-Pacific free trade area. So all of those sorts of things are important developments and need to be pursued. While I am talking about the importance of having good deals rather than bad deals, let me make a couple of comments about the Doha Round, which the minister also referred to in his statement. I note with interest that the APEC leaders made a statement calling for the Doha Round to be advanced; it sounded very much like the same leaders saying the same thing as they said in Sydney. Some little progress was made, and it is good to have the commitment of international leaders but it is not necessarily the key to turning out a successful outcome. The G20 also made similar comments about wanting the Doha Round to come to finality. I notice that the British government is part of the G20 and two days ago they announced a new duty on international travellers, which suggests that protectionism is alive and well in the UK and that there is no new-found enthusiasm from the leaders of the G20 to break down barriers. They are in fact putting a new tax on people who travel to and from the UK and that tax will fall most heavily on countries like Australia that are further away. So I do not think that there has been, in spite of the joint statements that might be made at G20 and APEC, any fundamental turnaround in the desire of not only the Europeans but also the Americans to actually embrace a significant level of trade reform. We should not be desperate in relation to the Doha arrangements to get a certificate on the wall or to get to a stage where we have traded everything off and ended up with signatures but no actual gains. I repeat again what I said earlier: the real problem with having an agreement that everyone is prepared to sign up to but does not actually make any progress is that countries slip back into a comfort zone. They have nothing more to do until there is another round of trade talks. This was the problem with the Uruguay Round because it allowed farm subsidies, export subsidies and the like to fester because they were put off to another time. I appreciate there are a few things potentially to be gained from the Doha Round. I understand there is a high level of agreement on issues such as an end to export subsidies, although that is some way off. There is some commitment to tariff cuts, although that is mainly in the water with very little pain associated with it. There is some commitment to reduce industry subsidies, although in the case of the United States it will pretty much be an academic cut because, with prices the way they are at the present time, it is highly unlikely that there would be a call for anything like the amount of money that will still be available to the US under these kinds of subsidy programs. We know, of course, from past experience that the US frequently has found tricks and ways to get around the rules of the WTO to in fact deliver more protection to their farmers than would otherwise be allowed. There is an important case currently before the WTO in relation to US farm subsidies and I hope that the Australian government is giving urgent consideration to participating in that case. It is a very important case because it seems to have identified a whole range of new issues in relation to industry support in the United States which will have ramifications across the world. It is an important test case and Australia should be there and be a part of it. What we really do want out of Doha, if it is worth doing, are actual real reductions in protection, real reductions in subsidies that actually happen and cause some pain and deliver real results. Then we want practical market access, not theoretical market access but real market access that does not have a whole stack of conditions attached to it which make it very difficult to be taken up. From an Australian perspective, it is also important that the developing countries are prepared to pay their way. I acknowledge that many of the most difficult issues have been unwillingness by the developing countries to provide access to their markets in return for the demands they are making on the developed countries. I accept that developed countries can do more than developing countries, but developing countries have got to show good faith and goodwill as well. I am particularly perturbed about some of the non-government organisations that advise the least developed countries that they should hide behind protection or that they can expect everything to be done for them rather than acknowledge that their economies will benefit most by being more open and that their consumers will have access to leading technology and the best things in the world which will then drive competitive industries in their country as well. So a successful outcome to the Doha Round would be an important boost to world trade, but only if the deal is a good one. So I appeal to the minister, who I do not very often have the opportunity to be able to speak to directly on these issues, that if he comes back with his signature on the dotted line, to make sure that it is something he will be proud of in two or three years time; that there will be Australians actually exporting and getting advantage from the Doha deal rather than just have his name in history as the person who signed the deal and perhaps achieved little for our country. The final point that I would like to make is that these discussions in relation to a Pacific partnership are welcome but let us not lose sight of the two most important bilateral free trade agreements that we should be concentrating on at the present time-that is, China and Japan. Japan is still our most important trading partner; China our most important export market. Any agreement that we can make with China and Japan has the potential to provide enormous benefits to Australia. I know they are hard but they are well worth doing. I was disappointed when the government cut funding to negotiations for the free trade agreements with Japan and China because they ought to be priorities. They ought to be the areas that we are concentrating on. I know the department is stressed with resources, but please do not take any resources away from the Chinese and Japanese negotiations in order to do the new Pacific partnership deals or for that matter any of the other FTAs. Our relationship with Japan is long-standing and needs to be refreshed. Our relationship with China is growing and strong but needs to be underpinned by a quality free trade agreement.

151,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Stirling proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to develop a plan to save Australian jobs. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",124
152,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The transDeputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is obviously a very busy woman because she cannot find time to come into this House to discuss Australian jobs. With ‘Kevin 747', the Prime Minister, jetting off overseas most weeks, the Deputy Prime Minister seems to spend half her time acting as Prime Minister and seems to enjoy it too. She is the Minister for Education overseeing perhaps the most timid revolution in the history of the world. She is the Minister for Social Inclusion. She is the Deputy Prime Minister. She is the minister for enhancing her partner's curriculum vitae. She is a very busy person. Of course, amongst all these responsibilities she is also the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Yet you never hear the minister for employment mention jobs. She will talk ad nauseam on workplace regulation. She is never happier than when she is horse-trading with the union movement about what they can and cannot have under their new workplace system. You can get the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to wax lyrical about the minutiae of industrial law. Yet on the biggest issue is facing this country, on the biggest issue that is facing this government, an issue for which she has direct responsibilityAustralian jobs-she remains practically mute. This is a minister who has got her priorities seriously wrong. It is as though the government is the captain of the Titanic, they have hit an iceberg, the ship is taking water, people are running for the life rafts, yet the minister for employment is running around fretting about some loose screws in cabin 24B. I am not sure that the minister for employment actually understands what is going on in the real world. Everywhere I go the issue of job security is raised with me. We consistently have lists in the papers of impending job losses across many different industry sectors in Australia, including industry sectors such as mining that have previously been robust and supported job creation in this country. Every economic forecaster, including the government's own, points to increasing unemployment. In some cases it is especially alarming: the chief economist at JP Morgan predicts that one million Australians will lose their jobs within the next two years. Regardless of which set of forecasts you believe, it is absolutely clear that unemployment in Australia is going up. Unemployment is now the No. 1 policy challenge that faces us in this parliament. Yet if you look through the public statements of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations you will see that she refuses to address the issue of jobs. In her speeches she rarely talks about jobs or job creation. I brought some examples of her speeches into the House today. If you look through them all, she does not mention jobs once-not in a speech to the House on 14 February on the Skills Australia Bill or in her second reading speech for the first tranche of the government's workplace relations reform or in that speeches outside the parliament. Never does she mention jobs, the most serious issue that is facing this parliament. Quite frankly, at a time when unemployment is on the rise, the minister for employment should think about nothing else than how she would go about creating Australian jobs. She should think about nothing else than how she is going to keep Australians safe in their employment. It should be the subject of her every waking thought. It should be the priority of every policy discussion. Addressing this problem should be the primary aim of the government, yet we have a minister who has too much on her plate to effectively address this issue. The impact of the global financial crisis will obviously complicate this role, but the government must not wash their hands of this problem. We cannot have a government that accepts a challenging international economic climate as an excuse to put more and more Australians out of work. The state of the global economy only makes this issue more pressing. I might just remind the House of the record of the previous government in this area. In 11 years of coalition government, between March 1996 and November 2007, more than 2.2 million jobs were created. Of these jobs, over 1.2 million were full time and 950,000 were part time. There are currently well over 10.6 million Australians in work, a record high. Over 7.6 million are in full-time employment and three million in part-time employment. In December 1992, under Labor, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 per cent, leaving almost one million Australians unemployed. Dr Stone-Most long-term unemployed.",124
153,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Long-term unemployment in August 2007 was 66,700. It was slashed by almost two-thirds under the Howard government and it was almost 80 per cent lower than the peak of 330,000 set in May 1993 under the previous Labor government. Very long-term unemployment stood at 33,000 in August 2007 and had fallen sharply from its peak of 171,000 in November 1993. Long-term unemployment fell by 3.7 per cent from March 2006 to November 2007. There was a 21 per cent increase in real wages under the coalition, compared to a 1.8 per cent increase under Labor. That is a pretty impressive record. Mr Brendan O'Connor-Nothing to do with the mining boom!",126
154,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister interjects it was nothing to do with the mining boom, but we are now seeing job losses even in that robust industry under this new government. The state of the global economy only makes this issue more pressing. Since the Rudd Labor government came to power, business and consumer confidence has steadily fallen to lows not seen even under the Keating Labor government in the early 1990s and unemployment has steadily risen from the record low of four per cent in January this year. In the 12 months since the Rudd Labor government came to power there have also been large and well-publicised layoffs across the country. According to the OECD in their report released today, the unemployment rate is expected to rise from the current level of 4.3 per cent to 5.3 per cent next year and then six per cent in 2010. In this time, GDP growth is expected to decrease from 4.4 per cent in 2007 to 1.7 per cent this year. The National Australia Bank's most recent economic outlook survey has unemployment increasing to over 6.5 per cent, well in excess of the government's own forecast. Yet no matter where we look we see the same theme coming from the Rudd Labor government. That is no plan to save Australian jobs. In just one year of Rudd Labor government the resilience of the labour market in this country is now looking shaky, and we are faced with a minister who has no plan to save the millions of Australian jobs that are currently at risk due to the ineptitude of this new Labor government. The government has been spending the coalition's hard earned surplus-we have heard today that the government is about to go into deficit-and we now have the OECD saying that the effectiveness of the federal government's $10.4 billion economic stimulus package may be limited if confidence is not restored. A Sensis consumer report released earlier this year highlighted the concerns that Australians have about their financial future. In particular, the report noted that unemployment has not been on the nation's radar for some time, but that since May concern about this issue has risen more than for any other issue. The government's leading indicator of employment for November, released by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, confirmed that employment prospects are continuing to decline. This indicator has now fallen for 10 consecutive months. Earlier this month we saw the Treasurer release Labor's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which listed off a series of policy responses to the current economic crisis. Yet againthis will come as no surprise to my colleagues in the coalition-the document contained not one reference to a government plan to save Australian jobs, despite providing confirmation of a slowdown in employment growth and a significant increase in job losses. We have seen the Treasurer try and tell us that the new economic security package will create over 70,000 jobs-and that was repeated in the parliament today-yet we have had no analysis, no formal modelling, and no plan from the government on how jobs will be created. Sadly, it appears that this theme is set to continue. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations conceded that her new regulatory framework for workplace relations will increase costs, no doubt leading to more job losses, but once again she was unable to provide any plan to save Australian jobs. And it gets worse. In addition to the admission from the government that their new IR framework will increase costs, it is clear that the government once again has dodged their own requirements to submit a regulatory impact statement with this new legislation. If I can, I will cast members' minds back to 17 March of this year, when the Minister for Finance and Deregulation made a ministerial statement on best practice regulation requirements-the new requirements that he was setting up for the Rudd Labor government. I would just like to read the introduction because it takes us back to an interesting phase of this government. The minister said: Increasing Australia's long term productive pacity is the key to maintaining downward preslouder sure on inflation and therefore downward pressure on interest rates. That is something we do not hear from the government any longer. He continues: As Labor announced prior to the election, a key element in the government's plan to increase Australia's productivity is our deregulation agenda. The minister went on to say: The level of regulatory impact analysis required is greater the more significant the regulatory proposal is likely to be. A preliminary assessment must be undertaken for all regulatory proposals. Proposals likely to involve medium business compliance costs must also have a further full quantitative assessment of compliance cost implications using the Business Cost Calculator or approved equivalent. Proposals likely to have a significant impact require even greater analysis, including compliance cost quantification, to be undertaken and documented in a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS). Yet, in one of the most significant policy documents that this government has produced in this House, what do we find under the heading ‘Regulatory analysis'? We find two paragraphs, and in them we learn that the Prime Minister has granted an exceptional circumstances exemption for these proposals at the decision-making stage. So we had the minister for finance saying how vital it is that the government conforms to its own requirements for a regulatory impact statement, yet on one of the most significant policy documents this government has produced in its 12 months in office they exempt themselves from the requirement for one of these regulatory impact statements. On this side of the House we know that it is not good enough to put in place a workplace regulatory framework and stand back and expect that jobs are going to be created out of thin air. The government has just sat back and watched the unemployment rate increase and listened to the forecasts of incacreasing job losses as the alarm bells get and louder, yet they have provided no plan to this parliament on exactly how they intend to save Australian jobs. Incredibly, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, despite conceding that the new framework will increase costs for employers, has not required a detailed, rigorous analysis of the new framework and how her new legislation will impact on Australian jobs. It appears that the minister for employment-despite her or her representatives attending at least 50 meetings on the regulatory framework for the workplace relations system-cannot even find time to talk about creating or protecting jobs, which is the main issue that is facing her in her portfolio. A review of the speeches made by the minister for employment over the past 12 months reveals that she never, ever mentions or addresses the issue. Sometimes it can be difficult in this place to measure ministerial performance. The measures of success or failure can be hazy and clouded in the rhetorical battles that occur in this chamber. But when you are the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations you have absolutely nowhere to hide. You have one very clear indicator of your performance. You can be judged on your success or failure by the rising or falling of the rate of unemployment. If it goes down, as it did under successive ministers in the Howard government, then you have been a success. If it goes up, as it has been doing under this government-if Australians are losing their jobs in increasing numbers under your tenure-then you have clearly failed. Not only does this government not have a plan to save Australian jobs or to create Australian jobs, they are wilfully ignoring this issue by their actions. It is time that this minister, who has not had the courtesy to appear in the chamber for this important debate, faced up to the biggest issue in all of her portfolios-the one that she refuses to mention, the elephant in the room that she is determined to ignore: the issue of saving Australian jobs.",126
155,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Can I say, having listened to the contribution by the member for Stirling, that the first job that is at risk is his. If he is trying to prosecute an argument on behalf of the opposition about what the government should do in assisting workers keep jobs and indeed in assisting job seekers to find jobs and that is the best he can do then the opposition is in a whole lot of trouble. The fact is that in the 15 minutes of his contribution today the member for Stirling did not have one idea about what we should be doing in relation to this very important matter-not one idea. The Prime Minister quite rightly in his statement today made it very clear how significant, how important and how potentially adverse the consequences will be of the global financial crisis across the world and, indeed, in this country.",128

The Prime Minister quite rightly said today prior to question time that the impacts of the global financial crisis on our economy will be real. Its impact on our businesses will be real. Its impact on our families will be real. Its impact on our workers will be real, and its impact on our country will be real. The first thing you have to do if you are going to tackle a problem is identify it and, indeed, recognise it. Those opposite are talking as if there is no global financial crisis. They are acting as if nothing has changed this year",128

160,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"whereas the entire world knows that there has been fundamental change to economies across the world as a result of these changes. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who wants a bob each way, who likes to walk both sides of the street when it comes to any policy prescription that might be under consideration by government, the government acted very swiftly to respond by ensuring a fiscal stimulus to our economy. Before I get to the detail of the response by the government in relation to this very important area in ensuring that we protect and create jobs, can I say that it is clear that the opposition are quite happy to make merry, to make fun, of the fact that people might be losing their jobs. They seem to concern themselves with what may be the perception of the government if unemployment rises rather than concerning themselves with the unemployed or with those people who may lose their jobs. As Terry MCCrann, a very credible economist from the Herald Sun, said recently in relation to the Leader of the Opposition's stance: It probably isn't a good idea for the Opposition Leader to implicitly call Glenn Stevens and the staff of the Reserve Bank a bunch of idiots. Mr Keenan interjecting",129
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Stirling will cease interjecting!,129
162,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Terry MCCrann went on to say-and he is quite right in making this point: This is not a good time to undermine ability of our banks. What we have had from the opposition throughout the last six weeks has been an effort to undermine the economic performance of this nation and to call into question the financial institutions of this country in order to score cheap political points. That is what has occurred in the response by the opposition to the global financial crisis. The one thing we will not do is listen to the architects of Work Choices about what we should do for workers. The last thing we will ever do is ask those who designed Work ChoicesMr Morrison interjecting,129
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Cook will cease interjecting!,129
164,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"the worse and most radical assault on the working people in this country since Federation-what their view is on protecting workers, because we know that they have no regard for workers and their families. That is of course why they introduced Work Choices, the most radical, extreme, anti-worker legislation this country has ever seen. So we really do not need any lectures from those on the other side about what to do for workers. I made reference to the economic fiscal response by the government. We took decisive and early action to stimulate the economy. We took decisive and early action to protect vulnerable people in this country by introducing a $10.4 billion economic security package. As the payments are made to vulnerable Australians-pensioners, veterans, carers and parents-the package will do a number of things. It will provide protection for those people who are vulnerable to costof-living pressures and other pressures. It will also provide the necessary economic fiscal stimulus to the economy to protect the interests of small, medium and larger busithe profitnesses in this period. We have had criticism from those opposite in relation to that package. On the one hand they say that they embrace the stimulus package. On the other hand they seek to undermine it. They have to make up their mind whether or not they support the support for pensioners, carers, parents, veterans and others and support for small businesses and other businesses that will be beneficiaries of the fiscal stimulus. They have again shown their capacity to walk both sides of the street in this debate and never stand behind the government in responding to the global financial crisis. What we will see very shortly are lump sum payments of $1,400 to single pensioners, $2,100 to pensioner couples, $1,000 each for eligible persons who are on the carer allowance and a $3.9 billion package to support two million lowand middle-income families. We will be delivering a one-off payment of $1,000 for each eligible child in their care. Those who will receive the support include families who receive family tax benefit A, families with dependent children who receive youth allowance or Abstudy or who benefit from the Veterans' Children Education Scheme payment. Another part of the package which is important is the $1.5 billion investment to help first home buyers. These elements of the Economic Security Strategy will provide much needed relief for those people who are in that situation but will also provide sary fiscal stimulus for the economy. In relation to our regulators, the Reserve Bank have made decisions which have also provided some relief and will provide confidence in the economic system and confidence in our economy as we go forward. The opposition ask what we are doing in creating or protecting jobs. That decision was made decisively and early and, as a result, we are in a position to create jobs. Mr Keenan-How many jobs will that create?",129
165,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We made very clear that that stimulus package will create up to 75,000 jobs. Mr Keenan-Based on what?",130
166,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This particular forecast is advice we have received from Treasury. It is an important element of the response by government to this difficult global situation. In addition to that initiative, recently the Prime Minister and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research announced the New Car Plan for a Greener Future. That is a $6.2 billion package over 13 years that will provide support for the automotive industry in this country. It will also ensure that there are new initiatives so we can see a reduction in carbon emissions, provide improved opportunities for our automotive industry and improve their opportunities in the marketplace. This initiative-again something the opposition seems to have two positions on-is a very important response to protect the 60,000 direct jobs and 200,000 indirect jobs in the automotive and automotive parts industry. Again this was a swift response by the government to protect jobs in this country. It is not coincidental that, subsequent to the government announcing this very important car plan, Ford announced that it will keep the Geelong neces- plant and maintain employment there. Last week, as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government mentioned in question time today, there was the $300 million package for 565 councils across the country. This initiative will assist with small infrastructure projects. It will provide opportunities to create local jobs across the country. It is the third element of the government's response to protecting and creating jobs in this country. Those three ideas are concrete proposals. We have heard nothing from the opposition on their position on this matter. Mr Keenan interjecting",130

We concern ourselves with those issues because we, unlike those opposite, relate to workers, empathise with workers' needs and do not see them as mere units of labour. Those opposite may talk about jobs all they like but in the end all we have to do is go to Work Choices to see exactly how the previous government considered it should relate to working people. We are very interested in seeing, notwithstanding the comments of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday in a media conference, what the opposition do in relation to the Fair Work Bill in the Senate. We will see whether Work Choices is dead or not. We do know that many members opposite have been defending Work Choices throughout this year.

179,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have been in the House for quite a long time and I have never heard 15 minutes of such waffle uttered by a minister of the Crown. It is absolutely clear that the Deputy Prime Minister is a very busy person. However, one of the key issues confronting Australia today is job security and jobs. The minister could have come into the chamber to address this important issue, but she has run away from the parliament and she has sent in a message boy, the Minister for Employment Participation, who simply did not perform adequately at all. I listened carefully to what the minister said, and he abused the honourable member for Stirling. He accused the honourable member for Stirling of not having any answers, but I want to draw the minister's attention to the topic of the matter of public importance: the failure of the government to develop a plan to save Australian jobs. On 24 November last year the Australian people made a decision that I suspect many of them now regret. They elected the Rudd Labor government, and as part of the creation of that government the Minister for Employment Participation took on his role, as did the Deputy Prime Minister. We have the global economic crisis, but what the minister has done is to fill in his 15 minutes by talking about anything other than the government's plan to save Australian jobs. Having listened very carefully to the minister's contribution, one can only assume that the government simply does not have a plan to save Australian jobs. Sure, the minister spoke about the 75,000 jobs that will allegedly be created as a result of the stimulus package. He spoke about some assistance to the motor vehicle industry. He also spoke about some assistance to local government which will create some minor employmentMr Snowdon-Minor employment?",131
180,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"some not very high levels of employment through minor local projects, and he highlighted three particular areas where the government may have done a little. However, what he failed to address is the forecast that unemployment is going to dramatically increase. In its latest economic outlook, the OECD has forecast a prolonged downturn, heralding weak prospects for labour demand. As was indicated by the shadow minister, the projected outlook is that the unemployment rate will drive up from its October level of 4.3 per cent to 5.8 per cent by the end of next year and six per cent in late 2010. It has been predicted that 140,000 people will lose their jobs over the coming months as a result of the crisis, and yet the government has continued to fail to come up with any solutions. All the minister has done is to turn on the member for Stirling, to heap abuse upon his shoulders and to accuse him of not having the answers. Frankly, I can understand why the minister is asking the honourable member for Stirling for answers: because the minister himself and the Deputy Prime Minister do not have any answers between them. At least the Minister for Employment Participation had the courage to crawl into the chamber and purport to represent the government. I do not know where the Deputy Prime Minister is, but she is not where she should beand where she should have been is at the dispatch box, at 5.13 today, to respond to what the opposition was saying. The Australian people elected the Rudd Labor government with high expectations. The Australian people expected answers. At the first challenge to that government, the global economic crisis, we find that the government's performance has faltered. The Prime Minister trips around the world talking at conferences, and yet at home the situation is quite dire. I challenge the minister to get out of his ivory tower, to go out there and talk to the Australian people, to talk to people who are concerned about employment. The minister, in his speech, spoke at length about assistance packages to pensioners, to carers-to all sorts of people. However, he did not address the need for jobs. The best way to create jobs is to have a robust economy, such as the economy that the Howard-Costello government implemented over 11 years of office. We repaid $90 billion of Labor debt. We created two million jobs. Most of them were full-time jobs, but there were also part-time jobs. Yet we find that it is now projected that, under the stewardship of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment Participation, we could have a situation where that shocking record under the Keating government of having a million Australians out of work could well be replicated. Is this what the Australian people voted for on 24 November last year? It certainly is not. They would certainly be disappointed, and I see the situation as being quite shocking. In fact it is a disgrace, because-let us face it-the Labor Party claim to be the party that is interested in the worker. They brought in the Fair Work Bill yesterday and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations focused on union rights. She focused on extra costs to business. She basically introduced a bill that will cost jobs. Mr Brendan O'Connor-Are you voting against it?",132
181,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The situation, Minister, is that the government has its focus entirely wrong. The government is focused on implementing legislation which will destroy job opportunities for generations of Australians. Just walk down the main street of any town or city in the country and you will find that small business and large business have never had a lower level of confidence, and this is after barely 365 days of Labor government. The National Australia Bank's most recent economic outlook survey has unemployment increasing to 6.5 per cent-well in excess of any government forecast-by mid-2010. In the mid-year forecast, sure, the Treasurer upgraded the anticipated number of unemployed-although not to the extent that independent people said-but the reality is that this government is fiddling, it is talking, it is abusing the opposition and it is playing party politics. It is doing everything other than addressing the desperate job crisis that is now confronting Australian families. Just imagine, Minister, what it is like to be a breadwinner and to be threatened with redundancy because of the economic situation. Many of these people voted for the Labor Party last year and now many of these people are seriously worried. Minister, I ask you to stop playing politics. I ask you to stop seeking solutions from us. I ask you to think very carefully about the need to save Australian jobs, because the government will not have the economic wherewithal to deliver desirable social outcomes unless the government receives income from taxes-and you do not receive income from taxes unless you have got Australians in real jobs. I listened carefully also to an answer given during question time by the Deputy Prime Minister in relation to jobs. She talked about the 75,000 jobs allegedly to be created as a result of the stimulus package. Mind you, I will believe that when I see it. I would like to believe it is true but, given the government's comprehensive failure in so many areas, I am not confident that that is in fact going to occur. She then moved to support services in the area of unemployment. So she did not have any answer. She had even fewer points to make than the Minister for Employment Participation did in this MPI. Maybe that is the reason why the senior minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, has run away from her parliamentary colleagues in this MPI. So no matter where we go, no matter where we look, we find that the Rudd Labor government simply do not have an answer with respect to jobs. The Rudd Labor government are simply wringing their hands. They have collectively made a decision that this is just too difficult. They wish that next year would come. They wish that the economic crisis had not occurred-as, indeed, we all do-but they simply do not have the mettle to take on the challenges presented to government at this time. Any party can provide government in good times. The test of a good government or a bad government is the ability to govern for all Australians in bad times. At the present time we face increasing job challenges, lack of job security, high els of concern in the community, and yet this minister has the audacity to come into the parliament and not give us any response. He comes into the parliament and waffles on, he talks, he fills up his 15 minutes, but at the end of the day we are little clearer than we were at the outset of this debate on just where the government are going. The government have run out of steam. This is amazing after 12 months! (Time expired)",133
182,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course the minister was absolutely right when he said that the member for Stirling and those opposite had no answers, but he was far too kind to them. Not only have they not got any answers, they have not got any questions! The member for Stirling, who raised in his speech his concern that there had not been enough discussion from the minister about unemployment, has been in this parliament as the shadow minister for a year and, in a year, has managed to ask how many questions about unemployment? One! One question in 12 months! Mr Keenan interjecting",134
183,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This issue is such a high priority for the opposition, and for the shadow minister, that in 12 months he could muster enough muscle to ask one question. Mr Keenan-Where have you been for 12 months?",134
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Stirling should be aware of his status.,134
185,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And when did he do that? Did he do that when the parliament first met, when obviously it would have been on his mind? No, he did not. Did he do it when the Labor government introduced a budget with a $20 billion-plus surplus? No, he did not. Did he do it after he came back from the winter recess in August? No, it was not imlevportant then. He only managed to ask his one single question in a year on this important topic in October-after the Labor government had announced its initiative of a $10.4 billion stimulus package. Mr Keenan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Before this member continues to embarrass himself even more, I would like to tell him I have been the shadow minister for all of six weeks.",134
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Stirling has already been warned; he is on very thin ice. There is no point of order.,134
187,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was going to come to that but, now that you have brought it up, let me come to it straight away. Let me give you a bit of free advice: when you want to raise those sorts of arguments, it is good to do a bit of groundwork. Now you may have floated position by virtue of the leadership change rather than other characteristics. I would not regard your six weeks in the job as the highlight of a parliamentary career. But as it happens, your predecessor did not ask any questions either. So the opposition, who want to pursue this matter as an issue of great concern, do so from a very false platform. Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order: there have been several ‘yous' and ‘yours' in that speech and they should not be allowed.",134
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I invite the member for Brisbane to address his remarks through the chair.,135
189,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I apologise, and of course I should not have said ‘you', Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know that would be a gross misrepresentation of your view. I was clearly referring to the members of the opposition. I am happily corrected on that. Yet again we have seen, as we have seen on a daily basis, an opposition that cannot hold to a thought for more than 24 hours. It has been the case here again. Someone asked today, ‘What are we going to talk about today in the MPI?' It is a great challenge for the tactics committee, so they decided to talk about unemployment-even though they have shown no interest in it whatsoever, even though the government has acted decisively, in a very significant way, with a $10.4 billion stimulus package, along with support for the vehicle industry, along with a number of other packages that time may or may not permit me to talk about, but some of which I know were touched on by the minister. In spite of that, the paucity of knowledge and tactics in the opposition leads them to raise this as an issue, once again demonstrating that 24 hours is a long time for the concentration span of those opposite. But who better to second this from the other side than the member for Fisher? When it comes to changing positions, I think he holds the record in this place. This is the son who came into this parliament as a National Party member, then changed to become a Liberal Party member, and then after the last election listed himself on the members' register as a Liberal-National Party member before finding out that he was the only one who did that. I thought that was a career move to make him the leader of a political party. It turns out I did him a disservice. He was not endeavouring to become the leader of a political party; he just made a mistake, so now he is a Liberal again. So who better to be involved in a flip-flop performance than the member for Fisher?",135
190,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is true that I have been a member of the National Party and the Liberal Party and the Liberal-National Party",135
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Fisher knows this is not a point of order!,135
192,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that I did not join the Labor Party; I had to draw the line somewhere.",135
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order! The member for Fisher will resume his seat.,135
194,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think the House notes his plea of guilty. Mr Deputy Speaker, the simple fact is that when the global economic crisis clearly became an issue, this government was on the front foot, well ahead of the game, well ahead of others around the world and well ahead, I have to say, of many commentators and those opposite. The trouble for those opposite is that, given that is the case, they have not been quite sure what to do. They instinctively knew they could not oppose it, so they said they supported our $10.4 billion package. They then spent weeks doing their best to undermine it in this place. That duplicity will win the opposition abpersolutely no support-none here in this place with the commentators and none out in the real world, where it matters and where the Australian citizens look at what we all say and do. That $10.4 billion stimulus package-and I do not have time to go through all of it-will insulate a large portion of the Australian economy, including the tourism industry and the retail industry, in the three months ahead as we go through the summer vacation period. The money will go to lowincome Australians, and we are confident it will be used constructively for their benefit and for the broader economic benefit of our nation. It is good policy, good social policy, good economics and-I have to say-good Labor economics. It will make a difference to many families. Mr Simpkins-There's no such thing as Labor economics!  Secker)-Order! You have been warned.",135
195,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Even on that we find ourselves in a situation where those opposite cannot agree. In his contribution today the member for Fisher decided to have a bit of a swipe at that. The Leader of the National Party-and I think it is still the National Party and not the Liberal-National Party; I am not sure-Barnaby Jones, has been on the record a number of times complaining about the package. Senator Barnaby Jones needs to have a look at the comments of those who are recipients.  Secker)-The member will refer to the senator by his correct name.",136
196,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Okay, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is Barnaby Joyce. Mr Snowdon-Is he otherwise known as Jones?",136
197,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is commonly referred to as Jones! There are actually some serious commentators out there in the business community who know the importance of that package to their businesses, to their profit lines and to their capacity to keep their doors open and people employed in the difficult months ahead. My attention has been drawn to a comment by Gerry Harvey about the situation he confronts. These are difficult times for all retailers. He is clearly one of the retailers who will have to look hard at their bottom lines. In the last 24 hours he has said that he supports the government's $10.4 billion fiscal stimulus package and that he believes the government was probably doing a pretty good job on it. He is at the sharp end of this. The retail sector is facing a pretty bleak Christmas. Had it not been for the Commonwealth government's initiative, had it not been for Labor's stimulus package, we would be now confronting a much worse situation. The fact that we are not has been recognised globally. It may not be recognised by Liberal and National members of the parliament, who struggle daily to find some issue to attack us with, but it has been recognised widely. We are all aware of the OECD report published overnight that identifies Australia as one of the very few countries in the OECD not forecast to go into recession. Indeed, it forecasts the growth rate in Australia to drop down to about 1.7 per cent and to then rise the year after. That is a very significant achievement. Whenever we talk about that achievement, those opposite immediately say, ‘That's only because we were in government before.' Mr Irons-You haven't achieved it yet!",136
198,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is true; it has not been achieved yet. It has not. I am talking about the forecast. Every time that forecast is mentioned, those opposite want to claim some credit by saying that something they did three or four or 10 years ago has somehow produced it. I will tell you what produced the surplus that has enabled these funds to be used: it was the May budget and the way that was crafted. That was a difficult thing to do. It was not only a difficult thing to do; it was a thing that those opposite seldom did. My time is running out, but there is one thing that I think needs to be corrected because it comes up so often in these debates. People talk about budget surpluses without much regard for the facts. This fact usually gets overlooked, especially by those opposite. Between World War II and when the Hawke Labor government came into office in 1983, those opposite were in power throughout. It was a boom period. In that period there was not one surplus budget. The Commonwealth ran its first surplus budgets in the Hawke-Keating years. To give you an example: in 1988-89, the budget surplus was 1.8 per cent of GDP. This is what Terry MCCrann said after the member for Higgins boasted about a budget surplus. He sobering to be reminded, as the budget papers do, that an earlier world champion Treasurer had-' (Time expired)  Secker)-Order! Can I remind the member for Swan that he is not in his proper seat should behave himself.",136
199,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Rudd government showed scant regard for employment when it ran up the white flag and predicted 134,000 Australians would lose their jobs in the period after the 2008 budget. The government's lack of will to fight unemployment comes into even starker relief when you look at the current economic conditions. Local and overseas agencies know we are in trouble. The OECD has predicted unemployment will rise to six per cent by 2010 and the government itself has again thrown up its hands in surrender, saying we can expect national unemployment of five per cent by June next year and 5.75 per cent by June 2010. But the national bank says it will be even higher. The national bank says will be 6½ per cent. So jobs are going to be scarce under Labor, and there is no doubt regional areas will be hardest hit. Looking at the unemployment rate for the entire Wide Bay area-my area-over the past 20 years, the all-time high was in February 1996, just before we came to power, when it was almost 20 per cent. The all-time unemployment low, ironically, in the October just before we left office was 3.9 per cent. Those figures are from either side of the Howard government. I am sad to say that the region's unemployment rate is already creeping up under Labor. The Wide Bay-Burnett area is an ideal template for what can be achieved when the right regional development policies are put in place. Conversely, if job losses increase to Hawke-Keating levels, we could see unemployment in my area back said, ‘It's to around 15-plus per cent. As members are aware, I delivered a dissent to the interim House committee report Funding regional and local community infrastructure. There was no malice in it, I might add. The committee's recommendation and that commercial enterprises not be considered for funding-despite the evidence in favour of it-is a huge mistake. The 20-year recovery achieved in the Wide Bay-Burnett area cannot happen without robust local enterprises. One such example is Austchilli, a Bundaberg-based company which processes and packages small crops for the domestic and export markets. Austchilli was due to receive $650,000 from Regional Partnerships so it could complete stage 2 of its development, incorporating state-of-the-art highpressure pasteurisation of food products. It would have created 25 new jobs and, despite the fact that the former Deputy Prime Minister announced the project, the Rudd Labor government withdrew the funding, causing the loss of these potential jobs as well as six it other positions within the company. Austchilli also lost a contract to provide avocado puree to a nationwide food outlet-the same product is now being imported from Mexico. The infrastructure committee took some very interesting evidence at the public hearings. The former mayor of the Isis Shire, Bill Trevor, told the committee of the importance of government supporting business, which in turn creates jobs in the regions. He said: The last thing a community needs is a bright new shiny toilet block but no jobs … Jobs in rural and remote areas are extremely important for the value-adding that they do in a community. He went on: If you take away all those opportunities to bring forward the technical advancement and development of industry in rural areas, then, what we are going to have left is people on unemployment queues. It was hard to get money into regional and rural areas from banks previously. It is going to be even more difficult in the future to convince the bankers to lend into regional and rural areas because of the financial situation around the world. This is where these grants-whether it be through Sustainable Regions, Bundaberg Futures Programs or the Regional Partnerships-play a vital role in lifting the technology job values and ting the enterprise grow. And he goes on: By having this grant coming in it allows it to happen now. We need jobs now in rural and regional Australia, not in 10 or 15 years time. What he and I are saying is that small and medium industries are essential for the growth of provincial communities. They are a buffer against creeping unemployment. When government supports small and medium industries it gives confidence to banks and other investors to come on board. Government approbation creates a level of confidence in itself. That is why seeding programs must continue. The government should not wring its hands about unemployment and throw money at the problem. Rather, the answer is in strengthening regional employment profiles.",137
200,Mr SYMON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It comes as no surprise to me, the day after the introduction of the Fair Work Bill that returns fairness to Australian workers, that we are in here entertaining the opposition's efforts to distract us all from the fact that they are the party of Work Choices. And it is with some temerity, might I add, that they want to have a debate about jobs-about a plan for jobs-after yesterday's events and their atrocious track record of ripping off workers' rights. But we are very happy to have this debate if the opposition want it and I am happy to talk about some of the things the Rudd government is implementing to boost jobs and drive our economy into the future. The member for Swan might even call this a case of ‘double happiness'! A good place to start is to look at the Rudd government's early and decisive response to the global financial crisis through our $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. As the Minister for Employment Participation said earlier, fundamental change across the let- economies of the world is happening because of the global financial crisis. With payments of $1,400 for single pensioners and $2,100 for couples, one-off $1,000 payments for people receiving the carer allowance and $1,000 one-off payments for each eligible child of families who receive family tax benefit A, there will be a direct economic boost to our economy as these payments arrive from 8 December, and increasing the first home buyer's grant has already led to a pick-up in demand in the housing industry. Sustaining demand in the economy protects jobs across many industries, especially in the retail and service sectors. The government has brought forward an additional 56,000 productivity places for job seekers for 2008-09, taking the government's commitment to over 700,000 training places. This comes as part of the government's Skilling Australia for the Future initiative. The issue of skills is something the previous government neglected for 11 years and is one of the very reasons that we still have jobs unfilled whilst there are people unemployed. Without training in the areas of need this problem will only grow, as it did throughout the term of the Howard government. Many Australian employers have not been able to find enough skilled labour in the required areas and imported labour is used in some cases to fill these skill shortage gaps. Proper job development depends on us having workers with the right skills for the future. Six hundred and forty-five thousand training places over five years in the vocational education and training sector will be created through the Productivity Places Program to develop the skills that Australian industry needs. Three hundred and ninetytwo thousand places have been allocated as part of this program to allow people currently in the workforce to upgrade their skills or retrain to better meet the needs and employers. Over 300,000 additional VET places will be available to people outside the workforce to acquire skills and gain lasting employment, and more than 58,000 job seekers have already enrolled in the program in just over six months. Fifteen thousand of these people have already completed their training in areas of skill shortage and almost 1,000 of these job seekers referred for training by their employment service provider have already obtained jobs. Training for new skills and increasing productivity are central to the government's economic agenda. The Australian government is working cooperatively with state and territory governments and has fast-tracked 4,500 places for the health and community sectors. Labor governments have always been the governments that care about workers and working families. For the opposition to cry crocodile tears about the effects of the global financial crisis on jobs just does not ring true given their attack on workers and workers' rights in the Work Choices debacle. And while on the issue of training, we have also established over 1,000 new training places for nurses in our universities as well as providing incentives to encourage thousands of nurses who are out of the workforce to return to work. And of course we have our trade training centres programs for secondary schools to help address shortages in both traditional trades and emerging industries. Already 34 projects have been approved in the first round of the program and this covers funding of nearly $100 million with 96 schools involved across those 34 projects. And, quickly, we can turn to the government's enormous nation-building agenda.  Secker)-Order! The time allotted for this of industry discussion has now expired.

202,Mr SULLIVAN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to rise today to support the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008. This bill has very simple objectivesthat is, to enhance market confidence in a time of significant market volatility. I think that we are all aware of what is going on around the world today, despite the fact that just a short while ago members opposite believed either that it had been caused by the election in Australia in November 2007 or that it was in fact a furphy. This bill does three things, which have been canvassed reasonably widely, but I wish to visit them again. Firstly, it bans naked short selling. Secondly, it requires full disclosure in relation to covered short selling. Thirdly, it clarifies ASIC's powers under the Corporations Act 2001. The member for North Sydney was a bit concerned whether we knew what short selling was when he came into the House before question time today, so I thought that I would tell him briefly that I do understand what short selling is. Short sellReference ing is the practice of selling shares that the seller does not own, then buying the shares back to complete the original transaction. Covered short selling is selling of borrowed of the shares-the sense of which escapes me somewhat. Naked short selling is selling shares that do not exist. In 2005, Patrick Byrne raised the alarm in the US about naked short selling. He was ridiculed for his views and pilloried widely within the financial community. I note also that Warren Buffett was widely reported, but also disregarded, when he raised concerns in the early part of this century about derivatives, arguing that such highly complex financial instruments were time bombs and ‘financial weapons of mass destruction' that could harm not only their buyers and sellers but the whole economic system. History has shown who was right in that case and also in the warnings that Patrick Byrne was making in 2005. Naked short selling has been blamed by some as a contributor to the global financial crisis, just as many hold that short selling tactics are a major cause of all market downturns-for example, the 1987 crash. Others will be much better placed than me to make judgements regarding the degree to which those views hold true. Schedule 2 of the bill effectively bans the practice of naked short selling in Australia. Naked short sales have a high risk of failure-that is, when settlement is due, the seller does not have the shares to transfer. ASIC can, if it sees fit, allow some naked short selling. It is assumed that this power will be used only when such sales are necessary to ensure the ordinary operation of financial markets. There is plenty of support for the practice of short selling. The website Investopedia, for example, expresses this view: … short selling makes an important contribution to the market. It provides liquidity, drives down overpriced securities, and generally increases the efficiency of the markets. Short sellers are often the first line of defense against financial fraud. It goes on to say: … work from short sellers is often regarded as being some of the most detailed and highest quality research in the market. Its been said that sellers actually prevent crashes because they provide a voice of reason during raging bull markets. That is high praise indeed. The Reserve Bank in Australia considers that both short selling and the associated securities lending add to market liquidity and pricing efficiency. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in its June 2008 report Better shareholders, better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia remarked upon the existence of a ‘widespread view that short selling activities are not subject to sufficiently rigorous disclosure requirements to ensure shareholders remain adequately informed'. All members of parliament and all members of society-except those with an ulterior motive-would want to see that people participating in our markets are adequately informed. Consultation during the drafting of this bill saw the government receive submissions from a wide range of stakeholders. Investors, brokers, ASIC and the ASX all made submissions. That wide range of stakeholders broadly supported disclosure of covered short sales, but offered different views as to how this could be best achieved. Short selling, it seems, is here to stay, though, as I said before, I personally struggle with the concept of selling shares you do not own to people who are buying them with money they do not have. We saw a large number of such investors suffer quite savagely when margin calls were made earlier this year as the stock market headed south. In reading some material for this debate I came across an unattributed quotation. I cannot tell you who uttered this wisdom, but it is wise. It was: ‘You can never control the market; you can only help it reach the best conclusion by providing as much information as possible.' The provisions in this bill that go to providing that information are found in short schedule 3. It is that schedule that the opposition indicated earlier today that they will be opposing. The shadow minister for financial services, superannuation and corporate law, the member for Aston, made that clear during his contribution. To be fair, he did also say that he offered the government the opportunity to redraft these provisions through his amendment. The question is, of course, what is it about the disclosure of covered short sales that has the opposition so spooked that they would try, as they did in the other place, to delay the passage of this bill; so spooked that, when my colleague, the member for Leichhardt, sought to canvass the matter, he was continually interrupted by fallacious points of order taken by the member for Calare? These are good provisions. Transparency in the market is particularly important at this time, and the sooner this bill passes through this place the sooner Treasury can consult the industry about the details of the regulations. Delaying, or watering down, these provisions is not in the interests of this nation at this time. It may be in the interest of sections of the community with whom members opposite curry favour; I simply do not know. But I do know that the approach taken by the opposition does them no credit in the context of Australia's response to every nuance of the global financial crisis. Schedule 1 of the bill contains the provisions dealing with ASIC's powers. These go firstly to clarifying ASIC's powers to regulate short selling. ASIC's powers as set out in the Corporations Act 2001 are more than likely adequate to allow ASIC to undertake this action. However, these changes make it clear-crystal clear-that the power does exist. Similarly, this bill validates the actions that ASIC has taken so far in relation to short selling. Again, this makes it clear that the power exercised was a power anticipated by the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001. Taken together, these are sensible measures. The absence from the 2001 legislation of explicit power does not mean that the power does not exist. The rules applied in statutory interpretation would more likely than not confirm that. However, these are times when certainty on regulatory matters is vital and therefore it is prudent to include quite explicit provisions in the principal act. I want to spend a moment in considering those actions taken by ASIC in relation to short selling in the market. On 21 September, ASIC put a 30-day ban on the covered short selling of securities, a ban that they extended on 21 October as a consequence of the market conditions that existed at that time. On 13 November, they announced that that ban would be lifted except in relation to the 46 securities that make up the S&P and ASX 200 financials index, plus five other securities. At the same time, they indicated that the ban on covered short sales of those 51 securities would remain in place until 27 January 2009. The ban on naked short selling, as indicated by ASIC, is to remain in place indefinitely. The announcement of 13 November also included a reporting and disclosure procedure, which market participants are following. Interestingly, the daily gross short sales report for 24 November shows that 27 of the financial securities on the S&P ASX 200 financials plus five list were short traded on that day. Clearly, that shows that ASIC is working with market participants to ensure what we require: the orderly operation of the market. Australia's strong position in the context of the global financial crisis is due in no small part to the financial regulators. As one of those regulators, ASIC is delivering for the market and the people of Australia the certainty that is required at this time of volatility. This is a very good bill. The measures in this bill are important. They make improvements to the market architecture. They are deserving of the support of all members in this House. They have my support. I commend them to the House.",140
203,Ms SAFFIN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"The Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 is necessary for a number of reasons. Short selling has a higher risk of settlement failure and these types of transactions have the power to distort-and do distort-the operation of the market by increasing volatility. They also facilitate market manipulation, a scenario that has arisen given that we now have a global financial crisis. It is one that we have to mitigate. This bill does just that. It is not as if it is a new situation, though, as this bill is filling a gap in the Corporations Law identified in and present since 2001seven years ago. But it has taken Labor to come to government and the Rudd Labor government to take the action to fill that gap. It was necessary in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, but it is even more necessary and pressing now. I do not know why the previous government failed to take action in this area, particularly when it was a government that liked to tell us that it understood the market, financial issues, the economy and the world of finance. I submit that, if it did, a lot more would have been done in this area and in a range of other areas. I might have strayed a little from the direct purpose of the bill, but it is necessary to identify why the Rudd Labor government is having to take this action and mop up after those years in this way. The reason for our move to prohibit short selling is self-evident, but it will do the following. It will enhance the integrity of Australia's markets and complement action already taken to strengthen our financial system through the national regulation of credit and financial services and forthcoming action on credit rating and research houses. It will dampen the volatility. It will bring some certainty-as much as it can-to a market area that does carry risks. The nature of investment has some risk at its core. You can never legislate risk out entirely, so there has to be a balance between the right type and quantum of regulations and allowing the investors and the market to function. I suggest that this bill is on the mark in that regard. It gets the balance right. The lack of any clear legal framework and system-wide disclosure of covered short selling has created this uncertainty or added to it. It is of a type that is not healthy and it has damaged market confidence, not strengthened it, hence the urgent necessity to get the bill through now. I have heard in the debate some people speaking along the lines of, ‘The regulations are yet to be filled in, particularly by ASIC.' If you look at the way the taxation system works, there are a lot of things that get what I would call not ‘filled in' but ‘filled out'. That is the way it works and that is the way this will work as well. Some things have to be a developmental process. We cannot envisage every situation and scenario that is going to arise that could be characterised as short selling, and it is absolutely necessary to allow the regulator the scope to oversee it. The bill contains three key measures and I want to say a little about those. The first is the prohibition of naked short selling. The bill removes the general ability of people to enter into naked short sales under the Corporations Act. But ASIC still has the power to allow naked short sale transactions if it considers them appropriate. It is envisaged that ASIC will use this power to allow some nonspeculative naked short selling. That is necessary to ensure the ordinary operation of the Australian financial markets. Short selling is in a sense speculative, and that is one of the things that the legislation and the regulatory framework have to try to come to grips with. It is the speculative nature of the short selling that is a problem and causes the distortion and the volatility. The second of the three key measures is the disclosure of covered short sales. This bill establishes the legal regime for the reporting of covered short sale transactions to the market. The market practice as we currently know it has developed where most short sale transactions are not reported, and that is an unacceptable situation. It means that the system is not transparent, and if we do not have transparency in the market we end up with mayhem in the market over and above the normal argy-bargy and risks that people are willing to take. These problems, though, are amplified by the current global financial crisis, which adds to the volatility in the market. The amendments will assure the reporting of covered short sales, and that enhances the transparency and integrity of our financial markets. The third key measure is the clarification of ASIC's powers. In that area, the Corporations Act grants ASIC the general power to omit, modify or vary certain parts of the Corporations Act through declarations. The bill specifies how this general power applies to short selling-and this is how it should be. This is how it has to work when we are dealing with the market and shares. The amendments make it clear that ASIC has the power to regulate all aspects of short selling, cluding prohibiting these transactions and imposing or varying requirements on these. These powers will also extend to transactions with the same or substantially similar market effect as short selling. We can envisage some of those situations, but it would be impossible to describe them. We would end up with a law that could be larger than the tax act. Some of those situations will arise and emerge and some of them we do not even know about today. It is appropriate that that power is with ASIC. The amendments also expressly state that the short selling declarations made by ASIC early this year were within the scope of ASIC's general power. My brief reading of it-and there is always a debate about whether the regulator has the power or notsuggests to me that it did have the power, there were doubts raised. If there are doubts raised, then the view is always taken that those doubts have to be put to bed, and this bill does that precisely. I shall now turn to some other issues arising out of this bill. There was public consultation on a draft bill and that prompted submissions from a wide range of interested parties, from investors and brokers and the regulators. There was a general consensus that supported the disclosure of covered short sales, but with a wide range of views on how to achieve it. There was not universal support-one can never hope for that as some people just want to be left alone, business as usual. But that is a situation that is not possible, not acceptable, not tolerable. Inaction in this case is harmful. We need corrective action. I know some also subscribe to the view that we can leave the market alone. It is called the Gaea principle-somehow the earth will correct itself and in the same way the market will correct itself. But that does not happen. The market builds up. It is an institution in its own right-admittedly, a in- very unwieldy institution of sorts-and it does require regulation. It does require law and it requires good public policy, and that is what this bill will provide. Covered short sales represent a small part of the market, but for something that is small it has an inordinate impact on the market in terms of the distortion that it can create. When people talk about it on a percentage basis and say, ‘It may only be a few per cent,' the impact is exponential. That is why it cannot be allowed to continue the way it is. Also, it was shrouded in what could only be termed secrecy. It is this secrecy that the bill is designed to address. I also want to say a little about the provision for ASIC to fill out the regulatory framework. I did a straw poll of members in this House on all sides and asked them to but explain what they thought short selling was. It was interesting. Yes, I did ask the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs as well-that is why he is turning around and smiling. He knows what it is. The responses I got on what short selling is were interesting. I have seen a lot of the argybargy across the chamber with people saying: ‘Go on. You say it. You describe it.' It is an area that a lot of people have not been involved in. I am just making the point that within the market and within this area it can be complex and it can be confusing to some. However, short selling is pretty straightforward and there is a variety of ways of describing it. In essence, short selling is selling something that you do not own and there are whole lot of other flow-on effects and scenarios that arise out of it. But it is the secrecy issue and a lack of transparency that is a real problem. I would like to talk here about ASIC having the power to, what I call, fill out-not fill in-the regulatory framework. It is not possible to define in forensic detail all scenarios that can be characterised as short selling or covered, in this case, in the same way that all tax liabilities cannot be so defined in that forensic way in an act. That is why-and I am arguing by analogy but it is very apt in this case-the Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office has a similar power within law. He has all the checks and balances so that the tax liabilities can be filled out in the same way. That is why it is necessary to have this power. I note that opposition members are saying that they object to that. But it just does not make sense because it is vital to have that provision within the act. With those few words, I would like to commend the bill to the House.",142
204,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.12 pm)-I would like to thank all honourable members who contributed to this debate. The Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 is particularly important, especially in the current environment. It will improve the regulation of short selling while also enhancing the integrity, fairness and transparency of our markets. Importantly, the bill provides certainty about the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to regulate short selling, including transactions that have a substantially similar market effect as short sales. The recent international financial turmoil has highlighted the need for this certainty so that ASIC is able to respond quickly to issues that could potentially threaten the fair and orderly operation of our markets. The bill also puts beyond doubt ASIC's recent use of its power to make various class orders in relation to short selling. The amendment will importantly provide certainty to business. The bill bans naked short selling. This is subject to ASIC's ability to grant exemptions from this prohibition. The government foresees the ASIC exemptions may allow some non-speculative naked short sales to ensure ordinary operation of the market. There are concerns around increased settlement risk as there are no available securities earmarked for settlement and naked short sales can cause increased price volatility, potentially facilitating market manipulation. There is also limited evidence of any significant market wide benefits from naked short sale transactions. Finally, the bill provides for the disclosure of covered short sales with regulations made under the bill to set the time and manner of such disclosures. This measure is primarily about transparency which will enhance confidence and market integrity. The uncertainty surrounding the activity of covered short sellers in the Australian securities market is having a significant impact on Australian capital markets. We have seen a significant price decline in some shares which has caused considerable speculation about the role of short selling. This speculation is affecting confidence in the market, particularly among retail investors. The disclosure of covered short sales will provide useful information to investors and regulators, contribute to pricing efficiency and also promote confidence and integrity. Let us be very clear. These three interrelated measures, all the measures, including schedule 3 and disclosure, are essential and urgent. These are measures supported by ASIC and the Australian Securities Exchange. They add further to the integrity and clarity of our market. It is particularly disapon pointing that the opposition is being so irresponsible on this matter. It is particularly disappointing that they have chosen to continue their grave irresponsibility in the face of this crisis. They have undertaken a number of steps during this financial difficulty which have left the financial markets in Australia shaking their heads at the irresponsibilof ity of the opposition, and we see another instance of that this evening. The shadow minister has foreshadowed that he will move to remove schedule 3, which is the schedule relating to disclosure. The opposition seem to think it is fine to let the current temporary arrangements continue. They seem to think it is fine to let the ASIC imposed emergency arrangements continue ad infinitum. What they do not recognise, or they choose to ignore, is that there no legislative backing for those and therefore there is no penalty regime. So there is a regime in place which is appropriate for an emergency situation, but is not appropriate ongoing. What is appropriate ongoing is that we have a situation where there are penalties for ignoring the law. At the moment the opposition want to continue the situation where there is a set of arrangements in place with no penalties. They ignore the views of ASIC, they ignore the views of the Australian Securities Exchange and they ignore the views of ASFA, the peak body which represents APRA regulated superannuation institutions in this country, and instead search around desperately trying to find an area in which they can differentiate themselves from the government. They try and find an area to score cheap political points, and that says more about them than it says about anything in this bill. Every day that this legislative gap remains open, every day that this anomaly remains, every day that ASIC's powers remain unclear or unlimited and every day that we rely only a potentially non-legal suspension of naked short selling is another day of market uncertainty. This bill stands to protect retail investors and Australian companies. If the opposition had succeeded in delaying the consideration of this bill, as they attempted to do in the other place, presumably authorised by the shadow minister and the Leader the Opposition, then we would have seen this bill delayed even further, and we see the shadow minister moving in this place to remove a very important schedule, schedule 3. He deserves to be condemned, as I am sure the market will condemn him, for doing so. It is critical that this bill is passed to deliver certainty to the market and allow the Treasury to commence further detailed consultations with industry about the regulations. The shadow minister says the bill is far is too broad and that it allows too much scope for moving within the regulations. What he does not recognise is that it is appropriate for the regulations to be the main mechanism for setting the detailed regulation of this matter. We need to have a situation where the government, on the advice of regulators, can respond flexibly to what is a very fluid situation. The shadow minister would like a situation where the parliament needs to consider any changes. Presumably, if there were an emergency situation, he would like to see the parliament recalled in order to change the legislation and not give the minister the power to change the regulations. That is a view we reject completely in this House and we will reject it in the other house. We will continue to vigorously argue for the legislation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.  move: Schedule 3, page 6 (line 2) to page 12 (line 6), omit the schedule. The opposition is moving an amendment to the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 to amend schedule 3 of the bill. We are doing that because we do not believe, and nor do by far the vast majority of Australia's financial services stakeholders, that schedule 3 is an appropriate schedule to be in this bill as it currently stands. I have indicated in my speech in the second reading debate that the opposition supports the government in relation to schedule 1 and schedule 2 of the bill. The issues that surround schedule 3 go to certainty, clarity and substance for the market. Despite what the minister just articulated in his remarks, it is the industry and various other stakeholders that have an issue with the government's bill, in addition to the opposition of course. I think it is interesting to reflect on some of the comments that were presented as evidence in the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. I have to say that, regrettably, this was a very rushed inquiry and unfortunately, outside of ASIC and the ASX, only two other organisations were granted permission to appear before the inquiry, despite the requests of many organisations. They were not given the opportunity to appear before the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The representative from IFSA, Mr O'Reilly said: Regulations are essentially there to fill in some of the detail and put flesh on a skeleton. The law itself should have the fundamental and basic requirements and give direction on what should be in regulations. Obviously, the House has the ability to change legislation, whereas when it comes to regulations, unfortunately, they are presented to the House and can be disallowed in whole but cannot be amended, which cuts down the level of debate on appropriate provisions which could be in the regulations. He continued: Certainly our preferred position is that a disclosure regime for short selling is a fundamental and very important structure for our industry and those features should be in the legislation, not in the regulations. That is a quote from a senior representative of one of the most senior organisations of Australia's financial services. I think that goes to the heart of the issue. What is an interesting question-and I would be very interested in the minister's response-is: why is it that the government has not been able to put the necessary detail into the bill? The government released an exposure draft of the bill back in September and yet, in their own explanatory memorandum, they acknowledge that the details are not in the bill and therefore cannot be costed in the regulation impact statement. The EM says that the details regarding implementation and the like are yet to come by way of regulation. It is an important question and I will be interested in the minister's response. Why is it that after several months the government has been unable to incorporate into the legislation any of the detail that our financial services stakeholders in Australia need and require in order to have the certainty and the clarification so that they can go through with implementation? There has been consultation over a long period of time and yet there is no substance in the bill. The bill outlines a skeleton or, if you like, a shell legislative framework. The opposition absolutely supports greater disclosure and transparency, but schedule 3 in this bill will not achieve that. It does not achieve it. The problem that we have and the reason why we feel obliged to highlight this to the parliament is that the work has not been done or, if it has been done, it certainly has not been incorporated into the schedule. That leads us to having this level of concern and to sharing the level of concern that the broader industry has. (Time expired)",145
205,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.24 pm)-Of course the honourable gentleman is deliberately misrepresenting the government's position. As I made clear in my closing remarks to the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008, the government has the view that it is an appropriate balance for the framework to be set out in the legislation and for the detailed implementation to be set out in the regulations to allow the government to respond flexibly on the advice of regulators to emerging and fluid situations, which is entirely appropriate in the circumstances. The government has thought long and hard about this and believes that the right level of detail is set out in the legislation and that appropriate that further details be set out in the regulations.  Contrary to what the minister has just said, the vast majority of people in the industry do not agree with the government, clearly. Minister, if you go through the transcript of all the evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, you will see that the overwhelming amount of evidence highlights the issues that I am highlighting in relation to this schedule. I think there are a couple of other interesting points here. The minister may not know that at the Senate economics committee inquiry hearing the other day, a representative of the Treasury acknowledged-it is in Hansard-that the bill and the approach that the government is taking are less than ideal. There is another question I would like to ask the minister, although he did not answer my first question, but I will have another go: why has the Treasury not made public the submissions to the exposure draft? There have been several submissions provided to the government in relation to the exposure draft and none of the submissions have been made public. There must be a reason why the government would not release the submissions. As it so happens we have obviously received a number of copies of the submission ourselves, so we know what is in the majority of submissions. I think the problem here is that the minister at the table is refusing to acknowledge not so much what we are saying but what we are saying on behalf of the industry and the concerns that we are expressing about the enormous lack of substance and detail that is in this bill. So, Minister, if the Treasury says that the approach is less than ideal and the government has not released the submissions to the exposure draft, they clearly have not taken on board the comments from the it is stakeholders in the industry. I would like to ask the minister at the table why it is that he is not open to the opportunity of allowing schedules 1 and 2 to go through, which we think are important and-whilst the intent of schedule 3 is important-allowing some more time so that the government can do the work that is needed, because clearly there is more work to do. The government acknowledges that. There is a lot of work to do in relation to getting the regulations right. The minister knows the impact that that will have on the system. The government has said that they are going to consult on the regulations. So this is nonsense about this bill being urgent-the regulations are most likely months away. It cannot take effect until the regulations are tabled and put into effect. The minister knows that the current ASIC undertaking can continue. The current ASIC undertaking is there. It can continue. He knows that. There is no uncertainty in the marketplace. Why won't the government entertain the idea of going back to some of the submissions, going back to the stakeholders, consulting with them and putting the detail that is needed into the bill? Then we can all support a bill that provides clarity and certainty. I am appealing to the minister at the table, who is representing the government on this matter, to consider allowing schedules 1 and 2 to go through. The opposition is giving the government the opportunity to go back and do the work that is needed. We are providing you with that opportunity. I would like to ask the minister why it is that he will not entertain that request.",148
206,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.29 pm)-The shadow minister raised a number of issues. Firstly, he misrepresented the position of the Treasury and mischaracterised the evidence given by the Australian Treasury to the Senate, which is very unfortunate. Secondly, he asked why the government is determined to proceed with this bill. This is something which has been covered extensively in the debate. The passing of this bill allows the making of the regulation. With the passing of this bill the Treasury can consult, in conjunction with the government, on the detailed implementation of the regulations. Until this bill is passed, those regulations cannot be made. The honourable member may or may not be aware that this is the second-last sitting week of the year. This bill must be passed through both Houses of the parliament or we will have a temporary arrangement in place over Christmas and into the new year until the parliament resumes in February, with no penalty regime in place. The honourable gentleman appears completely relaxed about a regime which says: ‘This is what you shall do and this is how you will disclose-but if you do not do it, no problem. It is fine with us; the opposition does not care.' That is not acceptable to this side of the House.  minister is misrepresenting the opposition's position and particularly my words. I am disappointed that the minister would take such a tactic and line. I really am disappointed in that. I can remember the situation being quite reversed on a number of occasions during the last term of the last parliament. I can remember the now minister, who is at the table, serving it up to the then government quite strongly. The minister really should not take the position of the pot calling the kettle black, should he? The minister is failing to recognise that the ASIC order and bans currently exist. The market is currently operating under those orders and they can continue to exist. As a matter of fact, the ban on the short selling of financials is currently in place until towards the end of January. If, for some reason, ASIC needed to extend that, the minister knows they can do that very easily. So there is a regime that is in place and that argument is a nonsense. Clearly, the government have not done their work. The industry-and I am only echoing the concerns of the industryis obviously very concerned and distressed about this. If it goes through as it is, it will create even more uncertainty. I would have thought that the government and the minister may have been open to our proposal, given the dislocation and the enormous impacts that the government's policy on the bank guarantee has had. I would have thought that the government may have learnt their lesson-that they are not particularly good at this sort of thing. They have got it wrong before, and what we were seeking to do was provide a legitimate opportunity for the government to actually do it properly and go about it in a proper way. Question put:  to.

209,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax-Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 is necessary to correct some serious errors brought about by Labor's rushed deal with the minor parties in the Senate on their legislation to increase the luxury car tax from 25 mittee per cent to 33 per cent. It turns out that this bill is necessary because now, in the cold light of day, it has become clear that the amendments agreed to in the Senate were unworkable and it is necessary to make these corrections to this bill now so that those exemptions that were negotiated and passed through the Senate can actually take effect. Specifically, it will clarify that a purchaser of a luxury car is considered the purchaser for the purposes of the luxury car tax even if the car is purchased through a finance company or through a lease. In a similar way, it will clarify that, even if a car was ordered before budget night and the financing arrangement for the car was made after 1 July this year, the tax will not apply. Finally, it will confirm that those eligible for refunds under these provisions will be paid them directly. Without these corrections, around 60 per cent of those eligible for exemptions in the deal struck in the Senate would not actually have got them-that is, without these amendments, which are necessary to fix serious errors brought about by Labor's rushed deal, someone purchasing a car that was meant to be exempt would not have been exempt if it were purchased through a lease company or if it had been ordered before budget night but paid for after 1 July. This is illustrative of what happens when Labor cobbles together a series of amendments in the Senate. What we have is that, for 60 per cent of farmers and tourism operators who were promised some exemptions, these would not have applied and would not be possible without these amendments in this bill that is before us now. The only reason the government have become aware of the necessity for these corrective amendments is that they were advised by the car industry some time after their first legislation went through. Indeed, Treasury officials at the recent estimates hearings said that the government first knew of the problem with their amendments when it was brought to their attention by the car industry. The luxury car tax amendments which were passed are contradictory in so many ways. They mean that now, under the new arrangements, there will be a tax break for an imported BMW 3 Series but there will be a luxury car tax on top-of-the-range Holden Commodores. There will be a total exemption for the Jaguar X-Type from the luxury car tax but there will be a luxury car tax on the top-end Ford Falcon, with an extra $1,000 in tax. We have made our position on the increase in the luxury car tax clear through debate this year. We made the point that there already was a luxury car tax of 25 per cent. For the government to cobble together these amendments, which were so ill considered that nearly 60 per cent of those they were seeking to exempt actually would not have been exempt, in the first place is very illustrative of their incompetence in this regard. Naturally, because we are correcting their failure, we will not oppose this bill. This will give exemptions where they were first intended some weeks ago, but it is a very good example of how this government make policy in so many areas. This is a sham of their own making. This amendment bill is necessary to fix their mess, and because it will give effect to some exemptions we will not be opposing it.",151
210,Mr BRADBURY,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax-Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 and wish to make a few observations in relation to these minor technical amendments. They are, of course, technical amendments of a minor nature, given that they are designed to correct some drafting difficulties that emerged with the amendments that had been moved in the Senate in relation to the government's proposed increase in the luxury car tax, which formed a central part of the budget back in May. I note that as a result of negotiations that occurred in the Senatein particular in relation to proposals that were put forward by Senator Fielding-the amendments that were ultimately carried sought to ensure that primary producers and tourism operators would be shielded from the increase in the luxury car tax by being allowed to claim it back from the Australian Taxation Office as a rebate after purchasing their vehicles. Clearly the intention of those amendments was to ensure that farmers and tourist operators acquiring vehicles that would otherwise be subject to the luxury car tax increase would be protected from those increases regardless of whether or not the vehicle itself had been purchased specifically by the end user, whether it be the farmer or the tourist operator. The way in which the amendments were drafted did not adequately take into account leasing arrangements, and I understand that right across the farming sector and the tourist industry it is not uncommon for bill lease-type arrangements to be in existence. Indeed, I have seen some figures to suggest that they could involve anywhere up to 60 per cent of the particular users of those vehicles within these two sectors. Clearly this was a situation that was not satisfactory. Given the legislative intent of the earlier amendments, something had to be done, and the government, in consultation with Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and, indeed, with industry, has sought to bring these minor technical amendments before the House as quickly as possible in order to remedy this situation. I note the member for Casey had indicated that this matter emerged as a result of industry concerns. That was certainly confirmed by Deputy Commissioner Konza of the Australia Taxation Office at the Senate estimates hearing held earlier this year. Certainly, the government has sought to act as quickly as possible to accept that that position needed to be rectified and to bring this amendment before the House. At the time these details emerged, I note the Chief Executive Officer of the National Farmers Federation, Ben Fargher, said: We do not need any taxes on business inputs, and if the intent of the policy is to exclude ers, then they need to have another look at it. Indeed, the government has had another look at this and that has led to the bringing of these amendments before the House. In relation to the specifics of the bill, there are amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 and, of course, the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act 2008. In relation to the amendments to A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 subsection 18.5(2)(a), the bill proposes to insert after ‘refund-eligible car' the following: … you have borne luxury car tax on the supply or importation if you had acquired the car directly rather than entering into a financing arrangement relating to the car. Clearly, the effect of these amendments moved by the Senate earlier this year is to put beyond a shadow of a doubt that the benefit of those refunds will be passed on to the end user of the vehicle, whether it be a farmer or a tourist operator. By inserting that particular provision, we will be achieving absolute clarity in relation to that particular proposal. Clause 13 of the bill relates to the bill's application and states: The amendments made by this Schedule do not apply where: (a) the contract to make the taxable supply or taxable importation of the luxury car was entered into before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 13 May 2008;which, of course, was the time of the budget announcementor (b) the contract to make the taxable supply or taxable importation of the luxury car was entered into before that time and, after that time, a contract to finance the making of the supply is entered into. farmClearly, the benefit of these provisions would not flow on in cases where arrangements may have been entered into after the event. Before I conclude on this matter, I will make a few general observations in relation to the luxury car tax. I note that those on the other side have been a little bit free with the truth when it comes to the facts on this matter. One of the issues that they have certainly not sought to highlight or publicise in any way is the fact that the very first tax on luxury cars-though it was not called a luxury car tax back then-was introduced during the Fraser government. So the suggestion that it has always been the Labor Party bringing forward proposals to tax luxury cars does not stand up to any rigorous analysis. I also note that the luxury car tax in its current form found its way into legislation with the introduction of A New Tax system in 2000-and I note the presence of the member for Higgins in the chamber at the moment. So, far from being a new tax, this is an amendment to an existing tax. Indeed, it was first introduced by the Fraser government and its more recent manifestation was a tax that was introduced by the Howard government under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, the member for Higgins. I will conclude by saying that I think that the various investigations, reports and the Senate committee inquiries have gone a long way towards dispelling some of the myths in relation to larger vehicles. One of the suggestions in relation to the luxury car tax was that it would be a tax on large families. I remember stating the position very clearly when the substantive bill was before the House that I did not believe that to be the case. The evidence brought before the Senate Standing Committee on Economics certainly held that to be the case. Having now achieved passage of that bill through this particular amendment, we will achieve clarity and ensure that the intention of the Senate and indeed this parliament that the benefit of the refund will be passed on to the end user, whether it be tourist operators or primary producers. I commend the bill to the House.",152
211,Mr ROBERT,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Who would have thought that I would be standing here for the second time in two days asking the question: why are we always required to fix Labor mistakes? Yesterday I was speaking on the wholesale banking guarantee bill after we had been calling for a month for this government to simply pass legislation. The banks were calling for it; the financial world was calling for a turn; we were calling for But, oh no, our nervous little Treasurer would not have a bar of it-until finally he relented. And here we are now for a second day fixing a Labor mistake. Today's introduction of the so-called ‘minor amendments' to the Rudd Labor government's illconceived luxury car tax surcharge is a humiliating demonstration of Labor's incompetence, and I certainly share the views of the shadow industry minister, Senator Eric Abetz. The government should be embarrassed, and I know it is. The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax-Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 has to amend A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999, the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and, more importantly, the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act 2008 that was passed a few short months ago. The amending legislation needs to be passed to correct serious errors brought about because of Labor's rushed deal with the minor parties in the Senate. The question that needs to be asked, and the Australian people need to hear the answer to this, is: why are we again correcting rushed legislation by the government? They rushed the bank guarantee which caused dislocation in the market and 270,000 Australian accounts to be frozen. The Treasurer rushed into say that for anything over $1 million in the guarantee there would be a compulsory deposit tax, only to back down two days later. They rushed into their view on short selling, especially naked short selling-three views in three days that affected the stock market as they sought to amend it. They rushed into their view on the wholesale tax, saying they did not need legislation to cover their wholesale tax guarantee, and then they passed it yesterday. And now for at least the fifth time Labor rushed again andsurprise, surprise-they have stuffed it up. The bill before the House will ensure that it. the relevant legislation actually allows for the refunds-imagine that-and/or exemptions as promised by the Labor government: namely, for primary producers who purchase four-wheel drives, eligible tourism operators and those who ordered a luxury car before the budget. It includes minor amendments to the ill-considered luxury car tax surcharge. It also includes cobbled together amendments to their punitive 33 per cent increase in the luxury car tax. Less than half of Australia's farmers and tourism operators are currently eligible for the luxury car tax surcharge exemptions. Sixty per cent of the farmers and tourism operators Labor claimed would be eligible for a rebate on the tax increase are not eligible. Of all the things to get wrong! While Labor and, of course, Senator Fielding told farmers and tourism operators they would quarantine them from the luxury car tax increase, the fact is the law, as passed, categorically failed to do what Labor said it would do. According to Treasury officials at the recent Senate estimates, the first the government knew of the problem with its amendments was when it was brought to their attention by the car industry. Labor should have done the basics-and it is not as though Labor do not have an entire Public Service to assist them, as well as their wealth and variety of advisers. If they had just done the basics and consulted, heaven forbid, with the Australian Taxation Office about the workability of the amendments, this new bill would not be necessary. This is one of the first bits of legislation of their own. So much of the legislation that has come through this year has been piggybacking on the Howard years. It was legislation that was in abeyance after parliament was prorogued, and they then changed it and pushed it through. Here we have one of the first bits of legislation that was all done by their little selves-and what did they do in the sandpit? Dug the dozer into a hole and completely stuffed it up. Why? Because they rushed. If it is rushed there will be errors. I have already outlined so many areas where the Labor government have rushed things. And because they rushed the luxury car tax legislation, the anecdotal evidence from my electorate is that luxury car sales are collapsing by as much as 20 per cent. The MYEFO predictions will not be reached. What is worse is that these amendments will benefit 25 imported vehicles that compete against Australian vehicles. These 25 imported vehicles are exempt from a range of taxes that Australian vehicles are not exempt from. Australian manufacturers and Australian workers that this government has the hide, the audacity, the blatant effrontery to say it represents, have been sold out by the tax breaks being provided to 25 imported cars but not to Australian cars. The coalition said a number of times that trying to ‘improve' the bill by trying to exempt various parties was not workable. We have been proven correct. The only way to ensure fairness is either to drop the tax increase altogether or, alternatively, adopt the coalition's compromise position of setting the threshold for the 33 per cent tax increase at $90,000. I know Labor, and when I look across at the member for Blair, who will probably follow me in this debate, and the member for Oxley, who will notMr Ripoll-Yes.",154
212,Mr ROBERT,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"The member for Oxley will? I know the member for Oxley and I commend him for his work on the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, on the inquiry on short selling and on the inquiry in June into shareholder participation. But unfortunately I cannot commend you now because you will try to claim that somehow these errors are not your fault. I know you, Member for Blair and Member for Oxley: you will try to claim that someone else is to blame for this. Perhaps, could it be, the global financial crisis is to blame for your ineptitude in making these mistakes? You will claim that all you did was to vote for Senator Fielding's amendments. We voted against the amendments because we knew they were flawed, but you rushed the bill.",155
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,I remind the honourable member to address his remarks through the chair.,155
214,Mr ROBERT,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Labor Party rushed the bill, and when you rush a bill you wear the consequences. While the amendments may have been in Senator Fielding's name, they are the government's amendments. The opposition remains opposed to the luxury car tax surcharge. It is still bad policy. At a time of global uncertainty-indeed, at a time of global financial crisis-when other governments are ensuring that interest rates are lowered, taxation is lowered and government spending is increased, this bill is about increasing taxation. At a time when a greater fluidity of finance is needed in the system and at a time when a $10.5 billion stimulus package is being put into the community to encourage consumption-that is, spending-this is a bill that rips money out of pockets. We could be the only government on the planet that is increasing taxation and pulling money out of pockets when the rest of the world is stimulating economies through consumption. The coalition will carefully examine whether Labor's second attempt at these amendments is any more effective. The government is surely on notice on this.",155
215,Mr RIPOLL,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"It is a pleasure to be speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax-Minor Amendments) Bill 2008. It is good to be following the member for Fadden, as he made a number of comments about the role that the government have played in these bills, about what has happened in the Senate in terms of the opposition's opposition and their attempted blocking of the measures that we are putting in place, and about the nongovernment senators and their amendments-and because his comments just point very clearly to the opposition's view of themselves in this place. The opposition are not here to try and make some good outcomes out of certain policy areas; they are here just to obstruct. They are here to ensure that the government have difficulty, because of the numbers in the Senate, in passing their amendments. But the opposition will not have it all their way, because the reality is that in the Senate there are a number not only of Independents but of independent thinkers who actually see some benefit in the policies that we put forward-in particular in relation to the luxury car tax. I will get to a number of other points that were raised by opposition members. This bill makes a number of minor and technical amendments to the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999, the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act 2008 to ensure that amendments to the tax laws amendment act passed earlier this year operate as intended. That is the clear purpose of the bill that is before us today. These amendments will clarify the operation of the law to ensure that the amendments moved by non-government senators operate as intended. This bill is to deal with those changes and those amendments that came through the Senate. Unlike what we just heard from the previous speaker and from other speakers on the opposition side, this amendment bill is about making sure that the consequences and the purposes of this bill carry through the intended amendments of the Independent senators-in particular, Senator Fielding's amendment, which provides for a refund of the increase in the luxury car tax to primary producers and eligible tourism operators who purchase eligible four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles, and Senator Xenophon's amendment, which provides for vehicles purchased under a contract entered into before 7.30 pm on 13 May 2008 and delivered after 1 July 2008 to be subject to the 25 per cent luxury car tax rate. I can well see and understand the intentions of those two Independent senators in moving those amendments to this bill. Firstly, these amendments will ensure that the luxury car tax refunds are payable to eligible businesses where the businesses actually bear the cost of the luxury car tax regardless of the arrangements used to finance the vehicle. I think that is an important part of recognising that the way a vehicle is purchased may vary depending on the circumstances, the structure of the business, how a specific individual enters into a finance contract or how they purchase a vehicle. Therefore we need to recognise that through these amendments and make sure that that is taken into account and that the proper mechanisms are in place to deal with it. Secondly, these amendments ensure that contracts that were entered into before 7.30 pm on 13 May 2008 are the relevant contracts for determining the luxury car tax rate of 25 per cent, when subsequent financing arrangements are made. This is to ensure that, despite the passing of time, at a particufiscal lar point the 25 per cent luxury car tax still applies to those contracts. What often happens is that arrangements are made at a specific time but the financing arrangements may not be approved at the same time, and therefore you have to have some other period between when a contract may be signed and when the actual financing arrangements are carried through, made or agreed. Further, these amendments ensure that the luxury car tax refunds are paid directly to claimants. I think it is important, in the way that this scheme operates, that the claim goes directly to the claimants-those who are actually putting forward their money in the purchase of those vehicles-and that it does not go through some other system. Therefore what these amendments clarify is that farmers and tourism operators-those people are at the core of the principle behind this-will be able to receive refunds of the increase to the luxury car tax where they lease a vehicle and also bear the cost of the tax and the changes. These amendments also ensure that those who entered contracts to purchase a luxury car before 13 May 2008 are not precluded from paying the 25 per cent because they later decide to finance the car through hire purchase or leasing arrangements. Not only does this take into account the timing issue and make sure the right amount of luxury car tax is paid; it also caters for the different financing arrangements which are in place. So these are good amendments. They are minor amendments, which will make these changes operate as intended and ensure that the processes that are in place are functional and efficient. In the 2008-09 budget the government took a decision to increase the rate of luxury car tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent. That was part of the Rudd government's plans to make the tax system fairer and to contribute to a strong position. There would not be too many people either here or out in the community who ought to be arguing against this position, because, for the very large majority of people, a luxury car is something they will never be able to experience, given that we are in tough global times. I still hear-although I find it almost amusing-the deniers on the other side. Not only are they in denial about climate change; they are in denial about a global financial crisis. They seem to support that it exists when it suits their agenda but then deny that it exists when it comes to anything that the government must do in response to protect Australians and the Australian economy. There seems to be this bizarre concept on the other side that the global financial crisis only exists to suit their own purposes, rather than that it just exists. Somehow the global financial crisis is the fault of the government in Australia. It is a bizarre concept but we have just heard it again from members of the opposition-particularly the last speaker-who were saying that somehow we were to blame. I am more than prepared to stand up in this House and say that we are responsible for dealing with it, that we are responsible for all the actions we take and that we are responsible for what happens to the Australian economy, regardless of who created this mess, regardless that it is a global financial crisis. But surely none of the opposition members link the election of the Rudd Labor government late last year with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States. Surely the opposition does not somehow link the election of the Rudd Labor government late last year with what seems to be now approaching a recession in the United States, what is currently happening to financial systems in Indonesia and other parts of the world or the financial crisis that we are experiencing globally. Surely not! But, every time. I come into this place or listen to some of the debate in here, that seems to be the view put forward by the opposition. They are trying to say that it is not just that we are now responsible because we are in government and therefore we must deal with it; they are somehow trying to say that we are to blame for it happening. It is a bizarre concept but it certainly seems to be the view being put forward by a number of opposition members. We heard it only moments ago when the member for Fadden was speaking on this. I actually wrote his words down: we were to blame for the global financial crisis. I think they might have to have another look at what is actually taking place in the world. I do not believe that ordinary Australians are offended by a small increase in the luxury car tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent. Nor do I think they are offended by the fact that tourism or farmers would particularly be excluded from paying that extra and would be getting a refund for it. I think there is good cause to show that not only are the intent, purpose and drive behind what we are trying to achieve with this bill and this policy right but so are the exemptions. It is also notable that the opposition purport that this was something that was uniquely being driven by the Rudd Labor government, that somehow this is all of our doing. The reality is that a luxury car tax of sorts is not something new. Luxury car taxes have been in place for quite some time. In fact, under the Fraser government a type of luxury car tax was introduced-certainly a tax of vehicles over a certain price. So it is nothing new. It is not something that the opposition should be arguing against; it is an accepted and legitimate method of taxation for vehicles over a certain price range. It is also something they support. Even though they come into this House, say that they are against these measures and that they will vote against things in the Senate and carry on-as oppositions will do-they do not have a great policy objective. So, while there might be some argument and debate over some of the finer points and refinements of certain policies, the mere fact that there has been an increase from 25 per cent to 33 per cent in itself is not an excuse for the opposition to block these bills and use the excuse of certain categories of operators in Australia, after the amendments have been made to make sure farmers and tourism operators get a refund. I think it is just a little bit cheap and a little bit shallow of the opposition. It is reflected in the opposition's reactions to a whole range of other areas-like the way it reacted to bank deposit guarantees, short selling and all the critical and essential things that this government has had to do and has willingly done. This government has taken up its responsibility to make sure that these things took place in a very timely way. We have been saying in here that we have taken strong and decisive action, because that is exactly what it is: strong and decisive. In times of global crisis, you do not sit around twiddling your thumbs, looking around the room, hoping somebody else will come up with a policy and a direction. What you do is consult and lead. And that is exactly what we have done. We have done it in a whole range of areas. We have done it in the short-selling area. We have done it by guaranteeing peoples' bank deposits-both large and small. We have made arrangements to make sure that we restore not only domestic confidence in our banking and financial systems but also international global confidence that the corporate governance system of Australia is robust and sound. It will best place our national economy to deal with the very real issue of decreasing car sales. We heard again from members opposite and other members of a decrease in luxury car sales of potentially up to 20 per cent. While I have not checked that specific figure, it is probably close to the number. There has been a decrease in ordinary car sales in the magnitude of some 15 per centand that is probably growing. That is a worrying statistic. But on this side, we have not just worried about that statistic; we have tually done something about it. We have put together a massive fund and provided the Australian automotive industry with a strategic plan over the coming decade to ensure that it not only survives but grows stronger, finds new innovative ways to operate and remains competitive and efficient so that we keep the jobs and create more jobs in that particular sector. This bill, while it is about minor and techmade nical amendments, is part of a larger suite of bills which look at the whole automotive industry. I am quite proud to speak on this, I said earlier on. It is, while minor, a very important part of the range of policies that we are bringing to the table in the national interest. These amendments are required to provide clarity and certainty to car buyers, to finance companies and to car dealers. I strongly urge the opposition to support this. This bill will give the sort of clarity and certainty that is desperately needed in the marketplace. If they were true to what they say to people about them representing small business and how small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, they would do something real by backing this bill in this place here today. That is what they ought to do. I have spoken to auto manufacturers, car dealers and people who work at dealerships and, let me tell you, they are very frightened about their industry and their jobs. They are frightened about the future and what is happening in the world and the impact that is having. The numbers that we read out in this place about sales being down between-let us say-15 and 20 per cent are reflected in job losses. That potential reduction in jobs is something that we need to look at carefully. If those sales continue to decline, fewer salespeople will be required, fewer vehicle delivery people will be required and fewer ac- people will be required pre-delivery-fewer people will be required in that industry. This is causing enormous pressure and fear within that industry. We have been taking a number of actions to ensure that there is a future for the automotive industry in Australia, including allocating billions of dollars to it. We have looked at a green car scheme and other ways that we can co-invest with industry. We have sure that they are part of the strategy. We have also taken some action to assist finance companies, including automotive as finance companies, to return some stability to what have been long standing dealerships right across the country. Through no fault of their own, they have had the rug pulled out from under their feet. I have to say that right now I do not have too many good words to say about GE Finance, GE Money or GMAC in terms of the way that they have operated. While they did give some months of notice, when you consider the amounts of money that were invested in terms of floor plans for dealerships, it is a little bit too rich for companies to be pulling out of long standing relationships with auto dealers who have looked after them by giving them their business over many years-and in some cases decades. To just walk away from the auto dealers in Australia is wrong. Some of them will be able to refinance; some of them will be able to pick up and enter into new arrangements, but others will struggle because of the magnitude of finance that is required. People who are listening may not understand, but even a modest sized auto dealer may have a floor plan worth tens of millions of dollars. Some of them have enormous investments of sunk capital through their franchise arrangements into the physical structure that houses the cars, which is often required by prestige car dealerships. They have a lot of money tied up in that. They cannot simply pack up and go home. They need that finance to make sure that they have liquidity in their dealerships. That is certainly not part of this bill but it is part of the general suite of bills and policies that we are putting forward in terms of stabilising the Australian economy and ensuring that the automotive industry is stabilised. Through the luxury car tax, we will ensure that there is a proper tax regime for those people who can afford it. People ought to be able to buy luxury cars if they can afford them, but they should pay an appropriate amount of tax. That is the key here. I do not think that it is onerous to move from 25 to 33 per cent, particularly given that these minor amendments will provide for a rebate for those people who fall into either the category of ‘farmer' or ‘tourism operator'. Those arrangements are good policy. The government has also asked David Murray to explore options to help facilitate larger and more liquid institutions to provide liquidity support to various market link inthose vestment vehicles. APRA will also fast track applications for finance companies. We are doing a whole range of things in trying to make sure that not only the confidence of the auto dealers is restored but also the finance companies that will deal with them have some certainty about their futures. All in all, I commend this bill to the House. It makes some minor amendments that the Senate has put forward. Thank you. (Time expired)",156
216,Mr TRUSS,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax-Minor Amendments) Bill 2008 seeks to correct serious deficiencies brought about by Labor's rushed deal with the minor parties in the Senate to introduce a luxury car tax. This bill corrects some flaws in a tax which is fatally flawed. It is an example of incredible bungling. I am amazed that government members are even prepared to come into the House to try and defend what is completely indefensible. The legislation was designed to put a luxury tax on vehicles. Deals were done with the Greens and the Independents. The rules to implement those concessions were in fact bungled and a lot of unintended consequences arose. These changes improve the situation, but the reality is that they do not fix it. The tax is still fundamentally flawed. The government should take it back and redraw it so that the people who are entitled to concessions in fact get them. There are all sorts of anomalies in the tax as it stands that will remain even after this legislation is passed. The opposition will not be opposing this legislation because it makes some improvements. But it should be seen as the first step to a comprehensive reform of the legislation that was announced on budget night and then implemented in a bungled way. Debate interrupted. NA",160
217,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mayo Electorate: Water",161
218,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening in this adjournment debate to discuss an issue which is the biggest issue in my electorate and probably the biggest issue in South Australia, and that is the current water crisis and the effect it is having on the communities along the Lower Lakes and in Goolwa in my electorate. Many people in the eastern states understand that the water crisis is a major challenge for our country but have little understanding of the actual impact it is having on people particularly in Goolwa, along the Lower Lakes and in the member for Barker's electorate on the other side. It is destroying businesses; it is destroying lives; it is destroying hope. You only need to travel down the Lower Lakes to see the utter destruction of people's lives and businesses because of the lack of water flowing down the river. South Australia, of course, has always been at the bottom end of the system. We have always been the place which has highlighted the crisis the most because, of course, we are at the bottom end of the drain, so to speak. We focus very much in this place, as we should, on the environmental aspect of this crisis, but we often forget the people who are involved and affected. These are people who rely very much on the lakes to go about their business. In Goolwa the major industry is boating and recreational tourism, and without water there is a lack of interest in visiting the area. So there is a real problem along the Lower Lakes, which, of course, also affects irrigators, fishermen and the like. I think it is our obligation, and I wish to use my time this evening, to urge the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Water to consider assisting these people, who are losing 95 per cent of their businesses and seeing the great lakes dying in front of them. I genuinely ask the Prime Minister and minister this evening to consider what the opposition has put forward before, which is a financial assistance package to help these people get through a crisis which is engulfing them. It is a sad time in this area. We all know that a long-term fix needs to be put in place. We all acknowledge that the system is overallocated. The Leader of the Opposition and the former Prime Minister, John Howard, outlined a $10 billion water plan in January 2007. I acknowledge that the current government is largely implementing that plan, with some changes, but they are long-term investments in fixing the system. What I am talking about this evening is providing some short-term assistance to help these people get through while we implement the plans to fix the system in the long term. But I must say, as an aside to that-and I do not seek to make too many political points in this because it is a genuine issue of helping these people-that the first thing the government should do is scrap the stupid pipeline from the Goulburn Valley to Melbourne. It is one of the most ridiculous decisions that this parliament has ever accepted or that the Australian government has ever been part of to allow nearly 100 gigalitres to be taken out of a system, which is completely overallocated today, in the future-it would be a disgrace. I urge the government to rethink this decision. I urge the government to stop the Victorian government from taking this water out. That 100 gigalitres in the Lower Lakes makes a substantial difference. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission said recently before a Senate committee that all the Lower Lakes need to get through the next 12 months is an extra 30 to 60 gigalitres. To allow an additional 100 gigalitres out of the system through this pipeline would be an utter disgrace. It is a political deal should be fixed-and it should be fixed today. I say very genuinely that these people on the Lower Lakes and in Goolwa are suffering under this crisis. I ask the Prime Minister and minister to consider some financial assistance to help them through what is a major environmental crisis-there is no denying it. Until the drought breaks there will not be a long-term solution-there is no question about that. I urge the government to continue with important water reform, but I urge the government to scrap the stupid pipeline and, most importantly, to implement some shortterm assistance and real action for these people to help them get through. It is a genuine crisis; there is a genuine need down there to help these small businesses. (Time expired) Port Adelaide Electorate: New Arrivals Program",161
219,Mr BUTLER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week, I had the privilege of visiting three schools in my electorate that are all doing a great job educating young South Australians: Pennington Junior Primary School, Pennington Primary School and the Adelaide Secondary School of English. Apart from being generally great schools, the notable thing about these three is their important work with the New Arrivals Program, or NAP. NAP is particularly important in my electorate, which is a common place of settlement for new arrivals to Australia. The New Arrivals Program provides students with intensive English lessons as well as integration assistance and support for transition into mainstream schools. Humanitarian entrants attract double funding from the Commonwealth in recognition of the fact that they have often experienced limited, interrupted or simply no schooling before arriving in Australia. These students are also often suffering the effects of trauma and perthat secution and require extra support to adjust to formalised schooling. Pennington Junior Primary School was South Australia's first United Nations ‘peace school', meaning that it fulfilled the UN's requirements to support learning about children's rights with a particular focus on the right to feel safe from violence, on conflict resolution and on a review of school policies to promote a more peaceful community. Touring the different classes, I saw that the students and teachers at Pennington genuinely practise those values. More than 50 per cent of students at Pennington come from non-English speaking backgrounds, with a significant number arriving in Australia through the humanitarian program, particularly from Africa. Over 24 different languages are represented in Pennington's NAP, meaning that all staff have specific ESL training. Classes are restricted to 10 to 13 students. Bilingual school services officers provide important support to teachers in their work. Importantly, students in the NAP spend part of each week mixing with English speaking kids in other classes. When kids graduate from the NAP-usually after 12 or 24 months-they move to mainstream classes at Pennington or to a school nearer their home. The Pennington Primary School works closely with its junior primary partner a few streets away. It too has a NAP that caters for children arriving in Australia at middle and upper primary ages. I was given a wonderful tour of the school by three grade 7 students in their last few weeks of primary school; Erin Davis, Hai Oan and Ben Russell. I wish them all the best for their high school studies. These are both proud schools doing immensely important work. In a growing part of Port Adelaide, they have an exciting future ahead of them. I also had the privilege last week to visit the Adelaide Secondary School of English, the only government school in SA that caters for newly arrived ESL students of high school age. They have been doing this important work for 25 years with a diverse and continually changing student body, working together across a range of cultural, religious, educational and socio-economic backgrounds. Many students have little or no schooling history, posing unique challenges to these high school teachers, such as teaching students at that age how to hold a pen and basic literacy and numeracy, while acclimatising them to Australian customs and the English language. Given some of the traumas experienced by these students, these schools provide ready access to student counsellors and, if more specialised support is required, to groups like Survivors of Torture and Trauma Assistance and Rehabilitation ServicesSTTARS. One of the most fulfilling parts of being member of parliament is visiting the different schools in our electorates. All of them are filled with inspirational young people in the most exciting period of their lives, being taught by some of the most dedicated people in our community. The schools I visited last week are that and more. They also help young people who have been brought to Australia by their families-often from war-torn, impoverished countries-to learn English, to adjust to our school system, and, most importantly, to begin to feel a comfortable and valued part of our community. I pay tribute to the principals: Pina Fitzharris at Pennington JPS; Catherine Cox-Wallis at Pennington Primary; and Maria Iadanza at the Adelaide Secondary School of English as leaders of their school but also as representatives of the students, teachers and parents who make their schools such a beacon. Parkes Electorate: Wheat Growers",162
220,Mr COULTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Parkes) (7.39 pm)Tonight I rise to speak about a disaster that is unfolding in my electorate. I refer to the crisis that the wheat farmers in Australia and particularly in my electorate are facing at the moment. While this crisis is reaching a peak now, it started some years ago when the current Prime Minister was the shadow minister for foreign affairs. When he saw the AWB scandal in Iraq as a vehicle for him to lift his public profile and finally become Leader of the Opposition and use that as a vehicle to go to the last election, the fate of my wheat farmers was virtually sealed. It reached a peak in June of this year when the single desk was abolished by this House. It was a time of great frustration for me as someone who came to this place to represent the people of my electorate. I had the feeling of being impotent at that particular time. It was particularly galling to me that the minister for agriculture, the minister who supposedly represents the industry, used that para ticular time to make political points. The fact that he claimed that he had spoken to wheat farmers and mentioned to me the wheat farmer from Broken Hill who he had spoken to clearly shows his lack of knowledge and understanding. Despite the ridicule that my National Party colleagues and I encountered at that particular time about our lack of understanding of the brave new world of wheat marketing and how much better off farmers were going to be, our predictions, unfortunately, have proven to be remarkably correct. At the start of harvest, due to the ability of farmers in my electorate we were looking at a remarkable crop. Some farmers are part way through harvest, some are further through than others and some have not started. Despite the fact that a multitude of sellers been registered as exporters, none have been able to raise finance, transport grain or buy any of the grain. So as I speak, there are large temporary storages scattered right across the north-west. If that was not bad enough, in the last two weeks further disaster has struck. There has been 200 millimetres of rain in my area since the start of harvest. Coupled with the fact that many of the contract harvesters have gone broke in the last seven years because there has been no crop and they have lost their headers, many of the farmers have had the frustration of not being able to find equipment to harvest their crop. As I speak, there are a range of storms going through my electorate and the forecast is that they are going to reach a climax on Friday when 40 millimetres of rain is expected. There are a million and a half tonnes of wheat in my electorate alone still in the paddocks. In the last three days the value of that wheat has dropped $100 a tonne-$150 million has been taken out of a part of my electorate, the part of my electorate that can least afford I believe that this parliament owes those farmers. We are going to have to come to their aid. We let them down when they needed us most and now they need the assistance of this parliament. After seven years of drought, to be within the grasp of obtaining a crop of wheat and then watch it being wash away is devastating. Not only is the downgrade of the grain a problem; this ongoing rain means that machinery cannot get onto the ground. Crops are rotting, particularly on the black soil plains west of the Newell Highway, because you cannot get machinery onto the ground. At the moment no-one has the money to buy the wheat. Credit is very much restricted to the grain merchants. In previous times the Australian Wheat Board would have run a have pool and sold the wheat. They would have made an upfront payment to farmers and sold the wheat into the market over a period of time. We no longer have that ability. I think it is an absolute disaster, an absolute disgrace that the Australian parliament-and I feel a responsibility as a member of it-have let down this group of people, and I think that we need to seriously look at a way of coming to their assistance. Franklin Electorate",163
221,Ms COLLINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to update the House on a number of infrastructure measures and projects across the electorate that I represent: the seat of Franklin. The Rudd government has been rock solid, as we know, in its commitment to ensure Australia progresses with many of the measures announced in our first 12 months having a strong focus around nation building. I would like to start by talking about the community infrastructure package that will support local projects and local people. A hive of infrastructure activity is set to begin across my electorate over the next 12 to 24 it. months, as it is in many others across the nation, thanks to an injection of much needed funds into local economies. Last week the Rudd government offered Tasmanian councils $8.25 million. It is a boost to the local economy and it is of benefit to the people of Tasmania. Of course I am talking about the $300 million community infrastructure stimulus package: the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, announced by Anthony Albanese and Prime Minister Rudd last week. This program is designed to help local communities weather the global financial crisis. Local councils across the seat of Franklin will have an opportunity to build local projects. The allocation on offer to local councils in my electorate of Franklin is $1.7 million. There will be a flurry of building and construction over the next 12 months as halls, community centres and parks are built, refurbished or upgraded. Supporting projects that stimulate the local economy is a common-sense measure. It is a measure that will support local jobs. It will provide practical community infrastructure for the long term. There is also money set aside-$50 million nationallyfor projects seeking $2 million or more. I know that local councils across southern Tasmania have, over the past few days, started to collate and develop projects that are significant upgrades or new constructions to improve local community facilities. In fact, I and other local members in Tasmania have written to councils to encourage them to start getting those projects together. The Rudd government has also invested in local councils with its financial assistance grants program in 2008-09, with $61 million being the highest level of funding ever provided to local councils in Tasmania. This will be used to build local roads, maintain parks and ensure the continuation of vital local services. The councils in my electorate have been allocated $8.5 million in 2008-09. That is a significant increase on funding before. is also worth mentioning that this funding is on top of the money that the Rudd government has made available to councils this year from the Roads to Recovery program. The Roads to Recovery program to date has delivered much needed funding-worth $1.5 million-to councils in my electorate so that urgent safety repairs and upgrades to local roads can occur. On a larger scale we will start to see the bigger infrastructure projects that were Labor election commitments like the Kingston bypass. The planning work and concept plans for the bypass have now been finalised. The Kingston bypass is going ahead. It is expected that a public display of the project will be available to local residents to view prior to Christmas. The bypass will provide improved traffic flows while at the same time improve the safety of motorists. Construction will commence next year and the completion date is scheduled for June 2012. Improving roads for Tasmanian motorists is a priority for the Rudd government. Equally, it is a priority for me to ensure my constituents have access to modern and safe transport infrastructure. The Kingborough municipality is one of the fastest growing areas in Tasmania, and I am acutely aware of how important the Kingston bypass will be to motorists of Kingston, Blackman's Bay and the Channel area. As the federal member for Franklin, I have listened closely to my constituents. They have waited not months but years for this project and, after almost 12 years of inaction by the former Liberal government, I am proud to report that this project is moving forward and it will become a reality. It is an election commitment that we, the Rudd government, will deliver on. Another infrastructure project in southern Tasmania is the upgrade of the Bridgewater Bridge. Money was allocated in this year's budget. Investigations and designs for the It refurbishment have already commenced. We know that, while those opposite were in government, around 90 per cent of road funding under AusLink was allocated to the north of Tasmania. For a long time the southern roads in Tasmania were ignored, but no longer. Projects like the Kingston bypass, the Bridgewater Bridge and others in neighbouring electorates such as the Brighton transport hub are about addressing real need in southern Tasmania. They are about improving the productive capacity in our economy. The funding under Labor is a strategic investment; it is not the pork barrelling undertaken by those opposite. So, as you can see, Deputy Speaker Burke, there is a lot happening across the seat of Franklin, but, more importantly, over the next few years we will see a steady increase in the number of infrastructure projects that will boost the local economy. Despite the global financial crisis, there are many positive measures happening on both a local and a national level. I look forward to seeing first hand the positive results in Franklin thanks to the Rudd government's funding measures. Western Australia",164
222,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"On a day of the last election campaign, I recall that I was walking along a street in Girrawheen and noticed a flyer from the Labor Party blowing along the street. It talked about how Labor would give WA its fair share of federal funding. It played to the ings of many people in Western Australia, saying that Canberra takes a great deal of the royalties from Western Australia and never gives a fair share back. This flyer was therefore just about politics, painting the false picture that WA had been ripped off by John Howard. The Labor Party won the election and, after one year, it is appropriate for me reflect on the new government's stated commitment to WA, to check on the progress of ‘a fair deal for Western Australia'. Fortunately, I have provided the House with a rundown of all the election promises made with regard to Cowan in the past, and I have written to the Treasurer as well to remind him of those commitments, with no reply. But it is important to again remind the House of what was committed and what has been achieved. There was the $10 million commitment for an overpass at the Reid Highway and the Alexander Drive Overpass-a red light on that. There was $5 million to be delivered to each of the cities of Wanneroo and Swan for different sections of the major road, Hepburn Avenue-another red light. Two million dollars was to be given to the Woodvale Senior High Schoolwe are waiting for that. There was the Wanneroo GP superclinic-we are still stuck in the waiting room on that one. Those are just some of the projects that were mentioned but for which we are yet to see commencement, let alone delivery. I therefore struggle to see practical results or outcomes of this alleged new commitment to WA, represented merely by that Labor Party flyer I found in Girrawheen. Whereas there has been a clear and ever present lack of action with Rudd government outlays in Cowan, this is in stark contrast to past years when the Howard government looked after the then Labor opposition held electorate of feelCowan, including the Investing in Our Schools outlays extensively throughout the electorate. The Ocean Reef Road extension is well underway after a $7 million contribution around two years ago. The Ballajura War Memorial and Peace Park received collective outlays of $155,000 from the former government-money, action and, above all, to real results. That is in stark contrast to the great action and effectiveness of the coalition government when it is compared to what has happened in the last 12 months. It is therefore hard to reconcile rhetoric with reality, and I cannot see evidence of any greater commitment to Western Australia by the Rudd government. In fact, I see that there has been far less action and far less commitment to the great state of Western Australia. I will, however, now provide a contrast between electorates across Australia to show that the Rudd government is committed first and foremost to the eastern states. I emphasised before what was offered in Cowan by Labor in 2007 and still not delivered. Now I will refer to government members' speeches that show where all the money is being spent and therefore the complete Rudd government preference for any state but Western Australia. Last night the member for Robertson in New South Wales spoke of the following projects which she described as truly nation building, including $7 million for a car parking station; $81 million for a pipeline, $900,000 for a sports precinct, $840 million to provide a freight rail line CCTV security cameras. So there is a fair bit going into Robertson. She also mentioned that the local government has received ongoing federal funding worth $17.8 million in the past year alone. Some may say that the member for Robertson may be getting more than her fair share of handouts, to help address a bit of a profile issue. In South Australia, to help out the Labor member for Kingston, there was $3 million for a transport sustainability study. In Braddon in Tasmania, $1 million was distributed among local sporting clubs. Up in Queensland $2.6 million went to Barcaldine for a monument to a tree. In Victoria the electorate of Ballarat got a $90 million commitment for a pipeline and $1.5 million for an aquatic centre. The list goes on, and that was only after about 15 minutes of searching through Hansard. What I want to say is that, as worthy and meaningful as each of those projects may be to people in those electorates, it nevertheless demonstrates that the Rudd government's priorities remain on the eastern states, where their big spending is boundless, but it does demonstrate that the Rudd government is not committed to Western Australia apart from the politics. As we approach the next election, how many of Labor's last election promises will be dusted off so that my next opponent can be wheeled into the camera shot? The final point I would make is that the Labor election promises in Cowan suffered from a lack of originality last time, essentially following on from our own. In recent weeks I have presented the government with a range of other infrastructure and community strengthening initiatives, and I look forward to Labor in Western Australia trying to pass them off as original concepts at the next election! I question the Rudd government's commitment to Western Australia, as I have proven that there is only evidence supporting their interest and commitment to and $680,000 for the eastern states. Overseas Aid",166
223,Ms JACKSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hasluck) (7.54 pm)Each year 34,000 mothers and over 400,000 children under the age of five years will die in our immediate region. These figures increase to 200,000 mothers and 3.2 million children if we include all of South Asia. The mothers die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth; the children from largely preventable causes. Australia's aid in the region has made a significant contribution to the health outcomes in many countries and this will increase with the improved AusAID health policies and initiatives of the Rudd government. The government has pledged to increase overseas development assistance from 0.3 to 0.5 percent of the gross national income by 2015. This funding will in part support our neighbours, through the Pacific partnerships, to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The 2008-09 budget allocated an increase of eight percent expenditure on health issues influencing millennium development goal outcomes. As a member of ASEAN this financial year Australia is committed to nearly $1 billion in bilateral and regional development for the East Asia region. All countries need to have an effective health system at the community and district levels to ensure a continuum of care for women and children before, during and after pregnancy; access to information and services to prevent and treat infectious diseases such as AIDS and TB; and of course the best treatment of common health needs as they arise. Australia recently joined the International Health Partnership, which aims to increase the coordination and level of support in the health aid arena as well as increase mutual accountability between developing countries and donors. The International Health Partnership will assist developing countries to develop and implement effective health plans to provide essential services to all. Our budget allocated $8 million to address inadequate access to clean water and sanitation in many developing countries, a critical factor in the health and well-being of the population. An improvement in the management of water resources and sanitation will lead to better health outcomes, especially for the poor, the majority of whom are women and children, because of the reduced risks of infection and transmission of disease. Priority must be given to services for adolescent girls, pregnant women and young children. Around the world almost 10 million children under the age of five die each year, two million of these in the first day of their life further two million in the first month of life. About 500,000 women die in childbirth. Girls under 15 are five times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than a woman in her 20s. In June 2008 the Prime Minister announced a program to improve maternal and child health in eastern Indonesia. This program, worth $49 million, will make childbirth safer by increasing access to trained midwives, improving management of maternal and child health services and providing better community support for expectant and new mothers. Better education of communities about public health and better community support can result in significant health improvements for everyone. In 2008-09 Australia also increased its assistance to the most vulnerable in society, those who are disabled, often through causes that are avoidable. This development assistance program will pilot various approaches to better eye and vision care, including the number of qualified eye care specialists, and reduce the impact of treatable blindness. Despite some gains we are still going backwards in our struggle against HIVAIDS. Although new infections have dropped and the number of people in treatment has doubled, two million people have died of AIDS and its complications. More needs to be done so that people at high risk of infection are receiving prevention information and advice. Australia is working in a collaborative project with Thailand on HIV and nutrition. This takes the form of nutritional advice to HIV patients and the tracking of the progress they then make. Improved nutritional intake has the potential to extend the period prior to the patient needing to access more expensive drugs. It is believed this has the potential to save millions and a on the Thai health budget. A 2008 UK report called Achieving universal access cites Thailand's experience that ‘every $1 spent on HIV prevention generated $43 of savings a decade later by avoiding the need for expensive AIDS treatment services'. Australia ‘s $200 million to strengthen the key United Nations development agencies will go some way to assisting in their important work. I would like to place on record my congratulations to the Rudd government, to the minister and to his parliamentary secretaries for their increased commitment to improving our overseas aid contribution.",167
