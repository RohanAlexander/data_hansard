1,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. In the Daily Telegraph of 1 September last, in an article by Kerry-Anne Walsh headed 'Angry Labor MPs join push against Hurford', the following extract appeared: The backbenchers are enraged at Mr Hurford's offer in the letter to talk about 'moves afoot to discipline few Labor backbenchers who caused a fuss on uranium sales to France'. The letter was sent a day after three left-wingers stormed out of Parliament over the Government's decision to resume uranium sales to France. South Australian John Scott and Victorians Peter Milton and Lewis Kent made headlines by briefly interrupting Treasurer Paul Keating's Budget speech by their walk-out. Labor Party sources said that if Mr Hurford's statement referred to the actions of the rebel backbenchers he was breaching Parliamentary privilege. Again on the same date, in the Australian, there was a similar reference to the same matter. The matter would seem to raise a question of parliamentary privilege and within our Standing Orders there is certainly a commitment that no action should be taken by any member which in any way would impede him in the execution of his duties. In the letter of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Hurford) dated 20 August 1986 to Mr Jeremy Cordeaux, the following words appeared: "". . . or if it were today in addition to Budget matters we could talk about moves afoot to discipline those few Labor backbenchers who caused a fuss on uranium sales to France. There were also comments by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) to the effect: Unfortunately, there are some people in this game who would sell out their grandmother's Christmas dinner for personal gain. Therefore, I think it would be pretty low if a Minister used on a radio station inside information of moves afoot without consulting his colleagues face to face. I ask you, Madam Speaker: Has that matter been referred to you? If not, I raise it as a matter of privilege without arguing the precedents within it, and ask for your ruling as to whether the matter should be dealt with now as a prima facie breach of privilege and then considered in further detail by the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges.",99
2,Madam SPEAKER,Unknown,"As is normal in these cases, I will take the matter on board and report PRIVILEGE back to the House. NA NA",99
3,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Since the last meeting of the House I have had the opportunity to make an appraisement of the apology offered by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) to me on that occasion. At that those time. I had not read the transcript of his Press conference. However, I have now made a comparison of what the right honourable member said on 21 August and his explanation to the House on 22 August. At his Press conference he is recorded as saying: Whatever the evidence, it certainly is not evidence that should be put in the hands of the Speaker who we saw this afternoon is inclined on occasions to rather hasty action. Later on he is recorded as saying: And certainly if, as one would hope, Mr Justice Murphy recovers from his illness, then it certainly is a matter that you can't just leave buried in the custody of the Speaker and the President. As I've said today, I rather doubt, in the circumstances of the Speaker's behaviour, that she necessarily is a person into whose custody I'd want documents of this kind left. The Leader of the National Party, in his explanation to the House, stated: Madam Speaker, the remarks were not meant to be about you but about Parliament, about the occasional misbehaviour of miscreants such as myself and the fact that I did not believe that Parliament was a suitable repository for documents containing allegations that are unresolved by legal commissioners. I therefore withdraw those remarks and apologise, for they were in no way directed against you or the office you hold. In accepting that apology, I assumed, as I am sure other honourable members did, that the right honourable member had been inaccurately reported. However, having compared the statements, I can only conclude that the right hon. ourable member has misled the House. I advise that, in my opinion, the transcript of his Press conference contains serious personal reflections on the Chair, which constitute a breach of the privileges of this House, and his subsequent apology constitutes a contempt of the House.",99
4,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA," I raise several matters in relation to this item, which you had the courtesy to advise me about-Mr MOUNTFORDYou lied.",99
5,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,Order!,100
6,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Madam Speaker, are you going to have that remark by the Treasurer withdrawn?",100
7,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,Did the Treasurer make a comment that 1 did not hear?,100
8,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,I said nothing. It must have been another member.,100
9,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Well, it was another one.",100
10,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,The honourable member will withdraw.,100
11,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,Is he going to withdraw it?,100
12,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Be quiet for a moment. The honourable member will withdraw. Mr MOUNTFORDI withdraw, although I think it was-",100
13,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,The honourable member will withdraw unreservedly. Mr MOUNTFORDI withdraw.,100
14,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Madam Speaker, with respect to the matter you have now raised, I thank you for the courtesy of forwarding to me today the transcript of the apology which was made by me to the House on 22 August. I raise first of all the question that there have been no new matters intervening since the time when I gave my apology and the time when you accepted that apology in the House. The matters which were canvassed were matters which were contained entirely within transcripts that were then available which followed a Press briefing that 1 gave on 21 August 1986. They were available at the time you called on me to make the apology in this place. As a result, the matter should have been raised at the time that it first appeared, that is, at the time you requested me in the first instance to apologise. 1 suggest to you that standing order 96 applies as much to the Presiding Officers as it does to any other member of this House. On the second account, 1 take it as a grave offence that you have suggested that in any way, in apologising, 1I have not completely withdrawn those remarks. How could 1I have withdrawn those remarks unless 1 had made them? The point of my apology was that I had admitted having made those remarks. I could hardly have withdrawn them if they had not been made by me. That was the whole point of my coming into this place and apologising to you and withdrawing the remarks. I suggest to you that there is no possible way in which 1 could have misled the House, because 1 would not have withdrawn the remarks if they had not been made. That seems to me to be fairly symptomatic of the whole basis of the apology. The third item that I canvass with you, Madam Speaker, is that when I explained the circumstances to the House 1 was attempting to say to you and to the House that I think it is important that if there are documents of a quasi-political character-I suggest to you that matters pertaining to the Murphy inquiry are becoming more and more of that character-it is essential that those documents not be retained in a forum in which politics is very much the barb of the  are very much within the political forum. The point 1 was seeking to make was that the remarks pertaining to a legal inquiry should not properly be contained within the custody of an officer or a chamber where politics, rather than the law, is the subject of everyday concern. Madam Speaker, as 1 explained to the House on 22 August, 1 believe that my fairly brief, but nonetheless totally accurate, comment was very pertinent to that point. 1 again quote: . . . I did not believe that Parliament was a suitable repository for documents containing allegations that are unresolved by legal commissioners. Madam Speaker, I repeat that those remarks sought to draw attention to the fact that the whole question of the outstanding matters affecting Mr Justice Murphy is very much under consideration by three legal commissioners. That commission remains intact at this time. The Senate has not yet dealt with the allegations. They are legal matters, not political matters. Madam Speaker, if you are suggesting that in what 1 said I was seeking other than to make reference to the fact that this is a political chamber, not a legal chamber, you are drawing an inference that is not justified by any of the content of my additional remarks. Madam Speaker, I believe that on those three grounds there is no basis for your assertion that I have misled the House. Apart from that, 1 also draw your attention to the fact that the matter was resolved by the decision that you gave on 22 August-that is, by your conclusion in reply to my remarks, in which you said: 'I thank the right honourable gentleman'. Madam Speaker, the matter should have been raised. The items were entirely available to you, your officers and everybody else; they were printed in the Press. If you felt that my apology was insufficient the matter should have been raised on that occasion. Secondly, 1 believe that you have drawn an inference-an innuendothat it is not for you to draw. The remarks, which I made intentionally, related to the fact that I do not believe that a political forum is a place where legal documents should properly be held. It is for that reason that I intended, when I spoke to the House on 22 August, to draw the comparison, and for that reason I withdrew my remarks. Thirdly, Madam Speaker, I believe that when I have withdrawn those remarks it is quite improper for you to say that in some way I was asserting that I had not made them. I could not have made that assertion if I had not made the remarks. It was because I believed them to be a reasonably accurate-I cannot testify to their exact accuracy-cover of the remarks I made that I withdrew them and apologised to you, which I again do. Madam Speaker, I do not believe that there is any basis whatsoever for your assertion that I have misled the House. I could not have withdrawn the remarks unless I had made them. I asserted on that day that I was withdrawing them and I assert again that having made remarks of that character I do not believe that this place, you as the Presiding Officer or Mr President in a political forum are appropriately the custodians of documents which I believe should be more of a legal than a political character. On that basis I contend that I have not misled the House. I put to you that the suggestion that I have done so is not in accordance with the fact. I suggest that even if it were the matter should have been raised on 22 August when it was first considered, for there is no new intervening material. On that basis I do not believe it proper that the matter has been raised again today.",100
15,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"I point out to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) that when the matter was raised in the House I accepted what he said and his apology, not having read the transcript or listened to the tapes. The new evidence comes as a result of listening to the tapes. The two comments made at the Press conference, he will see, have absolutely nothing to do with a political forum or the Parliament being a correct repository for papers that come from the legal commission. They are a direct attack on the Speaker of this House.",101
16,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Madam Speaker, as your Deputy, I would like to make some remarks on the explanation given by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair): I think that his explanation to your remarks was somewhat lacking. I do not think this matter should be taken lightly by the House, because any attack upon the Speaker should be construed by all honourable members as an attack upon the House itself. Having heard what the right honourable member has said, I think it is appropriate that the House should carry a motion which makes that point very clear. I move: That this House(1) is of the opinion that(a) the comments made by the Leader of the National Party during a press conference on Thursday 21 August and correctly reported in the Canberra Times the following day were highly critical of Madam Speaker and(i) constitute a breach of the privileges of this House, and (ii) were deliberately calculated to attack the Speaker's right to discipline Members by calling into question her personal character and, (b) the Leader of the National Party's statement to the House on Friday 22 August, being clearly at odds with his original comments, misled the House, and thus constitutes a contempt of the House, and (2) condemns the Leader of the National Party for his personal reflections upon the character and integrity of the Speaker of the House and her capacity as Speaker to perform her duties.  of order. It would appear to me that the honourable member is reading from a typed, and therefore prepared, statement. Would you advise the House, Madam Speaker, who, in addition to the honourable member for Grayndler, and perhaps the Leader of the National Party, was informed by you that this matter would be raised, and in so advising would you advise us why the honourable member for Grayndler was so informed?",101
17,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"There is no point of order. Mr Donald CameronYou are crooked, too.",101
18,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Order! I point out to the honourable member for Kooyong that the honourable member for Grayndler has the floor. He is entitled to make his own statements to the House. Mr O'Keefe-Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I demand that the honourable member opposite withdraw his reflection upon you. He called you a crook.",101
19,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"The honourable memin relation ber will withdraw. Mr Donald Cameron-Madam Speaker, I withdraw.",101
20,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Madam Speaker, it is obvious from the comments made by the Leader of the National Party that there is a considerable discrepancy between what was reported in the Canberra Times, what he said at his Press conference and what he said in the House later as a personal explanation in relation to what you said to him. It is obvious today from what the right honourable gentleman has said that there is a considerable discrepancy between what he said at his Press conference and what he said to the House. It is absurd for anyone to suggest that the right honourable member, in making that reflection upon you, Madam Speaker, was really talking about Parliament as a forum and that you and the President were not really included in it. When one looks at his remarks-I made a point of taking them down-one finds that the honourable gentleman said that he did not think that evidence should be put in the hands of the Speaker 'who we saw this afternoon'-that is the afternoon he made those remarks- 'is inclined on occasions to rather hasty action'. He went on to say at the Press conference that he rather doubted, in the circumstances of the Speaker's behaviour, that she necessarily was a person into whose custody he would wish to place documents of this kind. That is not a reflection upon the Parliament; that is a personal reflection upon you, Madam Speaker, as the Presiding Officer of this House. As such, it should be recognised by all honourable members that, if we are to accept that the Chair in this place is to have some dignity and that the Chair is the honest arbiter of disputes in the chamber, the right honourable gentleman should have had the strength of his convictions and stood up on 22 August and said that he made those remarksmaybe he made them in the heat of the moment; maybe he was misreported-and that he unreservedly withdrew them. But for him to get up and to put before this House the sham argument that he was not really talking about you or reflecting upon you, Madam Speaker, but was reflecting upon some institution is an absurdity. The House should recognise that and should condemn the right honourable member for it. I think that one should always judge people upon their standards and the standards that they ask of others. Even some honourable members on my right seem to agree with that. It is probably worthwhile looking at what the right honourable member for New England, the Leader of the National Party, has said about the standards of reflections upon Presiding Officers in this Parliament. Earlier this year, when he was trying to have a slice at the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as recorded on page 1038 of the Hansard, he said to you: Madam Speaker, in accordance with standing order 97, in a moment I shall table that document. But I wish to draw your attention to the procedures and practices of this place with respect to attitude to yourself. to members of this House and to chairmen of committees. Of course, within the Standing Orders and according to Pettifer's House of Represenlatives Practice, you will know that a reflection on the character or actions of the Speaker, inside or outside the House, may be punished as a breach of privilege. You will know that, indeed, there have been many occasions when such matters have been canvassed before the House. He went on to say that these sorts of things are things that the House should take a very dim view of. They are not my words; they are the words of the Leader of the National Party. In March of this year he said that he thought that any reflection upon the Speaker or one of the Presiding Officers should be something taken very seriously by this House. That was only a few months ago. But he came in here on the 22nd of last month and he came in here today and said that of course it was just a simple little thing and that he did not really mean it. To suggest that it is a matter of little consequence which does not require a full and open withdrawal when one says that the Speaker cannot be trusted to be a repository for documents placed before this Parliament is a scandal. The right honourable member for New England should do what a previous Speaker of this House, Archie Cameron, did when he was put in the same position of casting some aspersions on one of the Presiding Officers. Cameron at least had the strength of his convictions and stood up here, said that what he had done was wrong and apologised. In fact, Cameron even went further in his remarks and said that he felt that he had broken with a long tradition of never withdrawing and that he would withdraw at any time he was called upon in the House to do so. I think that the right honourable member for New England should have the strength of that conviction. After today's debate he should look at what Cameron said. The right honourable gentleman has been in this House for many years-probably longer than the rest of us. He is a Privy Councillor. He is a man who raises matters of privilege in this House frequently. I can recall him raising at least one or two this year and in the time. I have been in the Parliament I can recall at least seven or eight occasions on which he has raised matters of privilege. He ought to know what privilege is about and he ought to know that one cannot get away with doing what he did last week-going outside this chamber, making a disgraceful attack upon the Speaker and then coming in here and saying that the remarks were not meant to be about you, Madam Speaker, but about the Parliament. The remarks at that Press conference were about the Speaker. The remarks at that Press conference were a reflection on this Parliament. The right honourable gentleman at least ought to have the strength of character that Archie Cameron did. He should uphold the dignity of the Parliament and put beyond doubt the integrity of the Chair. If the right honourable gentleman is willing to do that, if he is willing to withdraw, I will do what Les Haylen did back in 1945-seek leave of the House to withdraw my motion. Mr Ian Cameron-Madam Speaker, I ask that the documents that the honourable member quoted from be tabled. That includes the typed motion that he has moved.",102
21,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,There is no provision within the Standing Orders for that.,103
22,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"The Opposition will totally oppose this motion. Madam Speaker, may I say that the concern of the Opposition that this matter should have been raised and the circumstances in which it has been raised were heightened when my colleague the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair) handed me your note to him dated today and indicating to him that, having read the transcript of his Press conference, you intended to raise the matter in the House again today. The letter was signed 'Yours sincerely, Joan Child'. That note carries an annotation to the effect that it was received by hand at 12.52 this afternoon. Yet the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) was able to give a prepared speech. We have enormous respect for the honourable member for Grayndler; he is very quick on his feet. I believe that other members on this side of the House, as I did, found your unwillingness to indicate who had been given prior notice of this matter, other than the right honourable member for New England, very disturbing. The fact that my colleague received this notice at 12.52 p.m. does not give us any cause at all for joy. I say to you, Madam Speaker, and the House that it ill behoves anybody in the Australian Labor Party to lecture this House about how Speakers of this House should be treated, because a few of us on this side have witnessed the assassination of Speakers by members of the Labor Party. We have witnessed their track record, their capacity and their respect. This matter goes to the reputation and position of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. This alleged admonition of my colleague, the right honourable member for New England, is about upholding the dignity of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. This Parliament and the honourable members who now sit behind the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Labor Party side ought to be reminded that when it comes to disagreeing with Speakers those opposite are the world champions. What really concerns the Opposition and what is the real basis of our rejection of this motion is that, as everybody in this House knows, comments by the Leader of the National Party which led to his expulsion arose during a very heated debate on a matter that has caused a great deal of controversy in this Parliament. Like many honourable members on both sides of the House, he made comments which ultimately led to his expulsion from the House. The right honourable member then held a Press conference and he made some other remarks. When the concern of the Speaker about those remarks was expressed, my colleague apologised in the House and withdrew those remarks-",103
23,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,As I did again later.,103
24,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"He withdrew them again a moment ago. Time and again honourable members on both sides of the House make remarks for which they are called to account and which they then withdraw. As far as the Speaker has been concerned on other occasions and as far as we have been concerned, that has been the end of the matter. Are we to have a new standard of conduct in this Parliament that says that an unqualified withdrawal and apology by the right honourable member for New England will not be good enough? Will he be treated in a fashion unlike that afforded any other member of this Parliament? A moment ago the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford) was asked by the Speaker to withdraw a slur on the character of the right honourable member for New England. He withdrew. Did we say: 'Oh no, that is not good enough. We want some other kind of apology and withdrawal.'? Did we say that he ought to be dragged before the Bar of the Parliament for contempt? Madam Speaker, I remind you with every respect that your most important duty is to preserve a perception of fairness and balance in the way you administer your duties. I believe that 1 speak for every member of the Opposition when 1 say to you that we are greatly disturbed that in this matter you are not doing that. We believe that the apology that was tendered by the right honourable member for New England, the Leader of the National Party, was quite adequate in all the circumstances. To require him to go any further than the apology that he has already given and the withdrawal that he has already made is to impose upon him a double standard. To require him to make an apology is to treat him differently from the way other people have been treated. 1 only say to those members of the Government who may have had knowledge of this move by you, Madam Speaker, that, if they really believe that this kind of behaviour by you and the Government will enhance the reputation of this House and produce better debate and a higher standard of exchange, they have made a very bad mistake. The action that has been taken will be greatly resented on this side of the chamber. The treatment of the right honourable member for New England is unfair and the Opposition will totally oppose it.",103
25,Mr CHARLES,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"1 support the motion. Bearing in mind all the documents that we supposedly have before us, if the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) or his staff cannot copy a few pages of Hansard, that incompetence will be one of the reasons why he will go down the drain at the next election. The right honourable member for New England held a Press conference after being legitimately suspended from the House. He interjected not once but on seven occasions, as reported by Hansard, and understanding order 303 (e) he was suspended. He then held a Press conference during which he made certain remarks which were in part reported correctly in the Canberra Times. The right honourable gentleman'said: I rather doubt, in the circumstances of the Speaker's behaviour-not the Parliament's behaviour but the Speaker's behaviourthat she necessarily is a person into whose custody I'd want documents of this kind left. You said, Madam Speaker, that if the remarks of the right honourable gentleman were made as reported, and verified by him-in other words, the right honourable gentleman was given a chance to verify that which had been reported, and all honourable members know that they should not believe everything they read in the newspapers because not everything is recorded accurately-you would ask him to withdraw them. The right honourable gentleman said: Madam Speaker, the remarks were not meant to be about you but about Parliament, about the occasional misbehaviour of miscreants such as myself , . . That is totally at odds with the following: I rather doubt, in the circumstances of the Speaker's behaviour, that she necessarily is a person into whose custody I'd want documents of this kind left. When 1 was on my way home from Parliament on that evening 1 heard the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program PM. During that program various quotes of the right honourable gentleman were played from his Press conference and from what he said in Parliament. As a member of this Parliament 1 was aggrieved that 1 had been deliberately misled, as had Parliament and you, Madam Speaker, by the right honourable gentleman. It is nonsense for the right honourable gentleman to come into the House and suggest that he genuinely withdrew the remarks he had made at the Press conference. That is not true. The right honourable gentleman tried to deceive the House and now he arrogantly says: 'I have already apologised for that'. But he did not do that. He said that the remarks were not made about the Chair, but they were. What has he withdrawn? 1 would like him to inform the House about that. Has he owned up to the fact that he made the remarks that were attributed to him? 1 thought originally that the Canberra Times must have got it wrong, but it did not. That was shown by the tapes the ABC played. The facts are clear. The right honourable gentleman deliberately misled the House. If he had apologised for his remarks, 1 suggest that the matter would not have gone any further; but after Parliament had risen and the tapes were produced, it was clear that the right honourable gentleman's remarks inside the House and outside were contradictory. 1 support the motion before the House. It concerns the most outrageous action 1I have ever seen in my six years in this Parliament. About the only correct thing the right honourable gentleman said was when he described himself as a 'miscreant'. According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary 'miscreant' means: '. . . depraved ... heretic; vile wretch'.",104
26,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"The public of Australia who no doubt are listening to this debate would be interested to know that today Caucus has been radically divided on questions of uranium and on the question of a letter written by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment (Mr Cohen) on the subject of mining in Kakadu National Park, and that the House rose four days after the Budget was introduced on the basis that the Government was unable to explain to the Parliament or to the people that its Budget was a total failure. Since then we have had a series of incidents within the Government which shows that it is not prepared to face up to the people in the way it should. So today we have an ambush, on the basis of what I find to be one of the worse instances that I can recall since I first entered politics a little while ago. I would like to refer again to three elements, Madam Speaker. The first is your letter to me. I received it at 12.52 p.m. Your Deputy, who moved this motion, obviously had a prepared speech, and the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) had a number of references which could not have been acquired in the few minutes since notice was given to this House. I find it fascinating not only that that has occurred, but also that in the normal procedure where there is a consideration of privilege it involves the Committee of Privileges of this House. I ask you, Madam Speaker, what consideration has been given by that Committee to this issue. Is it a matter that the Government has cooked up in its anxiety to run for cover? The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) laughs, and well he might. The House will remember that he is introducing a prosecution-within seven days, I think-on the question of whether there have been abuses in the administration of social welfare. It takes up to nine months, or perhaps two years, for the average person who has been abusing unemployment benefit to be prosecuted. The reality is that this Government is running scared. Ministers are unable to answer the proper questions of the people, so what do they do? I thank them for their flattery. They have decided that, as they cannot get rid of me in any other way, they will in a per-emptory fashion pursue a course of action which is false in its origin. Madam Speaker, I have apologised twice, and if you like I shall do it again. I apologise for the remarks I made and I withdraw them. I cannot see how one can withdraw remarks that have not been made, but I mention the circumstances of your Deputy, whom we all recall not so very long ago abused the position in which you sit when on 20 May 1986, seeking to participate in a debate while sitting in the chair, he offered the following comments: I would like to add my warm regards to the Minister on the passage of this legislation landmark work he did in this area in a previous Labor government. First, we have the circumstance of an ambush. Secondly, we have the climate in which the man who moved the motion, I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, grossly abused the privilege that he was called on to exercise as your Deputy while sitting in the chair. Thirdly, we have the climate in which the two members who are responsible for this motion-I hesitate to call them 'honourable' in this climate-have introduced a motion which certainly-",104
27,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Order! I would like to say two things. If the Leader of the National Party is verifying that these are the words he actually spoke and that these are the words he is withdrawing, I am quite sure that the honourable member for Grayndler will withdraw the motion. May I inform the Leader of the Opposition, in answer to his question, that the Chair was approached on this matter by a number of members of the Government who intended to raise the matter themselves today. As I started the matter back on 22 August, it seemed to me right and proper that I raise it. Whether I had raised it or not, it would have been raised in the House today.",105
28,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"In answer specifically to the intervention by the Leader of the House (Mr Young), may I say that I did acknowledge, do acknowledge and for the fifth time withdraw the remarks and apologise to the House.",105
29,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,Thank you.,105
30,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Now, may I continue on the motion-Mr Leo MCLeay-As I said in my earlier remarks, if the right honourable gentleman is willing to do that, I am quite willing to seek the leave of the House to withdraw the motion.",105
31,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,Is the honourable member for Grayndler seeking the leave of the House?,105
32,Unknown,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Leo MCLeay-Of course, if members of the Opposition want us to persist, I am more than happy to do so. But as I said in my opening remarks, if the right honourable member for New England were to take the principled position that Archie Cameron did in 1945, I would have no hesitation in seeking leave to withdraw. The right honourable member has said that he recognises the remarks and unreservedly withdraws, and it is fine that the matter should end there. If the House gives leave, I shall be willing which builds on the to withdraw. Motion-by leave-withdrawn. Ms Jakobsen-I am still unclear as to whether the right honourable member has withdrawn the remarks he said that he said or the remarks that he actually said.",105
33,Madam SPEAKER,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"To make it quite clear to the House, the right honourable member has withdrawn the words that he said about the Chair in his Press conference. DEATH OF HON. L. H. E. BURY, CMG",106
34,Mr HAWKE,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"I move: That this House express its deep regret at the death on 7 September 1986 of the Hon. Leslie Harry Ernest Bury, eM.G., a former member of this House for the Division of Wentworth from 1956 to 1974 and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Leslie Bury was born on 25 February 1913 in London and was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge. In 1956, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the New South Wales seat of Wentworth for the Liberal Party of Australia in the by-election held following the resignation of the Rt Hon. Sir Eric Harrison. During his 17 years continuous service to the Parliament, he held a series of ministerial portfolios, including the senior post of Treasurer from 1969 to 1971 and Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1971. LesliBury was a member of several parliamentary committees. He also represented Australia at numerous parliamentary conferences and on delegations overseas. Before entering Parliament, he was executive director of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the Australian representative on the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He held various senior posts in the Public Service in Canberra and was the President of the Canberra Branch of the Australian Institute for International Affairs from 1949 to 1951. During World War II, Leslie Bury served in the Second Australian Imperial Force from 1943 to 1945, with heavy artillery fixed defences and with the 12th Australian Radar Detachment. Madam Speaker, Leslie Bury was a long standing and respected member of the House of Representatives and of the Parliament. On behalf of the Government. I extend to his widow and family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",106
35,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"The Opposition warmly supports the motion of condolence which has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Leslie Bury entered the Federal Parliament for the seat of Wentworth in 1956. He brought with him a very rare and distinguished background in treasury and financial matters. He was a person who had served with very great distinction the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and in the middle 1950s he brought to the Federal Parliament a background in those areas which was not at that time very well represented. The Prime Minister has reminded the House of the various ministerial positions held by Leslie Bury. It has perhaps escaped the notice of some honourable members that Leslie Bury was the Minister to preside over the introduction of the first home owners scheme. In fact, the first home owners scheme was introduced by the Menzies Government after its victory in the 1963 election. Leslie Bury was given the job on his return to the Ministry, after his two-year absence resulting from his comments about the impact on Australia of the United Kingdom joining the Common Market, of overseeing the introduction of the first home owners scheme. That scheme continues today. It is a scheme which has been spoken of warmly by governments from both sides of politics. I am sure that honourable members opposite would allow me to make the observation that Australian Labor Party Ministers for Housing in recent years never tire of talking about the first home owners scheme. I think it is fair to say that their predecessors from this side of the House have also talked fairly regularly about the benefits of it. Perhaps it is appropriate to remember, as we move a motion of condolence for Leslie Bury, that he was in fact the Minister in the Menzies Government who gave the first home owners scheme its start. His ministerial career was a very wide and varied one. Of course he was very well and affectionately known to members of the Liberal Party in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, to Liberal members of parliament and members of the Liberal Party organisation. I can remember first meeting Leslie Bury when I began attending meetings of the New South Wales State Council of the Liberal Party in the late 1950s. He was a well liked and well regarded member of parliament and he was always accessible to members of the organisation. After his retirement in 1974 he was very greatly missed and very warmly regarded by all his friends and colleagues, particularly in the electorate of Wentworth. I know that I speak on behalf of all members of the Liberal Party in conveying to his wife, Anne, and to their sons the sympathy and the condolences of his many friends and the remembrance of a very rich contribution, both in war and in peace, in politics and in finance, to the service of the country he loved very dearly.",106
36,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"I rise to join the National Party of Australia in the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I suspect that my colleague, the honourable member for Kooyong  of this chamber who worked with the late Les Bury. He was a remarkable man. I guess from the National Party's point of view I should mention the difference that he had with my predecessor, as Leader of the then Country Party, Sir John MCEwen, over the question of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community. It was on that basis that in fact he was briefly sacked from the Ministry, only to return some years later when he certainly once again distinguished himself. However, it is of interest that on that first occasion the difference the impact on Australia of protectionism in world trade. Today that, of course, is the barb of the mission being undertaken by the Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins) in Uruguay on an occasion when all honourable members of this House would wish him well. As far as the actual circumstances of Les Bury's career are concerned, the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition has detailed much of the impact. I remember Les as a laconic gentleman. He certainly had a quiet application to his job. He also had a very balanced assessment of the problems which he from day to day found himself having to address. He favoured firmness. He was certainly one who did not seek publicity but worked as a quiet achiever in a way that earned the admiration of those of us who were his colleagues. He represented the seat of Wentworth for many years and, as such, was very close to the heart of that great city and the business affairs within it. As a former officer of the Bank of New South Wales, he also represented Australia internationally on the International Monetary Fund and, of course, had considerable close friendships within the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. He had a very close association with both those bodies outside the political forum. I extend to his wife Anne and his four sons, Peter, Michael, John and Nicholas, my very deepest sympathy and that of my wife and members of my Party.",107
37,Mr COLEMAN,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"1 give my support to this motion of condolence. Leslie Bury's career has been outlined by honourable members who have already spoken. The various positions he held in the banking world, the Public Service and the Ministry all indicate the great standing he enjoyed in the country at large and the level of his achievements. At the same time, the packed memorial service last Friday at his family's church, St Mark's, Darling Point, and the appreciative reception given to the very eloquent panegyric by Canon Whild, indicate the very high standing he also enjoyed in his local community. A child of the vicarage and always, in a sense, a man of the vicarage, he was known and respected for his character, integrity and humanity. These were never more clearly displayed than during that brief stumble in his distinguished career to which the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) referred, when Leslie Bury was obliged to resign as Minister for Air in July 1962. Support for him in his electorate of Wentworth was never really lay in stronger than at that time. The incident also showed something else about Leslie Bury. He resigned, of course, or was obliged to resign, because his opinions concerning the value of Britain joining the Common Market differed from those of the Government. It is important to note that in his speech during the debate on the Common Market, when the House resumed for the Budget session in 1962, he did not underestimate the economic problems that Britain's entry to the Common Market would create for Australia. However, he stressed the political, defence and security considerations that led him to support Britain's application for entry. He said that twice in our lifetime wars erupting in Europe had caused the slaughter of many thousands of young Australians, and the prospect of these dynamic nations now burying their ancient animosities was a development that Australians could not but support. I quote one characteristic sentence from that speech: European integration, of which the Common Market is an essential expression, is a keystone of the grand design for Western survival. Sir Leslie Bury was not only a man of character, he was also one of that rare species, a man of vision. I offer my sincere condolences to Mrs Anne Bury and her family.",107
38,Mr DOBIE,NATIONAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,"I rise as someone who served with Leslie Bury for six years in this Parliament. He was a man of great charm and great intellectual achievement, and a man of great personal courage. When I first entered this House in 1966 Leslie Bury was most helpful, as he was to all new members. He extended the hand of friendship-a friendship which I was to enjoy during the ensuing 20 years. We also shared a background in the economic department of the Bank of New South Wales, although, of course, I was there some years later. Leslie left this House due to ill health, which dogged him for the remainder of his life. He showed great courage during this time, and I believe the dedication of his wife and family carried him through that very difficult period of his life. I extend to Anne, and to Peter, Michael, John and Nicholas and their families, my personal sympathy and condolences. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA ANNABELLE RANKIN, DBE",107
39,Mr HAWKE,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"Wills-Prime move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the on 30 August 1986 of the Hon. Dame Annabelle Jane Mary Rankin, DBE, a former senator for Queensland from 1946 till 1971, a former Minister of the Crown, and High Commissioner to New Zealand from 1971 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement. Annabelle Jane Mary Rankin was born in Brisbane on 28 July 1908. She was the daughter of the late Colonel C. D. W. Rankin, a former Queensland State member and Minister for Railways. Annabelle Rankin was elected to the Senate for the Liberal Party of Australia in the 1946 Federal election, being the first woman from Queensland to enter Federal politics. Dame Annabelle was a pioneer in the involvement of women in Australian Federal politics and public life. In October 1947 she was appointed Opposition Whip, the first woman in any Westminster-style parliament to hold this office. In June 1951 Annabelle Rankin was appointed Government Whip, a position she held for 15 years. During her Senate career she served on several parliamentary committees, including the Standing Committee on Public Works. Annabelle Rankin was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queens Birthday honours in 1957. Dame Annabelle followed Dame Enid Lyons to become Australia's second woman to hold a position of Cabinet or ministerial rank in the Federal Government when she became Minister for Housing in the Holt Government on Australia Day 1966. She held this portfolio until her retirement from parliament on 24 May 1971. Upon her retirement from parliament Dame Annabelle, as we know, was appointed High Commissioner to New Zealand, the first woman appointed to a diplomatic post in another country. She held this position with distinction until September 1974. Dame Annabelle had a record of considerable community service before she entered the Federal Parliament. She was a Sunday school teacher and State Secretary of the Girl Guides' Association and early in 1943 she became Assistant Commissioner of the Young Women's Christian Association war service attached to the Army where she was responsible for welfare services for servicewomen in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Throughout her 25 years of parliamentary service her community concerns were paramount. Dame Annabelle was a long-standing and re Minister)-I spected member of the Senate and served her country and her party with distinction. Her pardeath liamentary achievements were recognised when in 1984 the new Federal seat of Rankin was named in her honour. On behalf of the Government, I extend to her family our sincere sympathy at the passing of a very fine Australian.",108
40,Mr HOWARD,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"-On behalf of the Opposition I warmly support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I know that I speak particularly on behalf of members of the Liberal Party of Australia from Queensland in expressing thanks and remembrance of the contribution that Dame Annabelle Rankin made to Australia and to the fortunes of the Liberal Party in the Federal Parliament and in her native State of Queensland. She was, as the Prime Minister said, something of a pioneer in the involvement of women in the political affairs of Australia. She was the first woman in Australia to administer a Federal department, the first Australian woman to head a diplomatic mission, the first woman in any Westminster parliament to hold the office of Government Whip and the first woman from Queensland to enter the Federal Parliament. By any measure and by whatever criterion of political belief or commitment, that was a very remarkable achievement. As the Prime Minister noted in his remarks, she had a very distinguished career in various service and other organisations before she entered Federal parliament. After her retirement from Federal politics and diplomatic activity she continued her very heavy involvement in voluntary and service organisations. Throughout her career she maintained a particular interest in welfare of young people, the handicapped and the aged. She was their frequent advocate in the Senate and held high office in a number of associated organisations. She was the Vice-President of the Multiple Handicapped Children's Association and patron of the Cystic Fibrosis Association, and she worked tirelessly for the Children's Hospital Foundation and the Queensland Spastic Children's Welfare League. She was a very active member of the Quota Club and of the Business and Professional Women's Association and she was the first woman to be appointed to the Board of Governors of the Utah Foundation. The former honourable member for Moreton, Sir James Killen, described Dame Annabelle as having exercised a matriarchal influence over the whole of Queensland politics. She entered politics at a time when, unfortunately, women were expected by too many people to participate in public affairs as women and for women. She did not see her role in that light and often remarked that in Parliament we worked as a team, not as men or women but as citizens. It is appropriate, as the Prime Minister observed, that a Queensland Federal seat now bears her name. Dame Annabelle's record is an impressive one for any Australian. On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia, I record our regret and sadness at her departure. We acknowledge the enormous contribution she made to the nation and to our Party.",108
41,Mr SINCLAIR,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and join the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in paying tribute to the contribution of the late Dame Annabelle Rankin. She was quite a remarkable person. I was interested to hear the comment of the Leader of the Opposition about Dame Annabelle having had a matriarchal impact on Queensland politics. I found that she had a very sisterly effect on those of us who worked with her. In Cabinet she managed to tone down somewhat the language and the vehemence of the debates. She certainly was able to offer a personal contribution in her measure of understanding of people-I think of the difficulties of mothers within the community-to her portfolio as Minister for Housing. Even though Dame Annabelle was born in Brisbane, I read that during her early times in the sugar cane district of Childers she rode a pony to her first school. Her memory of her bush beginnings certainly was a contributor to the her attitude in so many of the debates in which she became involved. It is difficult in a few words to encapsulate the lady who was Dame Annabelle Rankin, but reading through the headlines of Press comments on her does it so well. In a report on a biography of Dame Annabelle by Waveney Browne, entitled A Woman of Distinction the Courier-Mail calls her 'a thoroughly nice lady'. In the Canberra Times in 1966 she was described as 'a woman in a man's world'. She said of herself 'I don't think of myself as a woman'; she thought of herself as a 'citizen' and a 'member of the team here'. She said: I have always done my work like this, and that is the way I will continue to do it. She was an advocate of 'home work' and 'hard work', as the New Zealand Herald described her upon her first taking up her duties as High Commissioner for Australia in New Zealand in 1971. A more fitting description than any came upon her retirement as Minister for Housing. A Canberra Times headline by Rosemary Fairbairn on 4 June 1971 described her as 'the Dame would play politics, not dolls'. She was a remarkable lady and certainly had a tremendous influence in the Parliament and across the whole of Queensland. There is no doubt that she achieved what she did, not because she was a wnman but because of herself. She was always unimpressed with the cause of women's liberation. She just went ahead and did what she wanted, saying that she did not have time to think about it. She believed that all women should be interested in politics, no matter what their occupations. She believed that the woman who has the greatest responsibility and greatest role is the wife and mother. She certainly had a great influence on her community. To her sister Jean, on behalf of my colleagues and myself in the Nationa! Party, I extend our deepest personal sympathy.",109
42,Mr BEDDALL,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I would like to add my voice in support of this motion of condolence. As the first Federal member of this Parliament to represent the division of Rankin, I consider it a distinct honour to do so. I had the pleasure of meeting Dame Annabelle Rankin when she officially opened the Rankin electoral office for the Australian Electoral Commission. It was only a brief meeting, but the woman was impressive, even though she was not in good health. I have said before that it is a great honour to represent the division of Rankin and I think that Dame AnnabeIJe's memory is weIJ served by the naming of this Federal division.",109
43,Mr MOORE,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I associate myself with the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair). Dame AnnabeIJe Rankin was brought up in a political atmosphere. Her father was a Minister in the only non-Labor government in Queensland between the First World War and 1957-the A. E. Moore Government. As a consequence of that, her knowledge of politics was contributed to by her early years when she was brought up in the country town of Howard some miles north of Maryborough. In 1946, when she was first elected to the Senate, she was one of three non-Labor members of the Senate. Neil O'SuIJivan and Walter Cooper were the only other two non-Labor members of the Senate. As a consequence of that, she had a lot to do, although being a Whip of three is probably an easier job than being a Whip of many more. After 1951, when the coalition gained control of the Senate, she fiIJed that position with some distinction. As previous speakers have said, her contribution to politics here, her representation of Australia overseas and her overalJ representation of the people of Queensland are things for which I am sure we aIJ thank her and remember her. Indeed, she was a very kind and generous person, a person one could approach with great ease and a person whose great knowledge of people I always found very rewarding. She was a person I wiIJ miss in a political sense in Queensland and I know that the Liberal Party of Australia wiIJ miss her as weIJ.",110
44,Mrs DARLING,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I wish to support this condolence motion and to record the appreciation of Queensland women for the trail blazed by Dame AnnabeIJe Rankin in the Federal arena, as she set a pattern for women to follow. Dame AnnabeIJe was an articulate, capable woman. Her record in office as she balanced ministerial duties with family duties did much to demonstrate the energy and efficiency that women can bring to the office of a Federal representative, and this is appreciated. I would like to record my sincere sympathies to her family.",110
45,Mr DONALD CAMERON,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I would like to make a few brief comments in support of what previous speakers have said. Dame AnnabeIJe was a Minister when I came into this place in 1966. Along with a number of other members and senators, I attended her funeral in Brisbane a few days ago. I would simply describe her as the epitome of decency-a thoroughly kind, lovable person who proved that women can make it without being unduly aggressive.",110
46,Mr SLIPPER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE DAME,"I wish to associate myself with the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I came to know Dame Annabelle Rankin both before and after my election in 1984. In later years, after her retirement from Parliament, she was a resident in my electorate at Deception Bay. She was very much involved in the community there and earnt the respect of the local people. I would like to express my sympathy and that of the local community to her sister Jean because Dame Annabelle was loved and will be missed by everyone who knew her. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA",110
47,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins) will be absent from Australia on government business until 4 October 1986. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair) for his observation of good will in the important task that the Minister is undertaking on behalf of Australia. As. aIJ honourable members know, the Minister will be representing the Australian Government at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks at Punta del Este in Uruguay. Following that, the Minister wiIJ undertake discussions in Europe. In his absence, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) will act as Minister for Trade and will undertake his representative duties in this House. NA NA",110
48,Mr HOWARD,KAKADU NATIONAL PARK,"I ask the Prime Minister: Does today's government decision on Kakadu National Park totally preclude new mining activity taking place within stage 2 as well as stage I of the national park and, with the exception of Coronation Hill, aIJow exploration only in stage 3? Is this decision therefore not at total variance with the Prime Minister's letter of 1 September to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment in which he said that he would have serious reservations about any proposal that would result in the imposition of a more restrictive framework? I ask whether it is also not at total variance with comments made by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Evans, yesterday when he said: I would like so far as the existing Park is concerned to see some assessment of the resources there to proceed . . .",110
49,Mr HAWKE,KAKADU NATIONAL PARK,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The assumption underlying his question is wrong. Let me make clear the effect of the Government's decision. It will mean that there will be no mining or exploration in the existing Kakadu National Park, stages I and 2. That is not at variance with what I have said. In regard to what is referred to as stage 3, which is the Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases, we will extend the national park beyond its existing boundaries. But we have made clear, firstly, that there will be no mining of uranium. Stage 3 is the area which is the more highly prospective regarding non-uranium resources, particularly it seems for gold and platinum. In the processes of government, in discussions in the relevant committees and in Cabinet we will be undertaking the steps which will enable the assessment of the non-uranium resources in stage 3. We believe that this represents an appropriate compromise between the two essential interests that a large number of honourable members-not only on the Government side of the House-have, that is, that we should have a proper concern for our great natural heritage. Stage 2 of the national park will be submitted for World Heritage listing. I believe that that decision will meet with the approval of the great majority of the Australian people. I was concerned to ensure in regard to the most prospective area for non-uranium resources, which is stage 3, that we should not preclude our capacity to ascertain what is there and, according to national interest considerations, have the possibility of developing that. The decision by the Government will ensure that those two sets of considerations will be met properly. QUEENSLAND: LOAN TO NATIONAL NA",111
50,Mr WRIGHT,PARTY MEMBER,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the allegations made in the Queensland Parliament last week concerning a decision by the State Minister for Primary Industries to direct the Agricultural Bank of that State to lend $145,000 to a prominent member of the National Party of Australia? Can the Minister tell the House whether any Federal funds are involved? Will he comment on whether such activities are a normal part of primary industry ministerial activity?",111
51,Mr KERIN,PARTY MEMBER,"As we know, Queensland is the State of corruption. The only thing that really strikes me in my visits to Queensland is the deeply-held love between the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia at this time. It is really wonderful to see the great love between those two parties there. In answer to the honourable member's question let me say that I am aware of the allegations. They concern me deeply. I would imagine that in times such as these, Mr Turner, the State National Party Minister involved, would receive numerous requests for favours for his National Party mates. After all, that is the way the system works up there. I find it very sad, however, to consider the possibility that in the twilight of a distinguished career in the service of Queensland agriculture Mr Turner appears to have given into the temptation to be of service only to the Queensland National Party. It is especially sad because the recipient of this $145,000 State jackpot is a failed National Party candidate for the Senate. I have to view these allegations most seriously because it appears that a large part of the money loaned by the Queensland Government to the individual concerned was not its to lend at allit was the Commonwealth's. Of the $145,000 loaned, $85,000 was granted at 4 per cent under the natural disaster relief arrangements. As honourable members are aware, this scheme is funded by $3 from the Commonwealth for every $1 from the State in years of heavy demand, and after Cyclone Winifred this is one such year. We have a situation in which the Commonwealth and the States have agreed on a scheme under which the Commonwealth, the taxpayers of the nation, funds the bulk of natural disaster relief in adverse years. However, we find that in Queensland it is handed out to National Party candidates at 4 per cent interest, at the whim of National Party leaders. This $85,000 was loaned by the Agricultural Bank at the express direction of the State Minister and against the express advice of the client's trading bank, the Rural Reconstruction Board, an agency of the Queensland Government, and Elders. The Board considered the poor man's finances to be past the point of no return in terms of viability. His business equity was being eroded at a rate in excess of $2,000 a week. All the advice to him was that he should sell-a view shared by the pastoral house's finance manager, his trading bank manager and the Rural Reconstruction Board. These views were known to Minister Turner. But Father Joh BjelkeChristmas intervened and loaned the man $85,000 at 4 per cent-three-quarters of which appears to have been the Commonwealth's-and $60,000 more at 13.5 per cent, which was properly the Queensland taxpayers'. The Queensland Premier has shown his disregard for these allegations, calling it a loan of a lousy $145,000. I would like to suggest to the Queensland Premier that it is not a lousy amount but it was a lousy decision. My colleague the Minister for Finance is attempting to establish with certainty whether the State is liable to repay to the Commonwealth any of the moneys loaned. To obtain a natural disaster relief loan we need to be sure that the recipient had experienced some real natural disaster apart from being a member of the National Party. In the meantime let it serve as a reminder to the taxpayers and voters of Queensland: It is time they stopped Sir Joh and his Party cronies playing Father Christmas at their expense. NA  the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his Press conference in Brisbane last week, when in answer to a question on Soviet influence in the Australian anti-uranium and peace movements he said: Of course they are involved in it . . . stating the obvious. In the light of his admission that elements of the Australian peace movement are under the influence of the Soviet Union, will the Prime Minister specify more precisely the nature of that influence and the levels to which it reaches? Will he also give the House an assurance that such groups have not received any government funding through the International Year of Peace grants?",111
52,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN PEACE MOVEMENT,"For obvious and understandable reasons on the other side of the House, what I said at Brisbane has been blown up somewhat. Let me make clear what I was saying and the extent to which I wanted to extend it into the Australian situation. I was stating the obvious when I said that there were interests in the world, not only in Australia, which when addressing themselves to this issue had motives other than concern about the mining, transport and export of uranium. I went out of my way then and subsequently to make it clear that I was not attempting to cast aspersions on the great bulk of the people in Australia, who have a deeply held conviction on this issue. Honourable members opposite will do their purposes no good at all if they attempt to take from what I say some suggestion that the great majority of people in Australia who have expressed their concern at the mining and export of uranium have ulterior motives. I have never believed that and I do not believe it now, and I certainly did not want to convey the impression that that was in any general sense the case. People within the Labor movement, the trade union movement, the churches and a whole range of groups which have no conceivable connection with or influence from the Soviet Union hold particular beliefs on this issue. It is a well known non-state secret that I do not share their view, but I do accept, as I have consistently, the integrity of their position. I say to the honourable member for Kooyong that I have no information as to the degree of influence, financial or otherwise, where that influence exists, but it would be passing strange to believe that it does not happen in this country as I believe it does in others. As to the final point of the honourable member's question, I have no evidence before me that any such group which may be in that category has received any funding under the International Year of Peace. NA",112
53,Mr KENT,STOLEN AMMUNITION AND WEAPONS,"My question is directed to the I'm just Minister for Defence. Has his attention been drawn to the statement by the right honourable member for New England that stolen ammunition and weapons were shipped from Australia to Sri Lanka by Tamils to be used by terrorists? Has the right honourable member submitted any evidence in support of his allegations to the Minister or to the police? Is the Minister aware that baseless accusations against a peaceful community such as the Tamils, many of whom came to Australia to escape from racial violence in Ceylon, are harmful to our multicultural development? Finally, will the Minister request the right honourable member for New England to submit evidence, if he has any, against individuals instead of accusing a peaceful community of good Australian citizens?",112
54,Madam SPEAKER,STOLEN AMMUNITION AND WEAPONS,Order! The honourable member is debating his question. I call the Minister for Defence.,112
55,Mr BEAZLEY,STOLEN AMMUNITION AND WEAPONS,"I share the honourable member's concerns about the position of the Tamil community in this regard. I share his appreciation of the Tamils as a peace loving community within our multicultural society. When I saw the Press release by the right honourable member for New England in the terms in which it was put out I was more than a little mystified. Unlike the general argy-bargy of politics in this place where we quite freely dispense allegations with regard to the activities of other people and each other, these allegations were couched in quite precise terms and in some considerable detail right through the right honourable member's Press release. It was concluded by a statement that he regarded the advice that had been given to him to be advice on excellent authority and that there was a serious matter of security concern for the Government to be obliged to consider. When members of Parliament raise those sorts of security issues with me I always take them seriously. Generally they do so privately. When they believe that a serious matter of security concern has arisen they will come to me privately from both sides of the House and raise it with me. I cannot say that that has occurred in this case. In answer to one part of the honourable gentleman's question, I am not aware of any of the evidence that has been presented in this regard. Nevertheless, having not had that evidence presented to me, I made the best efforts I could to inquire through my Department and through other departments affected by those entirely specific and detailed allegations as to what their foundation might well be and whether we could discover any truth in the matter that required our attention. Having gone through those detailed allegations I cannot find any accuracy in any of them. In the first place it was suggested that lion rounds of ammunition had been stolen from an Australian ammunition factory and shipped to overseas terrorists. Ammunition Factory, Footscray is not missing, honourable members will be pleased to know, one million rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, one million rounds weighs 44 tonnes and represents two heavily laden semitrailers. Clearly, employee pilfering could not account for this bulk even over the period of a year. It would require an employee to pilfer 5,000 rounds per working day. This represents 25 ammunition containers of 200 rounds each per day. As each container is heavy this volume is not credible. Of course the employees could have spread the load around a bit. People would have witnessed a whole lot of workers coming out of Ammunition Factory, Footscray with their trousers round their knees and bits and pieces of ammunition dangling out of their pockets. I am pleased to inform the honourable gentleman that that event has not occurred either. These suggestions are entirely bogus. The right honourable member then came to the conclusion that ammunition was shipped via Darwin, Brisbane and Melbourne in waste paper containers. That has roused the irate indignation of one waste paper exporter to Sri Lanka, who has pointed out the absolute impossibility of doing that without whoever's machine was doing the compressing blowing up in the faces of the people who were doing that compressing. I will not go any further into that, because he has said that he intends to take legal action in regard to that suggestion. I do not know whether he has done so, but if he has it is clearly not a matter appropriate for comment here. The right honourable member went on to say that, because of all this, the Army was recently forced to buy one million rounds of ammunition on the open market as the Government factory was unable to meet the order. The statement implies that we could not meet the order because it was stolen. Indeed, an order for six million rounds of 5.56 millimetre ammunition was recently put to tender overseas, and Australian production of this calibre will commence in June 1987. It was put to tender for the simple reason, not that rounds had been stolen, but that we do not produce it. We will produce it under the self-reliant defence policies of this Government, but we do not do it yet. Over the last six years, there have been 18 overseas orders of 5.56 millimetre ammunition and orders of other calibres. During the right honourable member's time as Minister for Defence, an order for one and a a milhalf million blanks was placed in the United States. The right honourable member also claimed that a terrorist had stolen the ammunition while working at the Ammunition Factory, Footscray. He claimed that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation had been notified but had allowed him to escape overseas. Subsequently, on the Willesee program, reporter Martin King claimed that he had spoken to this same terrorist some months earlier, who had convinced him that he was indeed a terrorist. The Willesee program did not run the story, despite the reporter's conviction of the terrorist's bona fides, nor did it raise the matter with me and my Department or my office, although it was subsequently raised in discussions last week. Theft is a matter for the Australian Federal Police, not ASIO, to investigate and there was no theft to investigate. The so-called terrorist was identified by the Willesee show reporter on Friday evening. His name is Ram Damieen and he was employed as a national employment scheme trainee from the Aborigines at the Ammunition Factory, Footscray, from June 1984 to March 1985. He claimed that he was an Aborigine and had lost all his papers in Cyclone Tracy. Mr Damieen worked as a supply clerk. He had nothing to do with ammunition or paper work related to ammunition. As a temporary employee, contrary to the assertions of the Leader of the National Party, he did not have an ASIa security check. The Willesee reporter stated last Friday that, off camera, Mr Damieen claimed again to be a Tamil terrorist. The Federal police have since interviewed the gentleman and he told them that he was an Aborigine, that he had been grossly misrepresented and was going to take legal action. Police investigations are continuing, but the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who has responsibility for such matters, informs me that Mr Damieen may be the first Tamil who knows how to play the didgeridoo. I believe that the right honourable member must give us more information on his claims and his sources. It has been reported in the SunHerald newspaper that, immediately after his media conference, the representative of a Canberra lobbying group, Carney Hocking and Associates, was telephoning journalists advising them to ring the Sri Lankan High Commission for confirmation. That group is headed by Mr Carney, formerly on Mr Sinclair's staff, and, as I understand it, the group has a public relations account for Air Lanka. My office has also been told-it is not obviously as reliable a report as that-that a freelance journalist was complaining in the Press gallery on Friday that Mr Carney had given the story to that journalist and it was going to get a big run on Sunday, but that he had given it instead to Mr Sinclair. This all sounds very curious, and obviously there will be opportunities during the days ahead for the right honourable member to clear that up. To get back to the point, not one single item in that Press report was factually based-not one. They were detailed accusations, not the general argy-bargy that we throw around the place at each other from time to time. They were obviously introduced in the context of his embarrassment at dealing with the problems raised by the absurd claims by the Leader of the National Party in Queensland about this Government's attitude to terrorism. It is this Government that has taken its responsibilities seriously in that regard and it is this Government that has ensured that it is a primary requirement of ASIa to pay attention to the operations of potential terrorist organisations, if any, in this country. I might say that that preoccupation has sometimes come in for criticism from conservative circles, who believe that the principal function of ASIa should be counterespionage and that it should not concentrate on these types of issues. So obviously he was doing his best, as a loyal National Party member, to cover for his colleague back in Queensland. But his best was not good enough, particularly when it came forth in such detail, such spurious detail, as subsequent investigations have found. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT: NA",112
56,Mr SINCLAIR,MUNITIONS FACTORIES,"I ask the Minister for Defence a question and draw his attention to the Auditor-General's report, which is to be tabled later today, in which, referring to Footscray and other ammunition factories, it is stated: These factories have a lamentable history of inadequate accounting. The sustained lack of interest displayed in the financial reports by management represents a serious breach of public accountability obligations and shows little evidence of the commercial orientation necessary for efficient operations. In light of his claim in his Press statement that, with the exception of 25,000 rounds, all ammunition produced at the ammunition factory in Footscray is accounted for, how did he reach that conclusion? Where is that ammunition? What does he believe that ammunition is being used for? I also draw the honourable gentleman's attention to that part of his Press statement which stated that in another incident a small amount of explosives and ammunition was stolen, and refer him to the answer by the Special Minister of State to a question on notice in the Senate Hansard of 8 April 1986 which referred to four break and enter incidents between 29 December 1985 and 18 January 1986. I ask him: On what basis does he believe there was only one such incident? What guarantees can he give this House that the figure he stated, that is, only 25,000 rounds are missing, is accurate?",114
57,Mr BEAZLEY,MUNITIONS FACTORIES,"I thank the right honourable gentleman for his question and appreciate the fact that he is now running a thousand miles an hour away from his previous accusations. Let me now start with the 25,000 rounds. Indeed I felt that the occasion of his particular Press release required of me that I state in answer to him the maximum possible extent of the problem which was present at the time and to which I was obliged to respond. The point I make concerning the 25,000 rounds is that we have subsequently gone through an accounting procedure on that matter and we can now fail to account for only a few hundred. So in fact the bulk of that 25,000 since then has been accounted for. The right honourable member will no doubt be pleased to know that. I come to the basic suggestion about the problems with accounting not only in that factory but across the board in defence factories. We have had some real problems over the last three years catching up with the mismanagement of the government factories which has occurred and which was permitted to occur by the honourable member's Government when it was in office for that very substantial period. The fact that we are prepared to confront those problems is evident in the rationalisation in which we have engaged in all the defence factories. We have been obliged in that process to layoff workers. We have been obliged in some circumstances to shut factories as we start to introduce commercial practice into them, that is, commercial tice related not only to their accounting procedures but also to their operations overall. I think that the Auditor-General correctly identified a long historical problem in regard to accounting procedures in the defence factories. He would also be in a position to be able to identify correctly the fact that this is the Government that is actually doing something about it after 30-odd years, the only Government that has done anything about it, compared with the pusillanimous performance in that regard when the Opposition happened to be in government. As I have said, in a number of those factories we have introduced direct and more effective accounting methods. Honourable members would also note that the Auditor-General has referred to the fact that this Government has begun to address those problems. In regard to the theft of ammunition-the one million rounds that the right honourable member is looking for-that is supposed to be a matter of ASIO investigation. there have been police investigations with regard to small amounts of missing ammunition from factories, not the amounts that are going to be used to fight a great terrorist war in Sri Lanka. the Middle East or anywhere else, but a few rounds here and there. The result of those police investigations that a person is going to have to go to trial and an employee has also been dismissed. So these matters are being picked up by the police and are being dealt with. Opposition members-Oh, oh!",114
58,Mr BEAZLEY,MUNITIONS FACTORIES,"Honourable members opposite go: 'Oh, oh!' This is a bit different, is it not, from a million rounds for the heinous terrorists that we are supposed to be supporting-a bit of pilfering here and there which is supposed to cover that particular exercise? The right honourable member seeks assurances on guarding arrangements at factories. As with the accounting problems at factories, so too we addressed the guarding arrangements at factories left depleted by the right honourable member's tenure as Minister for Defence and his predecessors in that regard. There has been at those factories a tightening of security procedures to deal with the sorts of problems that have arisen from time to time with regard to pilfering and break-ins. Nobody is ever able to produce-not this Government, not the previous Government-absolutely foolproof security procedures anywhere. I would say that the procedures we have been introducing in the defence factories are markedly superior to anything that prac- was attempted while he was in office. Investigations have proceeded and been brought through to some degree of success, at least to the extent that charges can be laid. With regard to the particular 25,000 rounds, as against the one million, that the right honourable member has got particularly uptight about, I am able to assure him that we are down to being unable to account for only a few hundred of those, and a bit more effort on behalf of the people shifting paper on the issue will probably eliminate most of those as well. NA",115
59,Madam SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Rt Hon. Sir Peter Kenilorea, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA NA",115
60,Dr THEOPHANOUS,GREECE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware of the recent earthquakes which have devastated the Kalamata region of Greece. is What information can he provide to the House in relation to this tragedy and what action has the Government carried out?,115
61,Mr HAWKE,GREECE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member for Calwell refers to a subject which of course has brought considerable grief directly to many in Greece and also to many of our Australian citizens and would be a matter of concern to the Australian community generally. I have nothing to add to the general details that have been available in the Press as to the extent of the tragedy that has occurred there. I can say to the honourable member, however-and I believe I would be speaking on this matter not merely for the Government but for the whole House-1I have sent a message to the Prime Minister of Greece in these terms: I was very sorry to learn of the earthquake which occurred in Southern Greece and of the death, injuries and destruction at Kalamata. This is a human tragedy which will draw worldwide sympathy, but it is felt particularly acutely in Australia where so many of our citizens have strong personal and family ties with your country. Indeed Australians have notable connections with the Messinia region ranging from the landing of Australian troops at Kalamata during the Second World War to the many thousands of Greek Australians whose origins are in this part of Greece. I concluded by saying: On behalf of the Government and of all Australians I would like, through you, to convey to the relatives of those killed and to those injured and suffering the effects of the destruction our deepest sympathies. NA",115
62,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL TRAVEL ALLOWANCE,I address my question to the Treasurer. On what basis does he maintain that Sydney is his principal place of residence for the purpose of claiming ministerial and parliamentary travel allowance?,116
63,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL TRAVEL ALLOWANCE,"I can see, on the basis of organised questions, how the Leader of the Opposition is again wishing to play the man and not the ball, but so be it. I am quite happy to be in that particular game any time he likes. There is nothing irregular about my travel allowances. I own one residence in this country and it is in Sydney. That is the basis of my claim, as were the claims of a plethora of coalition Ministers during their period of office. NA",116
64,Mr MAHER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Much misleading information has been published relating to the log book record-keeping requirements for motor vehicles subject to the fringe benefits tax. What action can the Government take to clarify the situation?,116
65,Mr KEATING,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The changes to the fringe benefits legislation, in terms of the claims for motor vehicle costs and deductions, reflect the possibility of users of vehicles for business purposes being able to substantiate a high proportion of their deductions. At the moment two bases of substantiation are available in respect of motor vehicles. One is the statutory rule. I am not certain that many taxpayers understand that they do not need to fill in log books. Log books do not have to be filled in if owners of vehicles wish to use the statutory rule which has been provided by the Government. I do not have a copy of the precise rule with me, but it means that the write-off is around 40 per cent for 5,000 kilometres of vehicle usage, and for usage up to 25,000 kilometres it is about 75 per cent to 80 per cent. In other words, if a motorist wishes not to bother about the log book, he does not have to. He can fall back on the statutory rule if he so chooses. If, however, the owner of a business or a selfemployed person wishes to claim 80 or 90 per cent, or something of that order, and substantiate to the kilometre the differentiation between private and business use, then the log books, quite properly and sensibly, are available for that purpose. All they need to do is enter the private mileage in the log book each day and the balance is automatically designated as business mileage. It is not an onerous obligation. The notion that has been put about by the coalition, that a person must fill in details of every trip is, of course, nonsense. All people have to do is make clear what is their private mileage and the balance is business mileage. The whole purpose of this, of course, is to remove from the tax system the blemish whereby people who have the use of vehicles make claims at the taxpayer's expense which are really claims for private use. I remind the House that many investment advisers and accountants are still advising their clients that because of the concessionality of the statutory rule it is still worth their while to own and operate a motor vehicle. The log books are available for any owner of a vehicle who wishes to substantiate the fact that he or she can claim a higher level of business use than would be available under the statutory rule on the basis of block kilometres. NA  for Primary Industry to the decision introduced by stealth last week to increase the base price of diesel fuel by 5.8c per litre, which will further affect farm returns by $76.2m. Why did the Government increase the cost of fuel when there was an urgent need to ease domestic costs and slash the tax burden on fuel?",116
66,Mr KERIN,DIESEL FUEL,"I am not responsible for this area of government policy. I will check the honourable member's question with the relevant Minister, who I assume is either Senator Button or Senator Gareth Evans. NA",117
67,Mr MILDREN,POST OFFICE AGENCIES,Is the Minister for Communications aware of concerns raised by the Post Office Agents Association regarding possible closures of post office agencies? Can the Minister indicate whether there is any substance to these rumours?,117
68,Mr DUFFY,POST OFFICE AGENCIES,"The matter raised by the honourable member in relation to concerns expressed about the closure of post offices is well known to me. The honourable member has also raised this issue with me by way of correspondence. The fact is that the publicity that has been given to this matter by the Association is very misleading, particularly in two areas. There is an indication that due consideration is not given by Australia Post to the closure of post offices, which is not true. As the honourable member is aware, there is a difficulty in because of Australia Post having to carry out its financial obligations under the Act. There has been considerable consultation before any post office has been changed. The recent publicity by the Association in relation to the proposals for the closure of post offices has been greatly exaggerated. I have indicated recently to the honourable member that, in relation to a couple of specific cases, the concerns are without foundation. NA",117
69,Mr COLEMAN,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment and refers to the funding by the Community Arts Board of the Australia Council of the official bureau of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Australia, the Palestine Information Office in Melbourne. Is it the normal practice of the Community Arts Board of the Australia Councilor of any other board to provide funds to political groups which advocate or defend the use of terrorism? If so, what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that this practice is discontinued?",117
70,Mr COHEN,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,"As the honourable member knows, I have long had sympathy for the Palestinian cause! I think I should briefly outline the history of the Australia Council and how it operates, although I would have thought that the honourable member knew that. The Australia Council is appointed by the Government, as are the boards. We have a principle of arm's length funding and peer group assessment; that is, the boards, which are made up of artists with specialist expertise, assess applications for grants and recommend them to the Council. The Government does not interfere with the decision making process. Neither this Government, nor its predecessor, nor the Whitlam Government, which set up the Council, has ever interfered. We have always adhered to the principle of arm's length funding. In July 1985 the Community Arts Board gave a grant of $5,000 to an organisation called the Palestine Information Office. The grant was towards the costs of mounting a visual exhibition of the cultural traditions of Palestine in association with a large number of art works-paintings, et cetera-provided by or especially prepared for the exhibition. The exhibition was to bring together contributing artists of AustralianArab background, in addition to artists from the Aboriginal, Italian, Greek and Peruvian communities, similar to exhibitions on the same theme held previously in Japan, Italy, France, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the United States relation to finance, of America.",117
71,Mr COLEMAN,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,To promote the PLO.,117
72,Mr COHEN,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,"There is no PLO office in this country. The Palestine Information Office is headed by a man by the name of Ali Kazak, an Australian who is obviously sympathetic to the PLO. There are people of Palestinian origin in this country. They form one of numerous ethnic communities, of which there are dozens in this country.",117
73,Mr SLIPPER,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,Why fund them?,117
74,Mr COHEN,PALESTINE INFORMATION OFFICE,For the same reason we fund other ethnic organisations in their artistic pursuits. We adhere to the principle of arm's length funding and the decisions must be made by the Australia Council and its constituent boards. NA,117
75,Mr CAMPBELL,EXTRADITION TO ISRAELI,"I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he is aware of the plight of Mr White who, while engaged in a regular passenger service between Cyprus and Sidon, in an act of piracy by the Israelis had his boat boarded and confiscated on the high seas and directed to Haifa. Mr White spent a month in an Israeli gaol and was released without charges being laid. Will the Attorney-General tell me what action this Government feels it ought to take in view of the very strong support we are giving to the Israeli Government in recovering from this country people who it claims have committed offences in Israel?",117
76,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,EXTRADITION TO ISRAELI,I am not aware of the matter. I will have inquiries made and inform the honourable member. NA,118
77,Mr HODGMAN,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"I ask the Prime Minister to confirm or deny the fact that out of some 430,000 questionnaires sent to business proprietors throughout Australia in relation to the fringe benefits tax or the FBT - now known as the farewell Bob tax-less than 50 per cent have been returned, indicating massive public opposition to this tax. I remind the Prime Minister that I October-the first payment date-is now only 14 days away. I therefore ask the Prime Minister: What action does his Government intend to take against the thousands of businessmen in this country who refuse to pay this tax and against those, including me, who are advising hard working Australians not to pay this vicious, iniquitous socialist tax?",118
78,Mr HAWKE,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The question should properly have been directed to the Treasurer, who is responsible for administration in this area, but I am more than relaxed about answering the question from the honourable gentleman. One never ceases to be amazed by the double standards on the other side of the House, not least those of the honourable member for Denison who is at the forefront of trumpeting the responsibility upon the trade unions to obey the law of this country. The Leader of the Opposition said: 'Let there be 1,000 Mudginberris'.",118
79,Mr HOWARD,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Hear, hear!",118
80,Mr HAWKE,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"'Hear, hear!', he says. What was the point of his proposition? He is saying that where the law exists it should be obeyed. I happen to agree that where the law exists it should be obeyed, and I have said so on both sides of the industrial fence. What I find totally difficult, indeed impossible, to comprehend is how people can come into this House and on the one hand say to the organised work force of this country that it should obey the law of this land properly passed through this Parliament but on the other hand not only tell others, whom they regard as being of their ilk, not to obey the law but also actively encourage them to disobey it. They will be judged by the great bulk of the people in this country who will benefit from the fact that this Government at last has taken steps to bring equity into the tax system in this country. The fringe benefits tax is part of a total package of tax reform. It is estimated that in the next full financial year it will bring in approximately $600m as part of a tax package which will bring in $1.5 billion. Not one cent of that will be kept by the Australian Government. In fact, $4.5 billion will be paid out in the next full financial year to the taxpayers of this country, the overwhelming majority of whom have had an undue burden placed upon them in past years because of the way in which our predecessors in government protected the few privileged in this community and imposed a greater burden upon the many. We will overcome the legacy which was left by the Leader of the Opposition who, when he walked out of the door of the Treasurer's office, bequeathed to the people of this country a maximum tax rate of 60c in the dollar. As a result of the combined measures undertaken by this Government, by I July next year we will have reduced the Howard 60c in the dollar to 49c in the dollar. One of the central features by which we will be able to do that is the bringing to an end of the iniquitous system whereby a privileged few in this country were able to avoid their burden and so pass on a greater burden to the mass of the people in this country. If the honourable member for Denison, the Leader of the Opposition or any honourable member on the other side of the House believes that the Opposition will derive some political advantage from encouraging a few people to break the law they should start to understand political arithmetic. While the mass of people silently approve and the people who are having their perks taken away from them are making a massive noise against the loss of their privilege, if the Opposition reads that as a potential political advantage I hope that it will continue to do so because at the next election it will find, to its great disadvantage, that it has been massively wrong. NA",118
81,Dr KLUGMAN,ECONOMIC ISSUES,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is he surprised that there has not today been a question from the Opposition dealing with economic issues? What does this say about the general acceptance of the Budget by the Australian community?,118
82,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC ISSUES,"I am not surprised. The Opposition is always delving and rolling in trivia. Such matters as the Ordnance Factory, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and my travelling allowance tends to rate ahead of major economic issues. I can only assume that the Opposition thinks the Budget is entirely appropriate for Australia and has no queries about the cast of economic policy and that, despite the protestations of the Leader of the Opposition about how the Government should not be diverted from the principal task of managing the economy, he thinks it is going fine. Otherwise there may have been a question about it. However, to the more general point, going past the irrelevancies opposite us to the relevance of the Australian public, in the last couple of weeks in the opportunity I, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have had in touring the country we have found a very high degree of acceptance by the Australian public that the Budget is a correct strategy for Australia, that it recognises the difficulties of our external trading conditions, that Australia is living through the worse terms of trade that it has experienced since the Second World War, that restraint with equity was the order of the day for the Budget and that the Budget achieves that objective. In achieving that objective it has done what it set out to do, that is, to reduce consumption and demand and to lift the emphasis upon savings and investment. I think that is well understood and it is a commentary on the good sense of the Australian public that it can see the attempts by the Government to deal with this externally induced economic problem. Yet the comments of the Opposition remain where they have always been in respect of economic policy-entirely and completely irrelevant. REPORT OF AUDITOR-GENERAL",118

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION (EQUAL NA WOMEN) BILL 1986 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. Assent reported. GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",120
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT,"Madam Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The total failure of the Government's economic management resulting in the loss of Australia's AAA international credit rating. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",120
95,Mr CARLTON,MANAGEMENT,"On Wednesday, \0 September, in New York, Moody's Investor Services Inc., one of the major credit rating organisations in the world, announced that Australia's AAA credit rating, which it had held ever since it entered foreign markets, had been reduced to AA 1. This was a very sad day for Australia because the rating given by Moody's and the rating given by the Standard and Poor's Corporation, which will also be reviewed later this year, determine the interest to be paid by Australian governments and government instrumentalities when they are borrowing overseas. So whenever the Australian Government needs to borrow money abroad to make up for deficits in the Budget or for any other purposes, or Qantas Airways Ltd or the Commonwealth Bank of Australia wishes to borrow abroad, it will pay, as a result of the economic failures of this Government, a higher rate of interest than it otherwise would have paid. Ultimately, that will cost every taxpayer in Australia more money. There is a flow-on effect from that. Not only does the downgrading of the Government's credit rating reflect adversely on the Government and push up the borrowing rate of the Government and government instrumentalities, but also it is a grave reflection on Australia as a whole. It is a national disgrace. It is shameful that this Government should be the first Government to suffer the humiliation of having Australia's AAA credit rating reduced in international financial markets. Moody's, in giving its explanations for this action, which had been very seriously considered long before the Budget and, indeed, delayed until after Moody's had seen the Budget, mentioned a variety of economic and structural weaknesses which 'cloud the nation's flexibility for servicing long-term external debt over a five to 10-year horizon'. In other words, for the first time in Australia's history, an international credit rating agency has said that there is doubt about Australia's capacity to be creditworthy and to repay its debts. The Australian Financial Review reports: Moody's said that Australia's overseas debt had risen rapidly over the past several years-from a total of $US 18 billion in 1981 to $US59 billion currently. The agency believes that continued shortfalls eign currency receipts will result in further build-up external borrowings. In a devastating reference to the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) Moody's is' reported as saying: Recent measures by the Government to reduce public spending are steps in the right direction, but they are likely to be insufficient to put a brake on the build-up in debt requirements. One of the major items on the Treasurer's agenda for this Budget was to meet the requirements of international markets in reducing public spending and taxes. The article continues: Moody's said that its rating decision also reflects several internal factors,-that is, factors over which the Government has controlincluding inflation rates running at twice the OECD average and unemployment pressures. Industrial and labour market rigidities are further expected to hamper the country's efforts to shift economic resources into areas with high foreign exchange earning capacity. In other words, this highly respected international credit rating agency turned its thumb down at the fourth Keating Budget. It said that there were some positive aspects within the Australian community and talked about the liberalisation of controls on direct investment and capital inflows, something that the Government acted upon too late, and months after the Opposition had suggested it. Moody's mentioned the floating of the Australian dollar and, in what we would regard as a double-edged statement, referred to tax reform. But it said that the effects of these measures are still too uncertain to provide a level of investor protection compatible with Moody's AAA rating category. What a disgrace it is to be the first Treasurer of Australia to preside over the downgrading of Australia's international badge of probity and creditworthiness. I do not think it will be any news to honourable members on this side of the House that the Treasurer has long expressed a great admiration for J. T. Lang, who was the Premier of New South Wales in the 1930s and wanted to repudiate overseas debt. He was sacked by the Governor of New South Wales for so doing. Here we have the person who admires J. T. Lang being the first Treasurer who has presided over a downgrading of Australia's international credit rating. What were the reasons for this downgrading? Summarised, they were that debt was rising to a point where Moody's doubted whether Australia had the capacity to pay it back over the longer term with certainty. It said in for- that the recent changes in economic policy and in the recent measures-it was referring, of course, mainly to the Budget-were insufficient to change this situation. It talked about internal factors within Australia-the high rate of inflation, rising unemployment and an industrial relations and labour market system which was so rigid that Australia could not adapt to changing external requirements. What does the Opposition say about this? The Opposition says that the Government brought this on by its own recklessness, its own deceit and its own gutlessness. What do we mean by recklessness? This Government was reckless from the very beginning. When the Government came into office in March 1983 it had the ball at its feet. The economy was coming out of recession, the drought was breaking, the Fraser wages pause was in place and it had the confidence of the business community and of the international financial community. It had everything in front of it to bring Australia out of the recession and to make Australia secure against any forthcoming international shocks. But what did the Government do? It embarked on a campaign of reckless spending and borrowing. It doubled the rate of expenditure that we had over the seven years of the Fraser Government. From 2.1 per cent in real terms on average over the seven years of the Fraser Government it has risen now, at this point of budgetary forecasting, to 3.9 per cent on average, which is almost double, and it will blowout during this financial year. What about debt? When this Government came into office the external debt overall-private and public-stood at about $36 billion. At the last count by the Reserve Bank at the end of the financial year it had risen over the period of this Government from $36 billion to $88 billion, and the forecast is that it will rise to over $100 billion before this financial year is out. The public debt for all three levels of government, which stood at $14 billion when the Government came into office, as at last December, the latest period for which we can get figures, had gone from $14 billion to $31 billion. It is rising and it is probably over $40 billion by now. There is the question of servicing that debt. Do honourable members realise that it now takes about 40c in every dollar we earn abroad in export income to service our external debt? This is the recklessness of the economic program of this Treasurer. This economic program, make no mistake about it, has failed. It has clearly failed in the eyes of the world and it has clearly failed in the eyes of the Australian voter. Of course, that is not all. While all that was going on, things started to go wrong. They started to go wrong in February 1985, when the dollar dropped very substantially. But the Government ignored the signal. There was further evidence of failure and, indeed, the Government noted in its Budget Papers of last year that there would be difficulties with the terms of trade. By October and November, when we had dreadful balance of payment figures, dreadful inflation figures, and inflationary wage settlement and the dollar marked down again, it was obvious to everybody that the economy was in trouble. Yet this Treasurer and his Prime Minister embarked on a deliberate campaign of deceit of the Australian community. They continued this right through into May this year. Indeed, on 9 May the Treasurer said this to the Economic Planning Advi-' sory Council, his own advisory group: Overall, 1986 is emerging as a year of slower, but still satisfactory growth, a year in which we will see consolidation of the very strong gains of the past three years and in which the economy can deal with the imbalance on our external account. It is notorious that only five days later the Treasurer, having said that to EPAC and having deceived it, went on the John Laws program-",120
96,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,That's right. Mr MACKellar-He said: 'That's right'.,122
97,Mr CARLTON,MANAGEMENT,"The Treasurer says that he did deceive EPAC. We have his first admission that he deceived EPAC. He went on the John Laws program and said that we were moving to the point of being a banana repUblic. This is the level of public debate that was engendered by this Government and this is the depth of deceit to which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were prepared to go. Throughout the whole of this period the Government was utterly gutless in taking any notice of the signals and taking the necessary steps to bring the economy round. On 3 January the Opposition put up a fourpoint plan. It said that the Government must cut spending, that it must delay the wage case and that it must relax foreign investment controls. These points were put up in a program published by us on 3 January this year. What was done? Absolutely nothing was done. We suggested that there be a mini-Budget and that spending cuts should come into place before the beginning of the financial year, but nothing was done. The Government was gutless because it was concerned about the Labor Party National Conference in July. We suggested that the wage case be delayed and the productivity deal with the unions be called off. We also suggested that the anti-investment taxes introduced in September of last year be removed in order to encourage business investment. None of these things was done. The Government was not prepared to face up to the trade union movement and speak common sense to it. Indeed, the Government put a fraudulent case to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in March and it did not even mention the deterioration of the terms of trade in its submission to the Commission. So the Commission, although it did not accept the actual case on productivity, allowed the powerful unions to go ahead and pursue the 3 per cent superannuation claim by industrial action. This is the history of recklessness, deceit and gutlessness of this Government. It did nothing from October right through until the Budget in August, which was said to be the great panacea. The Government said: 'Wait for the Budget and everybody will see that this will be the answer to all our economic problems'. Moody's Investor Services, which had decided to look at the rating of the Australian economy, waited for the Budget. Representatives came out here and spoke to the Treasurer and Treasury officials. They spoke to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who argued in favour of retention of the AAA rating for Australia because it is a matter of national honour that we retain our international creditworthiness. However, having examined the figures of the Budget against the claims made for it by the Treasurer and having given the Treasurer an opportunity to explain what he had done and why, they went back to New York and objectively downgraded Australia's AAA rating to AA I. It was quite clear that anything that might have been said about confidence in the Treasurer by international markets is absolutely nonsense. I understand that the Treasurer gave a pep talk to members of Caucus this morning. He told them that all they had to do was to be positive and to wait for the turnaround in the economy. I wonder whether Caucus members remember the J-curve. They were told to wait for the J-curve to turn around the balance of payments. Senator Button did not believe it. In May the Treasurer told the Australian people: Let me make the point that the Australian economy has been entirely robust. The Treasurer presumably also deceived his own party room. It is a national disgrace that we have lost our AAA credit rating.",122
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,123
99,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"The honourable member's time has expired, that is for sure. I have heard some dishonest presentations here in my time but that just about takes the cake. The matter of public importance is related to the Government's so-called economic mismanagement in the loss of Australia's AAA rating; yet everything that is said by Moody's Investor Services Inc. gives the lie to that statement. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) in his last utterance said that Moody's came to Australia, asked about the Budget, and, having examined the Budget figures, went back to New York and downgraded Australia's AAA rating. But Roger Knye, one of the people who came to Australia and who chairs the Australian desk at Moody's, said: Moody's thinks the Budget was a brave one. In a rating review we take into account the wisdom or lack thereof of a country's economic managers. One of the positive features of the Australian scene is the intelligent guiding of the ship of state. So what about that? The honourable member tried to make the cheap point that Moody's made a judgment about the Budget then decided to bring Australia's AAA rating down when, in fact, Moody's explicitly says that the Budget was brave. Mr Knye said on the AM program on the day of the release of the rating: There are many factors that went into our decision. Chief among them was our view that external conditions such as commodity prices, restrictive access to agricultural markets and supply-demand imbalances for Australia's raw material exports, were combining in such a way that Australia would be, would find it somewhat more difficult to earn the requisite foreign exchange needed to service its debt. He went on: Our downgrade should not be interpreted as a black mark against the current Government or any future government. The honourable member for Mackellar knows that those things were said. He knows that Moody's made a judgment about Australia's terms of trade over the five to \0 years of the survey period that it was examining. Yet the honourable member tries to make a cheap point. On the day of the release of the rating statements from the Opposition became more extreme as the day went on, more strident and ridiculous one after the other. Nobody listened because Australia has had enough of the strident immaturity of these political opportunists. Australians want to look hard at our national condition and pursue sensible policies towards a more secure economic future. They are not interested in the headless-chook antics of the honourable member for Mackellar. The other thing that the honourable member said in closing was that the Government was gutless. He said this about a government which has brought the coalition massive Budget imbalance-the massive fiscal deficits of Treasurer Howard-from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 1.4 per cent in prospect. Supposedly we are gutless. We pull these outlays down for this year to 1.4 per cent as a Budget deficit and outlays to zero; yet the honourable member for Mackellar, when speaking to the National Press Club, said: It is not therefore in the public interest that an Opposition geld itself by announcing in intricate detail which interests it might challenge with its expenditure cuts. This would invite the maximum degree of opposition from the interest groups directly affected. Mr Carlton- That's right, too.",123
100,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"That is right, is it? The honourable member talks about gutlessness. His Party is not even prepared as an opposition to say where it would change outlays, much less as a government. We can see the nakedness of the statement: It is not therefore in the public interest that the Opposition geld itself by announcing in intricate detail which interests it might challenge . . . In other words, the Opposition says: 'We made a mess of it in government but even in opposition we will not come clean on where our fiscal policy-Mr Carlton-Read the next paragraph.",123
101,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"I know what the honourable member says, that he would bring spending growth to zero. Why would anyone believe the honourable member when he is not prepared to say-Mr Carlton- That wasn't the next paragraph.",123
102,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"Yes, it is. I have the honourable member's speech. It says that growth will go to zero. Why would anyone believe the honourable member when he not only does not have the guts but also does not have the decency to say where his public outlays cuts would fall? Does the honourable member think that it is fair enough for this Government to labour over outlays changes for five months and bring down a Budget which offends certain groups in the community to get the requisite changes in the macroeconomy when for him no such discipline exists? Mr Carlton-It will in due course.",123
103,Mr KEATING,MANAGEMENT,"No, this is not in due course. The honourable member makes it quite clear that he will not outline any outlays changes. He talks about gutlessness. My God, the honourable member is unbelievable-talk about doublespeak. If the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) decides to put the cue in the rack, I know that one of the first casualties of that change will be that the honourable member for Mackellar will be replaced forthwith as shadow Treasurer. Let us consider what Moody's said. Moody's made it quite clear in everything it said-I go back to its Press statement. It said: Moody's emphasised that Australia's international credit quality remains strong. It went on: In this regard, several recent structural changes viewed positively by Moody's including liberalisation controls on direct investment and other capital inflows, the floating of the Australian dollar, and tax reform. Whc did all those things? It certainly was not the coalition. Moody's went on: These should eventually lead to a more balanced economy. It went on: On the positive side, Moody's said that many fundamental factors bode well for Australia's long term credit quality. It said further: The agency cited the nation's political stability, its strong natural resource base, sound economic management ... Everything the honourable member said has been put down by Moody's utterances about its review. I make the other point that the major United States rating agency, Standard and Poor's Corporation, has reaffirmed Australia's AAA rating by making it clear that it is not about to undertake a review as Moody's has. Other commentators in New York City interested in Auscurve tralian sovereign debt say that they are not in position to commit themselves to a view about the terms of trade over a five to 10-year period. One can have a SUbjective view about the terms of trade over a five to 10-year period. Moody's was prepared to put that subjective view into place in this assessment. Many other groups, Salomon Brothers Inc. for instance and Morgan Stanley International Inc., indicated that they were not prepared to make a judgment about the terms of trade over a five to 10-year period. I suggest that it would be a very brave person or institution that would try to forecast the price of oil, wheat or non-ferrous metals over a five to lO-year period. It is basically on those factors that the review has changed the rating. Even so, it is a movement from AAA to AA I which, of course, is the next category. Moody's emphasises that Australia's international credit quality remains strong. I notice that the honourable member for Mackellar brings out the notion about the Jcurve-how there is not one. He keeps making the point that Moody's made it clear that it believes that Australian enterprises will take up the opportunities provided by the devaluation of the Australian dollar and that it was confident: . . . in the private sector's eventual ability to respond to competitive challenges from overseas. Apparently the champion of the free market, the coalition, is not at all confident about the capacity of private business to take up the opare portunity because it says that there will be no Jof curve, there will be no change in net exports despite the fact that the national accounts indicated clearly that there was a 1.3 percentage point contribution to growth from net exports in the last year compared with the 1.25 per cent forecast in the Budget, which of course was scoffed at by the honourable member for Mackellar who said that there would not be a J-curve. The Government said the figure would be 1.25 percentage points. The outcome of the national accounts was 1.3. In this Budget we are saying that the figure will be 1.75 percentage points from net exports and we have the huge driving force of a 40 per cent depreciation behind it. Apparently the free marketeer opposite, the honourable member for Mackellar, does not believe that a 40 per cent price change on the exchange rate will make any difference to the pattern of imports and exports, that the free market economy of Australia will not respond, that the price signals do not matter. The honourable member talked about the Jbeing an L-curve. The lack of economic a literacy of the honourable member for Mackellar and the Opposition in general is startling. The fact that this country will secure a real and effective depreciation of that order of magnitude and the changes that already have been secured in our national accounts in net exports and will be secured this year give the lie to the claim that there is no J-curve. It is obviously there. Of course, it was swamped by the terms Qf trade decline. It is with the swamping of the terms of trade decline that the Opposition chooses to muddy the waters and suggest that there is no effect operating in the economy. Indeed, without that 30-odd per cent depreciation, the Australian dollar returns of the Australian primary export sector would have been decimated. As it is, they have suffered markedly under the decline in the terms of trade. As I have said, our export earnings in Australian dollar terms would have been decimated. The Opposition does not believe in the Jcurve, market economics or the entrepreneurial capacity of Australian business. Is it any wonder that Australian business does not believe in the Opposition? I heard in an interjection talk about labour market rigidity. Let us examine that. The fact is that the data put down that claim. I shall quote the OECD's figures on the changes in annual real wages between 1983 and 1985: In Australia the change was minus 5.3; in the US it was minus 0.6; in Japan plus 5.8; in Germany plus 3.8; in France plus 3.1, and in the United Kingdom plus 10.9. In other words, the greatest change in annual real wages was in this country. The claim that there are labour market rigidities and inflexibilities is put down by these figures. What is not put down is the central fact that Australia has a centralised wage system. It has the British craft union structure and is not organised on an enterprise or industry basis. Which party has the policies to draw the best economic circumstances from that condition? It is clear that the Australian Labor Party alone has that capacity. The coalition Government gave us a 16 per cent wage increase in 1980-81 and 198182 because it was not in any position to manage the economy. What is the Opposition's wages policy? What a joke! It has decided to allow opting out for enterprises with fewer than 50 employees, but the enterprises would opt out into a centrally determined wage. It is upward flexibility, not downward flexibility. That is what the Opposition caIls wage flexibility. When the honourable member for MackeIlar was quizzed about how he would handle a depreciation, he said at the National Press Club: We would go to the Arbitration Commission. So the Opposition wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants the centralised system for depreciation-it will trot off to the Arbitration Commission to get change there-but it will not have the Commission dealing with organisations which have fewer than 50 employees. There will be opting out for them, but they will only opt out to a minimum wage that is determined by the same commission. That is the Opposition's policy. InteIlectuaIly, it is a disgraceful joke, yet Opposition members advance it in this place and elsewhere. The Opposition has no wages policy, no incomes policy and no fiscal policy. If it does not have a wages policy and a fiscal policy, it will have no credentials for economic management. It is saying that it has a $5.9 billion set of receipts commitments, and the Leader of the Opposition has implicitly stood by that by saying that he has junked his outlays commitments but not his receipts commitments. The shadow Treasurer will not say where the outlays changes will be. The Opposition wages policy is a joke and would be washed to one side in the real economy, if it were ever put into place. Yet Opposition members talk about the Opposition's credentials and how it advises the Government. The Opposition crowd could not raffle a duck in a pub. We all know that and we have always known it. Does the Opposition think that Australian business will ever trust it again? Does the Opposition think that Moody's Investor Services or Standard and Poor's Corporation or the great institutions of the United States, Britain, Germany or Japan have any confidence in it? The answer is that they have none whatsoever. The final put-down of the nonsense and tripe spoken by the honourable member for MackeIlar was the reaction of the foreign exchange markets to the Moody's decision. I received a telex from Morgan Stanley in New York teIling me that the decision was taken with a grain of salt. That was the reaction of the markets around the world. I advise the Opposition to do its best at political opportunism and urge the honourable gentleman to make the most of his shadow portfolio. I do not mind entertaining him while dealing with these matters of public importance because he will not be here in this job. He will be a long time in opposition.",124
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT,Mr Leo MCLeay)Order! The Treasurer's time has expired.,125
105,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,MANAGEMENT,"Berowra) (4.35)As usual, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has not faced the realities of the situation to which I attempted to direct his attention a couple of months ago. Largely, he devoted his speech to making debating points vis a vis my coIleague the honourable member for MackeIlar (Mr Carlton), and not to very good effect. This is the fact before the House: Moody's Investor Services has taken away Australia's AAA credit rating-but the Treasurer does not address that. That rating has been taken away from us because of the dimensions of our present economic predicament, together with assessments of our ability over the next few years, under this Government's policies, to meet our obligations in respect of the debt it has accumulated and will accumulate. Someone has to set forth the dimensions of our predicament, which the Treasurer has glossed over. Over the past three quarters we have had nil or slightly negative growth in non-farm gross domestic product. We have the yawning deficit in the balance of payments of upwards of $1,OOOm a month, or about $30m extra into hock every day. The August deficit figure was $1.24 billion, and the Treasurer said: 'We welcome the improvement'. Improvement on what? It is an improvement on the April figure of $1.5 billion, which generated the banana republic comments, and on the figure for October 1985, which was of about the same order. However, the August figure was above the average of recent months, and we are on course for a total deficit this year of about $15 billion.",125
106,Mr CADMAN,MANAGEMENT,Mr Micawber would have been a better Treasurer.,126
107,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,MANAGEMENT,"Many people could have been a better Treasurer. We have a yawning deficit, and that has to be financed by borrowing overseas. So our debt is on course for reaching $100 billion during the financial year. Thus, growth is at a standstill and we have a yawning balance of payments deficit. Our debt is expanding. The sinking Australian dollar has stabilised temporarily at about 60c, but with a significant quantum of Reserve Bank intervention. Inflation is 8 to 9 per cent, which is highly dangerous; indeed we may trace the course that is already in motion-a devaluation-inflation spiral. That is highly dangerous. In comparison, inflation in Germany is virtually zero and it is a couple of percentage points only in the United States America and in the other countries which are our trading partners. We still have in place an accord, the centrepiece of which, in principle, is an adjustment of wages to the inflation rate where there is foreshadowed an application for a two points discount, but what is two points in relation to adjustment to 8 per cent inflation? There are vast problems in that area. Another dimension is that unemployment is rising to 10 per cent, on the Government's own figuring in the Budget Papers. Further, investment is flat. According to Mr Crean of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, it is abysmal, and it is set to fall further on the Government's own projection. Yet if advantage is to be taken of the devaluation, about which the Treasurer has had a good deal to say, there must be new investment in import competing industries and export industries. But that investment is not forthcoming because no one believes that the competitive position, which has been significantly improved, will be retained. Why should they-businessmenwhen they look at inflation figures of the order. I referred to? Associated with all this we have interest rates at crippling levels, going through the roof with the prime rate touching 19 per cent the other week. It has come back a little but interest rates are at crippling levels and that also is very adversely affecting the necessary investment. These are the dimensions of the problem we are looking at. I stress to the people who are listening that this Opposition is not knocking Australia. We are not putting down the long term prospects of Australia-under the right policies. But we do not have the right policies. That is and has been the problem. It is important that the Australian people recognise who brought this situation about. It has certainly been exacerbated by the adverse movement in the terms of trade, by low world commodity prices, but the principal factor, particularly in the early stages, was the policies of this Government and in particular its profligate spending. I cannot spend time elaborating on the Budget deficit of $8 billion in 1983-84, but it was not a Howard Budget deficit. There was a forward projections figure of about $9.8 billion. But the Hawke Government brought in a $8 billion deficit embracing, in its own terms, $2.5 billion for its own new programs. So we are talking about a deficit of $5.5 billion-in the hands of those opposite-and we would have had it down further. Need I talk about the 1984 deficit and the profligate spending of that year when we had a whole range of headings of very large increases in spending-sport. and recreation expenditure was up about 60 per cent; the community employment program was up 80 per cent; the bicentennial program was up 350 per cent. It was the greatest spend-up of all time. Now this year we have a projected deficit of $3.5 billion. Everyone knows that that is a phoney. In the first place it has been substantially affected by significant increases in indirect taxes, particularly the excise on petrol which will add to inflation and make even more difficult the rectification of our fundamental problems. When the Government should have been cutting spending we had precious little of that, as indeed the Moody's statement said. Secondly, as we know, the deficit figure of $3.5 billion relies heavily on a number of onceoff changes-a Reserve Bank profit of the order of $600m; a deferral of the granting of the tax cuts, saving the Government $650m; and there is a difference 'in the impact of such expenditure cuts as were made, in the next year compared with this year, of the order of $500m. The real underlying deficit is thus in excess of $5 billion. The Government, in an act of bravado, will shortly bring in a Bill to introduce new tax rates as from I July next year that will cost another $3 billion. So the Government will go into next year, in effect, with an underlying deficit of $8 billion at least-that is, if it does go ahead with the tax reductions. Does the Government imagine that the markets have not been able to do those sums and to look forward to the incompetence and understand the sheer deceit, as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) said, of shifting the problems into that period? No wonder further support has been necessary to uphold the dollar at the 60c level. The Opposition does not suggest that there is any quick fix, any easy, overnight solutions to these difficulties. There is a long, hard haul ahead, but these matters underline the imperative necessity to implement the major, historic changes, changes in long-standing attitudes and institutions, required to allow this country to realise its tremendous potential, which we do not deny for one moment. These are in particular the requirements that governments in Australia should spend, borrow, tax and interfere much less, and the need for genuine tax reform and major changes in our wages and industrial relations system.",126
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,127
109,Mr MARTIN,MANAGEMENT,"As usual when I enter a debate on a matter of public importance such as this it is good to follow the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards). He makes some very reasonable points, and those points are worthy of canvassing. I am very pleased to hear him admit that the problems facing the Australian economy are many-fold and that there are no easy solutions. I would be the first to endorse the remarks that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has made in that regard. Quite clearly, the Government has no easy fix or easy solutions at its disposal to face the problems that have been foisted upon it. We have heard today words such as 'recklessness', 'deceit' and 'gutlessness' thrown about the chamber with great abandon, directed at this Government and in particular this Treasurer. I believe that that is nothing but nonsense. If we look at the record of this Government since it came to power and the deceit that was here when we first arrived on this side of the House we find that prior to the election the people of Australia were being told by the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Benneiong (Mr Howard), that the deficit was very low and that we had no cause for concern. We were suddenly in government and found out from the Treasury that we had a deficit of over $9 billion. The Opposition has the gall to say that we are deceitful and that the Treasurer of this Government is deceitful. It tries to tie this into some spurious notion that the downgrading of our credit rating by Moody's Investor Services will mean doom and gloom in Australia. That also is nothing but nonsense. Let us look at what happened when Moody's decision was announced. We can do no better than to refer to some of the newspapers that reported this at the time. What did they say? The Age, for example, on 12 September stated: The financial markets yesterday brushed aside the Moody's downgrading of Australia's credit rating to welcome the latest trade figures by lifting the value of the dollar and cutting interest rates. The honourable member for Berowra has talked about interest rates going through the ceiling again. The result has been that since then interest rates have been going down and the dollar has been going up. We have talked in this place previously about the volatility of the dollar. It is a phrase I have used before and I will not repeat it, but one can describe just how that operates. Quite clearly, when we have a floating dollar we will be subject to movements as they occur. What else was said when Moody's gave us the AAI rating? What did it mean? The Sydney Morning Herald on 12 September stated: Intrinsically, Australia's down-grading from AAA to AA I does not mean a lot. It will raise by fewer than 0.25 percentage points the cost of overseas borrowing by the Commonwealth and its authorities, with some flow-on possible to borrowers in the private sector. The main significance of the move is political. Many may see it as what Moody's said it was not: a black mark against the present Government. I repeat that many may see it for what it was not-a black mark against the Government. That is exactly right. How did other financial institutions view the position? The Treasurer went to the position of the Standard and Poor's international agency. What did it do? It strongly praised the Australian economy on the eve of its annual review of the nation's credit rating. That New York-based firm still has Australia in the top AAA rating. Mr William Chambers of that organisation was reported as having said that: its rating was usually reviewed after the announcement of a country's Budget. However, the article continued: He said that Australia's balance-of-payments problems and foreign debt was obviously of concern to the agency. 'But that (the balance of payments) is something Australia has very little control of, Mr Chambers said. 'It is a problem that has been imposed on it.' We have been saying that for some time. The Treasurer, in his brave and courageous statement to the people of Australia in setting out the scene for Australia's problem, alerted the people to that position and this Government has set about doing something about it. We have brought down a very brave Budget. If we go back to preBudget times we can recall the doom and gloom merchants on the other side. Those brave economists out there, all working for private banks, were saying that we must have a Budget deficit of $4 billion or we will be in really deep trouble. The night the Budget came out, the Treasurer announced a figure of $3.5 billion. Suddenly, because they had not reached that figure in their estimations, they all scurried away and said: 'There must be something wrong with the figures. We didn't think of $3.5 billion'. Mr Donald Cameron-Rubbery figures.",127
110,Mr MARTIN,MANAGEMENT,"The honourable member says that the figures are rubbery. Let us have a look at the figures for the last three years for which this Government has brought down Budgets, in terms of its commitments under the trilogy. Coopers and Lybrand p.ublished a most interesting review of the Budget in August 1986. It looked at the outcomes of the Budgets, under the Government's trilogy of commitments, for 1984-85 and 1985-86, and it projected the outcome for the 1986-87 Budget. What did it have to say? The honourable member for Berowra mentioned the point about the deficit. In 198485 the deficit was $6.746 billion, in 1985-86 it was $5.742 billion and the projected deficit for 1986-87 is $3.5 billion. Quite frankly, the figures that have been projected in Budget after Budget have been verified. Everyone of the commitments of this Government under the trilogy has been met, bar one projection for the 1986-87 Budget, which is a 0.5 per cent over-run on an increase in tax revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product. That will be the only over-run that we have had for four years. Yet Opposition members come here and tell us that we are economic mismanagers and that the Treasurer is presenting to the people of Australia deceitful, reckless and gutless policies. That is arrant nonsense. How did the people of Australia react to the Budget? We have heard of this. In Question Time today, we heard the Prime Minister clearly point out, from his visits around the countrythe Treasurer has been going around the country as well-the fact that people have been generally supportive of the Government's endeavours. For example, on Wednesday, 20 August the Australian, which is no great supporter of this Government, said: The Federal Government has given us a tough Budget, but one that deserves considerable praise. What do we see in the Australian Financial Review? Again, some on this side of the House say that the Fairfax Press does not give us a good go. I happen to be a strong believer that the Australian Financial Review does that. Under the heading ' Mr Keating's remarkable Budget', it said: The Treasurer, Mr Keating has produced a remarkable Budget. He has met the most optimistic of market expectations, maintained a high level of welfare spending, confounded many of the criticisms which the Opposition had signalled in advance and taken the very real political and economic gamble that his measures might not be fully effective in time to save Labor at the next election. * * * But it is also economically responsible and politically honest. The premier economic newspaper in the country said that the Budget was 'economically responsible and politically honest'. What did the real estate industry have to say about this? Here we have a report headed 'Keating budget is good news'. It states: The Budget news released this week may be horror to some but to the real estate industry things could be  Roberts, Executive Director of the Real Estate Institute of Australia. 'The general thrust of the budget will in time take the pressure off the interest rates. I consider the approach taken by the Government is good'. Time and time again, we can point to those in the community who have seen the successive Budgets of this Government and this Treasurer and who have all sung their praises. The Metal Trades Industry Association said: 'Government administers the right medicine'. Mr Bert Evans said that the Government had administered the right dose of medicine through the Budget to get the economy going. All those people cannot be wrong. The Government has taken a clear, concise and important step in guiding the economy along the road to recovery from overseas forces that have impinged upon it-forces that have come through our balance of payments, our terms of trade and through export and import prices that have been beyond the control of this Government. Indeed, even if the Opposition had been in power, it would have been beyond its control-far more beyond its control, because it would not have known how to handle it in the first instance. I reject out of hand this matter of public importance, which says that the Government has been a total failure.",128

112,The Clerk,MANAGEMENT,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Closure of Post Office Agencies To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House or Representatives assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we strenuously object to the proposal that many Post Office Agencies are to be closed. They provide a network of offices with postal and agency services to residential areas and small communities. They serve a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced if forced to travel further to purchase postal items or collect parcels. It would be an unnecessary expense particularly for pensioners without their own transport. We maintain that the purpose of Post Offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer. They are a community centre particularly in country areas and if necessary they should be subsidised to retain them. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that should take all possible steps to prevent the Post Office Agencies and that the network extended, with the Agency services they offer And your petitioners, as in duty bound, pray. by Mr Adermann, Mr Andrew, Mr Baldwin, Mr Beale, Mr Beazley, Mr Blanchard, Mr Blunt, Mr Braithwaite, Mr John Brown, Mr N. A. Brown, Mr Robert Brown, Mr Burr, Mr Cadman, Mr Ian Cameron, Mr Campbell, Mr Carlton, Mr Cobb, Mr Conquest, Mr Cunningham, Mr Drummond, Mr Duncan, Dr Harry  Fisher, Mr Gear, Mr Grace, Mr Steele Hall, Mr Hawke, Mr Hawker, Mr Hayden, Mr Hodges, Mr Holding, Mr Hollis, Mr Hunt, Mr Barry Jones, Mr Jull, Mr Katter, Mr Keating, Mrs Kelly, Mr Kent, Mr Keogh, Dr Klugman, Mr Lamb, Mr Langmore, Mr Lee, Mr Lindsay, Mr Lloyd, Mr MACKellar, Mr MCLeay, Mr    Scholes, Mr Scott, Mr Sharp, Mr Shipton, Mr Sinclair, Mr Snow, Mrs Sullivan, Mr West, Mr Wilson and Mr Young. Petitions received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows: Graduated family allowances are of important assistance to families with more than one child. PETITIONS All family allowances, whether for one, two, three or more children, have not kept pace with inflation. There are suggestions that all family allowances should be paid at the one flat rate. This would severely disadvantage families with more than one child. There are also suggestions that the dependent spouse rebate be reduced or removed. This would represent another blow to the family unit. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should ask the Federal Government to increase the value of existing family allowance payments, and reject any moves to change the payments to a flat rate or to tamper with the spouse rebate: And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bilney, Mr Brumby, Mr Ewen Cameron, Mr Hawker, Mr Howe, Mr Barry Jones, Mr  Reith and Mr Young. Petitions received. Family Allowances the House To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the closure of House of Representatives assembled. The petition of should be certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: expanded. That taxpayers with dependent children have been will ever gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of recognition provided in the taxation system for the costs of maintaining a family, in particular: the failure to index family allowances which has resulted in an erosion of more than 50% in their real value since May 1976; the abolition of family allowances for dependents who have turned 18, even those still at school; the abolition of concessional tax rebates for education and other expenses. That this erosion in horizontal tax equity has placed an intolerable financial burden on many larger families, particularly those on middle incomes who fail to qualify for means-tested benefits such as TEAS but whose living standards are now well below average due to heavy expenses on necessities such as education, housing, food and clothing. Your petitioners humbly pray that: family allowances be restored to the 1976 value (in real terms), and indexed according to the CPI; the dependent spouse rebate be retained; the Federal Government take urgent measures to restore equitable provisions in the taxation system through the introduction of family income splitting. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beale, Mr Conquest, Mr Drummond, Dr Klugman, Mr MCGauran, Mr Rocher and Mr Smith. Petitions received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That in the light of the Labor Government's proposal to bring about a reduction in the amount payable under the present Family Allowance Scheme, that the House of Representatives assembled oppose such a move, on the evidence of its impact not only on the family unit but on the families with multiple births. That any reduction in the spouse rebate would also affect these families drastically and that the House of Representatives assembled oppose any move to reduce the spouse rebate. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should immediately seek to restore family allowances to their former level if they are reduced and restore the spouse rebate should the Labor Government reduce this rebate. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr N. A. Brown. Petition received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Tasmania respectfully showeth: I. We are concerned by media statements that the Government intends to restructure the family allowance payment in a form that will reduce its assistance to families. 2. Remind the Government that the family allowance payment is not a Social Security payment as such but a replacement payment for a tax rebate once enjoyed by families for their responsibilities. 3. Whereas the tax rebate would be indexed to the CPI the present family allowance has lost real monetary value since 1976. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: (i) The family allowance payment be indexed to the CPI. (ii) That there be no adverse adjustments to family allowance payments in the 1986-87 Budget. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Burr. Petition received. Family Allowances The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned plead that the Parliament implement pro-family policies. In particular we appeal for: 1. the retention of the present graduated assessment system for payment of the Family Allowances; 2. indexation of the Family Allowances in order to keep pace with inflation; 3. an increase of 3.7% in the Family Allowance benefit to return it to 11.5% of the Average Award Wage (making it similar in value to the 11.5% of the Basic Wage when Child Endowment was first introduced by the Chifley Government in 1941). 4. retention of the Dependent Spouse Rebate and the amount of the Dependent Spouse Rebate adjusted so that it is equal in value to the tax-free threshold allowed when calculating taxable income. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beazley. Petition received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That families have been gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of their net disposable income through: Failure to index family allowances-resulting in a 50% loss in their real value since 1976 Abolition of family allowances for dependants who have turned l8-even those still at school Failure to increase the spouse rebate since 1982 Discriminatory taxation system-which penalises single income families. Recognising the cost benefit to taxpayers when the intact family unit itself delivers essential care to the extended family. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Government take immediate action to: Restore the lost value of family allowances and to index them to cover future price rises Introduce optional income-splitting for taxation purposes Retain the spouse rebate. by Mr Maher. Petition received. First International Earth Repair Year To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respecttions fully points out: That deterioration of the total global environment is continuing at an increasing rate; that important environmental resources vital to human livelihood such as trees, soil and water are decreasing at an alarming rate; that there is a need for educating all people to assume a greater responsibility for the conservation, sustainable use and maintenance of vital resources; that dynamic and active initiatives are needed to conserve and renew the total environment; and that protecting, conserving and repairing the Earth can unite all people and nations in co-operative action for survival; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will propose to the United Nations General Assembly at its 41st Session in September 1986 that 1988 be proclaime<\ the ""First International Earth Repair Year"".

In or about August 1985 the Commonwealth Department of Aviation established certain helicopter transit and access lanes for the Sydney Metropolitan area. 2.

The above mentioned lanes have been set by the Department of Aviation at an altitude of 500 feet between Ryde Bridge and Middle Head. 4. Your petitioners are concerned at the noise presently generated from and about the above mentioned lanes by the transit of helicopters and are concerned that over time the present noise levels will significantly worsen due to the inevitable increase in helicopter traffic along the above mentioned lanes.

Broadcasting and Television Act The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned, plead that Parliament becomes aware that the Public has no legal right to influence the setting of Standards for Television Programming, that we deplore the new Standards which come into force on 1st February, and that we call on Parliament to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, section 16 (2), so that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, when determining Television Standards, and screening hours, shall consult with the Australian people. because at present the Tribunal is compelled by law to consult only with television stations on these matters, because the new standards are a result of such consultation, and have already been implemented without public discussion, because the new Standards are ambiguous, and without definition, because the new Standards are composed of modifying terms which circumvent the proscriptions, because the media is only motivated by aspirations of pecuniary superiority, because, in contrast, the public is only motivated by their wish to exercise pastoral care over the nurturing home environment of their children, because we believe that the Standards wrongly ascribe extreme importance to ""the storyline"" of a film screened, because we believe that the Standards wrongly ascribe total unimportance to the effects of viewing, especially violent films, on the young, the impressionable, the immature, the unstable, or the socially disadvantaged, because we refuse to accept the media-imposed assessment of community standards, and because we wish to impart our demand to be consulted, our demand to have legal status in decision-making, and the right to counsel those whose decisions so deeply affect our homes. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter your earnest attention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beazley. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: I. The present Australian national flag is not distinctively and uniquely Australian and is confused with other national flags. 2. The people of Australia have never had an opportunity to express their views on an appropriate Australian national flag in a referendum. 3. The present Australian national flag does not properly represent Australia as a sovereign, independent nation. 4. The present Australian national flag falsely proclaims Australia as a colony, homeland, protectorate, dominion or government department of Great Britain. 5. The first condition in the flag competition of 190 I required that the design should show Australia's loyalty to the British Empire. The British Empire no longer exists. 6. A public opinion poll held in 1984 using the Gallup Method revealed that 52% of Australians surveyed wanted a competition for a new design for the Australian flag. 7. There is no inherent link between Australia proclaiming a unique and distinctive flag and the political issue of Australia moving to a republican form of government. 8. The adoption of a truly Australian national flag would serve as a focal point for Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: (a) Appoint a Committee of the Parliament with representatives from both Houses and all parties to invite and consider proposals for the design of a new Australian national flag, and (b) Require that Committee to make recommendations on the form of a minimum cost referendum at the time of the next general elections, in which the electors will be given the opportunity to vote for a flag from a selection of at least three designs which will include the present Australian national flag and the winner of the AusflagBulletin-2MMM.FM competition of March 1985. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Keating. Petition received.

Proposed Closure of Marsfield Post Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we strenuously object to the proposal that the Post Office at Marsfield be closed. The Post Office serves a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced by having to travel to another centre for our postal and banking requirements, or even to collected registered, certified letters and parcels. Many of us are pensioners and the cost of such travel would be an unnecessary imposition. The nearest Post Offices are about 2kms away with no convenient public transport. Also for those of us who work during the week, this is the only Post Office open on Saturday mornings where we can collect our parcels, do our mailing and other services it provides. We maintain that the purpose of Post Offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer, and that they should not be closed merely to save money or help Australia Post make a profit. Your petitioners therefore humble pray that the House should take all possible steps to prevent the closure of Marsfield Post Office.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we, the loyal citizens of Australia firmly express our strong opposition to any proposals to remove or undermine the importance of the place of God and/or the Queen in our national life, and democratic institutions. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament assembled reaffirm our nation's total dependence on God the Creator in accordance with our Australian Constitution, which commences with the words ""Humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God"", and the Standing Orders of both the Senate and the House of Representatives which prescribe that Parliament each day shall open with a special prayer to Almighty God and the Lord's Prayer.

What your petitioners therefore humbly pray; that the House take all possible steps to withdraw the introduction of the Tertiary Administration Fee.

(b) English-speaking population expansion and English-speaking mass media expansion threatens the survival of the remaining languages of Australia. (c) Aboriginal languages reflect an ethos that is truly Australian and unless steps are taken to implement language maintenance, this ethos will be lost not only to Aborigines but to non-Aboriginal Australians, and to the world. We humbly pray the Government to: I. Through the Prime Minister's Department, provide $300,000 per annum for a guaranteed period of ten years to enable the Aboriginal community of Australia to establish a co-ordinating body to implement steps to prevent the extinction of the remaining languages, and to introduce programmes which will enable these languages to continue into the future for the sake of all Australians. This body will enable us to maximize existing financial, material, and human resources, and is the least expensive way of implementing urgently needed maintenance programmes. 2. Through the Prime Minister's Department, provide finance for the establishment of Regional Language Centres-ten are urgently needed-cost $200,000 each. and we pray you may be conscious of God's sovereign purposes for our Nation.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Federal Division of Fisher respectfully showeth that: The Government's actions in changing levels of pharmaceutical benefits will adversely effect the infirm and elderly and that it will cause further unnecessary economic hardship and suffering among all people who are currently dependent on existing benefits.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. penalises small busi- by Mr Slipper. Petition received. Ayers Rock To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the electorate of Fisher respectfully showeth that: Whereas the present Government of the Commonwealth of Australia has purported to present the Title Deeds to Ayers Rock in Central Australia, in reality the joint property of the people of the Commonwealth to an Aboriginal Land Council on 26 October 1985, Whereas opinion polls and statements of representative groups, Members of Parliament and respected individuals show clearly that the Commonwealth Government had no mandate from the citizens of the Commonwealth to act in such a disgraceful manner, Whereas the present Government claims to be totally opposed to apartheid (separate development) in South Africa but purported to hand over Ayers Rock to an Aboriginal Council in support of a policy of apartheid (separate development) which has been shown to be detrimental to the Aboriginal people of Australia, Whereas it is pursuing this policy making it a crime for most white and many Aboriginals to enter, without permit, large areas of the Commonwealth designated apartheid (i.e., set aside for separate development), contrary to our democratic traditions and experience of freedom of movement for citizens of all racial origins within Australia, Whereas Australian citizens have no present means available to them to prevent this violation of their natural rights to unfettered common ownership of, and access to, a treasured natural asset. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Seek means available for the protection of the people's interests to reverse this outrage and preserve the democratic traditions of Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Slipper. Petition received. NA NA Report and Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Cohen: That the House take note of the papers. Motion (by Mr Barry Jones)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Goldstein speaking for a period not exceeding 17 minutes.",129
113,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I rise today for my 17 minutes to respond to reports tabled by the Minister for Communications (Mr Duffy) on the last day of sitting and will divide my time equally between the reports dealing with commercial radio and those dealing with commercial television. The report regarding commercial radio is comprehensive and might finally give a hint of progress to those entrepreneurs and consumers anxious to see established additional radio services in regional areas of Australia after years of frustrating delay and inaction. But, as the report itself suggests, the equalisation of regional television services is to receive priority, so it will be still some time before additional radio services become available. The lack of departmental resources, combined with the problems associated with band II clearance, will mean even further delays to the long-awaited expansion of radio service in the rural areas of Australia. I note that the radio report alludes to the need for an indicative plan that would provide a program for change and assist in the decision making process. Such a plan is long overdue and when completed should take away some of the ad hockery, uncertainty and false expectations which have plagued this Government's approach to broadcasting since it was elected in 1983. A coherent, detailed and well thought out framework, which presumably such a plan could provide, would go a long way towards putting the development of radio broadcasting in Australia on a more rational and predictable path. The study outlines various options for expanding regional commercial radio services. Reading between the lines, it would appear that option C, the so-called market groups approach, is the one favoured by the authors of the report. Approach C would involve the Minister and the Department of Communications categorising the regional radio markets into four groups: Firstly, markets where there is a prima facie case that a new competitor would be viable; secondly, markets where there is a doubt about the viability SERVICES of a new competitor; thirdly, markets where it is believed that a new competitor would not be viable; and, fourthly, markets that are so small that special measures may be needed. The report then suggests several ways in which the new or extra services could be brought to those markets. The options range from using the existing supplementary scheme, combined with the use of ministerial planning powers, to a fast-track option which would abolish the supplementary scheme and allow the rapid introduction of additional services. Of course, the advantage of that method, apart from a more speedy introduction of services, is that it would reduce the time and effort currently expended by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in what are sometimes unnecessary and costly licence hearings. The coalition would favour a more streamlined and less bureaucratic process in respect of the whole licensing system. We do, of course, favour the supplementary licence scheme. In the section on structural matters, the report raises the issue of ownership and control provisions with respect to radio. The Opposition parties are also in favour of a review of the current ownership provisions, particularly if changes are undertaken in the context of the public interest. At present, the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 restricts anyone owner to owning no more than eight radio stations, of which only four can be in anyone State. Moreover, there is a limit of four metropolitan stations throughout the country and a limit of only one metropolitan station in anyone State. The Tribunal observed: Compared with television, there is no significant concentration of ownership in commercial radio. I believe that the Government should seriously consider a loosening of the current ownership provisions as they apply to commercial radio. In the area of programming, the coalition is particularly concerned that new independent radio licensees may not provide a decent choice and range of programs; rather, they may concentrate on trying to compete with the existing licensee for the same market niche. The report refers to this type of programming as 'me-tooism'. In such cases a supplementary or additional permit-which is the Opposition's policy-granted to the existing operator has a distinct advantage. The additional programs can then be geared to the audience not currently catered for by the first commercial signal. That means that there is a genuine attempt at alternative programming. Given that the concentration of ownership does not appear to be a major issue in the radio field, the Government should give due consideration to the problem caused if there is 'me-tooism' in programming when new independent licences are issued. Additional quantities of programming may not necessarily lead to better quality in terms of what is available to listeners. In other words, if the existing station tries to cater for all the needs of the community and the new licence holder concentrates, for example, on rock music because the majority of people seem to prefer that sort of music, before we know it the existing licence holder will also turn to rock music and no other tastes will be catered for. A supplementary licence inevitably leads to a catering for other tastes because the one licence holder will not set up a station in direct competition with its own programs. Another crucial issue raised is that of commercial viability. We believe the notion of commercial viability needs a thorough overhaul. A Liberal-National Party government would look at loosening the viability criteria, as currently applied by the Broadcasting Tribunal, and allowing market forces a more prominent role in determining the viability or otherwise of a particular market. For too long, detailed and truncated arguments about viability have been allowed to delay proceedings before the Broadcasting Tribunal unnecessarily. With respect to the Forward Development Unit's earlier study on AM-FM conversion, I must observe that the three options presented to the Minister were totally unenlightening. With specific reference to the question of converting existing commercial AM services to the FM band, the report suggested three options: Firstly, allowing all commercial stations to convert; secondly, allowing regional commercial stations in competition with an FM station to convert; and, thirdly, allowing no conversion. The Minister made a brief reference to these alternatives when he commented on the latest radio report, but nothing new was presented. I would have thought that these three options were obvious, without there needing to be a detailed study, and I believe it is an issue which the Government should seriously consider. It should seriously consider allowing AM stations to convert to FM if spectrum space permits, and of course, in regional Australia it should. It rests on the available resources of the Department to allow the necessary planning and implementation of such a move. Many people in the private sector with consortiums ready to invest and provide services to rural Australia are now debarred from doing so by the policies of the Government and the obstructions that are placed in their way. We can see no obvious reason why those AM stations which wish to convert to an FM frequency should not be able to do so if technical circumstances permit. Of course, it is not only commercial radio operators that desire access to FM frequencies. We must remember that the needs of the national and public broadcasters must also be considered when planning is undertaken with respect to the use of spectrum space. In summary, it can be said that these three long overdue reports have raised a series of significant issues relating to broadcasting in Australia. The decisions made in the next few months and years that will arise as a result of these three reports and associated community discussions will have a momentous impact on the broadcasting industry for decades. It is crucial that the Government get it right and it is imperative that all interested parties and the public take the opportunity to comment on these reports to ensure that decisions are taken on behalf of all Australians. I must say that decisions taken to date in respect of regional commercial television do not fill one with hope in that regard. In the balance of my contribution I will refer to regional commercial television and I will amplify these remarks when I speak during the Budget debate tomorrow. The Minister, in the statement to which I am now replying, said: 'Equalisation is well within our reach'. I wonder what he meant by that. What is equalisation? Is it the same number of services in each region? The Government's early propaganda led us to expect that that would be so, but it is now clear from the Minister's statement that will not be so. Tasmania, we are told, will be a special case, and so will South Australia. There are to be two services in Tasmania, but in regional South Australia there will be one service. The result of these policies is that Mildura, a small centre, will have three services. Hobart, a State capital city, will have two services. Regional South Australia, such as Mount Gambier, Port Pirie and Loxton, will have one service. That is a very strange way of achieving equalisation. Nevertheless, the Minister assures us that it is well within our reach. What is within our reach? The answer must surely be the aggregation of viewing areas, regardless of the effect that has on the production of local programs, the lack of genuine community of interest between the areas to be aggregated together, local advertising revenue and local employment. Mr Cowan-The Minister has not considered those aspects.",150
114,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Not only has the Minister not considered any of those aspects; he has not consulted anyone who has. He has not consulted local communities, nor has he seriously consulted licence holders. At no time were the licence holders consulted by the Government about the most fatal flaw in the entire proposition, which is the so-called one-in, all-in aggregation. ",152
115,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"He did not discuss it with them and the Department did not discuss it with them. The important point is that the policy adopted by the Government now will bring about an aggregation of viewing areas, regardless of the adverse effect that will have on all aspects of local production, employment and advertising. At the moment a delegation of staff-not management, staff-is visiting Parliament House from Channel 8, which covers Bendigo and Traralgon in Victoria. It is here to register its opposition to the Government's policy. Members of the delegation know that their jobs are at stake. Because they are here I might as well give an illustration of the way in which the policy of the Government will work, to show what a nonsense it really is. In regional Victoria services provided by Channel 8 operating from Bendigo cover Gippsland through a Traralgon station which formerly had a licence on its own but proved to be too small. The service operating from Ballarat covers a good deal of western Victoria and there is a very small station at Mildura confined just to its own area. The Bendigo and Ballarat stations are both financially able and extremely willing to provide a supplementary licence, to provide the genuine alternative program to which I have just referred in respect of radio so that people can see a second commercial service alongside that of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service. Both organisations are willing to do that. All the Minister has to do is say that he will grant them a supplementary licence. Each of them, by that supplementary licence, would provide a greater viewer choice than is now possible under the Government's policy or, of course, is possible under the Government's refusal to provide a supplementary licence. Mr Jull-And more jobs.",152
116,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"It does mean more jobs. More people will be employed locally and there will be more advertising because there will be alternative programs. Let us look at this matter. Under the proposition now adopted by the Government there will be competition for the major audiences if there are two or three licence holders in the area. There will be a duplication of programming which means that no alternative programs will be provided. Equalisation should be seen in terms of diversity of programming; it should not be seen just in the number of services. The Government wants to aggregate the areas now covered by Bendigo, Ballarat and Mildura. The result of that will be that those three stations will need to set up facilities in the areas now covered by the other two and to set up expensive equipment for the insertion of local advertisements, local news, and. the coverage of sporting and other activities. Obviously the cost of producing those will be greater than if only one area is being covered, and the cost of installing the equipment is estimated to be about $20m a year. What will the stations get for that? They will lose their existing market and have a great problem in trying to split three ways the other two markets. In effect, there will be a loss of local production. The day after the Minister made his announcement about localism, Mildura announced that it would seek to trigger off an immediate aggregation of those areas. Mildura could easily be sold by its existing licence holder to someone else who would immediately take the network programs from Sydney or Melbourne with national advertising only and no local programs. The service would cover Bendigo and Ballarat, meaning a greatly expanded market for Mildura. In that way localism could immediately be wiped out because the other two stations, quite simply, could not afford to provide it. Why run local programs and local advertisements at substantial cost when one's competitor is making a profit by networking from Sydney or Melbourne? That is the logical consequence of this measure. One regional television executive recently said: 'What responsible business manager could be expected to leap at the chance to invest $20m in order to lose up to 50 per cent of the audience and slash profits?'. To prove the point in respect of Bendigo, I remind the House that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), a Labor Party member, a member of the Government, said the following on 26 August: At a time when the Government is taking the necessary tough decisions in relation to our Balance of Payments position, it would be irresponsible to encourage the importation of an additional $400m or more of overseas capital equipment. That is what is involved in this policy. Even if one does not agree that the Government is taking the necessary tough decisions, it is guaranteeing that we will import another $400m worth of overseas equipment while we are on a buy Australian campaign.  the Minister.",152
117,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,The honourable member for Bendigo then stated: The vast majority of regional broadcasters provide first rate service-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs DarIing)-Order! I ask the honourable member for Kooyong to withdraw the comment he just made. ,153
118,Mr MACPHEE,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"The honourable-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. LOANS BILL 1986 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 August, on motion by Mr Hurford: That the Bill be now read a second time.",153
119,Mr CARLTON,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"The Loans Bill 1986 is a machinery of government type of Bill. Basically it occurs because we are not allowed to overdraw the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Government and therefore defence and certain other expenditures that would be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund have to be charged to the Loan Fund, which is another fund of the Government, or there has to be an arrangement to reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund from the Loan Fund. The purpose of this Bill is to allow the Government to meet certain defence and other expenditures from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is all perfectly unexceptionable. The Opposition has no quarrel with that or with the particular sums to be taken out of the Loan Fund. However, in passing I point out that the extent of the moneys that have to be borrowed is governed by the Budget deficit of $3.5 billion. We could draw attention to the excessive borrowing program of this Government. However, I will leave that matter to a later hour this day when I will speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. I). There is a trick to this Bill which was raised by the Government last year. The Senate in its wisdom decided to amend it and on that occasion the Government accepted the amendment. Let me explain to the House exactly what that means. The Loans Bill comes into the House on an annual basis. Last year, for the first time, the Government tried to amend the Bill to provide for a standing Act. In other words it would no longer be necessary to introduce a new Loan Bill each year to provide for the borrowing requirements of the Government from the Loan Fund. I have to confess that the Opposition in this House let the matter slip. We did not object to a the Bill in this House. However, the House of review, very sensibly, had a closer look at it because it was not acting under the very fast time program that we have to act under here. The Senate decided, certainly with the support of the Opposition as a whole, that the Bill should be amended to retain the form of an annual loan Bill, not a standing Act of the Parliament. We had the support of the Australian Democrats and independent senators in that matter and those amendments were accepted by the Senate. When they came back to the House of Representatives the Government was not exactly gracious in accepting the amendments but at least it did accept them and that was that. I want to make it quite clear in giving the Opposition's view on this Bill that we have no intention whatsoever of delaying it. Some people get nervous about this matter because the same Bill was delayed in 1975. I want to make it quite clear that we have no intention whatsoever of proceeding along the lines that certain people did in 1975, so let there be no spectres of that kind. All we are concerned about is that this Bill should be an annual Bill so that if there are any controversial matters relating to it or any matters we want to raise in the Parliament we will have every opportunity of doing so and it will not merely be a question of the Government relying on standing legislation. This means that we will ask that a committee of the whole House examine the Bill and we will move amendments to bring it back to being an annual Bill.",153
120,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Stirling) (5.30)I have listened to the comments by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and note his comments about the Loans Bill being an annual Bill as distinct from a standing Bill. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) in his second reading speech discussed that matter. I take up a point raised by the honourable member for Mackellar at the outset of his discussion; that is, the role of the Loans Bill in funding the Budget deficit. This debate provides a good opportunity in this place to strike a contrast. Earlier today we had some debate about economic strategy. This debate provides a good opportunity to strike a contrast in terms of economic strategy because essentially it comes down to the deficit. The honourable member for Mackellar mentioned the $3.5 billion deficit. It is a source of some satisfaction to us on this side of the House that we have been able to achieve a $3.5 billion deficit. This deficit contrasts with the $9.6 billion projected deficit that was the legacy of the then outgoing Treasurer, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I emphasise that contrast in terms of the funding restraints and pressures on government. The community at large recognises that this Government had to address a very serious issue. In the face of declining commodity prices it was very important that we brought in a deficit that would minimise impact on financial markets. It is in that light that we ought to address the broad economic issues. It is important in this place to try to provide that focus. In going around my electorate I have found that the emphasis now in the community is that we are in difficult times and there is a need for some very serious economic decisions to be made. There is a recognition that those decisions are being made by this Government. This debate provides the opportunity, as do other debateswe had the matter of public importance debate earlier today and the Budget debate will be resumed later today-to show the community that all the decisions we are making head in a particular direction and fit within a framework. That framework is to recognise, on the one hand, that there has been a massive decline in commodity prices and, on the other hand, that the decline in commodity prices is being reflected in the balance of trade, the value of the dollar and interest rates. So there is a relationship between all those factors. Domestically, there is also a recognition that we need to take account of those factors in terms of the Government's fund raising efforts. I note that there will be no bond raisings as a result of this Budget. Further, there is the need to address wages policy. So when we are talking about something like the Loans Bill as it applies to the funding of a prospective Budget deficit, it is important that we take a moment in this House to show that a clear strategy is being developed by this Government and that that strategy takes account of the present difficult times. Let me sketch briefly the very difficult issue we have to address-a decline in world commodity prices. It is well understood in the community that that decline would have occurred irrespective of which party was in government. Had the Opposition been in government, the same issue would have had to be faced-that is, a massive decline in commodity prices. It is important to recognise that in framing debates in this place. Between 1981-82 and 1985-86 there was a 28 per cent decline in coal prices. Another major commodity that has attracted a lot of attention in recent times is wheat. There was a 27 per cent decline in wheat prices between 1980-81 and 1985-86-a very large decline. There was a 22 per cent decline in wool prices in the same time-frame. Iron ore prices, which are very relevant to my State of Western Australia, suffered a 26 per cent decline. There was a decline in aluminium prices-Western Australia being a producer of bauxite-of 28 per cent from 198384 to 1985-86. So we are talking about a very short time-frame and a very substantial decline in commodity prices. There was a 24 per cent decline in beef prices. In respect of sugar, which is a very important industry, particularly in respect of your State of Queensland, Madam Deputy Speaker, there was a 68 per cent decline in prices. That has had a major impact on the economy. Might I add that this Government has moved to address that problem with respect to Queensland. The only difficulty we have had has been in getting the Queensland Government to recognise its responsibilities in that respect. Barley is very important to my State of Western Australia. There has been a 48 per cent decline in the price of bulk feed barley. I interpose here that there has been some good news recently with r-spect to malting barley. The European barley crop has not quite come in as expected and it is likely that Australian malting barley will be able to be sold in the European market at reasonably good prices. So in all of these areas there are windows of opportunity for us as a government. There was a major downturn in oil prices, of which everyone is conscious, between 1981 and 1986. I will now talk about London Metals Exchange prices because they are quite significant. There was a downturn of 62 per cent in the price of silver between February 1983 and August 1986. There was a 39.3 per cent decrease in the London Metals Exchange price of lead between December 1981 and August 1986. There was a IS per cent decline in the price of zinc between January 1984 and August 1986. So there has been a considerable decline in a very short period. Between January 1984 and August 1986 the London Metals Exchange nickel price-again, Western Australia is a miner of nickel-fell by 20.1 per cent. All those commodity prices are significant in terms of Australia's trade. We have seen a decline in most commodity prices and we have had to react to it. I mentioned just a moment ago windows of opportunity. This Budget strategy has been to set out a platform for the economy to operate on. That platform has been designed to reduce Budget outlays, to reduce the deficit and to reduce the impact on the money market, thereby setting the scene so that, if there is an upturn in commodity prices and a downturn in interest rates, we will be in a position to move ahead in terms of economic recovery. It is crucial that we have set in place an important strategy. To draw a contrast-clearly that is the function of this sort of debate-what we are talking about is setting in place policies ranging from fiscal policy, which is mainly focused upon the Budget, to monetary policy. Monetary policy has been a matter of concern to us, because we were adjusting monetary policy earlier this year to do something about the value of the dollar and interest rates adjusting capital inflow. What we are seeking in our trade policy is an expansion of the volume of exports and import replacement production. We are doing that because the floating of the Australian dollar has given us the capacity to pursue those lines. In regard to exchange rate policy, the floating of the Australian dollar has meant some important structural changes, but these changes were very necessary for the Australian economy because we were living in an artificial world for far too long. The floating of the Australian dollar has meant that we have now begun to recognise where Australia is placed internationally. Finally, no policy on this side of the chamber contrasts more strongly with that of the Opposition side than does our wages policy. We have a wages policy which fits within the framework of the prices and incomes accord and which, in sum, represents, if you like, a social wage approach to wages policy. We have a policy, but the Opposition does not have a clearly defined policy. The Opposition has a series of propositions and options which it might pursue, but it does not have a cohesive wages policy. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Darling)- Order! The honourable member is getting a little wide of the debate.",153
121,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I was trying to set the framework in which to focus on the Budget deficit. When we put our policies in place, aiming for a deficit of $3.5 billion, we were able to demonstrate to the Australian community that we had policies. The context of this Bill, which seeks to fund a deficit of $3.5 billion, is that this Government has been outstandingly successful in the most difficult of times, recognising what basically is a $6 billion loss in income. To be able to turn around and place a Bill in this context, I believe, is quite an achievement. It is an achievement in another sense, which I think is an important function of this chamber, in that we are able to communicate to the community precisely what we are trying to do. There is a recognition in the Australian community that the strategy that is being pursued is a cohesive strategy; that is, it is a strategy designed to make some tough decisions. They are decisions that I think many would prefer not to have to make, but they are tough decisions and they are decisions that are understood by the community as being responsible decisions as part of that strategy. In the context of this debate on the Loans Bill, the crucial thing we are aiming at is to say that we have an economic strategy and that that economic strategy is being well thought through and is designed to deal with the conditions which we face. I will make just a couple of remarks in closing. There has been some considerable discussion in the financial Press and in the political arena recently about the assessment of Australia in terms of our deficit strategy and the AAI assessment by Moody's Investor Services. What I think has to be emphasised in the context of this Government's economic management is that those overseas who are making assessments of how we are performing are saying that, yes, this Government is taking account of the difficult economic circumstances that face it and that it is not retreating from those objectives or from the very difficult evidence confronting it of those declining commodity prices that I referred to. This Government is addressing those issues and it is doing so responsibly. What comes out of the Moody's assessment and what comes out of the comments by other financiers on the international stage is that the Australian Government is providing the necessary ingredients for an economic recovery-an economic recovery based on making tough decisions and putting in place a policy framework. The centrepiece of that policy framework, in terms of the Budget, has been the $3.5 billion deficit. I think we can contrast this role and approach to economic management by the Government with what is being provided opposite. There has not been up to this stage the degree of rigour and analysis that is required in the context of these difficult economic times. I say that because I think we are subject now to more scrutiny in the Australian community and in the international community than we ever have been. That is not a bad thing if as a government we are up to doing the job, but it is a difficult thing if one is not up to doing the job. I am very confident that we as a government can put the necessary mechanisms in place and I think the Budget strategy shows that we are doing that. In closing, in the context of this Loans Bill I say that this Government has said to the Australian community: We are about making difficult decisions, we are making those difficult decisions, which range through the policies I referred to earlier, and overall they provide a recognition that we can, if we are serious enough about it,set the framework for economic recovery, particularly into 1987. There is already evidence that the international community has recognised that the Australian dollar has been undervalued, that it is now improving in value, that interest rates are starting to come down and that the international financial community has a renewed confidence in the Australian community. And why not, because what we have in Australia is a community that is capable of great vigour, great achievement and great performance. We have shown it in the past and I am quite confident that we can do it in the future. What is required and what is being offered in this place is economic leadership. I ask the Australian community to pause for one moment and to think in terms of the quality of leadership that is being provided in economic managemerit here. If the community looks at that quality of economic leadership, it sees that it is there. One can identify the components of a necessary economic policy. I do not think it does the Opposition a great deal of credit in terms of contrasting its policies with those of the Government. We are quite confident on this side. I think the economic leadership is there, I think the platform for economic recovery is there and I believe that there are many reasons why we in the Australian community should be confident of the future.",155
122,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"At about this time last year the Government sought to stray from what had been the practice of successive governments. In its Loans Bill 1985 this Government wanted for itself the power to borrow money, under that particular instrument, not for purposes arising out of its taxing and spending for and confined to the year 1985-86, but for evermore. It seems that every day in this place we see the Government moving to take more and more out of the realm of the Parliament and vest it in the Executive, and I suppose we should not be surprised. The fact that the Senate wisely rejected the ploy last year certainly has not deterred the Government from trying on the same thing again this year. It is bad enough that successive governments have adopted a similar device each year for the sole purpose of avoiding the need to refer their proposed borrowings to the Loan Council for approval. At least the enabling legislation in the past had the virtue that it had to come before this Parliament each and every year. The present Government does not want to be under any such constraint. First, as its predecessors wanted and achieved, it wants to avoid the constitutional limitations on borrowings. Secondly, and more importantly than that, it wants to be able to do this very thing for evermore and a day. As to the first element, the Government avoids constitutional constraints by pretending, in the Minister's second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum, that these borrowings will be raised for spending for defence purposes only. That is plainly a ploy. That might seem like a good enough trick because the government of the day can get around the Constitution in that way and because it has become accepted practice and, therefore, precedents can be claimed. The second element is far more important for a number of reasons. What is being sought in this Bill is, in effect, an open-ended cheque. While it is nominally a Loans Bill, in reality it is a loans and appropriation Bill. An esteemed colleague of mine who has retired to the Ministry in the Tasmanian Parliament, former Senator Peter Rae, said in the other place last year that it is more like a Khemlani affair avoidance Bill. But more than that, it is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and it is contrary to the spirit of parliamentary representation in that it effectively prevents us from debating the merits of a particular measure brought down each year and entitled the Loans Bill for that particular financial year. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) introduced into the debate a few factors which I must say are relevant because they all have an effect and influence on the Government's need to borrow this money. He alluded to interest rates. It is interesting to that the estimates of interest rates for various Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as at 30 June read something like this: In Australia the rate was 8.4 per cent; in Japan it was 0.5 per cent; in the United States of America it was 1.7 per cent; in West Germany it was a creditable -0.2 per cent; in France it was 2.3 per cent; Italy was pushing us hard at 6.3 per cent; in the United Kingdom it was 2.5 per cent; and in Canada it was 3.7 per cent. The average inflation rate last year for OECD countries was 2.6 per cent. Looking at it another way, the average for major OECD trading partners was 2 per cent. Australia's inflation rate, as can be readily seen from those figures, is more than triple the OECD average, more than four times that of our major trading partners, almost five times that of the United States of America and a disastrous more than 16 times that of Japan, our major trading partner. They are factors which will influence the consequences which arise from this legislation, which merely gives the Government the means by which it will borrow to offset its budgeted deficit. Those inflation rates will come into play, just as they affect the value of our dollar and affect our ability to roll over existing loans and to take out new ones. The honourable member for Stirling also introduced the matter of our trade policy. He omitted to mention that our balance of payments is a disaster area, it having deteriorated significantly in the past two years. In 1985-86 the current account deficit blew out to a record dollar level of $13.7 billion, or more than 5.9 per cent of gross domestic product. That blow out of almost $14 billion in 1985-86 compares with the Budget forecast for that year of only $10.7 billion. When we talk about the Loans Bill and how much we must borrow to make up the deficit naturally we are suspicious because last year the Government was out by $3 billion or $4 billion. That does not give us any confidence in the Government's projections this year. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will understand why I say that. The current account deficit exceeded $1 billion in nine of the 12 months of last financial year.",156
123,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,Shame!,157
124,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"It is shameful. Prior to the Hawke Government the monthly current account deficit in this country had never exceeded $1 billion, yet it exceeded that figure nine timesin nine months out of 12-last financial year. note The current account deficit had almost doubled from $7.3 billion in 1983-84, the first full year of the Hawke Government. The OECD has forecast that in 1986 our current account deficit as a percentage of GOP will be the largest in the OECD area. On top of that, Australia's foreign debt is at alarming levels. It totalled around $35 billion when the Hawke Government took office in 1983. The latest official figure-for December 1985-puts that figure at $75 billion. In this year's Budget Papers, the Treasury estimated that our foreign debt had reached $86 billion by June 1986. The Reserve Bank of Australia in its latest annual report put that figure at $88 billion, but who will quibble about a couple of billion dollars under this profligate Government? These latest figures also support the confidential Treasury forecasts, which were reported in the Australian newspaper a month or so ago, of our foreign debt reaching about $85 billion by June 1986 and a staggering $100 billion by June 1987-less than 12 months away. On this basis our foreign debt will have increased by $65 billion during the four years of the Hawke Government. A $100 billion foreign debt represents something like 35 to 40 per cent of GOP and will generate an annual interest bill of, I guess, at least $9 billion or 3.5 per cent of GOP. I see some young people in the gallery. This is the sort of legacy, girls and boys, that you will be left under this Government because by the time you are taxpayers you will have to pay it back. I have to apologise to you for that. This is considerably more than the Government spends on health, education or defence each year.  ourable member should address his remarks to the Chair, rather than to the gallery.  Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs DarIing)-That is not a point of order, but I ask the honourable member for Curtin to be more relevant to the Bill before the House. That is the same caution that I had to give to the previous member who spoke.",157
125,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,I appreciate that. My reason for straying into that area was that the honourable member for Stirling also transgressed. Of course I shall get back to the Bill. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is a correct point of order that the honourable member address his comments through the Chair.,157
126,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I would not like to leave the accusations and allegations by the honourable member for Stirling unanswered, he having made them before you drew the matter to his attention, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I have already indicated, this has great implications for our borrowings in that the value of the Australia dollar has plummetted under this Government. Last year's Budget forecast was for an average exchange rate of 68 on the trade weighted index for last financial year. However, the TWI did not reach that level on anyone day, let alone average it through the year. There are many things that I might have said. We are under constraints of time once again. It seems that with this expanded Parliament it is no longer fashionable to allow speakers the full speaking time allowed under Standing Orders. I know that the Whips make special arrangements. I will abide by them in the spirit of those co-operative arrangements.",158
127,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,It is a pity in your case. This is an excellent speech.,158
128,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I thank the honourable member for Denison. We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill was drafted as standing rather than anmal legislation. That is the point on which we stick. My colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) has made it quite clear that we will move an amendment to this Bill. Its successors will be considered with the support of the Senate, if not with the support of the Government, each year as they should. We do not subscribe to even more power being delegated to the Executive at the expense of the contributions which can be made by the elected representatives of this country. I will support that amendment when it is moved.",158
129,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Australia today owes the world $88 billion. By June next year Australia will owe the world $100 billion. In short, before we become 200 years of age we will be indebted nationally in the staggering amount of $100 billion. This derelict, incompetent, bunch of economic vandals known as the Hawke socialist Government is borrowing Australia into bankruptcy. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I point out to the honourable member for Denison that I called two previous honourable members to order on irrelevance. I suggest that the honourable member at least commence his comments by being relevant and pertinent.",158
130,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Yes, I will, Madam Deputy Speaker. This legislation will make it easier for the Government to borrow more without the overview of the Parliament and in breach of the spirit of the Constitution. Madam Deputy Speaker, do you see what that is like? It is like putting a vampire in charge of a blood bank. That is the point that I am making. This derelict, incompetent bunch of economic vandals, which has already borrowed this nation into bankruptcy, in this legislation is seeking to bypass the annual scrutiny of the Parliament and rape the Constitution. The explanation by the Minister who introduced the Loans Bill, the Minister for Jeremy Cordeaux, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) who represents the Minister for Finance and is in the House is a sham and a ploy. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Again, according to Standing Orders I ask the honourable member for Denison to address the Minister by his correct title.",158
131,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. He said in this incredible document read in the chamber that this Bill is simply a machinery financing measure. I will speak at some length on those words to demonstrate that they are a sham and a ploy. This is not a machinery financing measure. This is a very skilfully prepared piece of legislation to enable this Government to get this country more into hock without being overviewed by the Parliament, by the House of Representatives and the Senate. This legislation is Khemlani mark 2, Iraqi breakfast, Nugan Hand and Australian Council of Trade Unions-Bourke's store rolled into one. It is the most derelict, disgraceful piece of legislation. It is very much to the credit of our colleagues in the Senate that they realised what had occurred. I am delighted that the shadow Treasurer, who spoke so eloquently on this Bill earlier this evening, will move amendments which will be put to the Parliament and which will demand-·1 repeat demand-that we know from this day on until the end of this shabby Hawke socialist Government every dollar and cent it borrows in the name of Australia and the rope it is putting around the necks of unborn Australians. You will be staggered to know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that during the term of office of the Hawke socialist Government Australia's overseas debt has trebled. Your home budget, Madam Deputy Speaker, has not trebled in that period, and certainly your home borrowings will not have done so. So why do we stand by and let the Government, which makes Mr Whitlam and Dr Cairns look like a couple of choirboys at a Sunday school picnic, borrow us into bankruptcy? Every little child born in Australia comes into the world with a national debt of $4,820 around his or her tiny neck. If the Government is not held in check, by the time it is thrown from office at the next Federal election that figure will have passed the $5,000 mark. The Government has borrowed excessively and has proved that it is not a good credit risk. an insult to the people of Australia that the Government has destroyed the credit rating which came in in the aftermath of the MCMahon years during the term of the Whitlam Government. The credit rating of AAA, the highest in the world, has been taken from us because of the Government's incompetence and economic mismanagement. I have said it before and I shall say it again: If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were accountants they would now be in gaol for what they have done to the Australian economy. We have lost our AAA rating. I heard an Opposition member try to fob that aside as though it mattered not a bit, but the enterprising and extremely persuasive honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) knocked that one on the head. The loss of the rating means that from this day onwards every loan that is arranged from Australia, when we borrow overseas, will be increased by 0.3 per cent as a minimum and in some cases the increase will be 0.5 per cent. What will this mean to our borrowings, which will be $20 billion in the next financial year? can be said conservatively that as a result of the incompetence of this disgraceful and discredited Government everybody in Australia will collectively be paying between $70m and $ 100m in additional interest. The problem will not rest solely with the Federal Government. It will go down through the State governments, to local government and statutory authorities, to Mr and Mrs Australia, who will be paying more and more because of the incompetence of the persons who are currently in charge of our economy. We do not own Australia and we do not own the economy. We are trustees. It is our responsibility to pass Australia's economy on to our sons and daughters in better shape than when we received it. I welcome with relish the impending arrival of a Liberal-National Party government that will get this country back on to the economic rails. I am certain that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), and those who work with him know what has to be done and will have the courage to do it. I have said before and I say again that we are at greater risk in 1986 than we were in 1975. It will take a decade to clean up the economic mess which has been inflicted on the people of Australia by the Hawke socialist Government. I for one do not cringe at the possibility of utilising the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution whenever and wherever they become What available. The founding fathers expected that one day, though they hoped it would not happen, the country would find itself in the hands of a government so bad that it would have to be forced out of office. That is why they gave the Senate greater powers than any other upper House in any other Western parliamentary democracy. How are these comments relevant to the Bill? They are relevant because it was the Senate which drew the attention of the people to the sneaky and discreditable piece of legislation that is before us and its implications. If this had sneaked through, those opposite, whom I would not trust with my son's piggy bank, could have borrowed, borrowed and borrowed without coming back here for annual parliamentary approval. To say that the Bill is a simple machinery financing measure is wrong, and that second reading speech is not worth the paper on which it was typed. Who are the big borrowers in the Hawke socialist Government? Leading them. I advised the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand) that he would get a special mention-is It the Socialist Left. I am pleased to give an illustration of how incompetent it is financially. If it cannot handle the financial affairs of the Carlton North Branch of the Australian Labor Party, whose minutes of the meeting of Tuesday, 5 August, have fortuitously come into my hands, how could it handle the finances of Australia? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I must ask the honourable member for Denison to come closer to the Bill before the House. I have given him plenty of leeway.",158
132,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"What I am going to do, Madam Deputy Speaker-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman is going to become more relevant.",159
133,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I shall obey you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I always obey you. No one on this side of the House gives you greater respect than I do. I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker: If a microcosm of the Hawke socialist Government-the Socialist Left, led by a potential Prime Minister, the honourable member for Melbourne-cannot organise the finances of the Carlton North Branch of the ALP, if it cannot tot up the petty cash and make it come out, how can the Hawke socialist Government be entrusted with the vital and fundamental role of safeguarding the nation's economy? The best thing about the Carlton North Branch of the ALP-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to discontinue his irrelevant line of thought. Please come back to the Bill.",159
134,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I shall conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have one minute left. I shall deal with the Carlton North Branch of the ALP on the adjournment. The Socialist Left is financially incompetent and it hates the Prime Minister's guts. It is clear also that it cannot spell. It does not even think that you are a speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, because it said that for the meeting of 2 September it did not have a speaker. It said that you were going to come along at a quarter to nine. I shall have something more to say about that later. I just want to thank the honourable member for Melbourne for coming into the chamber. I intend to bring to the Parliament plenty of news about the powerful Carlton North Branch of the ALP, but I shall do that on another occasion. The amendments to be moved by the shadow Treasurer deserve the support of every rational thinking and caring member of the House. I even appeal to the few remnants of sanity that I can just see dimly among the ranks of the Hawke socialist Government to join us and support the amendments. This is bad legislation and it deserves to be thrown out neck and crop. The Senate deserves to be supported totally. The more I read the Bill the more I see the ghosts of Khemlani, the Iraqi breakfast, Nugan Hand, and ACTU-Bourke's. These ghosts float before us as testimony of a government which has borrowed the nation into bankruptcy. The sooner this bunch of economic vandals is thrown from office, with the Prime Minister being dragged screaming from the Lodge, the better for Australia.",160
135,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"in reply-In closing the second reading debate I thank the four members who took part in it, but in a couple of cases I cannot thank them for the contributions they made. I must say to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) that the only thing that can be said about his speech is that it was in keeping with the total irresponsibility of his speeches normally. It is a disgrace. He has no credibility even on his own side of the House, let alone this side. The honourable member for Denison may joke and want to be hail fellow well met with Government members, but that will not make up for the fact that his rhetoric is empty. What is more, it is rudeness that he uses most of the time to get in his cheap jokes. The honourable gentleman's main theme was that the Loans Bill is not a machinery measure, and he attacked my second reading speech. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who led for the Opposition, had the decency and credibility to accept that this is a machinery measure. I know that when we discuss the Bill in Committee he will present his reasons for moving certain amendments. I do not think that they will be very good ones, but at least he accepts that this is a machinery measure. The honourable member for Curtin also made a couple of points on this Bill that need response. One of the things he said was that the Bill allows government to know more and more and avoid the need of coming up before the Parliament with the answers. He said that the Government wants to avoid the constitutional limits on borrowing for ever and a day. 'Seeking an open-ended cheque' was another remark we heard from the honourable member. Another comment was that the Bill is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and parliamentary representation and avoids annual debate on loan measures. Unfortunately, I was not able to be in the House at the time. ",160
136,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Yes, I am getting plenty of invitations, I will be pleased to tell the honourable member. ",160
137,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"Even the honourable member's wife invites me and I am always very glad when she does. It is pleasant to talk to her. I understand that she is very pleased to have me, and we will do it from time to time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I ask honourable members on both sides of the House, including the Minister, to come back to the point of the Bill at hand.",160
138,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I thank you for your advice, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am very pleased to have a little repartee with these gentlemen because they realise that they will be laughing on the other side of their faces after this whole episode is over. Let us look at the assertions by the honourable member for Curtin. I will not even bother to answer the nonsense from the honourable member for Denison because he really is getting more incredible every day. He cannot even get support from his own side, so why should we on this side take the time to answer him? All assertions such as those made by the honourable member for Curtin are wrong, as a reading of the Bill and its associated explanatory memorandum clearly demonstrates. Let us go over the facts. The Loans Bill would have no effect if Parliament did not appropriate moneys for specific purposes. I wonder whether the honourable member for Denison has just thought about those words. He suggested that this Loans Bill itself gives an opportunity to borrow. That is nonsense. It does not. It is a machinery matter and we have to have the appropriation first. We will have appropriation year after year in order to ensure that this machinery is used. It merely enables the charging to the Loan Fund of moneys appropriated by Parliament from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As I have said earlier and I will say again, Bill is a machinery financing measure. The provisions of the Bill prohibit borrowings for expenditures additional to those authorised by the Parliament. The Bill will not detract from the Parliament's ability to debate the Budget or the associated deficit financing measures. The deficit and borrowing requirement are announced in the Budget Speech and in the Budget Papers. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Mackellar in his speech on the Budget later tonight will be addressing these subjects. He does not need the Loans Bill, and nor does anybody else, to debate these particular subjects this year, year or in the future. The attitude of the Opposition displays its belief that it will stay in opposition forever. It does not need this measure as an excuse to bring up certain matters. It does not need it at all. It has other Budget Bills in order to bring up these subjects. If it were really working in the interests of this Parliament and this country it would make sure that this was a standing measure so that we did not have to take the time of the Parliament year after year on this sort of matter, this mere machinery measure, or have to listen to the incredible nonsense of the honourable member for Denison. That sort of nonsense should not be allowed to take up the time of this House. There are specific safeguards in this Bill as it is written. The Treasurer may borrow moneys only in accordance with other Acts authorising the issue of Australian Government securities. The annual appropriations of the Parliament set the limit on borrowings for defence purposes in any financial year. Appropriations of Parliament and the limit on borrowing authorities set by the Loan Council set an overall limit to borrowings which might be made pursuant to the Bill. The Loan Council borrowing limit is established pursuant to the terms of the financial agreements between the Commonwealth and the States and the Financial Agreement Acts. No member of Loan Council may borrow outside the approval limit set by Loan Council without further express approval of that body. That merely is pointing out in other words what I have said already, that this is a machinery measure. Another line of nonsense has come not from the person leading for the Government but from the two back benchers who peddle their line of Bills stupidity in this debate. Mr Rocber-Oh, come on!",160
139,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,I will accept the word of the honourable member for Curtin who was the much more rational than was the honourable member for Denison.,161
140,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I raise a point of order. I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to clarify the position. The Minister is attacking two back bench members of the Government. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order.",161
141,Mr HODGMAN,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,Those were his words. Who is he attacking?,161
142,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"In case I said those words, I appreciate the opportunity to correct them. I next meant members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Curtin took exception and I have now accepted his word. So it is one back bench member of the Opposition to whom I am directing my attention. In effect he said that there should be no borrowings whatsoever, that we were putting this country into hock, and so on. I remember the honourable member for Curtin breaking Standing Orders, playing to some young people in the gallery and apologising to them. Obviously, he does not understand what has happened in this Budget-a reduction in the deficit to $3.5 billion. Is the assumption underlying what the Opposition is putting to this Parliament that it would collect $3.5 billion more in taxation or that it would cut government spending by a further $3.5 billion? It is just as well for everybody who is taking note of this debate to contemplate what the Opposition is putting to us. There are some pains in what the Government has had to do in this Budget. We do not like doing it in many cases, but we have to do it responsibly for this country. We should just remember that the contributions from the Opposition in this debate are such that one would have to assume that it would raise $3.5 billion more in tax or cut government spending by $3.5 billion. I close the debate and ask the House to accept the motion before it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

"". The more I listened to the Minister for signing 'farewell Bob tax' letters the more I became suspicious of the intentions of the Government. There was no need for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) to go on at considerable length in denigration of my friend the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) and to a slightly lesser extent the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I made the view of the Opposition in this matter perfectly clear. We think it is important for the Parliament to consider the Loans Bill on an In Committee annual basis and the amendments I have moved are merely to give effect to that intention. I will not delay the House further because we (6.19)-by will divide if the Government persists in not accepting our amendments. We do not wish to delay the House unduly.",162
144,Mr ROCHER,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"1 second the amendments. In the spirit of the speech made by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), I shall not keep the chamber for long. One point was not clear in the summing up of the second reading debate by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford). He claimed that the Loans Bill is a machinery measure. Of course, the Appropriation Bills will be relevant before this Bill comes into effect. I suppose then the Government will take all pains to make sure that this Bill does not receive royal assent before the Appropriation Bills are passed, because this Bill comes into effect on the day it receives royal assent. If the Appropriation Bills are not passed, I would suggest that there could be some problems. They led me to say what I did in my speech in the second reading debate. I think that had the Minister understood that he would have been a little more charitable in his response.",162
145,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"The Government cannot accept these amendments. We believe that this Loans Bill should be a standing Bill and that it is taking up the time of the Parliament each year on a mere machinery matter. There is every opportunity for honourable members to debate all the issues in other Budget Bills without having to have this one each year. We are ever hopeful that wisdom will prevail in the Senate and allow us to have this standing Loans Bill. I repeat that the fact that the Opposition does not want to go along with this measure shows that it believes that it will be permanently in opposition. From that point of view, it is being realistic. To address the point raised by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), may I say that there is no need whatsoever for us to wait until after the Appropriation Bills are through before this one is proclaimed, because this is a mere machinery measure. This one is not used until appropriations transfer funds into the Loan Fund. Mr Rocher-But it can be.",162
146,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,It could be used only if certain measures were passed through this Parliament to use it. Mr Rocher-Like what?,163
147,Mr HURFORD,COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING,"I will make sure that the honourable member gets some further briefing on the subject. I thank him for an honest contribution, which is in such contrast to the contributions of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). Once again, I say that we cannot accept these amendments.

P. M. Sharp. J. upon which this disgraceful legislation will receive royal assent. It is not a matter to be fobbed off, and I forewarn the Minister and the other members of the Hawke socialist Government that if they make an error on this, not only will it be Khemlani all over again, not only will it be 1975 all over again, but also it will be a lot worse. The sooner the Government is thrown out, the sooner the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is dragged screaming from the Lodge, the better. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Darling) - Order! The honourable member for Denison is irrelevant. His comments are also irrelevant. I am sorry, I apologise.",163

I will be very happy with the third reading of this Bill.

Bill read a third time.",164
150,Unknown,AYES,Sitting suspended from 6.35 to 8 p.m.,164
151,Madam SPEAKER,AYES,"Earlier today the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) rising on a matter of privilege, referred to media reports of matters involving government party members, and the reported reference in a letter from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) to 'moves afoot to discipline those few Labor back benchers who caused a fuss on uranium sales to France'. The right honourable member asked whether the matter had been referred to me. I inform the House that it was raised with me, but not as a complaint of breach of privilege or contempt as such. I had, however, turned my attention to the issue, and have now studied the remarks of the right honourable member on the matter and given it careful consideration. House of Representatives Practice states: To attempt by any means to influence a Member in his conduct as a Member is a breach of privilege. So too is any conduct having a tendency to impair a member's inde' - ndence in the future performance of his duty. A comment of some relevance was made by the House IJf Commons Committee of Privileges following an inquiry in 1947 into a case involving Mr Brown, MP. The Committee stated: Your Committee think that the true nature of the privilege involved in the present case can be stated as follows: It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward. That case was certainly not on all fours with the present issue. However, the statement. I have quoted suggests to me that it is not what we might think of as the pressures of ordinary political life that members must be protected against, but rather those pressures which are of such a nature that members must be protected against them. A complaint which has some bearing on the present case was raised in November 1983 in our own House. My predecessor noted at the time there did not appear to be a case where the Committee of Privileges, either of the House of Commons or of this House, had reported in connection with disputation in respect of parliamentary party processes, and to the best of my knowledge, that remains the case. In considering the 1983 complaint, my predecessor referred to decisions of two Speakers of the House of Commons, one following a complaint that 'unexampled pressures' had been used to influence PRIVILEGE government members in connection with the Suez crisis. The Speaker at the time, Speaker Morrison, reportedly observed that the activities of Whips and 'the usual channels' had never been regarded as a breach of privilege of the whole House. In another case, in 1975, in connection with a complaint about Cabinet guidelines for the conduct of Ministers in the House, during the course of consideration of Common Market matters Speaker Selwyn Lloyd stated: In general, I think that arrangements made within political parties in this House would be unlikely to raise questions of contempt or privilege. I also note that while comments have been made and concerns expressed to me about the reference in the letter attributed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, no member claims to have been intimidated. Further, apart from the reference in the letter, no actual evidence has been placed before me of what might be regaI:ded as either obstruction or intimidation. I should also remind the House again of my belief that the House should invoke its great powers in respect of privilege and contempt sparingly, and only when it is considered necessary to provide reasonable protection to the House, its members and officers from such improper obstruction as is causing or likely to cause substantial interference. My conclusion is that, important as the general subject is, on the basis of the material before me and in light of such precedents as are available, I should not accord precedence to a motion in respect of this matter.",164
152,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"Madam Speaker, with your indulgence, I note that. the normal courtesy is that some notice is given of the timing of such a response. I regret that in this instance I had no idea that this matter was being raised. I apologise if the message had been given to me, but I was not aware of it.",165
153,Madam SPEAKER,AYES,I asked my staff to notify you before 6 o'clock.,165
154,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"I apologise, but I did not receive that notification.",165
155,Madam SPEAKER,AYES,I shall check.,165
156,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"I shall, too. Madam Speaker, appreciate the conclusions you have reached, but I think it is also important that members of the Parliament understand that if they seek to raise matters of privilege, it is correct that they be raised with you and not canvassed in the media. Part of my concern in this instance was that the matter was not raised with you but was canvassed outside the Parliament. I know nothing of the matters other than what was contained in the extracts from the print media which I passed on to you. I think there are occasions when there could well be an attempt to interfere in the way in which a member voted. I accept that in this instance that was not so. I think that if members believe there has been such undue interference, it would be far better if the matter were raised initially with you in this Parliament rather than for it to be canvassed at large in the media in such a way that people have the general belief that there might well be a breach of parliamentary procedures when, as you have suggested in this instance, that is not so. Madam Speaker, I accept the advice you have submitted to the Parliament in this instance. I hope that members of the Ministry also take note of your conclusions and observe the portent of them in the course of their subsequent behaviour.",165
157,Madam SPEAKER,AYES,"I say to the Leader of the National Party that if my staff did not advise him that I would be reporting on the matter at 8 o'clock, I give him my apologies. That was my instruction in regard to both yourself and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.",165
158,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,I apologise. I had not received it and I will check.,165
159,Mr CADMAN,AYES,"Madam Speaker, if I may make a few comments, I have listened with interest to much of your response. I know that you would have taken into account the Browne and Fitzpatrick case. The Committee of Privileges of this House reported that Browne and Fitzpatrick, by publishing certain articles, were guilty of a serious breach of privilege. In regard to the matter that was raised by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford) indicated by his words to the radio commentator that he intended perhaps to publish, by way of the radio, certain matters which could be construed to bring pressure to bear to intimidate members. I know that you would have considered the difference in the form of media which was intended in this case. Therefore, the Minister's intention to publish by a different form would have been noted by you, and I believe that should be noted by the House. The Minister has in the past used similar processes to disclaim his actions. This is not an isolated case as far as the Minister is concerned.",165
160,Madam SPEAKER,AYES,I have just been informed that the office of the Leader of the National Party of Australia was notified by my office at 6.30 tonight.,165
161,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"I apologise, Madam Speaker. My staff have sent me a note to say that they were advised but they had not advised me. So the fault lies with my staff, and I regret that. Mr John Brown-Shocking!",165
162,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES,"Even the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism knows that sometimes those things happen. I apologise, Madam Speaker, as I knew nothing of it. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1986-87 Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Keating: That the Bill be now read a second time.",165
163,Mr COWAN,AYES,"1t is now three weeks since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought the Budget before the Parliament. Since the Budget was delivered the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and members of the Government have been trying to sell it throughout Australia. If honourable members follow the media and the writings of economists and those who should know, it is evident that the Budget has not been received by the Australian people in the way the Government intended it to be received. In other words, the Budget has not reached the expectations of the average Australian. I am sure that most Australians were of the opinion that the general economy was so unsound that they wanted positive steps taken and the major problems concerning the economy tackled. Australia needs a fundamental change in direction. In other words, Australians were looking at three particular issues for reform. These issues were, first, the reduction of government spending; secondly, the reduction of taxation; and, thirdly, the reduction of union power. It is no use the Government trying to blame the markets of the world for the problems that we are going through at the present time. It is quite evident to any person that we have been running into trouble with our economy for three years or even more. If one looks at the promises made by the Prime Minister in the 1983 election campaign and queries some of the administrative moves made by the Government over the last three years, one appreciates that they have not put Australia back on course. Mr Ian RobinsonHe broke his promises.",165
164,Mr COWAN,AYES,"As the honourable member for Page says, the Prime Minister has broken promises. But let us not forget that in the month before the election the Prime Minister said: This country is divided and we are going to bring Australia together'. That was the main issue he placed before Australians. He said: 'We have to bring Australia together for our social life and for Australia's productivity'. My memory goes back to the summits we had on taxation and industrial relations, the people who attended them and their outcomes. We did not see the outcomes in true terms when the Treasurer presented the Budget the other evening. Today we see a divided Australia, with the National Farmers Federation, the Small Business Association and the people who do not agree with the Government on uranium mining. People within the Prime Minister's own political party are divided on and disturbed about the actions of the Government. Has anybody ever seen a country so divided as Australia is at present? Did we believe in 1983 that in September 1986, after the Prime Minister had promised to tackle the inflationary trend, interest rates, and such things, our gross national debt would be $85 billion? We never believed that we would see a trade deficit of over $15 billion. We never believed that we would see interest rates three years later taken up to a prime rate of 18 and 19 per cent. Did we believe that inflation would be about 8.4 per cent, that the value of our dollar would be down to approximately 62c against the American dollar? Do honourable members recall that in 1983 this Prime Minister said: 'Within a very short time we shall reduce the price of petrol by 3c a litre'. The tax on petrol has increased from 5.8c a litre in 1983 to over 24c a litre at present. The Prime Minister said that he would reform taxation. Did honourable members believe that they would see a capital gains tax when this Prime Minister said that he would never bring in a capital gains tax? Mr Fitzgibbon-He changed his mind.",166
165,Mr COWAN,AYES,"As the honourable member for Hunter says, the Prime Minister changed his mind. However, the honourable member should not have changed his mind because he is on the line at this time. Did we think that we would see a fringe benefits tax that would worry almost every Australian, every small businessman and farmer in this nation? Did we believe that we would see a 30 per cent superannuation tax imposed? We were not told about it. Did we believe that negative gearing would be done away with? In speaking on Bills before the House I have warned the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that if the Government wants to accommodate the people it represents in this Parliament it cannot afford to do away with negative gearing. Did honourable members believe that they would see the assets test come in? No, but it has been introduced. Did honourable members believe that they would see unemployment at 8 per cent and 22 per cent for the youth of Australia? Did we believe as Australians that we would see a Constitutional Commission set up in this country to review Australia's Constitution? Mr MCGauranWho makes it up?",166
166,Mr COWAN,AYES,"That is right. We can look at the people who are on it. Did we believe that we would also see this Government contribute funds towards a new flag competition for Australia? Let us look at all the things that have happened. I have not finished yet. Did we believe that we would see a Bill of Rights Bill come before the Parliament against the wish of the majority of Australians? The Australian people were opposed to it. Thousands of petitions were presented to the Parliament about it and the Government backed away. It was not game to face the matter because it knew that the Senate would not accept it. Did we believe that we would see ANZUS collapse so far as Australia is concerned? Why did not this Prime Minister go to the Prime Minister of New Zealand and say: 'We want you to remain in ANZUS'? I am talking not about the economy but about the security of this country and our foreign aid that comes within the Budget. Did we believe that we would say no to the Americans concerning their MX missiles? Did we believe that we would see the Soviet fishing fleet come to South East Asia and get the support of some of the countries in that area? What objection was raised by this Government about the Soviets' penetration of the countries which are so near to us and which we have been assisting? Did honourable members ever believe that we would see a person who led the Communist Party in this country, Mr John Halfpenny, put at the top of the list of the - overnment's Senate team from Victoria? Every nIght one turns on one's television, Mr John Halfpenny is in competition with the Prime Minister. He is getting more media coverage than even the Prime Minister of Australia. Did honourable members ever think they would see such division in a major political party as we see on uranium at this time? After that performance, how can we believe that this Government has the will and the vision to overcome the momentous problems that Australia has at present? The Treasurer says that the Budget was tough. Not one major function of this Government has been reduced in the Budget. The Budget shows that the Government has been able to reduce the deficit to $3.5 billion, which we pleased. to see. However, it is a rubbery figure. How dId the Government arrive at it? It did it by putting off pension increases and delaying t-xation reductions. Honourable members opposIte need to talk about these things. These are the reasons why they were able to reduce the deficit. The cost to revenue of the proposed tax cuts has been reduced to $1.4 billion, but let us look at the imposition of extra taxes. I wish I had more than 10 minutes in which to address the Parliament on this matter. I wanted to talk about the milk industry. The Government has a tax on milk, a tax on wine and a tax on everything else. Mr MCGauran-Orange juice.",166
167,Mr COWAN,AYES,"Orange juice, and the citrus growers of Australia are affected. Now all these other extra taxes and impositions on this country are coming out into the open. What about the Medicare levy? The Government put that up. The private hospital subsidy was taken away. Today half the sick people in Australia are in private hospitals. Pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners have been taken away. I have spoken about the' delay in introducing tax cuts. I spoke about petrol. Last Friday the price of diesel for the primary producers of this country went up by approximately 6c a litre. The farmers in this country will pay more for their diesel fuel. Fuel costs today are one of the greatest contributors to farm costs. Under this Government the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, but this is typical of socialism in a country. Honourable members opposite know that what I say is quite correct. I would like to say something about taxation. Of course there must be reform. Taxation reform must give incentive to the individual to work and to expand business. I remind honourable members opposite that President Reagan, upon coming to office, reduced taxation by 20 per cent and created over six million new jobs. The taxation reform that we look for in Australia must allow for income splitting for families, spreading the burden across the taxpayers of the country and allowing for a reduction in personal taxation. The Government must have confidence. Is it necessary for the Commonwealth to be involved, as it is, in such areas as education housing, Medicare and other important areawhich I believe should be left to private enterprise or the States? Political analysts have demonstrated in recent times how easy it would be to save at least $7.5 billion from our Budget are all very each year in government costs. I talk in general terms, because it is important that we do so. I would love to talk more about milk and petrol, I would love to talk more about the farmers, but I raise a matter that was discussed this afternoon in the Parliament· that is the allocation in the Budget for the A-straliaBroadcasting Corporation. I am worried about regional television. The measures the Government intends to adopt are not in the interests of country people generally. It is all very well for the Minister for Communications (Mr Duffy) to say: 'If television stations want to aggregate country people will have the opportunity to see three commercial stations'. In country areas we are accustomed to seeing local news, local issues and local advertising on television. I believe that the cost of equalisation, the cost of the coverage of at least three stations-particularly on the north coast and in the north-west of New South Wales-will make it extremely expensive for advertisers, will adversely affect programs and will not bring the equality that we are talking about. It was said in the chamber only this afternoon that it will cost at least $20m for a station to aggregate, to install the equipment. fuel We are concerned with keeping up the standard of our programs and providing the services we would like to see provided, particularly as far as country television is concerned.",167
168,Mr LINDSAY,AYES,"-It is an indubitable fact that Australia has as its current Prime Minister one of the greatest leaders this country has produced, a Prime Minister who has a clear vision of the direction his Government should take. The 1986-87 Federal Budget provides that direction-a direction to all Australians to face up to the challenges of a changing world and the direction to achieve the vision we all share for a better Australia. The 1986-87 Federal Budget was, by any standard, a tough Budget. It was a Budget which called for restraint on the part of all sections of our community. Restraint is necessary. For a responsible Federal Government, budgetary restraint was unavoidable. The last 18 months have seen dramatic falls in the world market prices for almost all the primary products exported by Australia. Despite the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the terms of trade for Australian goods since December 1984 have dropped by 13.5 per cent. These price falls are the result of forces totally beyond Australian control. In United States dollar terms, over the past five years coal prices have fallen by 25 per cent, beef prices in the last two years have dropped by a quarter and sugar prices have fallen by half since the late 1970s. The rise in the current account deficit, which is now estimated to be at $14 billion, can be attributed in the main to the devastating change in the international conditions affecting our internationally traded goods. All reasonable Australians know the necessity for restraint. That is why this Budget provides for zero real growth in outlays. This has involved the cutting of nearly $3 billion from the cost of existing programs. The Budget also provides for increased tax raisings of about $1.4 billion. The Government has served notice that it will seek discounting of two percentage points in the next national wage case. In summary, the Budget provides for a deficit of $3.5 billion overall; that is, $6.1 billion less than the deficit inherited from the Fraser-Howard Government. If 1986-87 is to be the year of consolidation of Australia's economy, it is also the year of continuing Hawke Government projects in the Herbert electorate on a scale unmatched elsewhere in Australia. The historic aspirations of the people of the Herbert electorate are being realised at a pace which has drawn resounding acclamation. No government, Federal or State, in the history of Australia has given more aid for the development of north Queensland than has the Hawke Government. Three and a half years ago there was no Burdekin Falls Dam, no new Townsville domestic air terminal, no School of Tourism and Hospitality, no Great Barrier Reef Wonderland project, no Commonwealth Government Centre and no School of Technology, and the Bruce Highway in north Queensland was not only dangerous to motorists but also a disgrace to the previous Liberal-National Party Government. North Queensland needed these Hawke Government projects. It needed the jobs that went with them. I have spoken often in this House of the importance of the Burdekin Dam to Townsville, a city of more than 106,000 people continuously plagued by periods of drought and water restrictions. Without water from the Burdekin Dam, Townsville will not have the capacity to meet the water needs of further industrial development, population growth will be limited and Federal Government plans to expand its defence presence in Townsville will be seriously handicapped. The sum of $29m has been allocated in the Budget for the completion of the Burdekin Falls Dam by March 1987. The Hawke Government is paying the total cost of the $122m Burdekin Dam, surely the greatest national water resources project in Australia since the Snowy Mountains scheme. I record the outstanding achievement of Paul Johnson, Burdekin Dam project engineer, in guiding this project towards completion. The sum of $9.5m has been allocated in the Budget towards the cost of a new domestic air terminal at Townsville. Construction is well advanced. Due for completion in November 1987, the $16m terminal will be able to transit more than 1,200 passengers at anyone time in air-conditioned comfort and will be one of the most functional and attractive air terminals in Australia. The Budget also provides funds for the $20m Great Barrier Reef Wonderland, a Commonwealth-State bicentennial project being developed in Townsville and hailed as unique because it will include the largest live coral reef aquarium in the world, the first omnimax theatre in the southern hemisphere and the first general branch of the Queensland Museum outside Brisbane. The aquarium will create enormous scientific interest in addition to being a spectacular means for visitors to experience the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. Visits to the reef can be inhibited by the distance to be travelled offshore, occasional weather restrictions and the cost involved in making such a trip. To be opened in June 1987, the Great Barrier Reef Wonderland will make the reef come alive for many more people. The aquarium will consist of a large main tank containing live coral reef, a small tank containing predators, an extensive interpretive area and a theatrette for audiovisual displays. Dividing the main tank and the predator tank will be a transparent acrylic tunnel approximately three metres wide through which visitors will walk and be subjected to a genuine underwater viewing experience. Great Barrier Reef Wonderland will not only further enhance Townsville's international renown as a centre of excellence in tropical marine science but also provide an attraction of wonder and beauty to the tourists of the world. The list of new ventures funded by the Hawke Government goes on and on. The new $12m School of Technology on the Pimlico technical and further education campus is due for completion in October 1986. Totally funded by the Hawke Government, it is the largest single T AFE project currently underway in Australia. On the same campus, another Hawke Government building-the $4m School of Tourism and Hospitality-now has more than 600 students. The Federal Government bears the total cost of roadworks along the Bruce Highway. This financial year, the Hawke Government is spending tens of millions of dollars on road works in north Queensland, particularly along the Bruce Highway between Townsville and Ingham. Good roads are more than a strip of bitumen. They bring tourists, help industry and create jobs. Townsville is home to the Third Brigade of the Australian Army and is the site of a Royal Australian Air Force base. North Queenslanders applaud the resolve and commitment of the Hawke Government to a modern and strong Australian Defence Force. Total defence outlay in 1986-87 is estimated at $7.5 billion. This is increase of 11.1 per cent over 1985-86 outlays on defence and represents an underlying real growth of one per cent. The defence budget provides for the continued improvement of living and working conditions for defence personnel, for operating costs and for investment on weapons, equipment and facilities. The Budget also announced a $20.7m project to move the RAAF's No.9 helicopter squadron from Amberley to Townsville by early 1989. The move would follow the re-equipping of the squadron at Amberley with Sikorski Black Hawk helicopters. Detailed planning of the facilities required to support an increased helicopter presence at Townsville are already underway. Included will be a new parking apron, a hangar, workshops and administrative facilities expected to cost about $19m, as well as houses for married personnel which could cost up to $8m. The Budget provides $450,000 over the next three years to establish a north Queensland health surveillance unit. The unit will monitor and study the incidence and distribution of marine-based illnesses and other tropical illnesses which occur in northern Australia. I stress that the Federal Government alone is financing tropical health research in Townsville. The Queensland Government has refused to contribute towards the establishment of such a health unit. On 24 June 1986 a large number of persons attended a public meeting in Townsville in response to a massive publicity campaign by certain sections of the local media on what they perceived to be the state of the national economy. The committee organising the public meeting circulated a questionnaire to thousands of people in the Townsville region and I seek leave to table details of the committee's questions and the respondents' answers, as summarised by the committee. Leave granted.",167
169,Mr LINDSAY,AYES,"The Federal Government is to provide up to $5m over the next three years towards Australia's hosting of the fifth International Festival of Pacific Arts, to be held in Townsville in August 1988. Festivals of Pacific arts are the main cultural events Australia shares with its Pacific neighbours. This financial year $300,000 has been allocated to commence planning for the festival and to establish an office in Townsville. A board of directors will be named soon and money should start to flow to the project in November. The festivals are a major means of cultural exchange. They draw together up to 2,000 people of diverse cultural backan grounds from over 25 nations through the South Pacific for traditional performances of song and dance, and exhibitions and demonstrations of traditional arts and crafts. As the festival will serve to highlight, under the Hawke Government Australia is emerging once again as a nation to be respected in the world. This Government has rejected conflict and confrontation and replaced it with co-operation and compassion. The Hawke Government has ended the drift, the division, the lack of direction, the loss of confidence, the absence of leadership and the blindness about where Australia was headed and what Australians could achieve together. We are creating a better, more caring, more tolerant, more diverse and more realistic Australia. It is a more cohesive, richer and enriched Australiaan Australia of which each citizen can be justly proud.",169
170,Mr CARLTON,AYES,"We are discussing the Appropriation Bill (No. I) 1986-87 and, on behalf of the Opposition, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House condemns the Government for(I) the failure of the Budget to tackle Australia's fundamental economic problems, namely: (a) the record and rising level of overseas debt; (b) excessively high levels of government spending and taxation; (c) an inflation rate 4 times the average of our major trading partners; (d) interest rates once again approaching 20%; (e) a wages policy that does not take account of the capacity of individual enterprises to pay, and (f) the pernicious effects of the anti-business, anti-investment taxes such as the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, and (2) the loss of Australia's AAA international credit rating following the failure of the Budget' It is now four weeks since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) introduced the much heralded Budget which was to solve all our economic problems. In the weeks leading up to the Budget the Australian dollar was under as'sault in foreign exchange markets. Almost a year of warning signals had produced from the Government nothing but deceit and prevarication, unwillingness to share with the Australian people the full extent of our difficulties and paralysis in the face of the emerging crisis. Month after month the figures were bad-inflation, balance of payments and rising foreign debt. Month after month the Opposition demanded that the Government face up to its responsibilities. We said that the Government should tighten fiscal policy, delay the March wage case and the productivity case, halt the legislation to impose new anti-business, anti-investment taxes, such as the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax, and remove foreign exchange controls. We first made a detailed statement to this effect on 3 January this year. The Government did not respond. The most powerful evidence of crisis began to build up in October and November of last year. Earlier-in August-the Government, in its Budget statements, warned of difficulties with the terms of trade. By marking down the dollar in November 1985 the foreign exchange markets delivered their second blunt warning to the Government that its policies were imperilling the Australian economy, having delivered a warning shot in February 1985. The warnings were ignored by the Government. High spending continued. The ludicrous charade of the March wage case and the productivity-superannuation deal continued with the Government presenting, in collusion with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, false evidence to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Commission was forced to acknowledge the weight of the evidence against the case on productivity concocted by the Government and the ACTU, yet demonstrated its subservience to the industrial might of the trade unions by giving them a licence to gain by industrial action what they could not gain by logical argument. Never was so clearly proclaimed the danger to economic good sense and industrial harmony presented by the current charter of the Commission. Having surrendered on wages policy, the Government refused to act on fiscal policy. It was self-evident in January that government spending had to be cut to reduce the deficit on our current account with the rest of the world. Yet nothing was done. The Opposition called for a mini-Budget in April or May to get spending cuts in place by the beginning of the new financial year-on I July-but nothing was done. Right up to 9 May this year the Treasurer misled the Australian public on the true state of the economy. On 9 May he treated his own formal advisory body-the Economic Planning Advisory Council-with contempt by telling it that the domestic economy was strong enough to withstand external pressures. Yet only five days later on the John Laws radio program he admitted that we were heading towards the economic status of a banana republic. The fact is that we are witnessing a massive failure of policy by the Hawke Government. For three and a half years it has been pursuing a policy direction which has been quite wrong for Australia. In March 1983 it had every opportunity to succeed. The economy was emerging from the recession caused by the wider world recession and a disastrous drought. The Fraser Government's wage pause was in place. The Government had the good will of practically the whole of the Australian community, including the business community. It had the ball at its feet. Tragically, it gambled with Australia's future security. It deliberately pumped up the economy by enormous increases in spending, financed by higher taxes and massive overseas borrowing. The wages pause of the coalition Government was abandoned in favour of the inflationary policy of wage indexation demanded by the trade union movement. Taxes and business charges were lifted to their highest levels ever. Even if our external trading position had remained strong, the disastrous impact of these policies on Australia's competitiveness and economic strength would have worked its way through. The failure to respond to our deteriorating external position, evident now for a good twelve months, has merely intensified the inevitable crash which has occurred. The simple truth is that the Government's economic policies have failed. The accord has been a disaster for Australia. The irresponsible Budgets of the last years have led inexorably to the worse crisis since the Great Depression. The Treasurer has used Australia's previously high credit rating to gamble with Australia's future on the world commodity markets. He recklessly drove the Australian economy on borrowed money in the hope that commodity prices would turn up. He trod the high wire, to the applause of the impressionable crowd and those who hoped to gain from his gambling. However, the croupier's spin did not turn in his favour. Commodity prices did not turn up. We were left with massive foreign debt and a crippling burden of interest and capital repayment. The Treasurer has betrayed his fiduciary responsibility to the Australian people. He has left us defenceless, with no policy for recovery. The Government has no strategy; it has no sense of purpose. It lunges in all directions except those necessary to correct the damage its policies have done to Australia. This Budget signals the Government's failure. It has not cut spending, it has not cut taxes. It has not put value back into the dollar, it has not generated investment, and by its reckless gambling it has destroyed Australia's proudest symbol of financial stability and trust, its AAA international credit rating. This Treasurer, proclaimed the world's greatest by an international money magazine at the height of his gambling spree with our money, has now been cashiered by the bank. What a shameful episode. What a record to leave in Australia's financial history, to have been the Treasurer to lose our top rating for credit worthiness! Perhaps it is no surprise when we remind ourselves that the Treasurer greatly admired J. T. Lang, who recommended default in the 1930s, and was ignominiously dismissed by the Governor of New South Wales before he could bring this country into disrepute. What of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)? He has let Australians down very badly. He has neither the strength nor the vision to do what has to be done. He believes in nothing and leads no one. He is a failed Prime Minister at the head of a failed government. The nature of Australia's fundamental problem is plain for all to see. It is understood by ordinary people a great deal better than it is understood by the Hawke Government. It is simply that governments in Australia at State and Federal levels have been living beyond their means. Governments are spending far more than the Australian people are prepared to pay for through their taxes and the borrowings needed to sustain this level of spending are higher than three Australia can afford. Government spending has moved far beyond the point where it can be sustained by the revenue base available to the Government. Indeed, the Government has spread its largesse so widely that even vital health services are starved while frivolous activities flourish. In every respect the Hawke Government has worsened this problem of overspending. Spending for Federal purposes has risen each year to higher and higher levels and tax collections have risen to the highest levels in Australia's history. Interest payments on the Government's debt are now the second highest item of Federal spending after social welfare. These interest payments can be funded in the end only by higher taxes. The Hawke Government's policies have been an economic version of Chernobyl: One by one all the safety valves in the Australian economy have been shut down until the critical chain reaction has occurred, blasting the floor out from under the economy and the dollar. Every Australian is suffering from the fallout, through high taxes, high interest rates and rising prices. The remedy is not complicated. It is not difficult to see or to understand. It is available to any government with the courage not to sacrifice the Australian people in order to appease special interest groups or trade union bureaucrats. The remedy is to reduce government spending to levels which Australia can afford and which the Australian people can comfortably and willingly pay for, without an oppressive burden of taxes or interest rates. I do not want to suggest that the solution lies wholly in the hands of government. Ultimately, it lies very much in the hands of the Australian people. It depends in the end on a recognition of the limits of what government can do for them and that the quality of their lives is really in their own hands. Nor do I want to suggest that the whole failure of the Government lies in its excessive spending. The competitive efficiency of Australia in a fiercely competitive world depends greatly on the capacity of its industries to adapt freely to changing circumstances, both in their work practices and in their cost flexibility. Yet the Hawke Government, as a conscious act of policy, has reinforced the power and influence of the most reactionary force in Australia today, the trade union bureaucracy. The very same people who forced restrictive work practices on whole industries through bUllying and intimidation, who shut down the petrol supplies of Sydney and Melbourne to secure additional benefits for employees already earning $40,000 per year, who closed the ports for a week after the Prime Minister's national broadcast calling for effort and sacrifice, are feted and garlanded by the Prime Minister and his Ministers, invited to the innermost councils of government, favoured in the decision-making process and granted a power of veto over the government's most important decisions. The Government has not merely failed to curb the excessive power of bureaucratic trade unionism; it has used all its energies to strengthen it. Not only has it failed to begin the process of reform of our outdated and inefficient industrial relations system, but it is preparing to entrench it further by legislating to implement the recommendations of the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems, which ran up a white flag in the face of trade union aggression. The troika of excessive spending, high taxation and overpowerful trade unionism has been driven over the Australian economy, leaving it crippled, bereft of an adequate fiscal and wages policy. Last November this weakness was exposed. Without curbs on spending and wage levels the government had to rely on high interest rates to prop up the dollar. As a result, interest rates rose to their highest real levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This Budget was supposed to provide the remedy. Not surprisingly, it has failed. Yes, the deficit was reduced by $2.2 billion, but $1.5 billion of this came from higher taxes and $0.6 billion came from windfall gains arising from Reserve Bank currency dealing. So we have no credible fiscal policy. What about wages? We are told that at a time when our inflation rate is more than four times that of our major trading partners and more than 16 times that of our main trading partner, Japan, the Government will humbly beg the trade union movement to accept a miserable 2 per cent discounting of wages against inflation. We are told that to ask for more would be 'industrially unrealistic'. On top of this the most bullying and thuggish unions are encouraged by this Government to extract 3 per cent superannuation contributions from terrorised employers on behalf of conscripted employees, 86 per cent of whom do not believe in compulsory unionism. What sort of a cloud cuckoo land of industrial relations do we live in, especially when those who quite legitimately question the system are referred to by an hysterical Prime Minister as 'political troglodytes' and 'economic lunatics' and accused of treason by the Minister for Trade? For this misguided and divided Government, the game is up. The international financial community believed its prospectus, backed it with its money, lost that money when the dollar fell, and has now lost confidence in the Government. Business, both foreign and domestic, has ceased to invest in Australia. Australians themselves are investing off-shore in increasing volume. The Australian people are fearful of their future and distrustful of the Government. The Prime Minister behaves erratically and unpredictably. The Labor Government's own grass roots organisation is beginning to disown it. And, of course, Australia's families are left poorer by this Government, with higher Government charges, higher prices, higher taxes and the increasing threat of unemployment. We in the Opposition recognise the seriousness of the task we face. As soon as this discredited Government can be removed by due democratic process, we shall begin our task. We are not of a mind this time to come into office merely with the intention of tidying up. We will indeed have to tidy up, but we will also make fundamental changes in the economic and social structures of Australia that will set the course well into the next century. The industrial relations system set up by the Liberal Alfred Deakin in 1904 to redress the imbalance of power between capital and labour will be changed for the same Liberal reasons, although this time in the other direction. The overreliance on government will be reduced and Australia will be transformed into a country of greater self-reliance and self-confidence as we move into our third century of settlement. The taxation system will be changed to remove the Keating barriers to entrepreneurship and investment, and also to provide incentive to personal and corporate taxpayers. Foreign investment controls will be removed. The transport and communications systems will be opened up to cost-cutting competition. Government interference and regulation will be reduced to the minimum. In the classical Liberal tradition, all aspects of our society will be examined. Those that work well will be retained and strengthened, those that can be improved will be improved and those that serve no useful purpose will be abandoned. We are determined that this fortunate, peaceful, well-educated yet self-indulthey gent society of Australia will break free of its self-imposed shackles and earn its place as one of the leading nations of the fastest growing region of the world. Ours is not a cold and calculating economic purpose, unrelated to the needs and aspirations of ordinary people. Change will not be made for the sake of change, or in pursuit of some untried ideology. But change is needed, and widespread change, that will bring practical and tangible development and benefits to individuals and their families, and allow them to shape their own lives with security and hope for the future. We look forward to the opportunity to bring about this change-not by direction of government, but by releasing the energies of the Australian people. We are convinced that it will not be long before we are called back into service.",169
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES," Is the amendment seconded?  reserve my right to speak.  appointing to listen to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). As has been said, he could drum up only 22 of his own members and coalition partners to listen to him.   am I a shadow Minister. The performance of the honourable gentleman was disappointing. Mr John Brown-You have great quality.  great quality on this side of the chamber at all times, as the Minister points out. I want to address some of the issues raised by the shadow Minister. He has talked about the necessity to try to cut government expenditures; and what do we find in the Budget? The Budget deficit has been reduced from $5.726 billion to $3.503 billion. The deficit has been cut in the Budget by some $2.223 billion, to $3.503 billion. If we had taken no action on outlays and receipts, the deficit would have been $7.5 billion. This is a government which has had to face the hard task of trying to address and get right the nation's economy. The feature of Opposition speakers that I do not understand is the confrontationist language that they use and the constant harassment of the ordinary men and women of Australia, whom want to blame for the current economic situation, in particular the current account deficit. They suggest that somehow the ordinary men and women are responsible for getting us into the present position and that they should be willing to see wages slashed, slashed and slashed again and not merely accept the wage restraint that we have provided under the accord. It is not necessary to be an economic genius to realise that if wages are slashed and slashed again we shall not land one extra tonne of wheat, wool, iron ore or aluminium in our export markets. The slashing of wages will not help. The Government's real accomplishments have been achieved by working in co-operation with the trade union movement. The Opposition keeps on talking about the evil influence of the trade union movement when it has produced real labour unit cost reductions so that these costs in 1986 are comparable to the levels that applied in the 1960s and 1970s. I could understand the constant chant about trade union power and the constant attack on the trade union movement if we had record levels of industrial disputation, but we do not. We have the lowest level of industrial disputation, from so-called evil trade union power, that we have had for the past 18 years. It is the best that we have had. I want to rehearse some of the real gains that the Government and the trade union movement, through the prices and incomes accord, have achieved. (Quorum formed) most I was outlining some of the real achievements accomplished by this Government and the trade union movement in the form of the prices and incomes accord. We ought to recall the legacy left to us after the Fraser years by that Treasurer, dishonest John Howard. He provided record unemployment and double digit inflation, and real hope for the future was taken away from so many of our families. The fastest growing industry in Australia was the dole queues of the Commonwealth Employment Service offices. That was the economic record and legacy of the previous Government. What have we accomplished? We have accomplished the fastest economic growth of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We have had the most consistent period of sustained high level growth since the early 1970s, we have had the fastest employment growth rate in the world, and we are the only OECD country projected to have a further fall in unemployment. More than two-thirds of the job growth has been in full time jobs. Almost 90 per cent of jobs created have been in the private se.tor. Fifty-seven percent of new jobs have gone to women, and a total of 630,000 jobs have been created since April 1983. Inflation prior to devaluation has been more than halved. Profitability, as a proportion of gross domestic product, rose from 11 per cent to 15.5 per cent. Industrial disputation is at its lowest level for over 18 years. As I mentioned, real unit labour costs have been significantly reduced and are now below the levels obtaining in the late 1960s and 1970s. Opposition speakers have drawn attention to Australia's inflation rate, as though this is the only measure of competitiveness in the economy. I point out to honourable members opposite that if the 6 per cent differential between our inflation rate and that of our international competitors were maintained, it would take until 1996 to erode the competitive gains that have been achieved in this economy. Of course, we would all like to see inflation reduced and that is why we are proposing a 2 per cent discount in the next wage round. We will get it down, but let us not be side tracked into trying to suggest that the inflation rate is the only measure of competitiveness and that somehow this is preventing Australia from competing. The major problem we have is in our current account deficit, which is currently running at $14 billion per annum. But that is not a situation that has been brought about by the trade union movement or by some aspect of government policy. Most rational economic observers are happy to say that the real problem has been a real decline in our terms of trade; that is, the money or the price we get when we export goods. Had we not had that decline in the last 12 months, our current account deficit, rather than being projected at $14 billion per annum, would have been $8 billion. I will give three examples of what has happened to the price of our commodities. Between 1980-81 and 1985-86 wheat prices fell from $US 181.90 to $US 133 a tonne-a fall of 27 per cent. The most recent price has not been $US 133 but $US103 a tonne. The same applied to coal. Between 1981-82 and 1985-86 average coal export prices fell from $US54.85 a tonne to $US39.41 a tonne-down 28 per cent. Between 1981-82 and 1985-86 Japanese contract ore prices fell from $US21.90 a tonne to $US 16.1 O-down 26 per cent. Of course, this Government is addressing Australia's loss of prices in its export markets. This is what this Budget is all about. I want to get back to my opening point. It is not the ordinary men and women of Australia who are to blame for this situation. A wage cut of 20 or 30 per cent that is obviously advocated by the New Right will not solve our problem. In fact, I refer to a Committee for Economic Development of Australia study on exploiting opportunities in the Pacific basin. That study concluded that, despite business perception, cost factors are not the real problem. The real problems are associated with developing skills in marketing and technology, and with competing in terms of value added to the consumer rather than associated with prices alone. There is no doubt that we have a long way to go in solving the problem. The difference between this Government and the Opposition is that we are saying: 'We have to face up to it as a nation'. We are not trying to blame one sector over another. We all have a contribution to make, but may I say none more so than the business entrepreneurs in Australia. We will overcome our problems-not tomorrow, not in the next three months, but over time.",173

He is easily confused for a National. 1 withdraw those words unreservedly. The real difference is that in a period when real labour unit costs have been reduced, when there is an unprecedented period of industrial peace, we are not about blaming the ordinary men and women of Australia for our current crisis. We are not going to say to them: 'You're going to be the victims of any economic action'. We are going to say: 'Everyone has to bear the burden equally'. I am very concerned to hear Opposition speakers talking about this inflexibility that is required in the trade union movement, and bringing up work practices. For the record, there has been a process by which parties can sit down and negotiate work practices that need improving. We have had some excellent examples in the steel plan, as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) would know, in the car plan, and more recently in the heavy manufacturing industry plan. All parties to that plan are satisfied with the real progress being made, but once again the trade union movement is being painted into a corner as being somehow the guilty party that forced these conditions on unwilling employers who would never have agreed to them and in fact did not. Of course, these things were obtained by a process of negotiation and the proper mechanism is for them to be unravelled by that same process. As 1I have outlined, there are some good examples of how it can be done on an industry basis. We have the opportunity to do it also at enterprise level. My constituents know full well what the implication of a Liberal government is. Hope is taken away, dole queues are created and the social fabric of the community that I am proud to represent is torn asunder. Therefore, when this Budget has been described as economically sound and politically honest, they can understand that and they can understand that they are being called upon to make some sacrifices. 1 conclude on a matter that is of some interest to me and which concerns the university. I am rather disappointed that the Education Minister, Senator Susan Ryan, continues to boycott the western suburbs of Sydney by refusing to go there and have a look at the position herself. I am pleased to say that other Ministers have visited my electorate, including the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and, on Friday, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). They are certainly not boycotting the area. It is also a matter of disappointment to me that the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and its head, Hugh Hudson, and the head of the Higher Education Board in New South Wales, Ron Parry, are still refusing to consult and underpin the activities of the new advisory council. I am looking forward to that blockage being unblocked. Real progress has been made towards achieving a senior high school. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Mr Hudson suggested that the area of greatest need was in lifting participation rates. We have had two public meetings in the electorate organised by my friend and colleague the State member for Riverstone. There was a tremendous turnout of parents and students, but, I am afraid, only a handful of Teachers Federation officials. Judging by the will of that meeting, most of the teachers and all of the parents and students were in favour of a senior high school, and if there had been a little bit of rope there and some white sheets, we might have had about three fewer Teachers Federation officials in New South Wales. However, 1 was rather disturbed that, at the second meeting, it became quite clear that the Teachers Federation has given up on the parents and is trying to manipulate the students against a senior high school. I remain confident that we will get a senior high school, which will have a dramatic impact on participation rates and the quality of passes and will provide extraordinary numbers of students not only from my electorate but from others for the new university, which I am sure is inevitable.",175
177,Mr WILSON,AYES,"I rise in this Budget debate to support the amendment in regard to Appropriation Bill (No. I) which has been moved by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). This Budget is like a hall of mirrors. It is full of illusions. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) proclaims that the Budget reins in government expenditure, when in fact outlays are increased by 6.9 per cent in money terms and by a small amount in real terms. That is his present forecast, but already there are indications that there will be a significant real terms blowout. He proclaims, like a wizard, that he is reducing the Budget deficit to $3.5 billion, when there was a stretching rather than a cutting. The lower deficit was achieved by lifting taxes, by accounting methods such as the Reserve Bank's currency trading profit, and by the Government's heroic assumptions about economic growth. I might add that this assumption about the Reserve Bank's currency trading profits implies as significant a change in the value of the Australian dollar in the current year as occurred in the last, disastrous financial year. Far from reducing the size of government, the Budget does not provide for the abolition of one single ongoing function of the Commonwealth Government. Most of the Budget savings are matters of tinkering with the machinery of government, with the timing of reforms and of i-d.exed payments, rather than real savings and glvmg the machine the overhaul it needs. The Treasurer appears to give us a long-heralded tax cut, but this is an iIlusion now as it was an iIlusion when those tax cuts were first announced. Whereas before the Labor Government came into office the standard rate of tax was just over 30c in the dollar for the great majority of taxpayers, under the Hawke-Keating tax plan the standard rate of tax would have been 46c in the dollar. The average weekly earner and those on incomes below the average are supposed to be thankful that the standard tax rate, instead of being increased to 46c in the dollar, is being increased to 40c in the dollar. Now there is the further illusion of the postponement of the expectation of a tax cut that was to heIp Australian families, which means that the real benefits of that gain, certainly in this financial year, are lost by the delay, by increases in the Medicare levy and by fiscal drag as well as by the increases in indirect taxes that impact particularly heavily on families with children. For the second year in a row the Hawke Government has broken its trilogy commitment not to increase taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product. Had the Government not broken the trilogy commitment, tax receipts would have been $400m lower in 1985-86 and $1,400 million lower in 1986-87. As the Leader of the Opposition said, this is a taxing, not an axing, Budget. Coupled with that, the Budget tells us that the foreign debt is likely to continue, for nothing in the Budget demonstrates that steps have been taken to reduce the rapid escalation of Australia's foreign debt. This increase in the foreign debt will not only impose a heavy burden on this generation year by year, by allocating an increasing proportion of its overseas earned revenue to the servicing of overseas debt, it will also impose a massive burden on the children of today. Something needs to be done about that. There needs to be a major change in policy. Although I do not wish to spend a great deal of time on that topic this evening, I simply want to say this: I believe in a free market economy in Australia. I believe in the ideal of a free market economy for the world. But we do not have a free market economy in the world. Major trading blocs are taking advantage of Australia's too-rapid desire to move into a world free market economy. The time may come when we in Australia need to recognise that many of those who are our closest trading partners are taking advantage of us. They are taking us for a ride.· They are benefiting from our naivete. We may one day find that we have to use some of the strategies that became necessary in times of previous governments if we are to protect the Australian economy, Australian families, the Australian worker and Australian investments. Whilst I would like to develop the topic further, all I want to place on record tonight is my concern that all of us who have ideals and goals may have to take a step back or maybe a step sideways before we can take that big leap forward that we have attempted to take all too soon at such great price, not so much to us-if it were to us, we should bear the price-but to our children. The price we are expecting people to pay is a price we are expecting our children to pay. I do not believe that we in this Parliament today should be allowing the implementation of economic policies that are putting such a huge potential burden on the future prosperity of Australia's children. The principal topic I wish to talk about in relation to the Budget tonight is its impact upon Australian families. It is an anti-family Budget. The effect of the Hawke Budgets-this one and its predecessors-has been to bring about a major shift in the burden of taxation from single people and married couples without children to families with children. Let me run through some of the figures produced by the Institute of Family Studies. It compared two households where both adults were working, and because both were working they were achieving a household income of $40,000 a year. One household had no dependants and the other had two student children aged 16 and 18 years. As a result of the last two Budgets introduced by the Australian Labor Party Government the disposable income of the married couple without children has been increased by $10 a week, whereas the disposable income of the family with children has, by contrast, been reduced by $6 a week. Is that a sensible way to achieve what is the illusion of tax reform? Tax reform is not merely tax reduction; tax reform is making the levying of the burden fairer and more equitable, taking more note of capacity to pay, recognising the responsibility borne by parents in maintaining children and by spouses who are at work in maintaining spouses who are not at work. If we go on taxing families in the way we have been, in the way this Government has been, more and more of those spouses who are being supported by taxpayers in a personal sense and more and more of those children who are being supported by taxpayers out of their disposable income after tax will, because of the pressures put upon Australian families, cease to be happy intact families and will move into the sole parent, supporting parent category where the supporting, caring parent along with the cared for children become the responsibility of government and the public sector and in that position are forced into poverty. The largest group of Australians in poverty are children. A vast number of children are living below the poverty line. In many instances this is because the custodial parent is not getting any support from the non-custodial parent. A second reason for their being moved into poverty is that our taxation and social security system is failing Australian families. It is not a family taxation and social security system; it is a system for individuals who have a greater capacity to pay tax while they are single, while they have no children. Yet they are not paying the tax that they should pay in order that when they do have children they can get fair treatment under the taxation system. If we had a social conscience and genuine feelings of compassion as well as proper concern for the future of the nation we as members of parliament would be deeply concerned not only that poverty is increasing but also that the number of poor children is rising alarmingly. In spite of the rhetoric about the family which has been the stock-in-trade of many in this House, debate on the specifics of family policy has been weak and policies implemented to assist families have been far outweighed by those which have burdened them and weakened their economic viability. Not only the unintended but sadly sometimes the intended consequences of tax and social security changes introduced in the name of reform have penalised families in general and two-parent single-income families in particular. One of the most fundamental and significant causes of poverty is the substantial error we have made, and continue to make, in the structure of our tax and social security system as it impacts upon families. Measures in past years and in this year's Budget have increased the disposable income of families without children by more than $10 a week, and in stark contrast, impact upon and have reduced the disposable income of families with dependent children. I believe that the time has come when we should develop family policies, when we should have taxation and social security policies that are based upon a life cycle concept, policies. which recognise the fact that the great majority of Australian taxpayers pay the taxes that they ultimately receive as social security benefits. Today's social security beneficiaries are tomorrow's taxpayers; today's taxpayers are tomorrow's social security beneficiaries. The great majority of Australian people are at some stage either taxpayers or social security beneficiaries, and sometimes for periods they are both. I was fascinated to read an article the other day which indicated that 25 per cent of pensioners and social security beneficiaries pay tax through the income tax system. They represent 10 per cent of Australian income taxpayers and they pay $800m in tax on their pension as well as their other incomes. But the system is failing in its recognition of the responsibility taken by parents for maintaining children, and by spouses for maintaining dependent spouses. For those who are outside that concept, for those who in many instances are not married, the system is fine. They are individuals, they are treated as such and they receive benefits as individuals. But children in intact families, dependent spouses in intact families, are assumed to be dependent upon the bread winning member of the family or their parents. I am very concerned that some very strange ideas are circulating in some academic circles. In an article, the Centre of Policy Studies in Victoria noted: While it is certainly true that the presence of dependants does indeed reduce ability to pay, it is debatable whether this should be regarded as a reason for reducing tax liability any more than should the buying of a boat which likewise reduces the ability to pay . . . Since the decision to have children, however, is usually one of choice, it is arguable whether the tax system should recognise such costs. Economic analysis of this kind shows children being thought of as durable goods. As has been pointed out by another writer, this idea can be translated as follows: A child is costly to acquire initially, lasts for a long time, gives flows of pleasure during that time, is expensive to maintain and repair, has an imperfect second hand market . . . Likewise, a durable good, such as a refrigerator . . . or a boat! If that sort of mentality is influencing policy makers in the way in which the tax and social security systems deal with children, we have a very serious situation on our hands. I believe children must be treated as people, as the future of the nation, and that the support of children by taxpayers should be recognised by way of tax relief which is at least equal to the extent of the minimum cost of providing those children with their basic needs. I believe the same should be true in the case of dependent spouses. It is absurd that we should be paying to separated families five times as much as we allow the taxpayer who is supporting a spouse in an intact, happy home. That differential does affect social behaviour as well as the economic viability of the single income household with a dependent spouse and dependent children. Assistance by way of allowances for children also needs to be sensitive to the ages of the children. Recent studies have shown that $1,000 is the minimum cost to provide for a child aged two, whereas $2,500 is the anticipated cost to a family to provide for a child in his or her teens. I think we need life cycle financing for families. We need a family policy. We need tax policies that are sensitive to the needs of Australian families. A taxation system which does not favour those with the responsibility for bringing up dependent children is a taxation system without social vision. We need a tax policy, a social security policy, with a social vision. This Budget fails Australian families, as it has no such vision.",175
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,178
179,Mr WRIGHT,AYES,"1 was simply amazed to listen to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), a member of the Liberal Party, when he had the audacity to move his amendment to the motion for the second reading a few moments ago. In his amendment he talked about high levels of government spending. He talked about the inflation rate and a wages policy. He also talked about the effect of this Budget on business. He certainly has a political cheek to move such an amendment because he was part of the Liberal-National Party Government that left the Hawke Labor Government and the people of Australia with a Budget deficit of $9.6 billion. He was part of the former Liberal-National Party Government that actually created negative growth in its last year in power. He was part of the same Government that overshot its expenditure targets and blew its estimated deficit targets for five Budgets in a row. Yet he has had the audacity to talk about overspending. The honourable member for Mackellar talked about the present inflation rate. What was it under the Liberal-National Party Government? In 1979-80 it was 10.1 per cent; in 1980-81 it was 9.4 per cent; in 1981-82 it was 10.4 per cent; in 1982-83, its last infamous year, it was 11.5 per cent. Those figures should be compared to the low of 4.3 per cent and the high of 8.4 per cent under Labor. As for his comments about wages, I doubt whether few Australians have forgotten that it was under the HowardFraser Government that the work place became a battleground. If we look at the record and the statistics, we find that between 1976 and 1982 more than three million days were lost on average each year in industrial disputation. As for jobs lost and the unemployment situation, under the Carlton Government-if we want to talk about it in that way; it was the Liberal Government, the Howard Government, the Fraser Government-the level of unemployment rose to 718,000. In comparison, the Hawke Government has created 634,000 new jobs. The honourable member talked about the nation's trading situation internationally. It was under the Liberal-National Party Government in 1981-82 that the Australian people suffered a recession. It was under the Liberal-National Party Government in 1981-82 that the current account deficit rose to 6 per cent as a percentage of gross domestic product. It is also a matter of statistical record that the former coalition Government, in which the present member for Mackellar was a prominent front bencher-he was a Minister at the time, and the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), was the all-powerful Treasurer-presided over the destruction of our nation's manufacturing and service industries. It was under Howard that Australian manufacturers were stifled by an overvalued exchange rate. The little assistance that was given was focused on negative protection measures, with few positive measures to encourage competitiveness and export growth. I have taken the trouble to look up the actual facts and figures of that time, when whole sectors of the industry collapsed and disappeared. Regardless of what members of the Opposition now promise, the people of Australia will look at the facts of their past performance. In 198081 assistance given to heavy industry by the Liberal-National Party Government amounted to $47.9m. Under the Hawke Government last year, this figure rose to $109.lm. In the light industry area-we remember that the Liberals are supposed to be industry conscious-the assistance received by that industry in 1980-81 amounted to $18.4m. Under the Hawke Government last year it jumped to $123.3m. In 198182 the Howard-Fraser Government spent a miserable $25.5m on technology development. If one contrasts that with what the Hawke Government has spent in the last year, one will find that it has almost trebled to $67.8m. The total assistance given to manufacturing industry in 1980-81 by the Howard-Fraser Government was only $138.5m, yet in 1985-86 the Hawke Government spent $466.4m. The honourable member has had the audacity to move an amendment referring to effects on business! The Liberal and National parties want people to think they have changed, but there is no better test than the test of past performance. The Liberal-National Party Opposition has always been great on promises, but it has certainly been light on performance. It has never been concerned about our international competitiveness. As Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition knew what had to be done in regard to the dollar, but he kept it overvalued, making manufacturers unable to compete with the imports which flooded in, and wrecked Australian jobs and industries. It was during his reign that so many companies went off-shore. It was when we sent our publishing firms to Hong Kong and Singapore. As in the past-it has not changed now-the Liberal-National Party coalition still sees Australia as an agrarian economy, selling mainly food products and unprocessed minerals. The Hawke Labor Government, on the other hand, has had to pick up the shreds and make the tough decisions to get Australia back on the economic tracks. The Opposition will go to any lengths to try to deny what it has done but, slowly, and surely, the truth is being revealed. A month ago the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia-the MTIA-known as the national voice of engineering employers, published a booklet entitled 'Australia's Foreign Debt-Budget Implications', written by Dr Clive Edwards, MTIA's chief economist. On page 23 it states: MTIA's task force on industry competitiveness recently pointed out that Australia's manufacturing sector is still conditioned by the traumatic developments of the early I 980s; (by) the large wage and on cost increases, the over valued exchange rate, the severe recession of 1981-82 and 1982-83, all of which led to a reduction in the size and capabilities of the turing sector. Who was in government from 1980 to 1983 when this happened? It was the Liberal and National Country parties. Business leaders must laugh when they now hear the honourable member for Mackellar, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Bennelong and others making all these pro-business promises, because business leaders know their record-a record of large wage and cost increases, a record of a pittance in assistance to business, a record of over-valued exchange rates and a record of uncompetitiveness in industry. It is also interesting to see what the MTIA publication said in conclusion. It made a number of points and the main one was that to reduce growth in Australia's net foreign debt there had to be a slowing down of growth in government spending and a reduction in public sector or government borrowings. This is exactly what the Hawke Labor Government has done. In real terms, after allowing for inflation the rate of increase in government spending has been held to zero. Mr Hawker-That is not a cut.",178
180,Mr WRIGHT,AYES,"It has been held to zero for the first time in something like 30 years, yet the honourable member says that. Government borrowing has been reduced so that more money is available for private sector investment in productive activities that will increase exports and replace imported products with Australian made goods. It would appear that, despite all the pessimism and the prayers almost of the Opposition that things will continue to go bad, many Australian businesses are looking to the future with optimism. (Quorum formed) As I was saying, according to a survey by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures carried out in Victoriathis survey covered 205 companies which account for one in three jobs in manufacturing in that State-a new optimism is appearing and that optimism is being generated by this Hawke Budget. The survey found that there is mounting evidence that improved international competitiveness in manufacturing is beginning to make itself felt. It found many companies were increasing exports and were finding it easier to compete against imports. This is not just because of the devaluation of the dollar but because there is a new attitude, a new approach, better corporate planning, new products and innovative marketing strategies. There is a new confidence that will expand as industry begins to see and grasp the opportunities that now exist under this sector, i.e., the manufacGovernment. I believe that this Budget is generating further confidence because, unlike our opponents in the Liberal and National parties, people in every walk .of life now realise that the Hawke Labor Government is prepared to put aside short term political popularity for long term national economic advantage and development. This approach sharply contrasts with the HowardSinclair attitude. At a time when this country should be stopping the lurks and rorts, at a time when the welfare cake should be shared amongst those who are the needy, not the greedy, at a time when investment should be directed at productivity rather than quick quid schemes, we find this Opposition will do anything and say anything to try to attract votes. It has come forward with a massive program. It wants to abolish the fringe benefits tax and reintroduce entertainment rorts, at a cost of $700m to the ordinary people. The Opposition wants to get rid of the capital gains tax, but at what cost? It would be at a cost of another $5m. The flow-on of the world oil price will cost Australian taxpayers another $400m. The Opposition wants to reinstitute negative gearing, which would add another cost of $50m. It wants to repeal the assets test. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) said earlier how he cared for pensioners. The Opposition wants those on $500,000 to still receive the pension. The Opposition wants to put another burden of $600m on the people of Australia. The honourable member talked about families on two incomes. Income splitting will cost the Australian taxpayer $2.7 billion. Those measures amount to almost $4.5 billion, and they are only part of the Opposition's promises. We must ask: Where will the money come from? If we total all the Opposition's promises to date we find that they amount to something like $11 billion. The promises are made not only by the Liberal Party. Of all the stupid things to do, a few weeks ago the National Party sent a letter to a man called Dr Doug Everingham of 50 Corberry Street, Rockhampton, asking for money. The National Party did that to a former Labor member of this House. What does the National Party say that it will do? It says that it will do the same sorts of things: It will repeal the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the assets test-the list goes on and on. Mr Tickner-I got one too.",179
181,Mr WRIGHT,AYES,"The honourable member got one too. Labor members are receiving letters from the National Party. It is just as much a joke as its promises, because what it is promising simply cannot be delivered. Yet the honourable member for Mackellar says nothing at all about how he would find this money. He spoke here as the shadow Treasurer and what did he say about where he would find this money if he ever got into government? He said not one word. Maybe he had nothing to say because it has already been said for him by the new extremist right movement. Let the people of Australia remember that the Leader of the Opposition says that he stands by these promises. This is the group which says that it will abolish the first home owners scheme. It is the group that the Liberal Party supports and obviously, from the letter of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the National Party supports-the group that will cut local government grants in half. This year we gave local government $585m; the Opposition would slash that figure in half. This is the group that would abolish family allowances for the first child. This is the group that would totally reintroduce university fees of $8,000 to $9,000 per student. Imagine the number of young people who would not be able to go to university. This is the group that would introduce a tax on the family allowance at the marginal tax rate of the bread winner. It is also the group that says it would remove the half-yearly indexing of age pensions and benefits. However, the honourable member for Sturt has the audacity to say that he and the Liberals are concerned about the family and the aged. What a joke. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Government who have gathered here tonight, let me say that if one had to sum up the Budget in only 100 words one could best take the words out of the introduction of the booklet 'A guide to the 1986-87 Commonwealth Budget'; that is to say, the 1986-87 Commonwealth Budget makes a major shift down in government spending and borrowing that will permit Australia to vastly improve its trading performance. The Budget includes a big cut in the Federal deficit, no increases in government spending in real terms, and some increases in tax receipts, offset by income tax cuts as promised in the tax reform package. It also asks Australians to accept smaller pay rises for a while so that we can stay competitive with the rest of the world, lift our export performance, and win back a bigger share of the markets for Australia. The Budget will provide Australia with the opportunity to surmount its economic problems and maintain control over its economic destiny. No wonder the people of Australia are supporting it.",180
182,Mr WHITE,AYES,1 listened with interest to the fevered speech of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and 10 particular to the bit about Dr Everingham being asked for a donation by the National Party of Australia. Mr Wright-Don't tell me you got a letter too!,180
183,Mr WHITE,AYES,"I advise the honourable member to check with Dr Everingham to make sure that he has not made that donation. From my visits to his part of the world-central Queensland and Mount Isa-it seems to me that more people are leaving his Party in disenchantment than are joining it. The honourable member talks about our promises to abolish the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax. If honourable members opposite had an ounce of sense and wanted to stay on that side of the House the first thing they would do would to be to abolish the fringe benefits tax. It is that tax above all which will see honourable members opposite transposed very rapidly, within 18 months, to this side of the chamber. The Budget of three weeks ago seems to have caused many more problems for the Government than it has sought to solve. For three weeks we have seen turmoil in the Australian Labor Party as it has torn itself apart, particularly over the issue of uranium mining. Little factions have been meeting here tonight, as they have done for the last three weeks. Mr Gayler-Yes, they are under control in the north.",181
184,Mr WHITE,AYES,"The honourable member was on the news today saying what he was going to do to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What happened this morning? Nothing. The honourable member and all the other fellows who were so brave on AM went to water, the same as they went to water last week and the week before that. The other point that must be made about this Budget is that, apart from all the problems it has created for the Labor Party and the Government, it has failed to address the real problems. Within three weeks of the Budget being introduced, the Government has announced that it will introduce a mini-Budget in May. Within three weeks of the annual Budget being brought down, it has been discredited. It is out of date and a new Budget is announced. The Budget has failed to address the problems that are besetting this country. There are no cuts in programs. There are no cuts in government spending. An inflexible labour market still dominates. Our overseas debt continues to rise, inflation is rising, and there is no real encouragement for our exports. On top of all that, the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax that are already in place, as if they were not enough, taxes are to be increased. As a final accolade from the world market, our AAA rating has been reduced to AA 1. Today the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia arrived in my office. If one flicks through it one sees that almost every economic indicator put out and analysed by the Reserve Bank is on a downturn. That is an indication of how the Reserve Bank, the market-place and the rest of the world see this Budget. Let me turn to taxation. The Budget is a high taxing Budget. Few programs have been reduced but taxes have been increased. In regard to personal tax in particular, which has been sapping this country's energy for years and destroying initiative, the great promised tax cuts, which were to have been introduced on 1 September, have been delayed for three months. One begins to wonder whether those tax cuts will ever come. When one looks at the new tax rates whose introduction has been postponed from 1 September to December, one finds that those who earn $12,500 a year, who are currently paying 25c in the dollar, will pay 24c in the dollar under the new scheme. Those people are basically Labor Party supporters. They will be very grateful at the next election because the Government has given them the magnificent benefit of a one cent reduction in their tax! The Government will give those who are earning up to $28,000 a year, who are currently paying 46c in the dollar, a 3c reduction. If the Government thinks it is going to buy their votes with a lousy 3c reduction after all the hoo-ha it has been through in the last three months, it is very much mistaken. One of the other problems which beset this country is the domination of this Government by the unions. We have heard a lot in the last few weeks about the New Right. I understand the real fears of people who see the New Right as some emergent nazi-type group that is going to become dominant in this country. Mr Gayler-Do you support them?",181
185,Mr WHITE,AYES,"Let me say to the honourable member that I do not know who the New Right are. I suspect that honourable members opposite do not know who the New Right are, either. They are taking the opportunity to try to create a New Right to divert attention from some of their problems. They are blaming the New Right for all their ills. If members of the New Right are people such as Copeman, if he is one of the people who the Government believes are forming the secret society of the New Right, and if people such as Copeman are taking a stand against restrictive labour practices such as the 284 practices which I understand the management at Robe River objects to, I am very much in support of the New Right. Let me tell honourable members some of the work practices the management there is trying to get rid of. Unions have placed a black ban on supervisors, who cannot give orders to their men. General foremen cannot pass direct instructions to an employee. For trivial reasons the Australian Workers Union has regularly placed bans on the transport of meals. Dust suppression on roads is undertaken by watering and the trucks must be manned even when it is raining.",181
186,Mr LLOYD,AYES,Even when it is raining-that is a good one.,182
187,Mr WHITE,AYES,"Even when it is raining. There are two men to a truck. Presumably, the trucks go up and down watering wet roads. Dust suppression agents such as oil are not allowed to be used on the roads. When holes had to be drilled nine metres apart instead of seven there was a jack-up by the union. To replace a discharged fire extinguisher after normal hours, someone was called out for four hours on double time. Five employees must be on site for the operation of a rail servicing machine designed to be operated by two people, and so it goes on and on. If the Government is blaming the New Right for trying to get rid of some of those restrictive trade practices, which are holding back this country and making us uncompetitive, let me declare here and now that I fully support them. I turn to the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. I would like to make some opening remarks about the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown). What has happened in recent weeks makes interesting reading. During the last autumn session we had the saga of Mr Rodney Groux who was employed by the Minister. God knows where he is now, because the Minister did not know where he was when he was employing him. I presume that he is still under police investigation, but we have heard nothing about that. The Minister went overseas and got stuck into all the States. He would not say anything to the States while he was in Australia, but while he was overseas he gave the States a good bucketing for carrying out their own promotion of the tourist industry. He speculated on the Budget deficit. Do not tell me that he won that one. He was hauled over the coals by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Minister said 'No, I am not really interested in politics' and that he wanted to get out, but then he said that he might stay for a while. So, we do not know what he is going to do. In any event, as far as the industry is concerned, he has become a lame duck. He has been banned in Western Australia. The Western Australians will not give him a bed or a feed over there because they believe that he has done nothing for them. There is a report that his phone is bugged by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I do not know whether the Minister says that; but, if he has sa,id that and believes that, has he reported that to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen)? He keeps setting up expensive boards and commissions all over the place so that he can put his mates on them. He set up the Australian Institute of Sport, increased the board-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Darling) - Order! I am giving plenty of leeway. I know that this is traditional in an appropriation debate. But this tale is going on for a rather long time. I ask the honourable member to finish it and to relate his comments back to the Bill before the House.",182
188,Mr WHITE,AYES,"We are talking about the Budget, we are talking about the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism, and we are talking about the man who is administering that Department. I think that how that particular portfolio is administered, within the context of the Budget, is very important. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I accept your explanation and I request you to accept my direction.",182
189,Mr WHITE,AYES,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I will come back to something that I hope you will regard as a bit more pertinent, and that is the expenditure within the portfolio and the setting up of boards and commissions and in particular the expansion within the Department. In March 1983 the Department had five officers of class 2 and above in sport and recreation. In August 1986, three years later, it has 23 officers of class 2 and above. That is an enormous expansion by any standard. Having said that, let me also say that the tourist figures indicate that the tourist industry is in a very strong state in Australia, and for that the Minister deserves a lot of credit. But it does not mean that many of the things that could make that industry better have been addressed. They have not been addressed. I refer in particular to penalty rates. Penalty rates were something that the Minister was going to fix when his Party won government. The Government has given every excuse as to why penalty rates have not been fixed. Penalty rates are still a bugbear of the industry. As honourable members opposite well know, throughout Australia we have first class hotels that literally do not operate on weekends and public holidays because they simply cannot afford the penalty rates associated with the staff when the penalty rates are one and a half, two or two and a half times the normal rates. The other problem that I very much hope will be addressed is the increasing congestion at our airports. For the life of me I cannot understand why, with the congestion in Darwin and particularly Brisbane, the Government will not accept the offers of the private sector to come in and rebuild or build new international terminals at those airports. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) should not shake his head, as it is a fact that a consortium in Brisbane offered to build a new terminal; yet when the proposal was put up it was thrown out of court. The same thing happened in Darwin. If honourable members opposite want to see this industry expand, I would have thought the sensible approach would be to accept the opportunity afforded by the inclusion of the private sector. On sport let me say just this: All of the promises that the Minister made quite rashly before the Budget came down have been doomed. He promised everyone that programs would go ahead. Unfortunately, they have not gone ahead, because the Budget was cut. For example, the national sports facilities program is now $8m short. We have problems such as the current development in Victoria where money was promised, the proposal went ahead on the basis that the money would be forthcoming, but suddenly it was not to be provided. The same thing has happened in the sports development program. The market has made its judgment on this Budget. This is the only Government and the only Treasurer to take our credit rating from AAA to AAI. The way the Treasurer prances in here, he looks as though he is proud of it; but the market is not proud of it. The market has made its judgment. Mr Gayler-Boom times.",182
190,Mr WHITE,AYES,"If the honourable member opposite thinks it is just the market that has made that judgment, he ought to go out and talk to some of the people who used to be his supporters and see what they think of the Budget, the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax. There is one thing I will say for the Treasurer: He has done this country a favour because with his intemperate remarks about a banana republic he has brought home to the people of Australia just what a mess this economy is in. The sooner the lot opposite are tossed out and we have some competent economic managers on that side, the sooner we will get out of that mess. Mr Gayler-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The previous speaker has obviously quoted from the report of the H. R. Nicholls Society which has been distributed amongst members of the National Party, and I ask him to table that report. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order.",183
191,Mr MAHER,AYES,"Tonight there are just a few minutes left for me to comment on the Budget and to pay tribute to the great work of our Treasurer, the Hon. Paul Keating, who has made an extraordinary, dedicated contribution to reducing the deficit that was inherited by this Government from the previous discredited Liberal-National Party Government which is now in opposition. Before I deal in some depth with the Budget and the debate that is now in progress, I make a few observations on the remarks made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White). He said that this Government was dominated by the unions. If that is so, how can the Budget clearly set out the fact that since 1982-83 there has been a cumulative fall in real unit labour costs in the non-farm sector of over 7 per cent? That means that, comparing profits and wages, there has been a fall in real unit labour costs. That is something about which very few countries with which we compare ourselves can boast. There is a further one per cent fall forecast in 1986-87. Yet the honourable member for MCPherson and other members of the Opposition make these wild statements that the Government is dominated by the unions. If it is, real unit labour costs should be increasing. We have had talk of restrictive work practices at Robe River. That is all rubbish because if we get rid of the industrial relations system in this country, as the H. R. Nicholls Society and others seek to do, we are getting rid of a system that has given us a 5 per cent cut in earnings. The employees in this nation have accepted a 5 per cent cut in earnings over the last few years to try to get this country out of the economic malaise and economic mess which we inherited. I pay tribute to the employees in this nation. I also refute some of the nonsense we got from the Opposition about the Budget attacking families. In the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in this House he said that bulk billing will be abolished except for people such as pensioners who really need it. What about the families with four or five children or a chronically ill child? They will not be bulk billed. The letter the Liberal and National parties sent me seeking funds said that they will cut down the cost of Medicare. If that is introduced, it will hurt the families, because the families of this nation have benefited from Medicare. Medicare was the great reform of the first term of the Labor Government. We introduced a system, which is available to Australians, of free medical and hospital treatment. If those opposite stop families being bulk billed by doctors they will hurt families. People with children should not be penalised. It is all very well for the Liberal Party and the National Party to say: 'We will stop bulk billing except for pensioners'. It is very unfair to families. All the gobbledygook that we are hearing tonight about hurting families is rubbish. Some of the compassionate parts of the Budget should be mentioned tonight while we have a few minutes. One concerns aid for diabetics. Many times I have made representations about people suffering from diabetes. The Government will supply free of charge insulin, syringes and all the accoutrements that people with diabetes need. The Government will also assist families in which somebody is chronically ill. When more than 25 prescriptions have been used in a year further preparations under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be supplied free of charge. I pay tribute to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) for bringing these matters forward. The main benefit for families will be the tax cuts coming in later this year. By I July 1987 the 60c in the dollar rate of income tax which was left to us by the Opposition-it walked away from this House after the 1983 election leaving the tax rate at 60c in the dollar for the top income earners-will be cut to 49c. The 48c and 46c rates will go down to 40c. There will be other changes in the marginal rates. At the same time, there will be imputation of company tax. That will be the greatest shot in the arm for small companies and small business people. No one will pay tax at a rate of more than 49c in the dollar. This is the greatest reform that has ever been introduced in the Australian tax system. Other Labor governments said they would do it. They promised to tax all the areas of income that were untaxed and to close the loopholes, but they never had the ability to do it. 1 pay tribute to the Treasurer. He will go down in history as the man who brought equity and fairness to the Australian tax system. (Quorum formed) It was my hope to speak about the allocation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. My time is fast slipping away. 1 pay great tribute to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) for what he has done and what 1 observed last week when visiting the Gulf of Carpentaria.

192,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.15 p.m., 1 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",184
193,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the Government's advanced plans for a national compensation scheme. Honourable members will recall the Whitlam Government's attempt to impose a national compensation scheme on Australia a decade ago. Nothing has changed but the means by which the Australian Labor Party intends to achieve its. ultimate objective. The Party's national platform now clearly shows that Labor will develop, in co-operation with the States, a national compensation scheme on a nofault basis. The proposals are already being progressed with the co-operation of the Labor-governed States in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. They will 'have a profound effect on the Australian community. As with Medicare, Labor intends to blanket the whole population with its accident scheme. All injuries resulting from road accidents, industrial accidents, accidents in the home and elsewhere are to be covered on a 24-hour a day basis. Everyone is to be caught in the net-the self-employed, housewives, children, road users and employees. A national compensation scheme will see the widespread introduction of taxed pensions for accident victims, instead of tax free lump sum payments received at common law. This tax grab is already happening without one word from the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech being necessary. These tax changes are occurring because the Victorian Government nationalised workers compensation last September and created Workcare-a scheme which erodes the common law rights of employees and places the emphasis on weekly payments, which attract income tax rather than tax free, lump sum payments. The Victorian Government is now proposing to introduce a pure no-fault road accident scheme in January 1987. This will, among other things, further advance the Federal Government's program and require a large number of road accident victims to pay substantial amounts in income tax which would not otherwise be payable. The Victorian ALP's platform, as one might expect, mirrors the Party's Federal platform. It states that a Victorian ALP Government will co-operate with the Australian Government and other States to establish a national compensation scheme. It is noteworthy that a Bill requiring the nationalisation of workers' compensation in South Australia will be introduced in that State's Upper House within the next few weeks. Again, that legislation will provide for the erosion of common law rights and lead to injured employees paying large sums of tax not previously payable. The New South Wales Government is pointing in the same direction with its workers compensation and road accident systems. At the appropriate time all of the State schemes will be integrated and expanded. Finally they will emerge as the Federal Government's national compensation scheme. There is another critical aspect of the Federal and State Labor governments' plans for national compensation which gives cause for grave concern. I refer to the propensity of socialist governments to mortgage Australia's future. The Workcare scheme in Victoria is semi-funded apd a Melbourne actuary has determined that if the Government maintains premiums at their current level the scheme will be absolutely broke within a few years. The present Victorian road accident scheme is already broke, with accumulated losses at June 1985, according to the State's Auditor General, of $1.5 billion.",184
194,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,How much?,185
195,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,It will be $1.5 billion. This led to the State's Treasurer announcing in his 1985-86 Budget speech that $30m from petroleum royalties was being pumped into the system to help alleviate the problem. Now the Government is stating in advertisements promoting its new road accident scheme that the program will be partly paid for by increased fines for serious traffic offences. The New South Wales road accident scheme has a funding shortfall in excess of $1 billion. We now have evidence aplenty of the growing threats posed by unfunded and semi-unfunded schemes. The Federal Government's proposed national compensation scheme falls clearly in this category. The Executive Director of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in the United States of America put the whole matter into perspective in his paper 'Around The World Social Security Goes Broke'. He said that funding problems promise to become political crises early in the twenty-first century and that policy makers think the problem can be left for someone else to solve. But the longer they wait the more painful must be the cure. It should therefore be evident that the national compensation scheme proposed by the Federal Government will not provide a cure; rather it will perpetuate and extend a problem this nation's taxpayers can ill afford.,185
196,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,185
197,Mr LAMB,ADJOURNMENT,"Parliament is often likened to the theatre-men and women strutting the stage delivering their well-learned lines and attempting to convey their views and philosophies on the great issues of the day. Tonight I wish to talk about an actual theatre which for over 50 years had dedicated itself to more political issues of the day than perhaps addressed by any particular member of this House. On II August, New Theatre at Melbourne completed half a century of political theatre, making it the longest continuously running theatre company in Victoria. During that time, while maintaining four or five plays each year over five decades, New Theatre remained constant, like the Northern Star, to its charter of presenting theatre with a purpose, designed to politicise its audiences on social injustices of the day. The philosophy behind New Theatre has always been left of centre, bonded to the causes of working men and women, the oppressed and the minorities. Its credo has always been that theatre can be a force for social change. Inevitably, right from the beginning the theatre has been at odds with the ruling parties and classes, whose rationale has been to preserve the status quo by ensuring that ordinary people remain powerless to bring about reforms. New Theatre encountered the wrath of the establishment as early as its second production, Till the Day I Die, in late 1936, when the antinazi one-act play was banned following a protest from Hitler's Consul-General to the Federal Government. Incidentally, the play was performed but the ban was not lifted until well into the war. In 1948, the theatre presented the plight of the Aborigines with productions of Fountains Beyond, a story of Aboriginal communities struggling to survive on the fringes of white settlements, and Rocket Range, about the establishment of rocket testing grounds on Aboriginal lands. This second play, which indicated the white bosses' total ignorance of Aboriginal ways, was tossed out of a drama festival because of its strong criticism of white society. New Theatre""s most outstanding success was probably Reedy River, which was first presented in 1953. It brought together about 10 traditional bush songs, which were linked by a story about the shearers' strike of 1891. Music was provided by a bush band and the whole show made theatrical and folk music history. The theatre has produced this all-Australian show on no fewer than six occasions over extensive seasons. I joined New Theatre during the 1966 performance and stayed to tread the boards in The Wall, a play about an uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, MACBird, a Shakespearian satire on the Kennedy assassination, The Death of Bessie Smith, the tragic story of the famous American Negro jazz singer who died from loss of blood when she was refused admission to several white hospitals, and On Stage Vietnam, a living newspaper-style play which opposed Australia's involvement in that immoral and unwinnable war. In 1967, its performance of America Hurrah generated an incredible amount of debate in the media on censorship when it challenged Victoria's obscenity laws. The issue became a cause celebre, hastening the introduction of more sensible censorship laws. Last year it produced Sandinista, a dramatic history of the Nicaraguan revolution, and this year, Athol Fugard's Statements, a semi-documentary of a relationship between a white librarian and a coloured teacher in South Africa. This list is hardly exhaustive but it illustrates the great contribution made by New Theatre to politics and the arts. The theatre has been closely associated with many of Australia's leading writers, including Vance and Nettie Palmer, Frank Dalby Davidson, Miles Franklin, Oriel Gray and Frank Hardy. It has provided opportunities for budding playwrights, directors and actors, especially those who would not have found a venue because of the political nature of the performances. New Theatre has, in fact, premiered 63 Australian plays and was first in Australia with Brecht, Miller, O'Casey, Milligan and Dario Fo. What has kept New Theatre going? It cannot be the money. It works from show to show, its members are working people, its productions are inexpensive and its publicity is noted for its absence of gaudy tinsel. It is the people and their message which has kept them going and I compliment them all, past present and future. Nettie Palmer once said: 'How do you assess a play? By what the play says and how it says it'. We might well ask: 'How do you assess a parliament? By what the Parliament says and how it says it'. Many of New Theatre's issues which I have outlined this evening are still very much current. Parliament, too, must remain a force for social change, not simply a talkshop.",185
198,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,ln this adjournment debate I want to refer to a question that was asked earlier today by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the answer that was given by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin). The question was asked by someone whom we regard as a rejected member of the Queensland State House and the answer was given by a Minister who wasted the time of the House with a fairly shoddy personal attack on a Queensland grazing family and a Queensland Minister of the Crown. It was shoddy because both the question and the answer came from this coward's castle where no opportunity of response is given to the person being attacked.,186
199,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,It was a dorothy dixer.,186
200,Mr BRAITHWAITE AITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, it was a dorothy dixer too. It was a wasted question because earlier in the day the Queensland Minister, Mr Neil Turner, responded in the Queensland Parliament to a question that had been asked by the State Opposition Leader on this subject last week. It was answered in such a way that the Labor Party and the Leader Opposition did not ask a supplementary question, to which they were entitled, and the whole thing fell rather flat because no further explanation was required. For cheap political purposes the Minister for Primary Industry, for whom I have a fair regard, allowed himself to be used and reduced himself to gutter tactics against a person in Queensland who could not defend himself. This episode reveals two things. First, the Minister obviously has no understanding of or empathy with the man in question, who is trying to survive on the land. He does not understand the great problems that are occasioned after a four-year drought of forced sales and stock deaths, or the impact of the Government'shis Government's-interest rates of 20 per cent or better on those who live or try to live off the land. In fact, he had time to quip about the use of the term 'national disaster'. I can assure him that those who live in the drought country find that it is no laughing matter to have this issue treated so lightly. Secondly, it brings to question the professionalism of a senior public servant in Queensland in making this information available, together with personal and financial details of a bank client, which a customer would consider should be confidential and secure. I understand that there are police investigations under way into the activities of the public servant who is believed to have leaked the information. The facts of this case are very interesting. The Assistant General Manager of the Queensland Agricultural Bank twice recommended the loan to the Behan family to the Board. On the second occasion, he said that the one difference between the two applications, both of which he recommended, was that the possibility of actual viability was better documented and, in the case of natural disaster funds, the purpose for which funds were sought came within its general guidelines. The Minister made great play of the fact that the bank, or the banker of the person in question and the pastoral house, had refused to fund the reconstruction. Perhaps the Minister does not know that under his own guidelines such refusal by the bank and the pastoral house is the first step in applying for natural disaster funds. In fact, after the case the bank has ceded $60,000 of its first security to the Agricultural Bank and the pastoral house has lent further funds in addition. The $160,000-as I understand it, the amount of the loan-was for $60,000 carry-on funds, which is quite normal, $40,000 to restock after the disaster of the drought and $60,000 for reconstruction. The loan was not a one-off operation by the Agricultural Bank. I understand that since March 1986 12 loans have been approved under normal lending procedures, ranging from $200,000 to $820,000. Seven loans have also been made available from natural disaster assistance, ranging from $170,000 to $500,000, all in excess of the amount lent to the Behan family. I am concerned about the Minister's allegation of corruption based in this case on absolutely incorrect leaked material. I will reject that where the allegation is made on that flimsy type of material. It is based on the fact that the Minister had no real experience, knowledge, or feeling for the families, the men and women, on the land. I challenge the Minister to go out to some of these forgotten places, to the areas in the central and north-west Queensland where Mr Behan's property is and the local shire is still drought declared. This area has been drought stricken for the past four years with the exception of only 10 months. I challenge him to go out and see what it is all about.",186
201,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,187
202,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday, 12 September, most of Australia's major newspapers carried a report from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) that some one million rounds of ammunition were stolen from an Australian factory and shipped to Tamil terrorists in Sri Lanka. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in answer to a question from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) today dealt with the absurdity of this claim. I suggest that there was another reason for the claim being made last Friday. On Thursday, a document was released by Amnesty International documenting the disappearance of 272 Tamil people from Sri Lanka. The report also documents the abuse of human rights, the use of torture and killings, by the forces of the Sri Lankan Government. It was just too convenient for the Leader of the National Party to release his story the morning after the Amnesty International report was released and thus deny this report the coverage it deserved. The Sri Lankan High Commission received a copy of the report a few days before it was publicly released. There was also a meeting between the High Commission in Canberra and officials from Amnesty International about the report. The High Commission knew when the report was to be released and the publicity it would gain. I suggest that the reports about the missing ammunition were an attempt to divert attention from the contents of the Amnesty International report. I am most surprised that after the one-day wonder of the Leader of the National Party's report the Amnesty International report has received no publicity in the Australian media. We know from the reply today by the Minister for Defence that after the Press conference last week by the Leader of the National Party to announce his startling revelation, the reprecharge sentative of a Canberra lobby group, Carney, Hocking and Associates, was telephoning journalists advising them to telephone the Sri Lankan High Commission for confirmation of the story. That group is headed by Mr Carney, formerly on the staff of the Leader of the National Party. So now we know who the reliable source was who supplied the information to him. The plot thickens when we learn that this group has a public relations account with Air Lanka, and obviously close connections with the Sri Lankan High Commission here in Canberra. Despite the best efforts of the Leader of the National Party to divert attention from this report, I urge all honourable members to obtain a copy of the Amnesty International report entitled 'Sri Lanka-Disappearances'. It will enable them to better understand the plight of the Tamil people, which I raise in this House from time to time. It is a very delicate time in Sri Lanka with negotiations for a peace settlement going on, a peace settlement that all who have an interest in that country hope will come to fruition. At this delicate time. I have no intention or desire to criticise the Sri Lankan Government or its representatives here in Canberra, but I must say that this report from Amnesty International goes beyond the politics currently occurring in Sri Lanka. The report documents disappearances, torture and killings. I think it is incumbent upon the authorities from Sri Lanka to answer the very serious charges raised in this document. All members of the Parliament would do well to obtain a copy of the report from Amnesty International and study it carefully.",187
203,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Whilst pensioners and the aged are asked to tighten their belts, the Government has in this most recent Budget increased expenditure on some of its pet projects. Although I will not be referring to very large amounts of money relative to a Budget of $60 or $70 billion, I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that to a pensioner who is out of pocket $80 or thereabouts as a result of the deferral of pension increases, the amounts of money I will talk about tonight are pretty significant. As a preliminary I make two points. First, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has announced that we will abolish the Commission for the Future, and that is a commitment I am very pleased to support. Secondly, the comments I want to make tonight are no reflection on the two journalists whose names I will raise. I will give the House some figures. The Commission for the Future has had its funds increased this year by 50 per cent. It is no wonder that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), has been going around the country, three weeks after the Budget was brought down, saying it is not good enough because it did not cut hard enough on the expenditure side. The third most senior member of the Government has already crippled the Government's Budget. So there is a 50 per cent increase in funding for the Commission for the Future, and a 10 to 15 per cent increase in consultants' fees.",188
204,Mr NA BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,Are they fortune tellers?,188
205,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, fortune tellers, as they are properly described by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Some time ago I asked for a list of consultants who had received funding in the 1985-86 year. On the basis of the papers provided to me under the Freedom of Information Act, in 1985-86 the Commission engaged consultants to the value of $146,293. The projects included the production of an annotated bibliography partly entitled 'A Select Bibliography', which cost $5,200 and which one would have to say was select in every sense of the word .. Another journalist prepared a written report on education futures that was so good the Commission paid $2,500 for it. In fact, if he had written the same article in the Melbourne Age, for which he writes, we could all have had it for 40c, which would have been quite a bargain. I suppose one might ask what these people know about the future. Quite frankly, I do not really know what more these journalists know about the future than anybody in this chamber, although one of the journalists engaged was once a weather man with one of the television stations. I suppose he at least has had some experience in predicting the future. I thought the House would be interested in some of these contracts. After I got the list of consultants I lodged a further application under the Freedom of Information Act for details of the consultancies.",188
206,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Was the Government helpful?,188
207,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"In fact, I had to lodge an appeal because I did not get the documents within the time prescribed by law, which gives the House an indication of the Government's real attitude to freedom of information. The documents were here when I arrived in Canberra today, so I have had a chance to have a quick look through them. The contract with Kenneth Davidson, who writes for the Age, is interesting. The contract is dated 6 August 1986 and states: The Consultant shall provide to the Commonwealth a written report . . . covering the issues for the future and education that arose from the conference . . . What does a consultant have to do for his $2,500? He has to attend three briefing sessions-I suppose that is something-and then he has to 'synthesise the input'. If we could define what 'synthesise the input' meant we would all be well advanced. The report was to be 6,000 words in length and Kenneth Davidson was to get about $350 per thousand words. If that is of some interest, Mr Charles Wright of Coldstream, to whom 1I have spoken and who 1 must say seems a very reasonable person, has done considerably better. He is getting $500 for every thousand words. That is SOc a word. His obligations are set out in an agreement of 13 August which 1 thought was pretty instructive. The first requirement was for him to attend the seminar. 1 would have thought that was the least he could do.",188
208,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,189
209,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak to the House and to the people of Australia, particularly the people of Queensland, about the fraud and deceit of the National Party Government-Mr Smith-Careful.",189
210,Mr GA YLER,ADJOURNMENT,"1 will be careful about it. I refer to the National Party Government of Queensland. 1 notice that when I say that, honourable members opposite, especially those from the Liberal Party, are nodding and agreeing with what I say. Earlier this evening the honourable member for Dawson tried to sweep under the carpet the unfortunate loan of $145,000, most of which was Commonwealth money, to someone who we now understand is one of the directors of the National Party in north Queensland. Once again, 1 see members of the Liberal Party nodding and accepting that this is what is going on in Queensland. It is clear that what we have in Queensland is a very simple fact of fraud and deception. Not only is Mrs X convicted and now spending 20 months in gaol, although the judge said that she should be allowed out after eight months, but Mr MCKechnie of the Department of Sport has said: 'After you had brought it to my attention, we now seem to have another fraud and deception on the taxpayers of Queensland within my Department'. But it took Mr Warburton's ability to bring it to his attention before anyone commented on it. Although we do not have any accounting in Queensland, what we do have-it is very simple-",189
211,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,What about the Auditor General?,189
212,Mr GA YLER,ADJOURNMENT,The Auditor-General-the honourable member would not even be able to spell it.,189

214,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"Would you ask him to spell it, Madam Speaker?",189
215,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Madam Speaker, I find the comment by the honourable member for Leichhardt offensive and I ask for it to be withdrawn forthwith.",189
216,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The comment was not unparliamentary.,189
217,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"And he still is not able to spell it, Madam Speaker. But when one comes from the simpleton area of southern Queensland, it is an unfortunate fact",189

219,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"Ask him to spell 'simpleton', Madam Speaker.",189

221,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Madam Speaker, I ask that I be heard on the subsequent point of order. I find the later comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt offensive and I ask that they be withdrawn.",189
222,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will withdraw the later comment.,189
223,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw, Madam Speaker. 1 suppose that 'simpleton' is a word that we could spell amongst us",189
224,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will continue with his speech.,189

226,Mr GA YLER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Menzies-,189
227,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! Will the honourable member for Leichhardt stick to the point and ignore the interjections.,189
228,Mr GA YLER,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Madam Speaker. What is happening in Queensland is despicable and the people of Queensland will show that they despise it in their voting habits in the very near future. Those who have raised objection here this evening will have to go out and sell what is happening to the people in their electorate. The matter is quite simple. Nationals are chasing 36 per cent of the people. Unfortunately, they will not get 36 per cent of the people-",189
229,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,We will get 50 per cent.,189
230,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will ignore the interjection.,190
231,Mr GAYLER,ADJOURNMENT,"We need not worry about 50 per cent. In conclusion, I say that it behoves me to stand here to appeal to the people of Queensland not to accept what is being put forward in the form of space centres in far north Queensland-",190
232,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,190
233,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"I shall not dwell on the disgraceful and inaccurate comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) other than to say that his comments were nothing compared with the deception perpetrated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in respect of the national economy, which eventually led him to admit the error of his ways when he uttered those famous words about a banana republic. I too would like to refer to Queensland as it has been mentioned here tonight. I point out that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) weighed into Queensland and made an atrocious attack on the Premier, Sir Joh BjelkePetersen. It has backfired and it will be shown how much it has backfired on polling day. It follows the attack made by Prime Minister Whitlam in the early 1970s, when he referred to Sir Joh as a 'bible bashing bastard'. That also backfired, and Hawke's attack falls into the same category. It all arose over allegations in respect of terrorism. I think it is time that we started to look at the facts in terms of the support of various honourable members and the Federal Government for certain organisations. In proof of certain aspects of this, I bring forward a letter dated 3 February 1984, which reads: Dear Colleague We understand that you have recently received a request for assistance from the African Liberation Trust Fund. We appreciate that you receive many such requests for aid because it is widely understood that the unions are key supporters of the struggle for human rights and liberation from oppression. But we would ask you to give a very full consideration to the appeal for financial support for the African Liberation Trust Fund. With the struggle in southern Africa moving towards a climax our support can help reduce the length and intensity of the conflict. The Federal Government has given its blessing to the establishment of an Information Office for the African National Congress and SW APO. It remains for us to provide the support that will sustain this office and make it effective. It is signed, 'Yours sincerely, Dr Neal Blewett, Minister for Health; Greg Crafter, Minister for Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs of South Australia; and John Scott, MP, member for Hindmarsh'. They are the three signatories to this letter, which shows clearly that these members of parliament and a Minister of the Federal Government, then and now, appealed for support for the African National Congress, the South West African People's Organisation and the African Liberation Trust Fund. Furthermore, I submit to the House that involved in this is a very nasty conspiracy, because it is clear from the first paragraph of this letter that it was designed to be a nicely timed followup to the original letter seeking donations. Therefore, it was done on a highly organised basis involving the complicity of the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott), and the Minister of the South Australian Parliament. They ought to be ashamed of their action in relation to this matter. This communication completely vindicates the comments made last week by the Premier of Queensland in respect of this issue. The support of the Federal Minister for Health in this matter is disappointing. He has signed the letter particularly as Minister for Health, and the letter refers to the Federal Government and the need to sustain support for the ANC and SW APO. Of course, we all know the sort of terrorist action in which SW APO is involved in South Africa. Obviously the Prime Minister was trying to camouflage the real position in respect of the economy-what the Government is doing in relation to the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and the cutbacks being perpetrated on war widows-by his action in Queensland last week. The attack of the Prime Minister on the Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, will clearly backfire.",190
234,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,190
235,Mr SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to thank the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who has just sat down, for advising me that he was going to raise this garbage in the House tonight. I raised this matter in the House on 25 March 1985. It is recorded at page 858 of Hansard. I am quite happy to repeat what I said because I think it is very telling on the difference between the two groups here-the Government and the Opposition. I said at that time: I am pleased to advise this House of the fine work being carried out in Australia by such organisations as the Campaign Against Racial Exploitation. The driving force is Jim and Irene Gale, two wonderfully dedicated people. I interpose that, unfortunately, Australia is the sadder because of the passing of Jim Gale. But I am glad to say that the Government, in its sponsorship of peace awards, saw fit to find that Jim Gale in his dedication to the peoples of Africa in particular was a person worthy of being awarded posthumously a peace award. His work continues. I am extremely proud to have been associated with him and his wife at that time. I will continue to work with my colleague the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) in trying to do something for the oppressed people of South Africa. I went on to say at that time: There is also the work of Eddie Funde, the representative of the African National Congress. I try to assist as a trustee of the African Liberation Trust I point out that that is shown in my personal details that were tabled in the House not so long ago; so there is nothing sinister or mysterious about my involvement. I went on: I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his statement. I congratulate the Opposition shadow Minister for his support. I would be delighted to see more of my colleagues support the Campaign Against Racial Exploitation and the African Liberation Trust Fund. The reason I mentioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) and the shadow Minister at the time was that earlier in the speech I had said: In the period available to me I would like to address some specific matters of great concern to Australia's standing as a nation in today's world. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) has recently in this House condemned the outrageous killing of black people in South Africa on 21 March this year. Similar killings at Sharpeville were carried out by the South African Government 25 years to the day before these recent killings. The Minister, speaking on behalf of this Labor Government, reaffirmed the Government's total opposition to the injustice and inhumanity of apartheid. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), wholeheartedly endorsed this Government's statement. I applaud the shadow Minister for his stand. I hope he can hold that line. I want briefly to say that the letter referred to did have wide circulation. I think there must have been a bit of a mix-up in the mail because one of the recipients was a fellow by the name of Bruce Ruxton of the Returned Services League of Australia. Something must have happened with the mail because the letter to Mr Ruxton somehow got lost and it was only in the last six weeks that he received the letter. I presume he received it only then. He had the kindness to reply to me and express his views about organisations such as the South West Africa People's Organisation and the African National Congress. I responded and said that I was pleased to receive his reply. I reminded him of his recent tour of the Soviet Union and his very complimentary remarks about the Soviet system. Those remarks appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. I would be more than delighted at the right time to table that letter to Bruce Ruxton and his subsequent reply, because I think it is with that kind of dialogue, without the hysteria that one gets from Queensland Premiers who are senile, that one gets a proper appreciation of the issues.",190
236,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,191
237,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"1 do intend to speak on a matter relating to my electorate. Fund. However, I have just been advised of a letter dated 12 September 1986 from the South West Africa People's Organisation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) seeking assistance from the Government. The letter, referring to support required, states in part: The first concerns our need for help in training Namibians in preparation for their role in a future independent Namibia. This dispels any suggestion that SW APO is not a terrorist organisation. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott), who spoke a moment ago, stands condemned as a person who supports terrorism, along with other members of the Australian Labor Party. I fully support what the Queensland Premier has said and the people of Australia will no doubt condemn the ALP for its weak-kneed approach to terrorism in this country. We have the Palestine Liberation Organisation, SW APO and other organisations which are operating under the auspices of this Government. I now wish to refer to a problem experienced by a bus company in my electorate, Kangaroo Bus Lines, which in February 1985 received a letter of demand, a log of claims and working conditions, from the Transport Workers Union of Australia, the leadership of which in many cases comprises industrial thugs. The conditions that were asked of the company were ridiculous to say the least. Among other things the unions demanded a minimum of $1,500 a week for all employees, a minimum of $100 a week in addition to all other payments as extra payment, and a rest pause of 30 minutes for each hour worked. The reply from Kangaroo Bus Lines stated: Having read the enclosed claim, I find it hard to believe that any organisation could expect a privately owned bus operation to remain in business if it had to meet the conditions as stated in your letter of demand. If these conditions were forced upon us, we would have no alternative but to close down our operations and stand down all employees. The letter concluded in effectly informing the TWU that the bus company was not interested in being covered under a Federal award, and the company mistakenly assumed that this was the end of the matter. In May of this year a staff member of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations approached the company to inspect its business operations. Since it was established the business has operated on the understanding that it was covered by a State award; but, unfortunately, according to the inspector the business somehow had become subject to a Federal award. How could this happen in a democratic society? Quite simply, the union concerned managed to include the business in a Federal award through a tactic known as setting up a roping in dispute. The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations explained in its letter to me of 25 June: Federal awards apply only to actual parties to the dispute in settlement of which the award concerned was made. Federal industrial tribunals ordinarily have no power to add new respondents to an award by variation. Where it is desired to extend the scope of an existing award to new respondents, it is necessary first to create a new dispute or disputes with such employers on the subject matters involved in the existing award. Such a dispute is known as a roping in dispute and the award made in settlement is known as a roping in award. This ridiculous log of claims that no company could hope to implement effectively placed Kangaroo Bus Lines in dispute with the TWU. Kangaroo Bus Lines did not hear again from any industrial tribunal. It did not hear again from the union and it thought that was the end of the matter. But an inspector came from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. I was advised that Kangaroo Bus Lines had been roped into a Federal award and that come hell or high water there was nothing that Kangaroo Bus Lines could do about it except to apply for a variation of the award to exclude it from the award. I am certain that the people of Australia would agree with me that it is criminal that a union could drag in a business in this way without previously advising it that the matter was coming before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, resulting in the company being bound by a Federal award. That is a ridiculous example of excessive union power. Not only did the employees of Kangaroo Bus Lines not wish to be included in the Federal award, but it also was in their best interest not to be so included. They now face the prospect of losing their jobs because of the onerous conditions of the Federal award which Kangaroo Bus Lines is not able to afford.",191
238,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being II p.m., the debate is interrupted.",192
239,Dr BLEWETT,ADJOURNMENT,I require the debate to be extended.,192
240,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The debate may continue until 11.10 p.m.,192
241,Dr BLEWETT,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to make a few remarks in response to the remarks made earlier this evening by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I say first of all that I am particularly disappointed that the honourable member, for whom I have had considerable respect, should join the Premier of Queensland in idiocies and simplifications concerning the very difficult issue in South Africa. I have for a long time been sympathetic to the black majority in South Africa and their struggle for rights which all of us in this society claim and have. I have followed their struggle. Indeed, I suggest that the honourable member for Farrer should examine much more deeply the problem in southern Africa before he makes the kinds of comments to which he lent himself tonight. Having long had this attitude, I must say that, when I was in South Africa in 1980 and visited Soweto and saw the contrast between the living conditions in Soweto and those in much of white Johannesburg, I found it understandable that that society has enormous internal tensions and problems. It is no good simply talking about terrorism without understanding the deep problems of that society. But honourable members do not have to believe me on this issue. I refer to the following quotation: There is no peaceful legal means in which black people in South Africa can seek to exercise political pressure on the Government because all the legal means of exercising political pressure that we know in a country like Australia, have been successively denied to black South Africans. So, they can't do anything legally to try and make their point known. If I was living without any political rights of any kind, and if over forty years I and my parents had not been able to achieve any political rights, and if I was living in the state in which people were in South Africa, then I would say if people would not respond to normal political pressure then ultimately you can't blame them if they pick up arms. Those remarks, of course, were made by the exLiberal Prime Minister of this country. Again, he is someone who has been prepared to study and understand the problems in southern Africa. So when a group of Australians whom I very much respect, including my colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott), Cliff Dolan, Professor Manning Clark, Don Dunstan, and the Bishop of Newcastle asked me to join in a trust fund to raise money simply in order to fund the personnel in an information office in this country for the African National Congress and the South West Africa People's Organisation, I was happy and honoured to take part. I point out that the whole purpose of this fund has simply been to fund and provide support for the personnel of that office so that their point of view-the point of view of the black majority in South Africa-can be presented in that country. They do not have the resources that the Government of South Africa has. H is important to consider this when one listens to the honourable member for Farreran honourable member for whom, as I say, I have considerable respect-make his simplistic statements. One expects nothing better from the Premier of Queensland, but one does expect better from the honourable member for Farrer. One would hope that he would make the effort to listen to the arguments that the people are presenting through the information office of the ANC and SW APO. I welcome this debate, because one of the chief benefits of Sir Joh BjelkePetersen's utterances has been to arouse interest in this trust fund. I hope that this debate will do the same.",192
242,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The debate having concluded, the House stands adjourned until \0 a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11.04 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Young to move That, unless otherwise ordered, the following amendment to standing order 112 be adopted for the remainder of this session: Petition to be lodged with Clerk Standing Order 112 be amended to read112. Every petition shall be lodged with the Clerk by 5 p.m. on the working day previous to the meeting of the House at which it is proposed that it be presented. Mr Hurford to present a Bill for an Act to amend certain Acts and regulations relating to Superannuation and similar benefits, and for related purposes. Dr Blewett to present a Bill for an Act to amend various laws relating to health, and for related purposes. Mr Barry Jones to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 and the Science and Industry Endowment Act 1926, and for related purposes. Mr Macphee to move That this House(I) notes that the Commissioner of Taxation has issued ruling IT No. 2121 which(a) appears to tax contractors who form themselves into family trusts or companies as though they were individuals, and (b) was intended to catch those arrangements which amount to nothing more than deceptive practices; (2) expresses its concern that the ruling(a) appears to catch those family arrangements which have been legitimately established with the purpose of providing limited liability to family assets such as the family home or to provide a going concern legal entity for the contractor's business, and (b) has been employed in many cases by the Commissioner of Taxation to penalise contractors whose circumstances do not warrant such heavy-handed treatment, and (3) calls on the Treasurer to seek an urgent review of the ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation.
