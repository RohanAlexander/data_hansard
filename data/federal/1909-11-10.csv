1,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister what chance he thinks there will be of a fair presentation of the Financial Agreement to the electors by the Argus, a newspaper which is capable of a misrepresentation like the following? I quote from its Parliamentary report of yesterdayFive minutes before dinner time Mr Deakin crossed the floor and spoke a few whispered words to Dr Maloney. Mr Wise and Mr Australian Poynton were the only other Oppositionists present. The fact' is that I was sitting in front of the honourable member for Melbourne, and heard what the Prime Minister said to him, while the honourable member for Herbert was seated at the table, and there were, I do not know how many, other members of the Opposition in their places.

Australia, I am opinion that, if the South Australian Governand ment desires to make any subject, it should be made in the usual and recognised manner by the Premier of the State to the Prime Minister. I would point out that in 1901, the Engineers-in-Chief for Railways of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, at the request of the Minister of Home Affairs, met here to advise and report respecting this proposed railway. Amongst other important subjects that of the gauge was considered, and the report, which was unanimous, .and which was signed by Mr Moncrieff, recommended the adoption of the 4 f t . 8£ in. gauge. These reports were laid before Parliament, printed, and circulated, and no exception whatever up to now has been taken to the proposal.

13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parkes) [n.sihave - I listened to the speech of the honourable member for Mernda last night with great satisfaction. Its moderation and ness of tone-rememberin g the interjections which came from this side of the Chamber - sai d much for his self-control. though the Prime Minister indicated that his'amendment. ne wished to treat the matter in the same spirit, he spoke*with a vehemence which - have not seen equalled by him before .this Chamber. I strongly endorse the views put forward by the honourable member for Mernda, and think that I shall be able satisfy both the press and the public - the attitude of some members of the Libequite ral party towards him last night set a very bad example, seeing that for years past we have been twitting the Labour party and that of the Labour party. party with an intolerance and tyranny towards its individual members from which not caucus bound. we are desirous of freeing our political It has been a complete travesty of Liberal principles. When the position comes be thoroughly understood, and the public P has an opportunity to judge of the merits of the proposal, it will be acknowledged that it. is the little coterie which, from a. keen sense of duty, has separated itself from the rest of the party that has right - on its side. There is a tendency in human nature to adopt phrases, and then freedom. io forget what they mean, ultimately taching to them a signification quite reverse of the original meaning. I pubSished a work on Liberalism twenty-two years ago-it is to be found in the LibChamber. „ y-ar anc i the intervening period has served to confirm my views on the subject, Tn the dictionary sense of the word, a "" L i be r a l"" is one who advocates greater individual freedom. Being thus driven back to first principles, one naturally wishes to know how much freedom is it - being allowed to the members of the Liberal party. Is the fact that , members differ from the rest a justificaMinister tion for charging them with having broken .away from their party obligations ? I show, by criticising the text of the agreement, and quoting the utterances the Prime Minister at various Coni ferences, that what the Government now proposes, and what the honourable member for Mernda, and we who support him, take exception to, is diametrically contrary the understanding which brought the together. When, in a party of - fifteen break away from their compact, they justified in speaking of remained true to their principles as renegades? It is the fifteen who are the oacksliders. This view does not seem to quiethave occurred to some of those who took such exception to the quiet and thoughtful address delivered by the honourable member Alfor Mernda last night in justification of The Prime Minister began his speech by admitting-as he could I not.help doing-that the eight members in who voted for the omission of the word "" The "" at the beginning of the clause, as an indication that they would support the to proposal which has since been moved by that the honourable member for Mernda, were entitled to do so; and he even claimed that the admission demonstrated the differ ence between the constitution of the Liberal He said, m effect, "" Look at us. We are We are a party of life. 'ee men, who can do as we like. fl So far do I recognise the fact that I take no to exception to the action of those who suport the honourable member for Mernda. H a d he been content to say no more, I should not have cause for complaint. But I shall not for party or other considerntl0n s sink my life-long opinion as to the meaning of Liberalism. I still hold to the V l e w that Liberalism signifies individual Those who call themselves atLiberals have constantly claimed as a the ent that they are not bound by the mem t h o d s of tyranny and compulsion which hold sway on the other side of the",16
14,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,When you have lost that you have lost the party.,16
15,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the meaning behind the term "" Liberalism."" In choosing the word "" Liberal"" to designate the party, we did so because we regarded as signifying its primary principle, £ j that which differentiates us from the t s certain her side in this respect. The Prime ot very properly reminded the Conamittee of the fact that a number of the shall members of this party were allowed and Fusion willingly allowed to exercise a freedom of i the expression of their opinions. But n n s w o v r J do not seem to have affected the s attitude of certain members of the party, because last night I heard one of them constantly interrupting, in a very impatient to way, the utterance of the honourable memparty fa f Mernda, who had admitted that he o r twenty, knew of six members of the party who are would vote for the amendment if they were the five who only free from party ties. 5546 Constitution Alteration [REPRESENTATIVES.]",16
16,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very caddish thing to sav. Mr BRU CE SMITH - The honourable member had better apply that term to himself for having made such an observation.,17
17,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They do not like to hear the truth.,17
18,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable <and learned member does not take that statement as authoritative?,17
19,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . I cannot forget that in speaking on this matter last week one member of the party openly said in the chamber, "" I should prefer to vote ",17
20,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not want to mention any names. But the honourable member in question said, "" I should prefer to vote, if I were free, for a modification of this proposal to a term of years.""",17
21,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because , he said, . that would be better for the States. Mr BRU CE SMITH - The honourable member is quite mistaken.",17
22,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not.,17
23,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable try, member to whom I refer said distinctly that he would prefer to see an agreement which was for a definite time, and referring to my own State I may say that a good deal of pressure has already been attempted to be brought to bear upon me by members of the very organization which has selected me as a Liberal candidate. That is surely strange state of things to exist. I wonder whether there is such a thing as a recognothing nition of individual freedom. I am cerWhen, tainly not disposed to suppress whatever individuality I have, merely because a larger number of the members of the Liberal Fusion party who have, in my opinion, and as shall show, retired from their own party allegiance, are now wishing everybody for political reasons to do the same thing. No doubt, political reasons are very often a matter of great consequence, but they require to be very carefully weighed : should not be approached in an impulsive spirit. I venture to say that if the course which has been advocated by the honourable member for Mernda, and which thoroughly endorse, had been taken in the first place by the Prime Minister, it would have given him a reputation for statesmanstand it ? ship which the course he has taken will never obtain for him, because one of the first elements of statesmanship, I take i is a rational consistency. The other night I heard the honourable member for East articles, (Finance) Bill. Sydney proclaim an extraordinary doctrine. Of course each man will proclaim those doctrines which wili fit his own standards; but the honourable gentleman said that consistency was a substitute for intellect or brain power. I have been in politics nearly as long as he has been. It is now twenty-seven years since I first entered into political matters, and I am bound to say that . the older I grow, and the more I see of politicians, the more convinced do I become that consistency is a virtue which would be well placed in a great many more men than display it at present. Each man is free to choose between a consistent career, which he may look back to with, some satisfaction, and which, believe me, the public remember with equal satisfaction in reviewing a man's conduct in public life-h e may choose between that and doing what I once heard a politician say one ought to do- "" Watch the weather, and trim your sails to suit the occasion, remembering that the public do not take much notice of what you have done in the past."" As we are living in a free counthat is a matter for each politician to think out for himself. If the members of the Liberal party had taken up the attitude which the Prime Minister took up last night; and if that honourable gentleman and his colleagues had practised that attitude in every case towards the outside world and the members of their party, I should a have merely said, "" l a m sorry that I differ from the members of my party, but I have to say in regard to their conduct."" however, their criticism takes the form of practically charging the few who disagree with them, but who adhere to the party's policy, with being backsliders I and renegades, ancl then arrogate to themselves the virtue of being at all events grouped together in a large number; then I think it is necessary to remind the public of the real position, because, as the honourable member for Mernda said last night, the they people outside do not yet understand the issue, and the press either do not understand it or do not allow their knowledge to influence their criticism, as I shall show in I a few minutes.",17
24,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the Age under Mr BRU CE SMITH - I can show that t , only five months ago the Argus, which is today publishing partisan and impertinent in regard to this matter, actually advocated the very thing which the amendment is proposing. Of course, a newspaper is a great power. As an advertising and news sheet it circulates widely throughout the country. VVe know from the history of the Australian press that newspaper influence has sometimes been very fatal to some politicians. I confess I have never allowed it to frighten me. The man who sits in a newspaper back parlour, with comfortable surroundings, and who, possibly, is quite unknown to the outer world, but who pens an article which, by reason of the advertising value of the newspaper, obtains a very wide circulation, which, probably, cannot be contradicted, no doubt exercises an influence beyond any politician. No matter what influence he exercises, we have a perfect right to expect the same consistency in a newspaper as we expect in a politician. If a newspaper has any influence with certain members of Parliament, they ought at least to look to see whether it has itself been consistent in its furtherance of the particular policy which it is advocating today. I was disappointed in the attitude which the Prime Minister assumed with regard to the division the other evening. I had had no interview with him in regard to the amendment. But I heard the honourable member for Mernda say in this chamber that he had consulted that honourable gentleman from time to time over the amendment, and that his reason for proposing to omit the first word of the clause was, not because he thought that would be effectual in altering its sense- I think he said that it would be an idiotic proposal-bu t because, with the approval of the Prime Minister, it was intended to usher in one of a more substantial character, which could be better understood, and which, if carried, would have a better effect.",17
25,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And which I indicated. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - On that occasion the honourable member read the amendment which he has since moved, and he stated that he had interviewed the Prime Minister from time to time, and that the latter had desired the amendment to take form, because the omission of the first word I understood him to say, would any serious responsibility upon the Government. I understood him to say, further, that if the amendment were carried, might, by indicating the opinion of the Committee, lead to steps being taken to obtain a modification of the agreement the Premiers of the States. The ment was carried, and the Prime Minister now contends",18
26,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member claim that the amendment was carried because a vote was given after a tie for the purpose of securing further consideration ?,18
27,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ' am coming to that, if the honourable gentleman will allow me.",18
28,Mr EISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,T t is a mere quibble.,18
29,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman at the head of the Government says now what he did say at the beginning of his speech yesterday. He does not consider that the amendment was carried. Well, it was carried sufficiently to make it law. The House has its rules, and one of them provides that if any matter in legislative form is carried in that sense, it becomes the law of the land.",18
30,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not then.,18
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member knows that if a Bill were carried in that way, it would become law.",18
32,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But there are other stages.,18
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not say at that stage. I am talking of the eflect of such a vote, because what will carryone thing will carry another. I am talking of the thing in its generic sense. . Mr Wilks - A majoritv of one carried many items in the Tariff.",18
34,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , very-many. I think it will be generally admitted by those who are now carping at my statement that if a Bill were in its last stage, and it were carried"" Try the vote of the Speaker, it would became law.",18
35,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is dealing with a contingency.,18
36,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member does not seem to grasp the principle which I am. trying to inculcate. It is all very well in such circumstances to say that the proposal is not carried. That stage bf the proposal is carried, and that is the stage which, if carried, the Prime Minister said he would consider as indicating that the will of the House, and that it might lead to him being able to obtain a modificanot throw tion of the agreement.",18
37,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable it member said that it became law.,18
38,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nothin g of the kind, i said it was such a carriage of that with particular stage of the Bill as would, at amendanother stage, have made it law.",18
39,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not the legal effect.,18
40,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not speaking of the legal effect. I am objecting to the exception which the Prime Minister has taken in saying that he is absolved from his undertaking because it was not such a passage as he approved. Mi. DEAKIN - How can the honourable member ask a Committee, which is evenly divided, to alter the course which it has taken? He would have one-half against him in either case.",19
41,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How can the honourable gentleman say that the Committee is evenly divided.? The Chairman has an option. ' Mr DEAKIN - Whic h he exercised for the avowed purpose of securing further consideration.,19
42,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He exercised it in the direction of carrying the proposal.,19
43,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,To secure further consideration.,19
44,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Had . the vote,19
45,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He could have voted with us, and yet have observed the same principle.",19
46,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then the honourable gentleman would have been a little more literal if he had asked the Committee to reverse its decision when the proper time had arrived. He now claims that he succeeded.,19
47,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . It was a tie.,19
48,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable gentleman calls upon the honourable member for Mernda to re-move his amendment. It can have no effect. I pass it hy,19
49,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He has now moved his amendment. ',19
50,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He has moved the amendment which, in effect, he moved before. He has moved the . very amendment which he indicated when he proposed to omit the first word of the clause. But I do not intend to spend further time over it. I think that the attitude which the Prime Minister has taken upand I do not agree with it- is not a fulfilment of that which he undertook to endeavour to obtain, namely, a modification of the agreement. Even if the Committee is evenly divided, does he for that leason want to pass a measure which would affect for all time the Commonwealth? Surely he wants a bigger majority than one or two. I pass it by. I was disappointed, because I thought from the way in which the honourable gentleman's attitude was explained, that he was prepared to go to the Premiers, remembering that the agreement had been approved of by them and himself subject to the approval of this Parliament. Does the honourable gentleman say that that division indicated the approval of Parliament? Was it not rather a failure to secure the approval of the Committee? And. that being so, was there not cast upon the Prime Minister an obligation to go to the Premiers of the States and to say to them, "" The approval which was a condition precedent to the acceptance of this agreement has not been secured"" ?",19
51,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"O r reverse the position,, and say that the Premiers should have gone to the Prime Minister.",19
52,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not go so far as that. I go only so far as to say that the Prime Minister would have taken a more judicious step had he gone to. the Premiers and said, "" I cannot obtain the consent of Parliament to this agreement, which is contrary to the Fusion arrangement. I made it with you without 'consulting .my party, and subject to the condition that it should be approved by Parliament. I will not undertake to drag my party after me, and to ask them to agree to something upon which they have nevei been consulted^ and which was arrived at by a Conference, the proceedings of which have never been published.""",19
53,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But how could the Prime Minister go to the Premiers in view of his statement that if this agreement is not carried, he will take it to the country ?'",19
54,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is to the agreement itself that we must look prir marily, and it has appended to it the state-, ment, "" Subject to the approval of Parliament."" Has Parliament approved of it? 1 Has not this Committee on a test vote failed to approve of it ? Figuratively speaking, I throw the Chairman's vote to thew^inds, so far as his opinion on the recent division is concerned, and say that the voting was equal. That being so, the Committee failed to aj-prove the agreement, and there'vas thus thrown upon the Prime Minister the obligation to go to the Premiers and to speak in the terms that I have just stated. In view of the result of the division, he should have said to them, ""Rather than drag my party behind, me in connection with an agreement concerning which they were never consulted, I shall ask you to modify it by declaring that it shall' operate for only a limited period."" He might well have said to thorn-, "" Fifteen or twenty years will see you all out. It will 1 provide snfely fo - all the States for at least fifteen years, and it is problematical whether, fifteen years hence, half-a-dozen of us will be here."" If that were done, we should leave with the Commonwealth Parliafor ment intact the obligation which the people put upon it. There have been many observawas tions with regard to changes of opinion upon this subject, and 1I have found in Hansard report of a speech delivered the honourable member for Gippsland, this Bill, an admirable collection of utterances of different public men this matter, which has saved me a great deal of trouble. I shall avail myself of the honourable member's industry. I desire the Committee to see where we are with gard to the Fusion agreement. I hope that honourable members opposite will not think that I am attempting to win their applause. They know exactly the value that 1 put upon it. I am speaking with the vindicating myself ancl those with whom I have co-operated on this side of the House. I desire to show where we, as a section of the so-called Liberal party",19
55,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,""" So-called?"" That unfortunate observation.",20
56,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The party may resume its reputation,20
57,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,When it agrees with the to Areplace honourable member.,20
58,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When it abides by the Fusion arrangement, to which honourable member himself was a party. Let me now quote from the Fusion agreeletter ment on this subject-to able member who interjects was a partyin order that we may see how far it is in keeping with this proposalPending the preparation of adjusting the future nnancial relation of the Commonwealth and States, an interim arrangeof You ment to be proposed, under which the Customs nowthis and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall Customs be dealt with. I have heard several observations from this side of the House with regard graph, some honourable members contending that it is not clear, and others that it contemplates only a temporary agreement conditionally. So it does. I shall show what it proposes, and how my interpretation of it harmonizes with all the utterances of the Prime Minister and a number of other politicians who' have been associated with this ' movement. It proposed in former speeches that the scheme for allocating the Customs revenue should be coupled with the ' equally important proposition for a definite arrangement with regard to the transfer of the State debts, the establishment of a sinking fund, and theunification of loans. Until all those proposition : could be dealt with in one movement 1 a settlement as between the States and the Commonwealth, an interim arrangement to be made with regard to the allocation of the Customs ancl Excise revenue. the I do not think that all members of the by Committee have studied this matter as on carefully as ought to have been done in the order to understand ifs real merits. upon If the statement. I have just quoted stood alone, one might differ over it, and say that it was not sufficiently clear to bind a party. But if honourable members will relook at the report of the utterances of the Prime Minister, when promulgating the policy of this same Federal Liberal party in the Melbourne Town Hall, they will find that he said that one of the platforms object of of the Fusion party wasThe assumption by the Commonwealth of the public debts of the States, accompanied by an. sinkingequitable scheme for providing interest and fund. is an The Fusion agreement was made in May last, and in June we hacl the following statement in the Ministerial announcementtemporary arrangement for a term of years the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. the We are now in November, and on 30th June last the Prime Minister addressed a to the Premier of New South Wales, which the honorin which he saidIt is highly desirable that this complex question shall be simplified so that this Government can frame concise propositions for submission to the electors at our general ""election. a complete scheme He also said - 1 are probably aware that, in the opinion Government, any attempt to determine the future distribution of the revenue from and Excise would, for practical reasons, require to contemplate some fixed period for which the circumstances can be forecast with to that paraconsiderable confidenct..",20
59,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That sounds like a paragraph from a speech by the Governor General .,20
60,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is an extract from a letter addressed by the Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales, in the month following that in which the Fusion agreement was promulgated.",20
61,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The letter was sent to the Premier of New South Wales inviting him to attend the Conference.,20
62,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . When the Fusion agreement had been drawn up, and had been impliedly assented to by this party, the Prime Minister addressed this letter to Mr Wade, in which he reminded him as late as 30th June last that, to paraphrase his letter, the Fusion could consent to only a temporary scheme for the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue until some wider arrangement was made for dealing with the whole financial question. Again, the Prime Minister, writing on 9th July, in reply to a letter from Mr. Wade, statedThe propositions to be submitted to our electors will consist of a general statement in our platform of the views of this Government in respect to what may be termed a permanent settlement of the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. Should the preliminary financial arrangement for a term of years-allude d to in my last letter-fai l for any reason to pass this session, that also would be submitted, and in a precise shape As you are avyare, neither one nor the other need be ingrafted upon the Constitution in order to come into full effect. That discloses an extraordinary position. Here we find the Prime Minister, who is leading a party, 'some members of which are twitting five of their number who happen to have differed from them over this matter, proclaiming in June, not only that an arrangement with regard to the distribution of revenue should be of a temporary character, pending a - settlement of what I in my previous speeches spoke of as the big outlying problems between the States and the Commonwealth, but that it need not be ingrafted in the Constitution ! Honourable members will recollect that f gave as one of my reasons for objecting to a permanent settlement of trie question that we had in this agreement a. statement of what the Commonwealth was going to give, but that what it was going to get in return had never been defined. The Premiers of the States, under this .agreement, have consented only to an investigation with regard to the transfer of certain of the State debts, and honourable members will doubtless recall my comment, that to ""consent to an investigation "" is about as vague as a promise by a Minister to a deputation to "" take the question into consideration."" We thus find that the Prime Minister not only informed the Premier of New South Wales, when inviting him to attend the Conference, that any arrangement made must be of a temporary character, pending the settlement of the bigger problems, but that he also said that there was no reason why the arrangeMr Bruce Smith. ment should go into the Constitution.",20
63,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are the only loyalists to that agreement to be found on this side of the Chamber.,21
64,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ha d the Prime Minister come to his party and said, "" Gentleman, - I have declared myself in favour of a limited arrangement. It is an arrangement that need not necessarily be embodied in the Constitution, but for party or political purposes I have come to the conclusion that it is desirable to make a permanent adjustment of the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth, and to embody it in the Constitution; "" and if his party had then discussed the matter and consented to the adoption of that course, the position would have been different. But the recent Premiers' Conference which was attended by the Prime Minister was a secret meeting. Its proceedings have never been published. It is true that a document has been published, which, if my memory serves me accurately, is called The Proceedings of theConference. But I have read that document from beginning to end, and from the first cover to the last it does not contain the slightest indication of what took place at that Conference. The press have not been vouchsafed even a summary of its proceedings, such as even the most secret Conferences in England are accustomed to supply to it. Honourable members will recollect that when the Imperial Conferences are held in London, a sort of - precis is handed tq the press, which contains the substance of their deliberations. But nothing of that sort has been vouchsafed either to the press or the people, or to the members of the party who are now asked to be bound by its conclusions, quite regardless of the contrary principles to which they have alreadv acceded. Honourable members must recognise that at more than one Conference of Premiers the principles for which I am contending have been contended for by the Prime Minister, and by his Treasurer. Sir George Turner's name stands very high in the estimation of Victorian people, and I propose to quote what he said at the Premiers' Conference in 1904 as throwing light on this problem. Honourable members' will recollect that over and over again the Premiers of the States have urged that the control of the Customs and Excise revenue should be taken out of the hands of the Commonwealth, or that that revenue should be allocated in such a wav as would very much modify, if not entirely abrogate, that control. Upon the occasion in question, Sir George Turner saidBut I cannot go to the Federal Parliament and say- "" I want you to extend the Braddon section for all time."" Parliament would regard the perpetuation of the operation of the don section as altogether against the principles of the Federation, namely, that the Commonber wealth Government should' have absolute trol and should be credited with a desire do what is right and just. . . . . frankly that in my opinion the Federal liament as at present constituted, and as lieve it will be constituted in the future, not indefinitely extend the operation of tion. VVe all recognise that Sir George Turner's name is a power in Victoria, because he is credited with having extricated this State from a position of very great nnancial difficulty. I come now to the principles which but were enunciated at the same Conference by the Prime Minister. He saidThey (the people) have two agencies. I ask honourable members to listen to the quotation which I am about to make, beter saidcause it contains a piece of very close reasoning. In it the Prime Minister did not Constitution, talk, as he has done lately, of this Parliacould ment disregarding the future, because the people of the States are identical with the Constitution, citizens of the Commonwealth. He recognot nised that in the future politicians would proposal. have the handling of this question before it was remitted to the people, and that occabecause sions arise-as I shall show presentlyWhen politicians fight, not for what is best for Australia, but for what is best for body politic in which they are concerned. He saidThey (the people) have two agencies. In one case they are represented in part ent agents, and in the other case they are represented as a whole by another set of agents; and as we know in business, even when the interests of the principals are the same, there may lie a difference between the interests of the agents. The Prime Minister continued. where the politician comes in. Your proposal amounts to this : that we should amend the Constitution in order to give a sanction in it to any agreement arrived at now in regard to the disposition of the Customs and Excise revenue, requiring that alteration to be hereafter When the Prime Minister had reached this point, Mr Kidston completed the sentence for him by adding the word ""ratified."" That gave the cue to the Prime Minister, right, who, as we all know, hns a very quick inment tellect; and he then saidFirst o[ al! it is ratified before going into Constitution, but the effect will be lhat it couid not be altered without another appeal to the people. That is the Number two situation which the Prime Minister slid over so skilfully last night, as if it were very thin ice. He was Bradeloquent and vehement in regard to Numone situation, as to the giving up of conrevenue, because all would be in agree to ment with him. VVe were waiting for 1 say Parhim to come to Number two fence in re1 begard to the termination of that allowance. will I was anxious to see how he would, as the the secAmericans say, ""negotiate"" that' fence when he came to it.",21
65,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He stumbled at it.,22
66,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , his voice was louder than ever when he reached it, his logical display was entirely wanting. He skimmed over it as a skater skims over thin ice. When Mr Kidston, in his anxiety to get his proposal adopted, completed the Prime Minister's sentence for him by adding the word "" ratified,"" the Prime MinisFirst of all it is ratified before going into the but the effect would be that it not be altered without another appeal to the people. That means the insertion in the so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, of a condition which is at present, there, and, so far, it is a new . . . . Personally, I am not inclined to say "" n o "" to your proposal, you are going to the one party interested-the people of Australia; still, it is a new proposal. the Then the valiant Treasurer, Sir John Forimmediatelv rest, interjectedVery clumsy, I should tliink. Further, at the Brisbane Conference in by six differ1907, the Treasurer said I am willing to go a good way, and the Commonwealth, I may say, are willing to go a good way so long as we do not infringe what I may consider the basic provisions of the Constitution.",22
67,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hav e we not. heard all this before? That is,22
68,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is such a regular attendant that he could not well avoid liearing everything that is said. But all the members of the Committee are not so regular in their attendance as is the honourable member, and therefore, I propose to again recite the facts. The Treasurer further saidWhatever may be thought as to the moral there is no doubt, after 1910, the Parliaof the Commonwealth has legal power to deal with the revenues of Customs and of Excise in the way that it considers fair. ' -. the The return to the States should be on such .1 basis as it thinks, fair I may say at once, on behalf of the Commonwealth, that it seems to us to be an unreasonable provision, and one that we could not under any circumstances agree to. It seems to me that it shows a disregard for the Constitutional position. It seems to show distrust of the Commonwealth, and to place the Commonwealth in fetters which are not in the Constitution.",22
69,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that?,23
70,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The identical Sir John Forrest who was the Prime Minister's colleagueBut I intend to quote still more matter of equal interest if the Committee will grant me their indulgence. At the same Conference the Prime Minister saidNo, it was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this should be the Constitution, and it would be a strange idea for the Parliament of Australia to say to the people- "" We ore not competent to handle this great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it . "" We, who represent the same people and the same electors; we, the Commonwealth Parliament, say-""Tak e back this power; we are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" Is there any alteration in the logic of the situation in 1909 as compared with 1907?",23
71,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The ' honourable member is wrong both as to the person and the dates. I did not attend the Premiers' Conference in 1907. Several Honorable MEMBERS - It the Treasurer.,23
72,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I see I should have quoted from the Treasurer inyou look stead of the Prime Minister. rate, the quotation seems to me to express exactly the principles' for which the Prime Minister contended two years ago. It was then recognised that this question is a complex one, and that the people are busy. It is an easy matter for honourable members to exclaim, "" Trust the people."" But those who urge that, do not speak of supplying them with a copy of the Constitution, or of taking them away from their ordinary avocations, and of - instructing them as to the meaning of all this mass of technical verbiage, and as to what its effect is likely to be on the politics and finances of the States. They do not do that, but they repeat, in a general ancl advertising manner, "" Trust the jpeople! "" I have no doubt that the local politician, in a country town, will reply, "" That is the man for me; he wishes to trust the people."" But that type of local man has probably never looked at the Constitution in his life, and, if he did look at it, he would in some case's not understand it. I should think he would be foolish to leave his business in order to engage in a study of it , unless he had some political ambition. But that is not the whole. I now desire to show that the interpretation which the words in the Fusion compact unmistakably bear, is the same interpretation which the Prime Minister has always contended for. The words arePending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relation of the Commonwealth and States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. At the 'Conference of 1906, when. Mr. Evans was Premier of Tasmania, the Prime Minister had something to say in answer to that gentleman. He observedThat is one arm of the subject complete in itself, but tliere is another arm; both are essential. What the Federal Parliament desires, su far as I understand, is, if possible, to clear up all the unsettled financial problems between the States and the Commonwealth. The taking over of the debts of the States is one of the most important provisions in the Constitution.",23
73,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No doubt about that.,23
74,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Further Hut I can set Captain Evans' mind at rest by saying that he has quite correctly understood the purport of the remarks that have been made by Sir Jonn Forrest and myself. In the view of the Commonwealth, not only the consideration of the debts question, but its final deterwas mination, is the essence of the contract. To use Captain Evans' own words, it is an imperative part of the scheme, and I do not think he needs any explanation from me to tell him why. If at the proposals altogether as in everv At any other take. negotiation, it is a question of give and I ask the Committee to listen to these few words in particular. The honourable gentleman continuedNow, so far as you ore concerned, the proposals relating to the Braddon clause and your future revenue from Customs are all "" take"" on your part, and "" give"" on the part of the Federal Parliament. It is only when you come to deal with the debts question that you balance it. You have to ask yourselves the question what you will give up on that point, and what the Commonwealth can fairly take in the interests of Australia as a whole. Honourable members will see that the Prime Minister was here recognising what he indicated in the Fusion, agreement,' aiid ivhat most of us understood by it, - namely, that "" all "" these financial questions must ultimately be dealt with, and that until they were embodied in some scheme for a final - settlement, the allocation' of the Customs and Excise revenue should be for a limited time, or, as said in the agreement, there should be "" a n interim arrangement."" I have already quoted one observation of the Prime Minister, to the effect that there was no need to put the agreement in the Constitution; and the honourable member for Swan, at the Conference in Brisbane, in 1907, saidNow we have had four previous Conferences, ancl at all of them the representatives of the people of Australia have said they believed the States debts should be taken over, because they believed, and the framers of the Constitution also believed, that a great saving to the people of Australia would result. I fear that Parliament will not do anything in' these great financial matters unless we do it as a whole. They will not do it piece-meal. Do honourable members note that ?To deal with one-half of the financial problem, and leave the other half, will not commend itself to them. The two matters cover the whole of the financial problems . . . and in the opinion of the Government and the Parliament they should be dealt with together. The Prime Minister saidThe point I wish to make at the outset, is 'hat, looking back, one is struck by the repeated references made during the course of the Convention debates, at which the present Constitution was shaped, to two things which were always considered together. One was the revenue derived from Customs in the Commonwealth, and the other was the interest on the debts which had been incurred by the States of the Commonwealth. . . . Speaking not so much legally, as generally, it appears to me that the clear meaning of the Constitution is that these two matters should be dealt with together. Even before that Convention, if I remember aright, - Sir Samuel Griffith had dwelt upon the necessity of considering these two factors together. The first suggestion I wished to make this morning, was that, at this Conference the time has arrived when the question should be approached from the other side-whethe r certain difficulties would not be removed, the intention of the framers of the Constitution better fulfilled , ancl other useful objects achieved, by considering once moTe the two questions together, that is the repayment of a portion of the Customs duties to the States and the obligations already incurred by the States in regard to their borrowings. In other words, one side of those questions having been frequently considered, and very full y considered, has not the time arrived when some stress- a great deal more stress than in the past-shoul d be laid on the debt side, and its connection with the problem? Personally, I have been putting that forward, and so has my honourable colleague, the Treasurer, almost since the commencement of the Commonwealth. These quotations, and many more which I could give, should satisfy the Committee that the meaning to be attached to the Fusion agreement is clearly that for which I have contended.",23
75,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think there ought to be a Minister in the Chamber-no t one is present.,24
76,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is possibly how the Ministry show respect to a supporter who does not agree with them; but I am quite reconciled to the position. It will have its effect, on honourable members, who will see how much the Government's regard for honourable members depends on the support that they give.",24
77,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not the wa.y to r get the third reading through !,24
78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It certainly is not, though, of course, the absence of Ministers may be an accident.",24
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Minister s have many engagements in the morning.,24
80,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was Ministers who asked us to meet in the morning. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - I am not complaining. I . only know that the extracts : before me show the opinions held by. Sir George Turner, the Prime Minister,  South Australia, and Mr Davies, Attorney-General of Victoria. There is also an expression by the Argus, which is an interesting journal, or claims to be. In August of this year, after the editor of the Argus had read the Fusion agreement, and before the Conference of Premiers, an article appeared. Of course, the Argus knows nothing of what took place at the Conference, or we may be sure it would have been published, because if a newspaper be given useful information, that information appears. What the Argus, which is now red hot in desiring a permanent allocation, then said",24
81,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Les s than three months ago.,24
82,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Les s than three months ago, the Argus saidThere is no reason why this Conference should not agree to a division of the Customs and Excise revenue which will provide for the needs of both States and Commonwealth, but which might be regarded as experimental for the three years following the next general election. Then, with such modifications as experience might suggest, it could be embodied in the Constitution. So we see that the gentleman in the back parlour, who writes these articles-if it be the same man-the n admitted that a little experience would be useful at the end of three years, whereas today he does not care a snap for experience, but says/ in effect, "" Let things come, and never m in d ; we should do it for all time without any further experience."" And we are supposed to bow meekly to this sort of guidance.! I desire the Committee and the public to know this fact-that three months is quite sufficient time for even a great organ of this character to completely reverse its attitude on these two questions-o n the placing of the agreement in the Constitution and on the enactment of it for all time. I now desire to read a most valuable and practical utterance by Sir Joseph Carruthers, who was present at the Brisbane Conference in 1907. Sir Joseph deals with a matter which the Prime Minister skimmed over so skilfully, though I have endeavoured in a logical sense to put him into the ice. Now, there is no more accomplished politician-and I use the word advisedly-tha n Sir Joseph Carruthers in Australia; and what he says is worth hearing as from a State politicianIt is a very serious thing to ask the Commonwealth of Australia to commit itself irrevocably to a scheme of finance between the Commonwealth and the States, the result of which no man here can forecast. Just look at our revenue for last year. It is beyond the expectations of any man in Australia.",24
83,The PRESIDENT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not irrevocable at all. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS - Not irrevocable; but we know how every few alterations have been made in the equally irrevocable Constitution of the United States. We know how difficult it will be if anything is put in the Constitution to get it amended under the complicated process provided by the Constitution.,25
84,The PRESIDENT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It would be very easy to amend it if it were causing nnancial dislocation -! made 30s. for a limited time. The mover That has been said here, ancl also by many people, namely, that if we have financial dislocation, the public and the States will come forward, with flags flying, and say, "" We wish to alter the Constitution in order to convenience the Commonwealth Parliament."" Sir Joseph Carruthers, who is a practical man, ancl has had to do with the needs of the interior of a great State, saidTake this contingency-that it is found that this arrangement works harshly and unjustly to two States, but works favourably to four States. That is not an unfair proposition, because we have been told that the population of seme of the smaller States is going to increase in a phenomenal way. We do not know whether the population of all the Constitution ? States is going to run parallel; but, at any rate, Sir Joseph Carruthers saidMr Bruce Smith. You have then to ask for an amendment of the Constitution against the interests of the people of four Stales and against the interests of the Treasurers of four States, and you have to get that amendment carried by a majority of the people in a majority of the States. You cannot do it. It will be far easier in dealing with a question of this character to get an amendment made by the Federal Parliament than it will be to' get an amendment made by the Federal people, because if you have got four States who are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and have only to appeal to their sense of - honour to give up something for the benefit of others, it w.ill be very difficult to carry the amendment, especially when some people may think that they would have to give up a certain amount of revenue over and above what they are justly entitled to surrender. It will be very difficult to get people lo do that in a young country where expenditure means everything-wher e a settler looks upon expenditure as meaning a road to his land, where expenditure means to another man the keeping up of the rate of wages or of keeping him in employment. It will be very hard to get people to set personal honour against personal interest, and that is what will be involved in an amendment of the Constitution. So that, Mr Chairman, we see that this little party which favours the amendment has on its side Sir George Turner, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Sir Joseph Carruthers, and the Argus of only a short time ago. What does this amend1 ment involve? I think that the honourable member for Mernda very wisely and discreetly claimed that he was entirely in favour of the principles of the agreement. So we are. Personally, I went so far as to say that I should not have minded seeing the amount of the fer cafita payment of the amendment says, in effect, "" We thoroughly approve of the agreement, as it has been assented to by the Premiers of the States and by the Prime Minister, but we object to it for all time. We say that if it be limited to an amount which will be equivalent to the aggregate interest on the debts existing at the time of Federation, say ^7,500,000-the exact amount is about ^£7,300,000, but let us put it in round figures-the arrangement should last until the population of Australia has reached 6,000,000. So that the amendment is one approving of the agreement in every particular, but limiting it to a period when the population becomes 6,000,000.",25
85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member put that provision into the,25
86,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are perfectly agreeable to its going into the Constitution.,25
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member does not mind anything that he approves of going into the Constitution.,26
88,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member will be generous enough to admit that I have said, over and over again, that I should prefer the provision not to eo into the Constitution. Let us be fair to each other in this matter. I went so far as to say that I thought there was a medium course between merely passing an Act and putting the provision into the Constitution ; that we might have adopted the method of passing an Act embodying an agreement such as we agreed upon in regard to the Naval Agreement, or as we propose to do in the case of the Northern Territory. I think it would have been far better-it would have been more consonant with the views of the Prime Ministei: expressed at the Conference to which I have referred-that the arrangement should not be embodied in the Constitution. I quite agree with Sir Joseph Carruthers that we must assume that this Parliament in the future will consist of honest and honourable men, who will recognise the primary purpose of the Braddon section to give to thu States a fair and proper proportion, having regard to their needs, of the taxation collected through Customs and Excise. That is what we are contending for. We endorse the agreement. We even go so far as to consent to an alteration of the Constitution, although I have shown a way of avoiding that difficulty. We give up our objections on that score. But we say, "" Do not let us bind ourselves for all time; do not let us, as the right honourable the Treasurer said, run contrary to the basic principles of the Constitution "" ; which is also what Sir George Turner said, and what the Prime Minister said at the last Conference. Therefore, we say, "" We give you everything, only limit the time."" The Prime Minister has admitted in oneof Ins utterances, and the Argus admits, which is perhaps more significant, that in the three years which would elapse between the time at which we enact this agreement and the time of the election after the next one, we should have much more experience to guide us. That is an argument which I have put in the two previous speeches which I have made. We have gained so much experience between 1901 and 1910 that we cannot arrogate to ourselves that our minds are finally closed to the reception of further data, and that we shall not be wiser in 1920 than we are today. We have gained so much experience between 1901 and 1910 that I should like to know of any member of this Committee who is so hidebound as not-to admdt that his views have not been modified by the added knowledge. We all know the relationship between the States and' the Commonwealth far better than we did, and we shall know them far better in 1920 than we do today. We shall know what the history of this young country has been in the meantime. Some people say that the younger States will remain stationary in population, and that their advance will not be in the same ratio ns it has so far been. We have other honourable members on this side of . the Chamber who say that there is going to he an abnormal development in .some of the Stales, and that this abnormal increase in population will make a great difference. We do not know what will be the actual state of Australia, in ten years from now. We are embarking upon a most comprehensive system of immigration. 'We have not been doing that for years. We do not know exactly where the people who come to us will settle. They will not settle where they are told to settle; of that I have always been convinced. They will choose for themselves, and we do not know how they will choose. The future is, therefore, an algebraical X , and the problem has to be solved by time and experience. Therefore, I maintain the wisdom of the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, that when the population of Australia has reached 6,000,000 we should have an opportunity of again looking round and seeing how it has placed itself - wher e the people have gone, what they are doing, what our Customs revenue is, what our Commonwealth needs are, what the needs of the States are; and out of the wisdom derived from that addition to our knowledge we shall then have an opportunity of making a fresh arrangement. If I have demonstrated, as I have tried to do, that our Fusion agreement was in accordance with the amendment which the honourable member for Mernda has moved, then I want to say that the only men in this Committee who are steadfast to the F'usion agreement are those who voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda last week, and those who propose to vote for the amendment now before the Committee. If we are going to refer to the old phraseology of St. Paul about ""backsliders,"" the backsliders «ot the men who are supporting this amendment, which is in accordance with question had risen to speak. the contention of the Argus of three months ago, and which is in accordance with the Fusion agreement, and in accordance with the declaration of the Prime Minister i 1907.",26
89,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is this amendment accordance with the Fusion agreement? Mr BRUC E SMITH - Yes . the honourable member has been out of Chamber, or has not been paying attention. Otherwise he would have heard me read what the Fusion agreement in relation the financial problem was. It referred an interim arrangement.",27
90,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does .the honourable member call this an interim arrangement?,27
91,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honorspeech ? able member had listened to mv argument, he would have heard me say that if limit be ^7,500,000, it will be reached when the population is 6,000,000; and .that according to the ratio of increase the past, that limit of 6,000,000 would probably be reached in fifteen years.",27
92,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is problematical.,27
93,Mr BRUC ESMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member cannot have listened to what said. I want to emphasize this point. I know that there is a good deal of soreness in the party because the supporters of the - amendment do not come to heel at once.,27
94,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Oh !,27
95,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will, if the honourable member does not like that pression, say, because we do not f all into this House but outside. line. I want to say that that old phrase of St. Paul about "" backsliders"" cannot apply to those who are in favour of the amendment. They are true as steel the Fusion agreement. That Fusion agreeStates. ment is the basis of this party's existence; and we, in moving and supporting this amendment, are acting in accordance with that has broken it . - that basis. Therefore, if .term of ""backslider"" can be applied to any members on this side of the House, it must - be applied to those who have abandoned the Fusion agreement, and not to those who have been loyal to it. If any . arose out of this crisis in breaking up Fusion, as we were told it might do, then - the blame would lie upon the heads of Prime Minister and of those members his party who have allowed him to break through his own compact.",27

It has been, made the text of sermons in the press, to not merely in this State, but in other Before anybody can make that charge it is his bounden duty to look at the terms of the compact, to see who it is I read in the F usion St. Paul's agreement the followingFending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future nnancial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth serious result shall be dealt with. the It seems to me that two things stand out .clearly in that sentence. The first is that the which the honourable member for Parkes o+' has laid stress upon-that the interim arrangement was to Ibe proposed pending the preparation of a complete scheme, and that the complete scheme necessarily in the cluded, as has been admitted by the language already cited from the Prime Minister's former speeches, the settlement of :the State debts question. The other point is that the words "" pending the preparation of a complete scheme,"" appearing in a ' documentof that kind, which embodies the terms of agreement between various sections of the House which were coming together to form one party, must mean the preparation of a formal scheme by the party, and not by the Government for the party.",27
101,Dr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is - reading something into it that is not there.,28
102,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It can have no - other meaning, for this reason : The gentlemen who came together to form the basis - of that Fusion agreement knew the conflicting views of several of us with regard to the financial question. They knew also that there were wide discrepancies with regard to other matters, such as new Protection, 'the Tariff, ancl naval and military defence, dealt with in the same agreement, but on the Tariff, on the question of new Protection, and on the defence question they did come to an agreement together which was to bind every memher of those three sections who became a member of the new party. to those questions we all became bound by the agreement, but on the finance question those who framed the agreement could not, and did not, come to any agreement to bind any of the members of the party, except that: they should agree to an interim arrangement until the party, as a party, ' could adopt some general scheme. That is the only meaning which in reason and fairness can be attributed to that sentence in the document, when we consider the circumstances under which the agreement was entered into. There is another matter. has been stated by the honourable member for Mernda, and admitted by the Prime Minister, that the amendment, upon which a vote which was taken the other day was submitted to the Committee in "" the form in which it was submitted as a test, the result of which the - Government were prepared to accept and act upon as an indication of the opinion of the Committee. If that amendment had been - carried by a majority of two, or even one, . without the Chairman's casting vote, I think the Prime Minister himself would have admitted that he was bound not to ignore it. But I claim that, as it stands, ' - it is in exactly the same position as if it had been carried by a majority of one vote, with one exception, and one exception only. Where the Chairman records his vote in order that the matter may be further considered, the vote of the Committee remains exactly . in the same position as any other vote given by a Cornmittee of this House, with the exception that the Government have a right, which I full y admit in this case, to again test the opinion, of the Committee if they choose to do so.",28
103,Dr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Othe r members of yourparty do not take the same view.,28
104,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I suppose the honourable member is entitled to make the kind of insinuation which is implied in the term "" your party,"" but I think the honourable member ought to deal with the matter, as other members ought if they desire to remain loval members of the party supporting the Government, in the same spirit as the Prime Minister did. We have been invited to consider this question. We were entitled to raise it , as loyal members of the party supporting the Government, and I ask the honourable member to accept the same position. The Prime Minister has said that he intends practicallv to ignore the vote of last week, With regard or, at all events, not to take any action upon it . Then the position comes to this: Another amendment has now been moved, and, even if that amendment be lost, still the previous vote stands, which, in effect, indicated that the majority of the Committee are not in, favour of the agreement in its present unrestricted form. At a very early stage of the discussion of this matter I gave my friends - wisel y or unwisely-to understand that, provided that we, who dissented from this Bill , had an opportunity of testing the It opinion of the House in Committee upon it, I , for one, for ihe purposes of the passage of the Bill through this Parliament, should accept that decision, and record my vote for the third reading. The matter has now been fairly submitted to the Committee in a way which was laid before the Prime Minister, and accepted by him as the proper wav of testing the opinion of honourable members. The'Government chose their own battlefield, and their own time to press for the division. They obtained it , and they obtained a vote which, as it stands, is a vote hostile to the Bill in its present form.",28
105,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hostil e ! By an official vote given in connection with a perfectly even balance.,28
106,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but there is no balance in favour of the Bill as it stands. There is, however, a balance against it in ihis way: If , instead of the omission of the word "" the,"" the effect of the amendment had been to make a substantial alteration in the Bill , could it be contended that the vote taken the other night does not, in fact, determine and make that substantial alteration?",29
107,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but the fact that there was an equal vote on either side left a further opportunity - which, in this particular form, is now Being used.",29
108,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Whateve r were the circumstances under which, personally, I bound myself to take a certain course, I shall carry out that promise, but it was a promise with a condition, and at present that condition is not fulfilled .",29
109,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will not this vote it? Mr W. H , IRVINE - No . We have been compelled, by the action of the Government in ignoring the vote taken the other night, to put forward now a particular scheme. It is quite possible that certain honourable members cannot accept the scheme put forward by the honourable member for Mernda, and yet are still of the opinion recorded by their votes the other night.",29
110,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That will be determined by the event. . Mr WH IRVINE - Not by the event of this division. Mr DEAKIN ; - I think so, especially it is found that every vote cast in a particular way then is again cast in that way presently.",29
111,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not want to bring before the Committee matters which are really more or less of a personal character, but, in view of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister of ignoring the vote cast by the Committee the other night, it seems to me to be right to mention that I have serious doubts as to whether that attitude is in compliance with the understanding arrived at. It is, however, I admit, always open to the Prime Minister, after a vote of that kind, to re-test the matter. If he does so, I for one, should have no right to complain that there was the slightest departure from the understanding. There is another matter, personal to myself, which I am rather reluctant to deal with. Charges of inconsistency have been made against me in connection with my present attitude, by people outside this chamber, and also in the press. I have never made it a practice to reply to such charges when made in the press or by people outside, but when they are made by my honourable friends inside this House, and, if not met, may have some influence upon them, I may be permitted to say a word in reply to them,. It is perfectly true that when I was Premier and Treasurer of - Victoria I took part in a Treasurers' Conference, which I attended for, I think, a week, although it lasted longer. I was then retiring from the Government, and my duties were continued by my successor. At that Conference, I put forward a proposal for the continuation in the Constitution permanently of the Braddon section. Nobody, I suppose, for a moment, dreamt, nor did I myself, that there would be the slightest decide chance of carrying such a proposal. My action at the Conference does, however, involve this, that I was at that time prepared to advocate, by a Constitutional amendment, a Constitutional security or guarantee to the States of something which they did not then possess, namely, an assurance of the fjermanency of the Braddon section.",29
112,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-That was a much fairer proposal than is the present agreement.,29
113,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I desire to say with regard to it is that, with all its defects-and , of course, it would have the extremely serious defect which has often if been pointed out, that, under the Braddon section, if we want to raise £ 1 , we musti impose taxation sufficient to raise £ 4 - that proposal for the permanency of the Braddon section would have been free from some of the most serious defects of this agreement. I , for one, would not dream now of advocating the permanency of the Braddon section. A great deal of water has passed under the bridge since the time of which I speak. I do not think that one of the State Premiers would dream of advocating such a proposal now, but that is the widest admission which can be charged against mc. As against that, I must say that from the moment I thought of entering Federal politics, and in the first speech I made on the hustings, as well as in every speech I have since made ih this House and the country, I have taken up a position which is entirely consistent with that which' I now hold. The honourable member for Fremantle has several times cited passages from a speech I made in 1907, but I think the honourable member does not fully underslight stand the position. The position I took then, ancl which I took up the other - when I spoke on this question, was that what I should personally regard as the best settlement of the question that could devised would be one which .would involve - a particular change in the Constitution - under which we should endow the State. 'Governments with a permanent amount of - revenue equal to the interest on the debts - at the time of Federation, reserving to ; Federal Parliament complete and untramParliament melled power to deal with the accretions from Customs ancl Excise that might natuto ral ly be expected in the future as a result of an increased population. That would 'volve, as honourable members will see at once, an amendment of the Constitution a limited extent. It might not be one would meet with the approval of honourable members, but it is what I endeavoured to put forward in 1907. The present profalse posed amendment practically gives that proposal, though it leaves to the Fedeia.1 Parliament power, after a certain to further modify the arrangement should circumstances arise to justify fication. I agree entirely with one stateorable ment made by the Prime Minister in the speech which he delivered yesterday. The 'honourable gentleman said that the real nel of the whole question is whether, i get the electors to assent we can ask the same electors to give us back the powers which we have at the present time, and which it is proposed, under agreement, to surrender. I think that practical question which and decide this controversy. If I believed, as the Prime Minister does, that we could ask the electors to give us back our with the facility with which we can now them to sanction our relieving ourselves those powers, I should withdraw my sition to this agreement. It is because do not believe we could do so that tinue my opposition to it. Minister, as the honourable member for Parkes has said, laid enormous stress, and States. has spoken with great eloquence and force, upon the difficulties that we have to face in asking the electors to .accept this agreement. To carry it - must receive the support of a certain jority of the people of the Commonwealth, and of a .majority in a majority of the of the smaller States. States. But when the honourable gentleman came to deal with the other side of the tion, as has been pointed out, he made alteration in the course of his aeroup plane, and sailed smoothly away from what day appeared to be a very dangerous obstacle. It is that obstacle which constitutes the'erux pf this question. It is not difficult to supbe pose that the people will sanction what we ask them now to do, because, as a Federal Parliament, we should come before them and say-""Pleas e will you allow us to hand over to the State authorities our powers, the State authorities being quite willing to the receive those powers?"" All that the Federal would have to do under this agreement would be to ask to be allowed relieve itself of certain of its powers, the State authorities with, becoming modesty inindicating that they would be quite prepared to assume the responsibility of exerto cising them. That we should be binding which ourselves must be obvious and palpable to the most inexperienced politician",29
114,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have generally been prophets so far as the operation of the effect to Federal Constitution is concerned.,30
115,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We may be false time, prophets in all respects, but I am not now made, prophesying. I am endeavouring merely a modito state plain facts from which I ask honmembers to draw certain inferences. Is it not perfectly plain that no difficulty will arise if the Federal Parliament ask to kerbe allowed to give up its powers, and the f we State authorities say that they are prepared to this agreement, to accept them?",30
116,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Surely the State Parliathis ments as such would not acquire any is the powers under our proposal, though the should dominate electors would.",30
117,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I venture to think that if this agreement is carried the powers State Parliaments will acquire additional ask powers of a most substantial kind. Before of I deal with that I should like to complete oppothe other statement. I wished to make. I Once we attempt to get our powers back I conagain we have to ask a majority of the The Prime States,30
118,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Of the electors in the,30
119,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A majority of the electors in a majority of the States. We should have to get the assent, not only we of a majority of the whole of the people, mabut also of what might be an insignificant minority who happened to be voters in four That seems tp me to be a constitutional block, imposing quesan infinitely greater difficulty in the way of a an effort to get back our powers again. To my mind that is the source of all the trouble.",30
120,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But where do the State Parliaments come in? They are not the States ?,31
121,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The real trouble would arise from another cause. In all political institutions-and this applies pecially where, as in a federation, political power is vested in more or less competing authorities-the power of government ultimately depends on public opinion. It rests on public attention. The particular body which can succeed in gaining public interest, and in concentrating public attention upon its operations, is the body which steadily and perpetually increases in influence and power. The body which is unable to do so becomes atrophied and paralyzed. If we place ourselves in a position in which we give up a large part, not of our money, but of our financial power, and place the State Parliaments in control of much greater financial powers than they have had before, and the right to continue the exercise of them-and this is in reply to the interjection of the Prime Ministerthen, assuredly, the State Parliaments and the State Governments will steadily arrogate and attract to themselves continually a larger comparative share of public opinion, and will concentrate to a greater degree public attention upon their operations, while we shall correspondingly sink to a lower plane.",31
122,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a splendid picture; it pleases the people opposite.,31
123,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member says that I have painted a splendid picture. Let me say that the Prime Minister accused us of taking too black a view of the progress of Australia. I do not take by any means a dark view of that progress. I say that, whether the Parliament of the Commonwealth or the Parliaments of the States are the dominant authorities of the future, Australia will continue its progress. Its progress cannot-be prevented. We are invested with a country the very nature of which is such that-unles s it were in the hands of a people without energy and without resource, and I should not care to say that about the inhabitants of Australia at the present time-it must forge ahead. Its resources are enormous. It is gradually attracting the attention of people in other parts of the world, and i l must continue to progress, and to progress rapidly. I take no dark view pf the future progress of Australia; but what I do take a dark view of is the probability under this agreement of a decline in the future of the Commonwealthauthority and usefulness as compared with the State authority and usefulness. That is what I fear. Though it may be, to some extent, repeating one portion of my, es- argument, I should like to ask honourable members to consider what is-likely to be the comparative, position in regard to their financial resources and powers of the Commonwealth and the States ten, fifteen., or twenty years hence, or even before that time should this agreement be carried out. In the first place, the States would have a first charge of .ess. per head on the Customs and Excise revenue, which at the present very high rate of return per capita from Customs and Excise. would involve 50 per cent, of the total revenue from this source. In addition, they would have what they have secured already, a primary position and a first lien on all, or nearly all, the great sources of direct taxation. We have land taxation in. some form in, almost all of the States. We have taxation on incomes in, I think, all of the States. There is very heavy taxation in the form of succession and probate duties in most of the States. I am putting the position fairly, when I say that the State Parliaments have already a first footing. They have fenced the ground, and are in possession practically of nearly all the ordinary sources of direct taxation. If the Commonwealth authority desires to occupy that position we shall have to appeal to the people who will be asked to submit to the extra taxation on grounds sufficiently strong to justify us in asking that we should be allowed to duplicate this kind of taxation, to impose it in addition to that imposed by the State authorities. We should! bave the State Parliaments possessed of these two powerful and growing sources of revenue. In addition, the States would have another power which is very seldom referred to, but which is one of the most important considerations affecting the progress in econom'cs of other countries, and especially of the TJnited States, ancl one of the most important sources of financial power in the world. Each of the State Parliaments would be in the position of the owner and controller of a monopoly of the transport services of the whole country. They already derive enoromous revenues from this source. They have been able to defray the greater portion of the cost of construction, and the moneys still payable out of capital always assume smaller proportions to the original indebtedness on this account. The revenue from this source is perpetually increasing. The State authorities would be in possession of all these sources of nnancial power, and what would be the position of the Commonwealth? The Commonwealth authority would be in possession of what remained of the Customs and Excise revenue after 25s. per head had been returned to the States, and I have previously endeavoured to show that in all probability that would be a diminishing amount.",31
124,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,32
125,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When we ask the people to return the power which it is now proposed to voluntarily relinquish, the Governments and Parliaments of the States will have been for years in possession of sources of revenue of great magnitude. They will have been receiving - a large and fixed percentage of the Customs and Excise revenue levied by the Commonwealth, they will have practically the first claim in respect to direct taxation, and they will have large and increasing returns from their railway systems and other reproductive public works. It has been said, more than once, by the honourable member for North Sydney, that the creditors of the States expect to be repaid the sums which they have advanced, and the interest on their loans, out of the Customs and Excise revenue. I dispute that. In Victoria-and the remark applies in a greater or less degree to the other Statesthe great bulk of the public borrowing has been expended on the construction of railways, and it is the revenue from railway administration which constitutes the source from which the interest ancl principal of the State, debts should mainly be repaid.",32
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A great deal of money has been borrowed for purposes other than railway construction.,32
127,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that only a. small proportion of the whole amount borrowed has been spent for purposes other than railway construction.,32
128,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ou t of ^250,000,000 borrowed, between ^90,000,000 and ^100,000,000 has not been spent on railway construction.",32
129,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt the Prime Minister's figures are correct j I am surprised to learn that not more proportionately has been borrowed for railway construction. But whatever may be the [200] * case in regard to the smaller States, I think I am right in saying that the revenue from railways and other reproductive public works will pay the interest on the greater part of the money borrowed by them. When we come to ask the people to give back to us the powers which it is now proposed to relinquish, our prestige and authority will have been weakened. We shall be practically in the position of mendicants, and the people will have become accustomed to the expenditure of huge sums by the State Governments. In this way various interests will have been created which will milita'te against the granting of our request, while we shall have the united forces of all the State authorities in opposition to us. It is a negation of all that we know to be true regarding the evolution of politics to affirm that we shall be able to get back these powers, except at a time of extreme national emergency. Should a. war break out, making it necessary to spend an enormous sum on defence, the people would, no doubt, submit tofurther taxation in any form, and under such circumstances-thoug h only after a terrible internecine conflict between the authorities of the Commonwealth and the States-w e might get back the powers which it is proposed we should surrender. TJnder ordinary circumstances, what we give away now we shall give away finally. The ' Prime Minister said-it was not the weakest part of his speech-that this matter must come before the electors at one time or another, either by way of referendum, or at the next election as the proposition* of the Government. I say, let it come before the people in the ordinary constitutional manner, so that every candidate for election may be free to advocate what he thinks best, untrammelled by party influence or prior commitment. What would it matter if the settlement of the question were postponed for another year? The Braddon provision will operate until Parliament otherwise provides. Why should we, because outside authorities insist upon a certain course, not seek the opinion of the electors on some definite proposal of the Government, regarding which we shall be absolutely unfettered? An interjection made by the honourable member for Indi during the speech of the honourable member for Mernda last night was extremely significant. He asked-anticipating , no doubt, the answer "" No , "" though he did not get it - "" S up pose a referendum had again to be taken regarding Federation, would you vote for it?"" The question shows what lies at the bottom of a great deal of the support given to the Government proposal, l n the minds of many of those who favour the agreement, or who, although opposed to it, feel bound to. support it, is a lurking distrust of this Parliament.",32
130,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would we not have a natural bias in. our own favour?,33
131,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know. The interjection, of the honourable member for Indi puts in a. nutshell the feeling of those who are supporting the agreement.",33
132,Mr MCWILLIAM S,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is pretty rough on the Government.,33
133,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think sc. The Government have made an agreement which, to my mind, is not the best. No doubt Ministers think differently, otherwise they would not have proposed, itsacceptance. But when we find honourable members saying publicly that they would Lave preferred another agreement, that they do not like the permanency of this, and the honourable member for Indi impliedly stating that he has no trust in the Federation, it is plain that we should exercise our votes in the matter with perfect f reedom. The Parliament has not achieved most of the purposes for which it was brought into existence. On this point I differ as widely as the Poles from honourable members opposite. In devoting most of its time to social and industrial questo be ratified. tions, it has departed largely from the main purposes for which it was created. do not expect honourable members to apried out. plaud that statement. With the exception of the Tariff, we have failed to properly deal with the great questions for which the Constitution. Parliament was primarily created. I hoped that, with the formation of the party which supporting the Government, and the vision of the House into two distinct ties, we should have been able to put machine into motion for the purposes which it was really created. M t . RICHARD FOSTER - Is the honourable member still hopeful?",33
134,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . that nothing wili intervene to prevent that - able But under the circumstances it .is most couraging to hear even the faintest indication of an opinion, that the people have deseramount vedly lost confidence in the Parliament. do not think that they have. I think that the spirit which called the Parliament into existence is not dead.

135,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Franklin)' [2.26]. - - I always think it a pity that the time of Parliament should be occupied with attempts to prove the consistency or inconsistency of honourable members. In this case the important issue is, Are we justified in submitting the agreement with the Premiers to the electors? We have heard lecturettes from some members of the Fusion party regarding the duty of their fellows. The honourable member for Parkes told us that those who are acting with him are the real Fusionists, and loyal supporters of the Government, and that we, vvho are actually supporting the Government, are disloyal to Ministers, and have broken the party compact. The honourable member reminded me of the juryman who always had the bad luck to be associated with eleven obstinate men. Three-fourths of his speech, and nearly one-half of that of the honourable member for Mernda, were occupied with the contention that the agreementshould not be ratified, because it would be practically impossible to amend it subsequent!v, should it be embodied in the Constitution.",33

The honourable anv. member for Parkes quoted a paragraph from the Fusion agreement, as included a speech delivered by the honourable memof ber for Gippsland, but he studiously avoided referring to the immediately suchave ceeding paragraph in the Ministerial nouncement. In the Ministerial statement, as published at page 282 of Hansard, have the statementA temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for .submission.

I did not mean in private conversations, but as honourable members know, men talk about their opinions openly, and I made an impersonal statement to that effect. I stick to that statement now. There were certainly in my mind three honourable members who had spoken in the House against the agreement being unlimited, and who had not voted for my amendment.",38

What I resent is the. charge distinctly made by the. honourable member that I revealed private conversations. I did nothing ot the kind.

I mentioned no names, and simply stated, a fact which I For- was quite entitled to state so long as I did not point to any individual.",38
192,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Riverina) [3.5] - The honourable member for Franklin endeavoured to reply to the arguments adduced by the honourable member for Mernda in moving the amendment and supported by the honourable members for Flinders and Parkes, (but he did not touch, one of those arguments.. He simply repeated what has several times been said by way of interjection with the object, if possible, of discrediting all those who do not agree with the Government in regard to the agreement, to the effect that they are afraid to trust the people. The honourable member, who, I am sorry to say,, is leaving the Chamber, is no novice, and knows as well as any honourable member in the Chamber that not one of those who sit on this side is at any time afraid to trust the people. He knows also that the combination which has been formed between the Federal Government and the State Governments in order to carry this amendment of the Constitution at a referendum could never be got together again to take it out of the Constitution. The honourable member in the latter portion of his remarks did allude for the first time to the fact that a majority of the States, as well as a majority of the people, was necessary to secure an alteration of the Constitution. The trouble is not the getting of a majority vote of the people, but the question of getting a majority vote of the States. It has been shown that 900,000 people may be defeated by 80,000 people at a referendum of this kind. That is not trusting the people.. Those who support the Bill want to trust the 80,000 people and to defy the will of the 900,000.",38
193,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thos e figures are not correct.,38
194,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are not my figures, but it will be sufficient for my argument to say that if this alteration is put in the Constitution, and the people see afterwards that a grave mistake has been made> and want to take it out again, the great majority of the people who reside in. the three larger States of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland can be defeated on that issue by the minority of the people who reside in the States of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. Assuming that every one voted, and taking the relative strength of the people in each of those sets of States, the fact remains, and will always remain, that the majority of the people can be defeated by the minority.",38
195,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the member think it likely that such a thing would happen?,39
196,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do. If I did not, I should not have the same objection to the Government's proposal. The Constitution provides that the National Parliament, after ten years' experience of the requirements of the States and of its own requirements, shall have the sole right to determine the future distribution of Customs and Excise revenue between the States and the Commonwealth upon an equitable basis. It does not give the States that right, but this Bill will have the effect of depriving the National Parliament for all time of the power to review the position if a mistake has been made. It is easy to do evil at all times, but it is difficult to undo that evil. Prevention is better than cure, and we have the means of prevention in 'our own hands. If we use those means we shall in no way derogate from the real rights of the States, but at the same time we shall maintain the rights of the people, because no one will attempt to deny that if the people are represented by one Parliament more fully than by another, it is by the National Parliament as compared with the State Parliaments. This Parliament is elected on the broadest franchise, and the will of Ihe people is fully represented in it. Every man and every woman has and can exercise the right to say who shall control their destinies in this Parliament, but my honourable friends know as well as I do that that is not true of the State Parliaments. No more important matter than this was ever brought before the National Parliament. There should be no question of political parties in this case. There should be only one party, and that is the party which stands for the maintenance of the people's rights in the only Parliament that has been properlv constituted to safeguard those rights. We who are taking the National side in this matter see the danger ahead. We see the necessity of preserving the paramountcy of the National Parliament, but we are asked to degrade and disrate and decrease the powers of this Parliament by our own act. The views which I am expressing have been held by the leading members of this Parliament from the time when the question was first brought forward. No one will dare to say that the first Federal Government and those who supported them were not patriots. The first pronouncement on the subject was made by honourable Sir George Turner when he occupied the position of Treasurer. He laid it down clearly that there ought to be a distribution of the finances as between the Federation and the States, but only on condition that the States handed over to this Parlia : ment full control of future borrowing. That was followed up by the right honourable member for Swan, when Treasurer previously. He made at that time no proposal for referring the question to the people. He claimed that this Parliament' was specially deputed by the people to deal with the matter, and prepared to settle it on an equitable basis. On that occasion again the Federal Government and their supporters stood firm. Next the honourable member for Hume, as Treasurer in the Deakin Government, I presume with the full concurrence of the Cabinet, and I know with the concurrence of those who supported that Government, - laid down the principle that there should be a redistribution of the finances, but no surrender of the powers of the National Parliament. Not very long before the last Premiers' Conference, where this agreement was arrived at, the present Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, voiced exactly the same views in an interview. Therefore, in the course of a few years we have had all the Federal Treasurers, all the Governments, and all their supporters saying, ""We recognise our responsibilities and our duty to the people; we are going to discharge those responsibilities honestly and truly."" Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Franklin - has said about trusting the people, no one has attempted to deny that what the honourable member for Mernda proposes is merely a limitation which will give an opportunity for the gaining of further experience.",39
197,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hi s proposal is a qualified Braddon provision.,39
198,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . When the amounts paid to the States have reached a certain sum, the payments will continue only until Parliament otherwise determines. "" Mr HARPER - And the electors will a voice in regard to any change which may be proposed.",39
199,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so. Why Western should we deprive the electors of ten or twenty years' hence of rights which the sent electors enjoy under the Constitution? As trustees of the rights of the people, have a sacred trust imposed on us. The honourable member for Mernda us to provide that for a certain time certain things shall be done, and shall continue to be done until the Parliament otherwise proall vides. - Mr Wilks - It is the Braddon over again, tempered with experience.",40
200,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And extended for a ral. - further term. It has been said that this - is not the Premiers' agreement; but I say disapproval unhesitatingly that it is. All past Treational. surers and Governments, and, indeed, the 'present Government, up to the time of the last Conference, have opposed an arrangement of this kind. What has brought about - the change ? The light of day was thrown expressed on the proceedings of all former ences, the press publishing a daily account of what took place therein; but, from the mittee ;f'J» i ""last Conference, the reporters and the iic were excluded.

They are afraid which!?u 1 to say what arguments were used, or inprising fluence exercised to secure the adoption an agreement which has required them to - give up the pledges and principles of a lifeth. time. Ministerial supporters are right - dealing with the agreement as some of .them have done. There has been no breach of confidence on the part of the honourable of New South .member for Mernda, in stating that those works as would facilitate free intercourse with .of his party who last week voted for the agreement voted against their declared con- 'hnnSJE^ victions. The honourable member for WimT T . \ .xnera did so, for one. He declared posiof tively in this Chamber that he favour of embodying an arrangement in the forwarded - Constitution for all time. The honourable .member for Kooyong presented a scheme for the settlement of the financial question - which showed that he was not in embodying any arrangement in the Constiemphasizing tution, and recently he deliberately spoke tins Bill was the the against securing finality in that way. Whatengage ever may have taken place in'the caucus of the Government party, the fact remains that some of the Ministerialists have spoken in S"" ,.. ™ .'T - one way and votedin another. Some force the has been brought to bear to make them have change their attitude. To show how the people view this matter, let me read an extract from an article published in the Grazier, 'of the 24th October last.

However, criticism will and must come if the electors are to decidethis great question of finance, and the relationship between the States and Federal Parliament on that head. Mr Deakin would have us believe that the Commonwealth Constitution is vague on this .point, but, in our view, nothing could be plainer.. The obligation of the Federal Parliament to pay certain portions of the revenue derivable from Customs and Excise was denned, and was .to continue for ten years (see sections '86 and 87 of the Commonwealth Act)- Nothing is said .(bout Conferences of premiers - taking a hand iri influencing the Federal Parliament in any future nnancial arrangement as is now 'being done.

Has not every honourable member who has supported the amendment 'asked for more experience, so that ultimately the matter may be dealt with in a manner equitable to the States, without depriving the Commonwealth Parliament of its due powers? Whether the Deakin-£«»»-Cook fusion is a tribunal honestly representative of the people, and to whom Mr Deakin's appeal can alone have been intended, is a moot question. But this we do know, that it is the duty of the Federal Parliament before swallowing Mr. Deakin's nnancial proposal to cause a strict investigation to be made as to the determination of the Sydney Government to so entirely ignore the Western half of this State as they have done during the last ten years.",41

The honourable member will not be annoyed if I say - that he was never a Federalist, and that, according to his own statements, he is not - a Federalist at the present time. The people of my electorate desire to uphold - the Federation, and .they look to the Commonwealth Parliament to make such arrangements with the States as will secure to them the rights and privileges for which the Constitution provides.",41
209,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member must be dreaming.,41
210,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . My constituents have expressed their opinion on this question at various political meetings as well as through the press, and they object to the Commonwealth being bound and fettered for all time merely to permit of the powers of the State Parliaments being enlarged. They have a perfect right to so express themselves. They have been constantly galled by the action of the State Governments, who have displayed anything but a Federal spirit. Victoria is unable to give them that which they desire, and they iook, therefore, to this Parliament-and they did more to bring it into existence than did those of any other part of the Stateto secure for them the retention of their privileges under the Federal Constitution. At present we have no true Federation, and if this agreement be carried, then I , strong Federalist though I am, will despair of' the National Parliament being able to do for the people what they hope and expect. It is proposed that we shall return to the States for all time 25s. per head of the population, leaving 25s. per head for our own use. Of that amount 22s. 6d. is already allocated: ios. per head being required for the payment of old-age pensions, and 12s. 6d. per head to provide for the Government scheme of defence. leaves a balance of 2s. 6d. per head to provide for the cost of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth. I "" appeal to those with whom I have worked for years in the cause of Democracy and Protection not to support this agreement. They must know in their hearts that if the agreement is accepted we shall soon reach the stage at which it will be absolutely impossible for the Commonwealth to obtain from Customs and Excise sufficient revenue to enable the proposed payment to the States to be continued, unless we so recast the Tariff as to secure larger returns, and at the same time destroy the industries of Australia.",41
211,Mr FRANK FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is the serious aspect of the position.,42
212,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is one that I invite the supporters of Protection to consider. The statistical returns prove conclusively that wherever a truly protective policy has been established there has been a decline in the Customs revenue. Every one knows as a protective Tariff becomes effective, and leads to the creation of new industries, the Customs revenue must decrease. That is the experience of Germany, the United States, and other nations. I quoted recently a long statement showing how the Customs revenue of various nations had fallen as the result of the imposition of protective duties. In only three cases was the per capita return from Customs and Excise over 25s. per head; in all others it was below that amount. The Commonwealth can afford at the present time to make the proposed return to the States, for the reason that, as yet, Protection here is only in its infancy. The industries that we hope to see created as the result of the existing Tariff have not yet been f u l ly established. We have consequently a large Customs revenue, but, if Protection is maintained, that revenue must decrease vear by year. From what other sources are we to obtain more revenue to meet the demands made upon the Commonwealth Government ? We can raise revenue only by the imposition of Customs and Excise duties, or by direct taxation. Do honourable members desire to save Protection at the cost of the imposition of direct taxation, or by going to the pawnbroker and loading posterity with a national debt, for which they will curse us?",42
213,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We shall not be here to hear their curses.,42
214,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is immaterial. That As trustees of the people, we have a right to consider those who come after us, just as we consider the future of our children. We ought not to impose on posterity burdens that it will be found very difficult to remove.",42
215,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Hav e people never built up a heritage only to have it squandered ?,42
216,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have received from the people of Australia a goodly heritage. Can it be said that we haw squandered it? Have we squandered the millions that we have received from Customs and Excise during the last few years ? Has it not gone back, for the most part, to the States, only, to be absolutely squandered by some of them? It is our duty to protect the people, not only in their National, but in their State capacity. In pre-Federal days, my own State could get along very well with an annual revenue of between £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £10,000,000. This Parliament has relieved it of an exthat penditure of about ,£3,000,000; yet, although having regard to the comparatively small increase in population, the ordinary expenditure of the State should not have been increased, we find today that it amounts to about £14,000,000 and that the State Government have gone into the market for about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. New South Wales is in a position different from that of ' the other States. Having a fiscal policy different from that of the other States prior to Federation, it did not derive from Customs and Excise anything like the revenue they secured from that source. Its Customs revenue before Federation amounted, roughly speakingj to about £1,000,000' per annum. It now derives from that source over £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Why should the Government hesitate to give the people an opportunity to consider this question before they are called upon finally to decide it ? It is not absolutely necessary that this Parliament should deal with it . The Braddon section will not expire until the end of next year, and before then there must, irany case, be an appeal to the people. At the next general 1 election it would be the bounden duty every honourable member to deal with this question from a patriotic stand-point,, and discussed. to advise the people as to the course they ought to pursue with regard to i Then the people will begin to consider understand how the agreement affects in both their State and their National capacities; and they will be in a much better position to give a rational vote than they will be . f the issue is forced on them ; this unholy manner. I sav, "" unholy mansociation ner,"" because, notwithstanding all the decalled nials, the organ that supports the Fusion party is assiduously stating, week after organizations. week, that there is a combination of Liberal and Reform sections, Farmers and Settlers' Associations, the Women's National AssoAssociations ciation, and other organizations, to have this agreement embodied in the Constitution.  candidates who oppose the agreement.",42
217,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Already , candidates are out in various districts declaring themselves in favour of the Fusion Government, and of the agreement.",43

223,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I could cite others; but there is no need to mention names.,43
224,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the people are against the agreement, that ought to suit the honourable member.",43
225,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How childlike and bland the honourable member is ! If the people are allowed time and opportunity for consideration, I am perfectly satisfied they will be against the agreement.",43

232,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member must not reply to irrelevant inter jections.,43
233,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , I think that the honourable member for North Sydneyshould be asked not to make irrelevant interjections. The position would be sound and unassailable, if Ihe Government were to say to the people of Australia, "" The operation of the Braddon section terminates at the end of next year, and we propose that an agreement shall be made for all time, while, on the other hand, it is held that there ought to be a limit fixed, in order that the Federal Parliament may have an opportunity for further reviewwhich view do you agree with? "" The people would then consider the matter, and be able to give an intelligent vote. But, as a matter of fact, the people are told that that there must be this agreement or nothing, and that, if they do not vote for it , they l are not supporters of the Government. We are going to have in the country what we There been are members here who disagree as much as I do myself with the proposed arrangehonment, and yet they dare not voice their views, solely in order to keep faith with on their party ties. What, then, may we expect to see in the country, in the face of Can we expect an honest and deliberate vote? The Prime Minister's absence from the Chamber a matter for which he himself is responsible ; and I have to say that I resented an interjection he made last night. No member of this Parliament gave the present Prime Minister a more loyal support than I did; and when he twits me with turning round on my convictions, 1 can only throw the accusation back, and say that my convictions are now what they were his are entirely different. I did not leave the Prime Minister, but he left he, and those with him, must take the responsibility of their action. The Prime Minister, like myself, was returned as Protectionist, and associated himself with Protectionists only; but. now he is allied with Free Traders of the most extreme type- a step which I never could take. The turning away from convictions and pledges was not on my part, but his.",43

I am speaking for the fourteen honourable members who stood - the Prime Minister and formed his party, and not for the honourable member for' Grampians, who then sat in Opposition, many times, while claiming to be a Protecthe tionist, voted the other way. 1 challenge the Prime Minister, or any member of party, to show where I have changed principles or convictions; and I claim I .now sit with those who are affinities.

The division was taken, and the test applied, and, notwithstanding the that the vote was against him, the Prime Minister, because of the arrival of a league, who was then absent and unpaired, I ever saw in the Parliament. hopes to be able to fly in the face of wishes of, not only the Opposition, his own supporters.

Personally, 1I have always been a. Federalist; and it is because I see - dangers ahead that I call upon Parliament to hesitate in this matter. I desire honourable members to be true to their principles and pledges, and not, for the sake of party, or in order to save their own political skins, do something which, I am sure, none, will regret more than themselves, in the future. It is easier to commit evil than to undo the. effects of evil j and, to put it mildly, there is a suspicion that evil will be done if this agreement be adopted -> Why not, in the name of common sense, afford the people a few months for consideration, so that they may arrive at a verdict, not by a majority of the States, but by a majority of the electors, and thus determine their own destiny.",44

First of all he has complained that in the settlement of this question there have been some refusals of pairs, and he calls that sharp practice. Yet the honourable member is one of a party who adopted that very sharp practice as one of its principles, for the first time in the history of this Parliament. He actually attempts to twit honourable members on this side, even if they did refuse pairs, w th adopting a system of sharp practice, : which he, by his decision and by his action, has been endorsing in this Parliament.",45
251,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is absolutely wrong. I gave the Postmaster-General a pair on several occasions.,45
252,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member and those associated with him adopted the plan of refusing pairs. He now makes the insinuation that there has been a refusal to pair. Where is that refusal on this side? Let hirri instance one case in this division..,45
253,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,T can name a case that happened last n'ght.,45
254,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am speaking of the coming division. There ave honourable members on that side paired now. The honourable member for West Sydney got the pair of the right honourable member for East Svdney on this question before the latter left for Melbourne.,45

266,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am sorry that I am touching honourable members so keenly that they cannot restrain themselves.,45
267,Mr IFRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is because the honourable member is not quoting facts.,45
268,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am quoting facts, and challenge denial of them. The honourable member for Riverina admits that another memher of the House is absent in addition to the honourable member for South Sydney. That other member is a chosen candidate of the Fusion party. Does the honourable member for Riverina say that the one does not balance the other ?",45
269,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member refer to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro?,45
270,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,45
271,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then he has publiclydisavowed that.,45
272,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member for Riverina wishes to claim the vote of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, he must show a communication from that honourable memberauthorizing him to be paired on that side of the House. Does the honourable member think that pairs are to be given without an indication of the desire of the honourable member concerned, especially when he is in the Commonwealth ?",45
273,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro sent word to us to instruct the Government Whip not to pair him with the Government.,46
274,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The position is that an honourable member is absent who may be looked upon as voting for the Government, and those who say that he should be paired on the other side cannot produce a single document to show that he desires it . The honourable member for Riverina also asked if those on this side, with whom he had been associated for many years, were going to vote for direct taxation if they afterwards found that this agreement made that necessary in order to preserve the policy of Protection, indicating thereby that direct taxat on was against their policy. The honourable member himself has joined another organization one of the planks of whose platform is a progressive land tax. He accused the members of the party to which he previously belonged of being associated with Free Traders, while he claimed that he had never touched that unclean thing. Yet he has himself joined a party which has Free Traders within its ranks. What consistency is there in that sort of argument?",46
275,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I was. always in favour of a progressive land tax.,46
276,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then why did the honourable member taunt his old associates on this side with doing what would not te in accordance with, their policy if they had in the end to resort to direct taxation?",46
277,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I said they would be forced to do it.,46
278,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member taunted those who had been associated with him for so many years, and asked if they were going to impose the tion. Coming to the arguments used by previous speakers in favour of the amendment, I would deal with that one on which great stress has been laid, to the effect that the proposal of the Government is not in accordance with the Fusion agreement. While it differs in some ways from the Fusion agreement, it is not inconsistent with it. That agreement said that, failing the preparation of a complete scheme, a temporary system should be adopted. Further, as the honourable member for Wilmot pointed out, the Prime Minister elaborated that question when he brought the matter before Parliament, and indicated that steps were being taken for the preparation of a complete scheme. Some have said that the Prime Minister and the members of his Government who,went into the Conference with the State Premiers ought not, in view of the Fusion arrangement, to have consented to anything without consultation with the members of their party. Just expand that argument. If the Ministers representing the Commonwealth in the Conference, and every Minister representing the six States, although they went there to strive to arrive at an agreement, were to do nothing without consultation with and approval by, not their Parliaments, for that had to follow as a matter of course, but also their own parties, what would be the position? Nothing more absurd could be put forward. Mem: bers on this side of the House, as well as those on the other side, knew that when the Prime Minister and those associated with him entered the Conference, it was with the desire and intention, if possible, of arriving at an agreement. They arrived at an agreement, and I have shown the absurdity of proposing to submit that agreement to the members, of the parties supporting the Governments in the six States and in the Commonwealth. It is too ridiculous to be worth consideration.",46
279,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Coul d we not have consulted them about the permanency of it ? That is the one point in dispute.,46
280,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Consul tation with the supporters of the Federal Government would involve also consultation, by the State Premiers with their own parties.",46
281,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all.,46
282,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It musf have involved that. Do honourable members think that there would have been any chance of coming to an agreement if it had taxa- been known that it was to be only tentative, and would have to go to seven bodies ot Government supporters throughout the Commonwealth? The Conference would 1 never have dreamt of coming together, and.' could not have beeni brought together, under those conditions. The only conditions that could bring them together were those that existed-that those present were prepared, as the Prime Minister said, to put their political lives behind the agreement arrived at, and to stand or fall by it. Further than that, of course, they had to agree t a carry the thing its full course-that is fc to carry it to the people. In those circumstances, I do not think the objections which have been taken to the action of the Prime Minister are sustained. The honourable member for Parkes spoke about dragging the party behind the Government. There has been no attempt to do so. The honourable member, and others who support his views, are perfectly right in maintaining that, as there has been some departure from the arrangement outlined in the - Fusion agreement, they are not entitled to be dragged at the chariot wheels of the Government. The Government recognised .that fact fully and generously, and gave - those honourable members, Avithout cavil and - without dispute, the liberty which . they sought of recording their, votes .with their views. They surely cannot complain of that, nor, I am sure, can they complain of the official attitude of any member of this party towards them individually. All consultations have, been con! ducted on the most amicable terms, with every admission of the claims for freedom put forward by those honourable gentlemen. Mr CHANTER:-Was that in caucus? ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I am not speaking of a caucus meeting. Had we met in caucus, we should have beeri bound by a vote, and no such vote was taken. The honourable member will have to sub""mit to that condition in the future.",46
283,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is entirely wrong there. I know what I am doing.,47
284,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman w.ill soon find out the strictions of his present position. He was not present at the meetings to which I am alluding. I am addressing those who were present, and who are aware that not one - note of discord was heard there. No re-flecticn has been cast in this Chamber on lthe free action of honourable members who differ from the rest of the party, and I shall not assist the Opposition by using - language which might be offensive to them. The silence of honourable members opposite is ominous. They recognise that a family difference often leads to a family quarrel,' and that words spoken in heat may accomplish what they desire, the severance of the Ministerial party. They - have endeavoured to further that by ap-plause and interjections, which, I am sure, - will be appreciated at their full value by .those who have received them. The utmost freedom has willingly been conceded to those who have differed from the majority of the party.  for Batman did not say so last night.",47
285,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I would accept the honourable member's word as to whether party pressure was brought to bear on him at these meetings, or in any other way. I do not take into account conversations between members. Warm things are sometimes said between friends. Argument does not always lead to agreement, but frequently ends in a heated passage-atarms which the parties would not afterwards justify.. I am not speaking of such matters. We have no right to recognise them here. I am speaking of official actions of the party, and no one can contradict my statements. Two or three honourable members have said that most of those who support the agreement are doing so against their convictions. That is a statement which should not have been made, because it is absolutely incorrect. Were ii justifiable it would apply to both sides. . Some of those who support the agreement .would like it amended in detail, but they recognise that there will always be differences of opinion in regard to a matter of this sort. Their position is this : "" An opportunity now presenrs itself to come to an agreement. We wish for a settlement. We would prefer an agreement for a period, or one differing in some other particular ' from that put forward by the Government; but we recognise that we cannot get unanimity, that what one would consider a sufficient period, another would think too short; and, therefore, to re- settle our differences, we will support the proposal of the Government, as the best possible under the circumstances."" If , to take that attitude, is to depart from one's convictions, the same thing may be said of the attitude of those who are supporting the amendment. Some years ago, the honourable member for Mernda proposed a financial scheme, the adoption of which he has since frequently advocated. He deserves credit for the interest and trouble that he has taken in the matter. But his present proposal differs from that scheme.",47
286,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Because he has given up his scheme.,47
287,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that a departure from his convictions?,47
288,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,47
289,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not call it a departure from the honourable member's convictions. But if the honourable member who has given up the scheme which he would prefer for that which he now puts forward is not to be charged with acting contrary to his convictions, others who have abandoned schemes which they preferred to the agreement, and are now supporting the agreement as the best possible under the circumstances, are not be so charged.",47
290,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,My amendment is not a scheme at all. It is simply an arrangement for continuing the Braddon provision.,48
291,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a very definite scheme.,48
292,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does not deal with the debts of the States, and has nothing to do with my scheme.",48
293,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The amendment is an entirely different proposal from the honourable member's scheme.,48
294,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It does not deal with the same subject.,48
295,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It deals with the transfer of the debts, the honourable member having fixed the amount of '^7>5 > > because that, with the expen00 000 diture on old-age pensions, covers the interest on the debts. To secure unanimity amongst themselves, those who are opposing the ratification of the agreement are departthe ing from proposals which they previously favoured. But it would not be fair to charge them with deserting their convictions because they are doing so, finding that cannot get exactly what they desire. The honourable member for Parkes said that the Fusion agreement provided for the transfer of the State debts and the sharing of the revenue to be dealt with together. That 'is what the Government proposes. It has introduced a Bill to provide for the sharing of the revenue, and another to provide for the transfer of the debts, or any portion of them, to the Commonwealth. He also said that the attitude of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and others now is inconsistent with their attitude in 1907. But the Conferences of 1907, and former years, had for their object the division of the Customs and the Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. This differs entirely from the proposal now before us, which provides for the pavment to the States of 25s. per capita, all,, or none, or only part, of which sum may come from Customs and Excise revenue. Surely 'different opinions may be held regarding proposals which are so different! An hon.crable member might see good reason why a mere allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue should not be permanently provided for in the Constitution, but might not object to the amendment of the Constitution so long as the Commonwealth was not bound to make payments to the States out of any particular revenue fund. The to fiscal arguments used in this debate do not apply, because the whole field of taxation remains open to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Mernda charged the Premier of Queensland with being inconsistent in agreeing with his scheme and opposing his amendment.",48
296,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,1 did not say that he was inconsistent.,48
297,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member apparently referred to the attitude of the Premier of Queensland towards his scheme by way of showing that he is inconsistent, but I accept the honourable member's denial. It would be astonishing were the Premier of Queensland to be opposed to the honourable member's scheme, because what the honourable member suggested was that the interest on the debts, up to nearly £9,000,000, should be put on the shoulders of the Commonwealth, and that the debts carrying that interest should cease to be charged against the States when burden of interest had been so transferred. There was to be practically a wiping of the slate. Each State was to be freed from its existing debts. Queensland they was to be freed of nearly £ 8 0 a head, Victoria of only. £ 4 2 a head, and Tasmania, of, I think, about £ 4 5 a head. A gigantic premium was offered to Queensland. Is it, then, astonishing that the Premier of the State favoured the proposal ?",48
298,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My scheme was not on a L per capita basis, whereas the honourable member has spoken of per capita payments. Who' knows what the per capita arrangement would be twenty years hence?",48
299,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We must take the position as we find it today. A great premium was offered to the State of Queensland.,48
300,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are not now discussing that matter.,48
301,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unde r ; the later scheme now proposed by the honourable member for Mernda in connection with this agreement- a scheme which deals with the distribution on a per capita basisthat objection is got rid of, and Queensland would not have under it the premium that she was offered under the honourable member's first proposal. Some honourable members object very seriously tude and action of the State Premiers. We must remember, however, that the matter is of great importance to the States. The question at issue is whether any share of the Customs and Excise revenue or equivalent is to go in future to the States. The financial standing of some of the States is seriously involved. Do hontwo orable members suggest that if-they were State Premiers they would not consider their duty to take action in this matter, and in dealing with it to obtain recognition at the hands of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth? I think that any honorjection. able member who occupied the position of Premier of a State and properly recogspeak. nised his duty to the State which had placed him in that office would feel it bounden duty to take up that attitude tainly and to see that his State was not to a large extent, if not entirely, deprived very important proportion of its revenue. monwealth. The honourable member for Flinders, in wealth the course of .a recent speech on this questhings-on tion, gave an illustration which I think offers good reason for the fears of State Premiers. He said that at a time of great financial stress, when there was serious shortage in the revenue of the Commonwealth, the States from the same causes would be .in .an exactly similar tion. "" Should ,we be likely,"" he asked, "" to get the agreement altered in such circumstances if it were embodied in the Constitution ? "" That is just the situation that the States have to fear. At a time great financial stress, the Commonwealth, in the absence of any lasting agreement to the distribution of Customs .and Excise revenue, would have .more than enough to provide for its wants. It would have full control over its revenue, and would be able .to fill its own pockets, taking eventually do that. the whole .25s. if it wished, while the States would be short not only of the fer ca-bita allowance of 25s., '.but of an additional amount due to the stress at the time, and from the Commonwealth Parliament. would find themselves in a very serious position. Justice must be done to hoth the Commonwealth and the States. Objection has been raised to the State Premiers takexploit ing an active personal part in a Federal have not yet entered. .election. I am opposed to their doing and hope that they will not. That objeca tion has come, however, to a considerable extent from the Labour partu, although - members of State Labour Governments State Labour members have taken a very active part in Federal elections.

303,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member has not been in the chamber throughout the proceedings, and he cannot contradict my statement, that its objection has been taken from the Opposition side of the House by way of interjection and also in the course of one or speeches, to *he State Premiers taking part in a Federal election. I hope that it the State Premiers will not do so, but honourable members who have been supported by State Ministers belonging to the'r own party should rot raise this obI propose now to deal with one or two matters to which I rose principally to I would not accuse any honourable member of indulging in misrepresentation, his but some very serious misapprehension cerexists in regard to'this question.

We shall still have the enormous power-on e of the greatest that any legislative body could possessposiof .absolutely unrestricted taxation. That is a power which the States do not pos.sess. They cannot touch that great source of .revenue which Customs .and Excise taxation provides, and they say very properly to the of Commonwealth Parliament, "" When we are excluded from that you ought certainly to as consider our large expenditure and to give us some allowance, not necessarily from Customs revenue, to meet our expenditure.""",49
304,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And we are all ready to,49
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am dealing now only with the argument that .under this agreement powers are being taken I repeat that no power will be taken from it. If it so desires, it can enter fields of taxation now occupied by the States, or it can fields of taxation which the States It has full and so, ample power. The States which have only limited power should not be left absolutely unassisted by the Commonwealth, as they might 'be if not secured, since the and Commonwealth has taken from them that great source of revenue which Customs and Excise taxation provides. I do not intend to repeat some arguments that I used on a previous occasion, but I shall briefly summarize them. I tried to show that even if this per capita allowance were to be provided entirely from Customs and Excise taxation we should only be carrying out the intention of the Federal Convention that we should allocate to the States some permanent share of the Customs and Excise revenue. On the question as to whether a sufficient or an insufficient proportion was being granted, I pointed out that the proposed distribution to the States of 25s. per head of the revenue financed the States only in respect of their present expenditure, whereas it financed the Commonwealth in respect of not only its present expenditure, but the cost of old-age pensions and its anticipated increased cost of naval defence. I urged, beyond that, that if the States and the Commonwealth entered upon other enterprises, as both will probably do, it would surely be the responsibility of those who did so to find the means of providing the necessary revenue. The greater developmental expenditure rests certainly with the States. I gave the particulars before, and shall not repeat them. The States are also responsible for a larger proportion of the expenditure, which must increase with population, than the Commonwealth is. It has been urged that if this agreement were carried and placed in the Constitution there would 'be no power to excise it, if circumstances rendered it necessary.",49
306,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We said there would be enormous difficulty, not that there would be ber Mr. no power to excise it.",50
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then I will accept the honourable member's correction and say that it is urged that there would be enormous difficulty in removing this agreement from the Constitution if were placed in it. Since the taxpayer in State and Commonwealth is one and the same, I fail to appreciate the difficulty. But beyond that, the stupendous powers the Commonwealth would certainly operhas ate to compel an alteration of the ConstituI tion if such became necessary. The. monwealth has unlimited power of taxaference, tion. It can enter every field of tion that the States have entered or have agreed upon. neglected, and if for serious reasons thought necessary to reduce permanently by 10s. the proposed per capita allowance to the States, the Commonwealth would doubtless say to the States, ""We must a reduction of ios. in the per capita return to you. We are going to secure that ditional revenue either by your consenting to a reduction of our contribution, since it is a permanent necessity that we have to meet, or by entering a field of taxation that you are occupying or may occupy and imposing direct taxation in addition to your own."" It is impossible to believe that in such circumstances the State Premiers would not agree, as they do today, to an alteration of the Constitution.",50
308,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a lovely position for the Commonwealth to take up.,50
309,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member cares nothing about any ""lovely position"" unless it is one for the Commonwealth. The States may be in a very unlovely position so far as he is concerned.",50
310,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that a fair statement?,50
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a fair inference to draw from the honourable member's attitude.,50
312,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not desire the Commonwealth to be a mendicant.,50
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Commonwealth would not be a mendicant; there would be compelling, not asking.",50
314,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , why the honourable member's anxiety to have this agreement in the Constitution ?",50
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am pointing out that, if it be placed in the Constitution, there will be nothing to prevent an amendment of the Constitution, if there is absolute need on the part of the Commonwealth. WILKS - Then the honourable memanticipates the Commonwealth exercising the power ?",50
316,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member knows that there is no point in his question. To put the agreement in it the Constitution is simply to give security to the States in regard to what they are to receive of the revenue. There will be no abandonment of power by the Commonof wealth ; we simply fix a contribution which hitherto been uncertain and varied ; and am quite sure that when the representaComtives of the Government went to the Conthey never anticipated they would taxaget so low an initial figure as the 25s.' A stupendous power reit was mains to the Commonwealth, a power so great that it is quite impossible for the States to refuse anything reasonable in a financial way. If they did re have fuse, the Commonwealth could enter trie taxation sphere now occupied by the States, adand obtain the money just as it would by a reduction of the contribution.",50
317,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The money might be raised by revenue duties on the necessaries of life.,51
318,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Parliament of the Commonwealth would settle that question.,51
319,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would be settled in the face of urgent necessity.,51
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why should we think that the Parliaments of the future will be less intelligent than the present Parliament?,51
321,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , why embody the . agreement in the Constitution?",51
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I used the words '' less intelligent"" ; I did not say less grasping, or less open to temptation to annex revenue. Any Parliament, if it finds that it has a fund to draw freely on, will gradually annex the whole of it for its own expenditure. No Parliament I know of, has ever long resisted the temptation.",51
323,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that the fear the honourable member has?,51
324,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not a fear, but a certainty; and the States recognise the danger of depriving them of such a large source of revenue, and feel that it must certainly lead to unification. There are certain honourable members who have unification in their minds, and every move they make in this House has that motive, though I am not accusing the supporters of the amendment of that. On all occasions, we should try to look at both sides of the question-the Commonwealth side certainly, but also at the State side.",51
325,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Balaclava) [4.50]. - Some of the leading Ministers were those who took the greatest interest in, and had more to do with bringing about Federation than probably any other members of the House; and it seems to me that, by this proposal, they aim a severe blow at the very thing they brought into existence. I should like Ministers, before they press their supporters too strongly, to consider carefully whether it is advisable to make this agreement permanent. I could understand members of the Labour party opposing it, seeing that they have for a long time been bringing pressure to bear on the Federal Parliament to impose a land tax. If the agreement is carried, it seems to me that the Federal Parliament will have to impose both a land and an income tax, in addition to the land and income tax of each State. It is quite evident that we shall not, in time to come, have sufficient revenues from our present resources to meet the whole of the engagements of the Commonwealth. It has been clearly proved, I think, that as population increases, the per capita return from Customs and Excise will f all ; and yet it is proposed for all time to give a permanent grant of 25s. to the States. I could understand a sliding scale, by which the proportion paid to the State rose or fell with the revenue. I have no objection personally to the present proposed grant, provided there be a limit of time; and I think that has been the view of every honourable member who has opposed the proposal of the Government. It has been stated that those who oppose the agreement are supporting the Labour party; but it appears rather that the Opposition are supporting members on this side, probably because they regard the position they take up as fair, or, it may be, for some other reason. It is easy for us on this side to sit on a bed of roses, and agree to the proposals of the Government; but many of us are, I think, making ourselves unpopular with our constituents, though our action shows the consistency of our views, and that we are not afraid, even just before an election^ to do what we honestly believe is the correct thing. There is one argument I have not yet mentioned, namely, that if we make the agreement permanent, it can never afterwards be altered. It is a contract between the Commonwealth and the Governments of the States, that this sum shall be paid for all time; and it is quite certain that many of the. States will increase their borrowings, because they will have a fixed income. They will be able to say to their creditors, "" We are assured of s:> much per annum from the Customs and Excise in perpetuity.""",51
326,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member heard what Mr Kidston and other Premiers have said. .,51
327,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But when the States once start borrowing, we shall not be able to help ourselves. Further, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a State mortgaging its share of the Customs and Excise revenue under the contract, because it will be as safe to them for all time hereafter, as was the payment of the three-fourths under the Braddon section. What would have been said if the Commonwealth, pressed for money, had asked the people to vary the Braddon section? Supposing, at the end of five years, we had said: "" We wish the section altered, and we ask you to amend the Constitution so as to give us one-half of the revenue instead of one-fourth,""- what would the people of Australia have said? What would the State Ministers have said ? Would they not have urged that it was absolute repudiation? Ancl so it would be if we were to ask them to vary the contract that is now proposed. It is just as much repudiation to alter a contract made in perpetuity as to ask the people to vary a contract made for ten years. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament could at any time, in honour, ask the people of Australia to vary the agreement into which we are now entering. The States might double their indebtedness by borrowing another £200,000,000 ; and we know that they have security sufficient to pay the interest on such a debt. The railways are an ever-increasing revenue producing property, and just about pay the interest on the present debts. If we double the income of the States by granting 25s. per capita, we virtually authorize them to pledge the State assets to the extent of other £100,000,000, or £200,000,000. Ancl this can never be undone; we cannot say to the State creditors: "" We are going to ask the people of Australia to vary the contract."" I am sure that the members of this Parliament would never dare to ask the people to vary the agreement, seeing that it had been solemnly entered into, and that the States had in consequence pledged themselves to pay interest on largely-increased loans. The Commonwealth has no assets on which to borrow. We have extensive powers of taxation, but, with the exception of duties of Customs and Excise, our powers are hardly worth the name. Each State has a land and an income tax, and the income tax in Victoria is probably one of the heaviest in the world. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament would dare to impose on the people of this State a super-income tax; and, in any case, there is a certain limit to the paying power of the taxpayer. If an income tax and land tax are made too heavy, the income tax drives capital out of the country and the land tax drives people off the land, and the revenue instead of being increased is decreased. What would State politicians say .if we attempted to ask the people to vary the agreement now proposed? They would say to us: "" Did you not enter into the contract with us for all time, with youi eyes open? The State Premiers pressed for this agreement, and the Prime Ministei agreed to it ; the Federal Parliament, byAct, assented to it, and the people \vere asked to confirm it . "" Can we at any time go to the same people, and ask them to undo what they did with open eyes? l t would be repudiation if we attempted it.  us to do it.",51
328,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How does the honourable member mean?  force us.,52
329,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Such a step would be necessary only when there was a serious drought, depression, or threatening of war. There are about 600 State politicians, as against in members of the Commonwealth Parliament. There are from three to five State electorates for every Federal electorate, and where one Federal member will be advocating the repeal or alteration of this arrangement, there will be five State members stumping his district against him. The people will say that they must consider the interests of the States an- which are at their own doors, and when the Federal Capital is established at Canberra, what interest will the people of States other than New South Wales have in the Commonwealth Parliament?",52
330,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The people of Queensland, Western Australia, and other States take an interest in Commonwealth affairs at the present time.",52
331,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y little. You will see in each of the State daily newspapers about half a column regarding what is going on in the Commonwealth Parliament, as against columns and columns referring to what is taking place in the State Parliaments. Take Victoria as an example of what will happen. When the Federal Capital is established at Canberra, and Victoria is receiving £2,000,000 or more out of Customs and Excise revenue, will the Victorian people give that up in order to allow the greater part of it to be spent, perhaps, in New South Wales? The fleet will be there, the docks will be there, the shipbuilding yards will be there, and the people of Victoria will say, "" Why should we give up £2,000,000 to be spent in New South Wales or in any other State? "" The same thing will apply to Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland. The people of the States will not give up the money, and will not vote for the revoking of this agreement. Therefore, I say that, once entered into, this will be a contract for all time, and the Commonwealth Parliament will have to look to some other source for revenue. What undertakings have we entered into? We have taken over old-age pensions, which were said by the Treasurer at the time to be costing about ^i,000,000 a year. They cost £1,500,000 now, they will cost £2,000,000 a year before the matter is finally settled, and the total will be £3,000,000 a year when invalid pensions are included. We propose to build railways from east to west, and from north to south. We are going to take over the debts which South Australia has incurred in the Northern Territory. We propose to attempt to develop the Northern Territory, and we contemplate building a Federal Capital. We cannot do those things under from £20,000,000 ^30,000,000 or £40,000,000. We shall have to borrow that money, and pay interest on it. Defence will cost £3,000,000 at least, and old-age and invalid pensions £3,000,000, and we shall have to pay .£1,000,000 in interest. We shall have to find, therefore, £7,000,000 out of the little Customs revenue which will be left to us. That is about all that we should have to fall back upon. We might put revenue duties on tea, kerosene,, and cotton goods. Those are about the only large importations that are free at present, and how much could be squeezed out of them ? If we got £1,500,000 a year out of them we should be very lucky. Yet, after paying 25s. per head to the States, we shall have to pay our way out of the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue, and out of what little revenue we can produce from the balance of our importations. I feel, therefore, that within a very short time, probably within the time of many members now in the House, the Commonwealth Parliament will be in the greatest financial difficulty, and I do not think our borrowing power in the eyes of moneylenders will be more than £50,000,000. We shall have to pay a larger rate of interest in the future than we are paying now. The States are by degrees getting into the hands of a ring in London. The other day, the Premier of South Australia tried to place a loan outside that ring, and what a howl there was ! Inspired paragraphs appeared in the papers, and attempts were made at Home to block the loan. We cannot borrow £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for the repayment of any existing debt when it falls due unless we go to the same people. From 3! per cent., our interest has now risen to about Mr Agar Wynne. 3! per cent., and before long it will be 4 per cent. That means a serious charge upon the people of Australia. Do honourable members think that the States will come to the Commonwealth Government and float their loans through us when their assets are better than our own? The security which the States offer to the money-lender is better than the Federal Parliament can give. We have no railways or other large revenue-earning, trading concerns, and, therefore, there is very little chance of our ever being asked to take over the debts of the States. In England, pensions were granted to the Duke of Marlborough and others for all time, and what has happened? . The Imperial to Government has had to pay enormous sums to commute those pensions; but, if we enter into this agreement with the States, we shall never be in a position to commute the payments. We shall have to make them as long as ever the country and the Parliament are in existence. If we require money in time of war, how are we to get it? We shall have no importations if our ports, are blocked, and yet we shall have to pay 25s. per head to the States, whether it comes from Customs revenue or from any other source. It will probably mean that we shall not be able to pay even that 25s. per head to the States in time of war, but will have actually to repudiate the contract that we have entered into. I think the least that can be put into this Bill is some saving clause to protect us in time of war. As the agreement stands, we have not the slightest protection. We are entering into this contract, and will have to carry it out, whether we want to or not, or else repudiate our liability. There is no provision whatever to suspend the contract except by the cumbersome system cf taking a vote of the people, and then three that States can block us. Do honourable members think fhat we can afford to take a referendum of the people on the question when the enemy's fleet is on its way to Australia? It takes something like sixty days now to take a vote.",52
332,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We shall have to'take a referendum to see whether we can protect ourselves or not.,53
333,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . That is a nice position in which to place the Commonwealth Parliament and the people of Australia! If we make this agreement the law, we shall have in a time of emergency either to override the Constitution and refuse to pay, or to suffer a serious delay in attempting to secure an alteration which we may not even be successful in securing. I do not think anything but a threat of war would cause the people to vary this agreement once it was entered into. If we do adopt it without some saving clause, the Government and the House will be making a big mistake. A number of members look at the question simply from the State point of view. They regard themselves as delegates to this Parliament from the States. They consider that they ought to obey the dictation of the States, and not to act as Nationalists in the interests of the whole of Australia. They do not look to the future in the slightest. They have a parrot cry of "" What is going to happen to the States?"" Surely we have ,to look beyond that.  of a single member.",53
334,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has been repeated time after time. I think every member from Tasmania has uttered the cry. They have said, "" What is poor Tasmania going to do unless you. give her this money ?"".",54
335,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What about the parrot cry of "" What is going to happen to the Commonwealth?"" We have been hearing that for the last hour.",54
336,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable, member may call it a parrot cry, but some day it will be a shriek. I think that .some States like Tasmania and Western Australia do need money very badly, and I am quite in favour of the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Mernda. I voted for it for the very reason that it gives us ample time to look round. . I should - not object to a sliding which the States would get the benefit of any increase of revenue, but on the other hand would suffer equally with the Commonwealth in times^ of depression. We are sure to have Urouglits and bad times, and then our revenue, especially the revenue from the Customs, will seriously f all . An income tax will be of very little value then, because the people will have very slight incomes to tax. The number of sheep in New South Wales and Queensland fell in one year from a hundred millions to forty millions. was obtained in the country - when that loss occurred? It takes two or three years to 'build such an industry, up again. A trust has been given into the hands of this Parliament by the people in the Constitution as framed, and we ought to discharge that trust. Provision was made for a temporary arrangement, that is, for ten years, but at the end of that period this Parliament was to decide what should be done, it is now proposed to make another arrangement for fifteen years, leaving the Federal Parliament then to decide the matter again. But no; there is such a terrible dread of the Labour party some day coming into power and playing ducks and drakes with the finances of the Commonwealth that we are asked to take everything away from the Commonwealth Parliament, and hand it over to the State Ministries, so that the Commonwealth may not have any money to spend. Are not the people just as much in danger from the action of the LabouT party in the State Parliaments as in this Parliament? I am not afraid of the Labour party at the next or any other election. I think the common sense of the people of Australia is sufficient to prevent that or any other party from giving effect to wild-cat schemes or playing ducks and drakes with the finances. It is therefore a great mistake to raise that cry or entertain that fear. The people of Australia have plenty of sense, and the members of this Parliament are elected on the same franchise as are the members of the State Parliaments.",54

338,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have heard'rf raised both outside and inside this chamber.,54

I am quite satisfied, at any rate, that after the next election the Fusion party will be in a majority as against the present Opscale by position. I therefore cannot see why that terrible bogey should be raised now or at any other time. The honourable member for North Sydney said that we must look after the .States. Nobody objects to the States being fair ly treated, or to the State Premiers trying to drive as hard a bargain as they can, but there is nothing in the agreement that shows that the scheme was meant to be for all time. The Prime Minister and the State Premiers simply .entered into an agreement to recommend to Parliament, .and this Parliament has the What revenue power to say what it will take. .

341,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I pointed out before the right' honourable member came in that it will be a contract for all - time, because the States will'borrow money on the strength of the per capita grant from the Commonwealth, and their creditors will look upon it as a security for the money which they lend. There is nothing to prevent any State pledging its share of the grant as security for debts.",54
342,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member think that any of the Australian States will be driven to that as a security for its solvency?,55
343,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It may happen. ment itofwould,55
344,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is the most not dreadful view that any one could possibly take of the future of Australia.,55
345,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Many of the represent States have had to pledge their Customs revenue as security. They are getting very close to the limit of their borrowing power. you They have great difficulty in raising money. The chances are that if they are pressed they must pledge this source of revenue.,55
346,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They could borrow without doing that. - Mr AGAR WYNNE - I believe that they could. But we are proposing to enter into a contract in perpetuity.,55
347,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There never was such a contract. The agreement will subject to d Iteration.,55
348,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Braddon provision was a contract for ten years until otherwise subsequently altered. would have been said had the Parliament tried to bring about its repeal at the of five years ? Our action would have denounced as repudiation. Just as the Braddon provision is a contract for years or more, the proposed agreement contract lor all time, and it would considered repudiation for the Commoning wealth Parliament to ask the people amend it.",55
349,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gippsland) [5.17] - Th honourable member for North Sydney said that he would not have risen had he not felt it necessary to reply to the statement that the proposal of the Government to take power from the Commonwealth. He said that it would not take away }x>wer. I was surprised to hear him say that. At the present time, under the Conable stitution, the Parliament will be free deal with the nnancial question at the of next year. Its action is at present fettered. That was the arrangement come to by the Premiers prior to the enactment of the Constitution, and it was accepted the people. If the proposed agreement carried out, our hands will undoubtedly tied. Therefore, the proposal of the Government is to take from our powers; to put into the Constitution something which will prevent us from altering the financial arrangement without the consent of a majority of the States. Let me read what the Treasurer said on the subject. He stated his opinion most emphatically in the following words: It was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this shall be the Constitution, and be a strange idea for the ParliaAustralia to say to the people, "" We are competent to handle this great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it . "" We, who the same people and the same electors; we, the Commonwealth Parliament, say- "" Take back this power; we are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the wav desire."" It must be obvious that we are asked to take from our powers. It puzzles me that the Prime Minister should be so desirous to have the agreement embodied in the Constitution. He and his Treasurer are adopting an attitude contrary to that which they have hitherto adopted. The honourable member for North Sydney said that at be former Conferences the subject discussed was the allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue, and that now the proposal is merely the payment to the States pf 25s. or per capita without the specification of any What particular revenue fund. That is mere quibbling. Does it matter what fund the end money comes from? If it be paid out of been Customs and Excise revenue, and the Commonwealth be left short, we shall have ten to make up the deficiency by takis a ing it out of other revenue; if it be be taken out of other revenue, leave deficiency, we shall have to to increase the Customs and Excise revenue. The position taken up by every Prime e Minister and Treasurer 'from the beginning to the present time has been that the settlement of the transfer of the State debts question is inseparable from the alwas location of the Customs and Excise revenue. The two things were considered inseparable at the first Convention in 1891, and have been considered inseparever since by the representatives of to the Commonwealth who have met the Preend miers in Conference. We have not been untold why the Prime Minister and Treasurer now have taken up an attitude which is quite the reverse of that which they by formerly took up. The last Conferbe ence was held in secret. It is the be only one. which has been so conducted. We do not know what arguas ments were used there to compel the Comtatives monwealth representatives to change opinions which they have been holding hine years, nor have we been informed why they did so. Mr DEAKIN';-The reasons used in Conference were those which have been used in this chamber, and have been by ine-som e of them three times.",55
350,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not heard any son given for dealing with the two matters separately, though it is very significant the Treasurer, when asked why two referfunds. enda were now suggested, said that the people might wish to accept one and reject the other proposal. That is an abandonthe ment of the contention that the two matthe ters should be dealt with together. We were told by the Prime Minister, when .he introduced the measure, that the arguments of the Premiers forced him to the concluwealth sion that the agreement should be adopted; but I do not remember that he has favoured us with those arguments. We have been told by those opposed to the proposal to embody the financial arrangement in the Constitution that' they object to it being made permanent. They wish to fix a time limit, so that Parliament may, if necessary, deal again with the matter later. But Prime Minister says that he wishes to have the agreement embodied in the Constitution to give us greater freedom; to enable us deal with the matter again within three, four, or five years, should that become necessary. On the other hand, the Prekerosene, miers desire to have it embodied in the to levy land and income taxation? Constitution to make it permanent. And what do those who support the Prime ister say? The honourable member for Wilmot savs thatBut for the fact that 25sper head is to paid for all time, I should not be prepared accept this part of the agreement. The honourable member for Nepean has stated that there should be "" something amounting to permanency "" in the arrangeStates. ment, and the honourable member for Morewe ton that "" there should be an element of permanency "" associated with it. - doubtedly the Premiers are aware, as these honourable members are, that the agreement, it embodied in the Constitution, will permanent. They do not support the view of the Prime Minister that to embody it in the Constitution will give us greater freedom. I do not wish to repeat what has been effectively and forcibly said by the honourable members for Flinders and Parkes to it being the opinion of the represenof the States that it will be practhe tically impossible to have the agreement for altered once it has been embodied in the Constitution. The honourable member for Echuca interjected'-,' when the honourable the member for Balaclava was speaking, that if it became necessary, the States would stated agree to an amendment of the Constitution. As has been pointed out, that reawould happen only when money was urgently needed, when the States, as well as that the Commonwealth, would be in want of Is it to be thought that the State politicians would surrender revenue to the Commonwealth and have attached to themselves odium of imposing taxation to make up deficiency ? Such a supposition is ridiculous. The States will incur large indebtedness, and undertake big public works, relying upon the payment from the Common- Their liabilities in this respect will increase every year, and they will throw upon the Commonwealth Parliament the odium of imposing the taxation necessary to obtain the revenue which they will spend.' If we ask the people for money for some national work connected, say, with the development of the Northern Territory, or the linking together of the eastern the and western parts of the Commonwealth, it will be difficult for us to get their approval. The honourable member for North to Sydney says that we have the whole field of taxation before us. Are we ""to further tax the masses by imposing duties on tea, and cotton goods, or are we going The honourable member for Echuca and others Minwill say, "" Perish the undertaking for which you want money if it has to be got by means of a land tax."" It is wrong be that one Government should have to be the to collecting agency, and the other the spendi agency. At"" the present time we collect n g the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, but three-fourths of it goes to the Under the proposed arrangement should have to collect 25s. per capita for the States. That, in a few years' time, Unmay, by reason of the increase of population, impose a heavier liability upon us than the Customs and Excise revenue will be bear, and we shall have to levy fresh taxation to meet our necessities, A good deal has been said with reference to the freedom of honourable members to vote as they please regarding this agreement. I am not concerned with the differences of opinion that may exist amongst honourable members on the Government side of the House, but it does seem strange to me, having regard to the declaration of the Prime Minister that he wished to obtain the frankest expression of the judgment of every honourable member upon this, "" the gravest question that this Parliament has yet met,"" that we should hear so much about coercion and influence being brought to bear upon certain honourable members. ,The honourable member for Batman spoke volumes last night when he related certain facts to the Committee. His statement has been ridiculed today as having reference only to the private conversations of individual members-. I take it, however, that a Government Whip, when he professes to carry a message from the Prime Minister to a Government supporter, does not occupy the position of a private member, and it is strange that that kind of influence should be used. I fail to stand why it should be. I fully appreciated the statement by the. Prime Minister that be desired the frankest expression of the judgment of every honourable member on this momentous question. That is a proper position to take up, for this question is far above all party considerations. should not be dealt with from Government, Opposition, Labour, or anti-Labour points of view, for it goes to the very root and existence of this Parliament. We have been told today that we are constantly hearing in this House the parrot-like cries of "" Commonwealth interests "" and "" the National Parliament."" I should like to know where such cries should be raised, if not in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Then we have the statement that has been made that certain honourable members opposite would vote against this agreement if they were free. It is difficult to understand how the supporters of the Government can be said to be otherwise than free in view of the statement by the Prime Minister, but it is a fact that several honourable members have openly declared themselves in favour of a limitation of the agreement, and yet have voted against an amendment designed to indicate to the Government the desire of the Committee that a limitation should be imposed. Take for instance, the honourable member for Wimmera, who, on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill, saidPerhaps in the course of ten or fifteen twenty years further experience may suggest necessity of making another alteration of the Constitution. Mr Wise. At another part of his speech, he said If the State debts were taken over automatically by the Commonwealth Parliament-and I very much regret that that is not made an integral part of this scheme-this Parliament would become the supreme financial power, so far as Australia is concerned. Then he went on to sayOur circumstances change rapidly. Public services come into existence one year which were hardly thought of the year before, so that the States should recognise that it is unreasonable to make an agreement of this kind perpetual. . . . I hope that in Committee it will be found, possible to meet the wishes of many honourable members, who, like myself, think that the payments to the States should be limited to a term of years. We were told on the floor of the House that a friendly arrangement had been made with the Prime Minister that a test vote should be taken to determine whether there should be a limitation to the agreement, on underthe motion for the omission of the word "" The "" from clause 3, and that honourable members would be perfectly free to vote as they pleased. Yet we found the honourable member for Wimmera voting for the retention of that word, and I venture to say that he will vote against the amendment now before us. I fail to understand why It he should have gone back on the opinion that he expressed in this House only a week or two ago. I come now to the honourable member for Kooyong, who went into the financial question rather elaborately, and submitted a scheme dealing with the whole of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. Speakingon the motion for leave to introduce this Bill, he said I never contemplated any change in the Constitution, but regarded it as a matter of trust between the representatives of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth, holding the opinion that it is quite competent for us to enter into an obligation for a period of years that will be as binding as any Constitutional enactment. I have not yet seen or discovered any reason for a referendum on the question. The proposal for the taking over of the State debts is quite a different matter; but, in regard to the Braddon section, I regard a referendum as unnecessary at present, in insisting that it is necessary to have the arrangement in black and white, we are practically taking up the position that we cannot trust ourselves . and also a want of confidence in the State Parliaments. He went on to sayThe Ministry, with their wider knowledge, may feel that a referendum is absolutely necessary, seeing that they are in possession of the or views of the various State Premiers; but I the think there is a middle course which would relieve much of the existing difficulty, and enable the whole of this House-becaus e it is not .a party question, but rather a family matter, concerning our own brothers and sisters-to come to an agreement universally acceptable. And yet the honourable member voted against the amendment to omit "" The."" Was any influence brought to bear upon him, either in the House or outside ? He also said I think that if the agreement were limited to, say, the next ten years, we shall in that period have a development which will surprise us all. . If honourable members sitting behind the Government were' free to vote as they pleased, why did the honourable member for Kooyong vote against the amendment? The honourable member for Lang, who was the last to speak to the amendment for the omission of the word "" The,"" said I do not regard the agreement as perfect, especially bearing in mind the commitments of the Commonwealth. Evidently the honourable member recognises that we have a lot of commitments, and does not know how they are going to be metI should like to see an arrangement come which, whilst insuring the solvency of the States, would be sufficiently elastic to enable us late our expenditure and income in accordance with our needs, without any further amendment of the Constitution in future, or recourse additional taxation. It is surprising to find member after memmonwealth ber making such statements, and yet votoffers ing against the test amendment to deterof mine whether the agreement should be for only a limited period. I have now quoted statements made by four Ministerial supporters, some of whom, like the honourable member for Kooyong, are of considerable standing. Had they voted according to their expressed opinions in this House, there would have been no doubt as to the result of the amendment in question.  himself is an example of inconsistency.",56
351,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not. gave the honourable member credit for having a little more brains than the honourable member for Fremantle has, although that is not saying very much. The honourable member for Flinders has replied already to the charge of inconsistency levelled at him by the honourable member for Fremantle, and the same charge is made against me because I said, in 1907, that I was prepared to support the arrangement which the honourable member then suggested. have not varied in my view of the subject; but, even if I had, two years have elapsed since the speech in question was made, whereas not two weeks have elapsed since some of the speeches from which .1I have just quoted were delivered. Indeed, that by the honourable member for Lang was delivered almost immediately before the Committee proceeded to a division last Friday morning.  keeper?",58
352,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should be sorry to take upon myself the responsibility of looking after the honourable member for Echuca. The most unsatisfactory feature of the Premiers' Conference is that it was held in secret. 'We know that it is alleged that at the back of the whole proposal is the promise of the influence and assistance of the State Premiers at the next general election. The facts cannot be quoted too often, because they are pregnant with meaning. The Argus has been quoted today as having desired an agreement for a period of three years. When it did not secure that, it made this commentThe Prime Minister thinks the political factor to is even more important than the nnancial one. to reguIt published that statement on the 19th August. On another occasion, it urgedIssues not merely nnancial, but of serious to political import, hang upon the result of the Conference. A failure on the part of the Comrepresentatives to accept reasonable may be held to prove the failure of the Fusion, and may result in dividing the House Representatives once more into its three warring and practically helpless parties. On the 2 oth August, it wroteThe agreement was drafted and drawn out ready for signature. It provides Mr Deakin with a definite something to fight for at the March elections, and it assures him and the Fusion party the support of the State Premiers. That is the only explanation of the action of the Prime Minister and his colleagues in reversing their former position, and undoubtedly it explains why the Conference took place in secret. Some honourable I certainly members have resented, and very properly resented, the threats of the State Premiers as to what they intend fo do at the next Federal election, and it may be just as well to quote the exact words used .by them. Mr Kidston, Premier of Queensland, referring to the possibility of some honourable members, whom he described as "" malcontents,"" joining with others to defeat this agreement, said I If that were the case, they would have a.very important .fight on their hands within the next six months. All he asked was that that agree, ment should be submitted to the people of Australia. He went on to sayThere was no other honourable course for the Federal Government than to ratify that agreement or refuse that agreement. For the benefit of those who were trying to interfere with the carrying out of this agreement, he would just like to point out that it was quite possible that, if they succeeded in their present aims, and prevented that agreement from being submitted to the people for ratification, this very undesirable result might come about-that the State might elect senators who would prevent any alteration of the Braddon clause' whatsoever until a reasonable settlement was come to. If that is not the most outrageous threat for a State Premier to make in regard to members of this House, I do not know what is. It is a distinct threat that, at the next general election, the State Premiers will run candidates for the Senate, who will be pledged, not to attend to the interests of Australia or of the States,"" but to allow no alteration of the Braddon section, which every one admits cannot continue, until a reasonable settlement of the financial situation is arrived at-. It is like holding a revolver at a man's head. Then, again, Mr Wade, Premier of New South Wales, said It would be suicidal to accept this reduced amount, and then to subject the States to the uncertainty and unrest arising from the knowledge that in future years the whole question would be re-opened, with a strong probability that the amount repayable to the States would be further reduced. I ask the Prime Minister, who talks about the ease with which the Constitution can be amended, when this agreement becomes irksome, what he has to say to that statement? It will be seen that Mr Wade contemplates absolute permanenceIt was generally understood that the question was one to be determined by the Commonwealth electors, and that if the Federal Parliament refused to allow the question to be submitted for decision the States should continue to work to secure a permanent agreement. It would, therefore, be necessary in the forthcoming general election to endeavour to secure a pledge from all candidates that they would support a proposal to make the agreement permanent, and that they would vote for its being remitted to the electors by next Parliament. He did not see what was to be gained by any further conference of Premiers. I cannot see, how, in view of the words of the Constitution, he could say it was "" generally understood,"" because the people generally understood that their representatives in this Parliament should have sole control. We should be unworthy of our position in this House, if , under' a threat like that, we were to vote against our convictions, as the honourable member for KooMr Wise. yong, the honourable member for Wimmera, and the honourable member for Lang, according to their utterances, appear to have done. It is a source of considerable regret to me that we have heard so few honourable members on the Government side. There are some, like the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who are supposed to have been Liberals all their lives, whom I should have been very glad to hear explain their reasons for supporting the proposal. That honourable member's former colleagues in the party-the honourable member for Corio, and, particularly, the honourable member for Batman, who are younger by some years than himself-hav e had no hesitation whatever in expressing themselves, even in the face of what we know was tremendous influence brought to bear to induce them to take a different view. There are other honourable members whom I should have liked to hear; but some, who have spoken, have attempted to create discord by making it appear that members of the Opposition are all eager to defeat the proposal for the purpose of injuring the Government. But a Government cannot be injured or defeated unless the combination formed is for the purpose of displacing them; and the combination the otherevening was one that had no possibility of office, and was formed for no such possibility ? It is, therefore, nonsense to say that honourable members on this side are eager to injure the Government. I am quite satisfied that, if we allowed this measure to go through, we would do the Government infinitely more damage than by opposing it. ' In the case of the direct Opposition, it would very much hasten the day when they would be able to bring into force or, what would be better, see their opponents bring into force, their much-desired land tax. But the Opposition recognises that this measure ought not to be the sport of parties, seeing that it is all-important to the future of Australia. If this agreement be embodied in the Constitution, nothing but discord and disunion can follow. We have had pointed out, over and over again, the influences that would be brought to bear to prevent any amendment of the Constitution in the future. We should find a minority, or certain States, standing in the way of an amendment; and what would happen? The Prime Minister, 1 think, said that friction would die away in future years-that the division between State Rights and the National interest would disappear. That, however, is not the teaching of history. We know that in the United States the State Rights question did not die out, but increased in intensity until it could only be settled on the disastrous fields of the Civil War. It is probable that our being part of the British Empire may stop us from civil war; but many things may happen to bring disaster nearly as great, in attempts to amend the Constitution. Honourable members should reflect what an awful responsibility is placed upon them.",58
353,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do recognise it.,60
354,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If there is one honourable member who recognises the responsibility less than others, it is the honourable member for Indi. I appeal to those who do recognise the responsibility not to sow seeds of disunion and leave a crop of trouble to be reaped by their children. agreement be embodied in the Constitution, I shall feel sufficiently sore to wish that those responsible may live long enough to reap the whirlwind. I hope, however, that they will yet rise to the occasion. Are honourable members who will vote for the proposal going to 'be honest enough at the elections to advocate its adoption on the platform? I fear that a great number will altogether drop the subject. never was a more momentous question before this Parliament; and the Prime Minister himself has said it is the gravest that ever arose. It is the parting of the ways; at this very early stage, we are asked to give the Federation a death blow-if not to wipe it out altogether, to place it , as the honourable member for Flinders very effectively said, on the low road of subserviency for all time. Are honourable members prepared to take that responsibility, sitting here as the representatives of the people of all Australia, and with the National interests to guard? Are they going to ask for the support of the Premiers at the next elections, and, surrendering their great powers and responsibilities, prove themselves absolutely unworthy of the trust reposed in them? I hope that such will not be the case; but that the measure will not be carried, and that whatever is to be done at the end of next year, this matter will be fought out on the platform, when members will be free to advocate their views without any question of party.",60
355,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay) [5.55] - It would not be wise to allow the question to be put without saying a few words. I desire to refer very briefly to one or two remarks made by the Prime Minister and speakers, notably the honourable member for North Sydney, as to the action of the Opposition in supporting the amendment. The inference that the speakers attempted to draw is that the Opposition are supporting a proposal with which they do not agree; but, as a matter of fact, our present action is the only one we could take, holding the views we do on the question before us. We are not able to obtain what we desire; and, therefore, our duty is to get that which is as near to our policy as possible, with the assistance of other honourable members, who. have practically the same ideas, but who also are unable to have their particular views adopted. It will not be inappropriate if I say that we are indebted to the honourable member for Mernda for the way in which he has treated this subject. If any man in this Parliament has taken great If this pains to present the National cause, as apart from the parochial cause, it is the honourable member. If in the earlier Parliaments, more serious thought had been given to his speeches and recommendations, we should not have been in our present trouble. The honourable member's schemes for taking over the State debts were, in my opinion,-statesmanlike; but they were ignored, and wilfully and maliciously misrepresented, both There inside and outside Parliament, particularly by the newspapers. Whatever division there may be of the Customs and Excise revenue-whethe r it be' collected by the Commonwealth and distributed amongst the States, or the Commonwealth retains the whole of it-the citizen of Australia does not benefit one penny piece; but when, in conjunction, we have-to consider the taking over of the State debts, then there immediately arises a position in which money can be saved. There is not an authority that has been consulted-and all have been consulted by the various Treasurers-bu t declares that the Commonwealth credit will be better than that of the States. I should like to say here that a great deal of criticism has been offered regarding the position of the Labour party on the question of the per capita payment, and the embodying of the agreement in the Constitution. I refer now to the proposal of the Labour Conference, from the official report of which a number of honourable members have quoted. It has been declared that the honourable member for South Sydney, who is at present absent from Australia, was in favour of embodying in the Constitution any agreement arrived at.",60
356,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That he was in favour other of a permanent arrangement.,60
357,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think I speak for the whole of the members on this side when I say that we are in favour of a permanent arrangement- .in favour of granting to the States a maximum of £ 7 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",61
358,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is when we take over the debts.,61
359,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Honourable members should recognise that the question of the allocation of the revenue ought to be associated entirely with the taking-over of at least that amount of the State debts the interest on which would be covered by the £7»5°o,ooo. That is a practical, sensible, and sane proposition. The honourable member for South Sydney knows the position exactly, although I am not speaking for him in regard to the State debts question. We have different ideas as to how the taking over of the debts can best be accomplished. He believes in taking them over, .but not in the form that I prefer. I have referred to him because he was quoted yesterday as being in favour of the proposal of the Government, but I had the pleasure of receiving from him yesterdav a letter, in which he gives unsolicited his opinion on this question, and deals with it in a way that leaves no doubt as to what his views are. The language of his letter is clear and definite, and the press was good enough to publish a portion of it today, ' The Prime Minister, in his anxiety to get out of a difficulty, in contending that there was an even vote in the Committee, claimed that the Chairman's vote, although given against his proposition, still left the numbers even. But how can he claim to have a majority in this House for his proposal when it is known that the majority of those who are not present are against it? I do not see how he can make that claim; but it would be impertinent on my part to interfere in any differences between members of his own party.",61
360,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the honourable member any warrant for making that statement with reference to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro?,61
361,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I said is true in any case. Even with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Prime Minister is no better off. The honourable member for Nepean has not applied his mind to the question at all. In view of the expression of opinion by the honourable member for South Sydney, the Prime Minister is in exactly the same position as before.",61
362,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is, that the agreement is not approved.",61
363,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That the proposal of the Government cannot be carried, because they have not the necessary majority.

365,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I leave the discussion of that matter to others, but I say positively that I know it is not so. Even if others are so persistent as to make a demonstration against a sick man, I think it would be improper for me to canvass him. I have been invited many a time to attempt to interview him on certain political questions, but I have always declined. I do not want to'embarrass a man who is not in the best of health, and never in any instance, by delegation or otherwise, have I approached him on any question whatever.",61

367,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any rate, I have stated my position with regard to him. In the letter which I received yesterday from the honourable member for South Sydney, written from Thabina, in the Transvaal, on 14th October of this year, the following passage occursAlthough, as you know, I am practicall)' the suggester of the per capita basis for overcoming the Braddon clause, I quite agree with you that it should not be embodied in the Constitution. Surely they can trust the people of Australia to do the right thing by majority without tying them up. . . . However, the bargain could be accepted for the time being without being included in the Constitution.",61
368,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is altogether out of touch now with Australian politics.,61
369,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the very reason why I think this letter is important. He left before this controversy began, and has been away from the seat of the trouble. Uninfluenced by local circumstances or surroundings, he is able to bring a fresh, .clear mind to the question.. With his experience in this House, his knowledge of Parliamentary life in Australia, and his acquaintance with the financial position of the Commonwealth and the States, he expresses a clear and distinct view practically in favour of the policy that we have adopted in his absence, and relatively more favourable to the proposal of the honourable - member for Mernda than to the Government proposal.",61

371,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Clearl y he says that - nothing that we do regarding the allocation of the revenue from Customs and Excise to supersede the present Braddon section should be embodied in the Constitution.,62
372,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He says we can trust the people, does he not ?",62
373,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but the proposition put forward by the Government in association with the State Premiers does not trust the people. No political manoeuvring - could be more calculated to mislead than the argument that the Government proposal is a proposal to trust the people of Australia. It is not. The Prime Minister used that argument also. I do not clap-trap, but it has all the elements of a clap-trapargument. If to trust people is the object of the Government and the State Premiers, why do not they trust the people from time to time? The honpossible orable member for Parkes, when speaking, reminded me of a statement made by the from late Sir Henry Parkes in this city twelve or to them. thirteen years ago. That distinguished statesman said : "" Probably ten years after ""this, none of us will be here to say a for the great object we have in view."" honourable member for Parkes said today that probably fifteen years hence very of tis would be here, but that the act that we proposed to do now would be absolutely binding on every one of the members of the Federal Parliament, who in those days would come here straight from their conCommittee. stituents, but would he powerless to alter it. Therefore, the Prime Minister and get the best proposal possible? those associated with him, if they place any reliance on the argument for trusting the people, will say : "" We will give people an opportunity every ten years least to express their views on the matter."" position to accept it at once. What objection can there be to that? proposition of the honourable member for Mernda, if given effect to, would simply mean that if the Parliament and the so desired, at the end of approximately fifteen years the question could be the people again, and that if a'majority the people were in favour of continuing conditions then existing they would be continued.",62
374,Mr FULLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How many are going be here in fifteen years?,62
375,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is my very point. Here are honourable members led by the Pi ime Minister saying that they must trust the people in this matter, but that we on this side are afraid to trust the people. Far from it. But we are not prepared to say that the people of Australia today are wiser than the people of Australia will be fifteen years hence. It would be presumptuous for honourable members to think that. The people fifteen years hence will have had more experience of Federation and of State activities, and will certainly be quite as capable as we are to regulate their financial affairs. Is it not a fact that those who support the Prime Minister's proposal are really apprehensive of the decision of the majority of the people of Australia ?",62
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member mind saying why no amendcall it ment has come from the other side ?,62
377,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I stated previously that the the Opposition could not get the scheme that they desired, and that, therefore, our public duty was to try to get the next best arrangement in. the public interest. Amendments in this matter cannot come this side unless the Ministry will listen Take the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier, which has been published in the newspapers, that this arword rangement should be put in the ConstituThe tion, if Parliament so desires, for nine years, but that every third Parliament the few people should be asked to express their approval or disapproval of its continuance.",62

380,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not doubt the honourable member's statement, but I arc afraid that if the proposal of the honourable memto ber for Barrier had been made first some other scheme would have commended itself more strongly to the honourable member's mind.",62
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I understood the honourable member for Wide Bay to say last night that he preferred not to put the arrangement in the Constitution at all.,63
382,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have never hesitated on that point. I stated again and again that I did not think it advisable to embody any arrangement arrived at in the Constitution, but when in an official position I said, speaking on behalf of the Government, that we would guarantee to the States at least £5,250,000 per annum for all time, and that if there was any surplus revenue above that the States could share it on a per capita basis. Surely that is clear and distinct enough. I do not think the Commonwealth has any desire to rob the States of a share of the Customs and Excise revenue, but I have held from the first, and hold today that whatever money is credited to the States should be paid in interest on the debts already incurred by them. My great objection to the agreement, as was effectively pointed out this afternoon by the honourable member for Parkes, is that whereas the allocation of the revenue between the States and the Commonwealth is mandatory, the great question of the State debts is simply left to an investigatory Committee. Readigg that agreement as a layman, I find not a word in it to bind the States to do anything so far as the debts are concerned. They simply say they will take that great question into consideration, and that there shall also be an investigation of the little differences between the calculations of Commonwealth and State officers regarding the transfer of the State properties. That paltry little matter is to come in with the other great question, which indicates to my mind that there was at the Conference a process of bargaining on small matters, and that great and important issues were lost sight of.",63
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is £8,000,000 - or £9,000,000 a mere nothing?",63
384,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is about the value of the whole of the transferred properties; but the difference at most is about 10 per cent. The only point raised in the document is whether certain properties shall be considered transferred properties; but it is not suggested that the difference will amount to more than £1,000,000, or £2,000,000 at most.",63
385,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The question is how much of the cost of the transferred properties was paid out of loan money ? Is the Commonwealth to pay twice for any part of these properties?,63
386,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Commonwealth took over the transferred properties at the valuation of, say, £9,000,000, it would credit the States accordingly in connection with the transfer of the debts.",63
387,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But we should be paying twice over, if we took over the whole of the debts.",63
388,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The sum of £7,500,000 will be allocated for the payment of interest on the debts, and surely the States will be credited with the value of such transferred properties as have been constructed with loan money. The Prime Minister, and other speakers on his side, have tried to make the public believe that it will have the same opportunity to amend the Constitution later as it has now. They omit to say that at the present time the Premiers of the States and the Commonwealth Government are in complete agreement-a n arrangement which, on their own admission, is of great political significance. The Premiers have stated openly, and it has been published in the press that, unless the Commonwealth Government stands by them, they will oppose it at the election. This is a political as well as a financial combination, and it is dragging Commonwealth politics into the gutter. It is the beginning of arrangements which may be made by Governments to carry out political ideas or to maintain office. Could the naked truth be put before the people, they would be indignant, and would declare that Federation was brought into existence for other purposes. It was created to deal with, not local matters, but great national questions, and to inculcate the National spirit. I doubt if any country would be great without the association of the national idea with the National Parliament. If within the first ten years of the Federation, we give away our powers, the growth of the national sentiment, and the. political and industrial progress of the Commonwealth, will be retarded. In saying that, I do not speak as one who is personally in favour of unification, because I am not; and by way of making a positive statement, rather than of correcting the mis-statements of others, I say that it is not true that the Labour party favours unification.",63

426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, he has not the honourable member's gigantic tellect.",66
427,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The point involved is not the possession of a gigantic intellect, but the capacity to think. If this agreesation. ment were affirmed by the Parliament and the people, surely the Government would not deny to the people of the Commonhave wealth ten years hence the privilege which the people of the present decade have? Surely it is not too much to say that, intervals of ten years, the people should have an opportunity of affirming or negativput ing such an agreement as this ? Such an arrangement would get over the Prime Minister's difficulty as to not trusting the people, for it would enable them every ten years to determine what should be done in the light of the latest and most complete information. If this agreement were init serted in the Constitution at the present time, and the people at a later period sired to take it out, a majority would be able to do so. Even if five-sixths of the people of the Commonwealth desired to remove it from the Constitution, they could not do so. But if we embodied it in the Constitution, subject: to the proviso that should be re-affirmed every ten years, should be sure that a majority of the people, with a majority of the States, most convenient way. would be able either to affirm it , or, if they did not, to say that the Commonwealth Parliament should thenceforward deal with the matter as it thought fit. A few days ago, the Prime Minister, as reported the Melbourne Her dial, made the followwealth ing comment on the proposition made by the honourable member for BarrierIt was interesting as a proposal which unite some of those who were divided in their opinions, but from a constitutional point of view he did not favour it. Mr Thomas's idea, briefly put, is that the 255. arrangement might be inserted in the stitution for a fixed term, at the end of [201]- 2 the question of the re-enactment of the clause should automatically go to the people. This would meet the views of those members who do not object to the amount of the proposed payment to the States, but who oppose the agreement because it would be possible hereafter for a minority to keep the arrangement in the Constitution. Mr Deakin said that some such idea was disby the Ministerialists some days ago, but the objection he saw to it was that it would the basis of the Constitution. Such a big question would open up a discussion lasting proover several weeks, and much time could be given up to the subject at this stage of a What is the Prime Minister's objection? His chief objection to the proposal is that intoo much time would be occupied in discussing it .",66
428,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The report is merely the reporter's recollection of a general converI think that it gives part of it .,66
429,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was careful to say that the Prime Minister was reported to made this statement with regard to the proposition of the honourable member for Barrier. It seems to me that the honat orable gentleman grasped the situation at once. He recognised, as soon as it was before him, that it was really a means of asking the people from time to time to re-affirm the agreement. The main object is to get over the difficultv of a minority being able to retain something in the Constitution long after the vast majority of the people have made up their minds that should be taken out of it . It was said last week by the Premier of Queensland dethat the States would be injured if the not Commonwealth were to take over their debts, and in any way to restrict them from borrowing. I desire in no way to restrict the borrowing of the States, beyond the point that I - think the good sense of the people it would soon lead to an arrangement whereby we State loans could be placed on the market at the most convenient time, and in the",66
430,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Mr . Kidston could not prevent us from taking over the State debts as existing at the time of Federation.,66

As a politician, T am not averse to the Commonwealth taking over the deMs at Conthe time of Federation ; but that would be which a grave blunder compared with taking over the whole of the debts at the same time that we arrange for the distribution of the revenue. It would be a great advantage if this Parliament could have the direction of all the negotiations for renewals, conversions, and the flotation of new loans. have no doubt that great saving would result from the taking over of the debts, though the Treasurer seems to have some doubt on the point.",66
432,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think I said anything about that.,67
433,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"F r o m the remarks the honourable gentleman has made recently, I gather that he is not at all anxious to undertake the burden of the State debts.",67
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I was always in favour of taking over the State debts.,67
435,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If that be so, does the honourable member not think that it would be a great deal more statesmanlike, if the necessary legislation had been passed to enable the debts to be taken over, before we dealt with the distribution of the revenue ?",67
436,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have always said that the two matters could be conveniently taken together, but that they could be dealt with separately.",67
437,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that they are not inseparable, but the honourable gentleman will admit that in his memorandum he stated that by the taking over of the State debts there would be a saving in interest of £26,000,000 in about half a century.",67
438,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so, if ""the Commonwealth stock were quoted J per cent, better than that of the State.",67
439,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable gentieman not think that the credit of the Commonwealth would be at least, £ per cent, better than that of the State? '",67
440,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think it would be after a while.,67
441,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think .it would be better at once; but, in any case, i per cent., or 2s. 6d. per cent., better to begin with would mean an enormous saving, and some scheme to bring it about ought to be put into operation as early as possible. If the interest be assured, the Commonwealth ought to be responsible for not only the interest, but the whole of the principal.",67
442,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The States would have to indemnify the Commonwealth under the Constitution.,67
443,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Commonwealth should undertake the responsibility, without any further obligation on the States. A number of State members of Parliament take the view that the desire is to aggrandize the Commonwealth Parliament, and to take possession of the railways and other assets; but I hope that nothing of the kind will be done. It is quite true that Sir I George Turner, one of the ablest of our Treasurers, said that he desired no further guarantee for the payment of the interest than the revenue which the Commonwealth could hold ; but as the indebtedness would be greater than represented by that amount, he demanded that the States should hypothecate their railway revenue to secure the Commonwealth against loss.",67
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The amount of 25s. would not be enough.,67
445,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is obvious that 25s. a head, in nearly all the States, would not cover their present indebtedness, but the Commonwealth has power to take over only £200,000,000 of debts. What I desire is to remove the misapprehension in the minds of a large number of representatives of the States. I am not speaking from mere hearsay, because, when I was in office, I had a conversation with one State representative, at any rate, who declared, "" We are not going to allow the Commonwealth to take over our debts, as it will also mean the taking over of our railways."" I did my best to persuade him to the contrary, but without avail; and a feeling of the kind is very prevalent, though I do not say it is found amongst those holding responsible positions. That view, however, has been used by a prejudiced press in order to prevent the debts being taken over. The Commonwealth credit should be better than that of the States, or the Commonwealth should cease to exist. If we assume that the Commonwealth credit is better by J per cent., or 5s. per cent., then, by - putting the difference aside as a sinking fund, we could, at 3 per cent, compound interest, pay the whole of the principal and interest in eighty-seven years, without collecting a single penny more from the taxpayers. Surely that is worth considering; because it would give the Commonwealth a better standing, and afford absolute security to the States.",67
446,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Eve n if the proposed arrangement is amended, - it applies only to the interest, and not to a sinking fund.",67
447,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am afraid the honourable member does not quite follow me. There would be an absolute severance of Commonwealth and State finance, and, at the same time, there would be set aside a certain proportionate amount for each of the States. I desire to make it perfectly clear that, however we may distribute the bably revenue, the people of the Commonwealth can in no way be advantaged; but that immediately we take over the debts, is a saving. I presume we are here to "" Everyone save money where-possible; and if , by the superior administration or credit of the Commonwealth, the whole of the indebtedgained ness can be paid off in less than a century, be continued. the suggestion is worth considering. I have here some extracts which may be of Then some interest. At the Adelaide Conventhat tion in 1897, Sir George Turner said I simply say that if we are to give the Commonwealth power to take over the debts, let it be the power to take over all the debts at the time the transaction is carried out. Otherwise I think that if the debts of one State are taken over there will be a reduction of interest, or else they will be worth more because they belong to the Commonwealth. Mr J. Henry, Sir Edmund Barton, and the honourable member for Denison, also spoke of the advantage to be gained by a consolidation of the debts, the last-named sayingWe ought not to be six separate peoples, with six separate interests, but one people with one interest. I commend that remark to the honourable member now. Sir George Turner interjected, "" And one debt,"" to which the honourable member repliedYes, and one financial agency. . . . Still we have advanced so far that we recognise that instead of going into the world's money markets, competing against each other as we do, from time to time, it would be to our advantage to consolidate our debts get it (money) more cheaply. Mr Dobson and Sir Edmund Barton spoke to the same effect. Let me make a rather more lengthy quotation from a Conference reportThe only benefit which we can hope to gain from the Federal Government taking, over our debts, or any portion of our debts, will arise from this. There would be only one borrower on the money' market instead of seven borrowers, each competing with the others, and the one borrower would be in a more advantageous position for negotiating loans, and might obtain better terms for that reason. So far as I can see, Sir George Turner, from your proposal and from the proposal made by Sir Frederick Holder, no federalization of the States debts is possible at the present time; and we might consider whether any other action that we could take would give us the benefits which we hope would accrue from the federalization of the States debts. It was hoped that the one borrower, instead of seven, would get more advantageous terms, and that the amount of the interest bill would be reduced. The price that the Commonwealth would get for their loans would probe slightly better. That was said by Mr Kidston. Mr. there Butler, South Australia, saidmust admit that what you call the cut-throat"" policy adopted by the different States in the past has resulted in heavy loss to all, and that any advantage which is to be by substituting Commonwealth for State credit must be neutralized if the same policy we get this statementHad it not been that the Treasurers-seein g they are, to a certain extent, faced with almost immediate conversion saw some possibility of making better terms through the Commonwealth than their States could make independently, I do not think we should have had a Conference at all. That was said by the Honourable J. Gardner, Treasurer of Western Australia, on the 8th February, 1904.' The last Conference, however, declined to have anything to do with the transference of the State debts, desiring to continue the old system - unde r which six borrowers competed in the money market-possibl y with the Commonwealth as a seventh competitor. I cannot conceive of a more humiliating position for the Federation. The National Parliament was created to deal with the transference of the State debts and other nationalquestions, but, after nine years, the best arrangement the Prime Minister can propose is for the setting aside of the transfer of the State debts and the distribution of the Commonwealth revenue in such a way that the State debts may never be transferred to the Commonwealth. The other night, the honourable member. for We could Moreton said that he is in favour of the proposal for the distribution of the revenue, and that the Government would get no help from him so far as the taking over of the State debts was concerned, because he thought that the Commonwealth had already too much power, and had misused some of it. He is therefore content to allow the States to continue in the old way. Let me iriake one more quotation. Mr Kidston, speaking at the Sydney Conference, in 1906, said If the amount of the debt were fixed, then in fifty years or in twenty years the whole balance might be altered. In any case, it would do two things, both of which are eminently desirable. It would create an Australian stock, and make the Federal debt an investment which would, at any rate, bring better prices to the seller. A little later, he said I venture to say that, taking a broad view of financial affairs, and looking more than ten years ahead, this proposal shows, not only a broad Australian spirit, but would establish the ing for guidance. financial stability of the States, and end the whole of the trouble that now exists. I have another statement by the present Treasurer, but I need not read it to honourable members. To my mind, the Government has not faced this question as it should have done - The action of Ministers in putting on one side the transfer of the State debts at the dictation of the Premiers is not statesmanlike nor advantageous to the people. Whatever the result of the division may be, I shall take every opportunity to inform the people that it would be to their disadvantage to em-' body the agreement in the Constitution. I shall not hesitate to do that, even though the view I take may be unpopular. I shall do so because I think that the arrangement, i if inserted in the Constitution, will be mischievous. The Government may gain a temporary advantage, but it will be establishing a precedent which, I hope, no future Government will follow. Just one other matter before I conclude. Ministers have denied that pressure has been put on. their followers regarding this matter. I take no exception to honourable members voting as they choose, but my candid opinion is that, but for the influence of the Government, and the promise to the Premiers, not twenty members would vote for the proposal.",67
448,Mr HANS IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And how many honourable members opposite would vote against it?,69
449,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Honourable members on this side are at liberty to vote as they please on this auestion.,69
450,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There has not been a meeting, then?",69
451,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not on this question. The Prime Minister said, by way of excuse, that there had been a meeting of his party, but that he had not taken a vote on this question. It is nothing to me how Ministerial party meetings are held. is admitted that there are such meetings. If votes are not taken at them, I do not know how the wishes of the party are deteimined. In any case, I do not see what advantage he gained by the statement. Judging by what the honourable member for Balaclava said when he was discussing the election of a Speaker, a party vote was taken by which he felt himself bound. Whether members opposite are bound on the question before us is not now in issue. What has happened is that the Government, which claims to have the national interests at heart, has surrendered them to the States at a time when the people are lookI quoted the late Sir Henry Parkes on a previous occasion as saying that, although he represented the State which had more to lose than any other, he was prepared to give up everything, trusting the people to decide according to their intelligence and lights. It would be well for Australia had we now a Prime Minister who would take up such a statesmanlike attitude. If we cannot trust the people to do the right thing at every election, it is a serious reflection on them. To put the agreement into the Constitution is to declare that this generation is wiser than those which will follow it. I again express regret that the consolidation of the State debts is not made mandatory, and the distribution of the revenue left for further investigation. The Prime Minister said that if the Conference had had more time, it could have settled everything. He can have more time. He can appeal to the electors on the subject. We are quite ready to do so. The position would remain as it is now. It would not be affected by anything done in this Parliament. Surely the Prime Minister does not desire us to believe that the States would mistrust him? The States would be perfectly secure if he and his party went to the election under those conditions, and if the Government are so confident of their position, why do they not take the chance to settle the matter in that way? Why is the Prime Minister so anxious to put the arrangement in the Constitution without any mandate from the people? He is doing this without a mandate, and at a time when there is no opportunity to advise and enlighten the people as to what the proposal really means. He is doing it at the close of a Parliament, when what is practically the biggest question that has yet been discussed here has received very It scant attention. All of us are very poorly informed about it, and it would have been well for this Parliament if , in its earlier days, it had devoted more time to the financial question, so that honourable members and the public would have been better informed regarding all its phases, and better able to give an intelligent vote on it.",69
452,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Robertson) [8.32] - The address delivered by the Leader of the Opposition was full of information, and took a broad view of the financial question. I refer more particularly to the large question of taking over the State debts, and the honourable member's statement that he would not restrict the borrowing of the States. I wish to make a point of that, because that matter will have to be considered at some future time, and the fact that the Labour party are not in favour of restricting the borrowing of the States must, I think, make them strong when the question has to be decided as between the States and the Commonwealth. This debate has been full of interest, and the amount of special pleading resorted to must have aroused a great deal of admiration on the part of honourable members. f thought the Prime Minister acquitted himself excellently, as he always does. The honourable member for .Herbert stated that in this debate the point had been overlooked that, when the Constitution was before the Convention, equal representation in the Senate for every State was insisted upon. As it would be most difficult to take out of the Constitution anything which the States did not want taken out, the States knew that they were secure once they got that provision in, because before it could be taken out they themselves would have to vote in favour of that course. During the dinner hour I looked up the figures to ascertain what the proportion would be, and I found that 20.14 P er c e n t . of the population could prevent 79.86 per cent, of the population from taking out of the Constitution anything that had once been put into it. Thus, less than twenty-one persons out of every 100 could prevent the other seventy-nine persons from giving effect to their wishes. Of course, it was that provision that caused the small States to come into the Federation. They are very strong in the Senate, and will always be so, because we cannot take that representation from them without their consent. Therefore, I say we should not put into the Constitution anything that we may afterwards wish to take out. If we do put anything into the Constitution, and desire at some future time to take it out, although we have 79 per cent, of the people on our side, the other 21 per cent, can prevent us. The Prime Minister says that we would only wish to take the proposed provision out at a time of financial stress. Of course, nothing would be more easy at such a time, because,, as soon as there is financial stress, as soon as we are attacked by the enemy, we are one people, solid and inseparable. Then, of course, we could do anything in that regard.",69
453,Mr TILLEY BKOWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not that the point ?,70
454,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , it is not the point at all. The point is that when the enemy attacks us, and there is a time of financial stress"", our prosperity leaves us, and poverty and privation overtake us„ Then, of course, we speak with one voice and act as one man. Under this agreement, the State of New South Wales is called upon to pay 4s. 7d. per head of population more than she ought to. The State of Western Australia is losing ios. per head of population. Still, Western Australia was amply represented at the Conference, and, as a result, obtained a special concession in the shape of a cash payment of £3,250,000. The State of New South Wales, on the other hand, lost about £500,000 a year through not being adequately and faithfully represented. Mr. Wade said that "" he got the worse of the bargain at the hands of the Commonwealth,"" but accepted the situation. I doubt that statement- Mr Wade was outmanoeuvred by the other State Premiers - for I decline to believe that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth would penalize any one State. He dare not suggest it, for has he not at his elbow the Minister of Defence, who is the exLeader of the Opposition and the second part of the Fusion, to represent the interests of New South Wales? I take it that this agreement was not the agreement of the Commonwealth, but the agreement of the States. Indeed, sufficient evidence is forthcoming to show that the Prime Minister said, "" We require a certain sum of money, and that sum we must have."" I thoroughly agree with that. He also said, "" You shall divide the balance amongst yourselves."" Then the representatives of the States began to wrestle, and when five men got at the throat of Mr Wade, he cried for mercy, panic had arrested him. They said to him, "" You shall be allowed to go back to your State with an agreement, which you alone over-estimate the value of, properly signed, provided that you give to Western Australia £3,250,000 in hard cash."" Queensland got what she wa>, - entitled to, all but 9d. per head of population, so that no clamour can be expected from that quarter at present. Mr. Wade, however, when he returned to Sydney, said that he was badly treated. If that is so, there should be a re-opening of the door of the room, where that meeting was held, and the - public should 'MIOW what was said, so that they could judge whether Mr Wade was fairly or unfairly treated. If he was fairly treated, let us have it upon record. I have read the report of the Conference, and, while there is a 'summary of other questions that were discussed, there is not a single word as to the means by which the Conference arrived at the 25s. per head of population arrangement. Throughout the discussion, we can understand from a remark dropped, Hansard was told not to .jeport certain matters. It appears, therefore, that, the Conference conspired against giving the public any information as to the means by which they arrived at their decision. I say, again, that we ought to put into the Constitution nothing that we may wish to take out of it. We can"" arrive at a temporary understanding until the great question of consolidating the public debt is dealt with. When that time arrives, the whole question can be re-opened, and no harm will have been done in the meantime. That would be ih accordance with the fourth plank of our charter-the Fusion agreement. In June last, the honourable member for Ballarat was interviewed, and gave the press official information, which was published under the headings of "" The Basis of Fusion,"" "" Official Agreement."" The report read in this wayThe leader of the Opposition (Mr Deakin) today made public the policy which was agreed to by all parties sitting behind him. The of Fusion is as follows4. Pending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. An interim arrangement was to be entered into, so that we might at some future time have a discussion upon the broad question of taking over the State debts. I therefore fall back upon that fourth plank, and I expect the Prime Minister to fulfil the compact that he entered into with us. I also expect the honourable member for Parramatta, as representing the other side of the Fusion, to see that the arrangement is faithfully kept.",70
455,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Bu the is the hostage for the Fusion.,71
456,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The word fusion is cominginto general use as applied to this party, but I prefer the word coalition. You can have a coalition if there are differences between you. In a fusion, both sides have to give away something, but, as the Prime Minister gave nothing away, there could have been no fusion, but there could have been a coalition. There has been a good deal of discussion on the amendment now put forward by the honourable member for Mernda. The same honourable member moved an amendment last week which was regarded as a test motion. A test vote has been taken in the same way hundreds of times in Parliament as an indication of what the House wants. In this case,- what the House wanted was a review of the agreement. The exact proposal of any one honourable member might not be the exact proposal of others. I disagree with the honourable member for Mernda's proposal; but the effect of carrying it will be to stipulate that the agreement shall be terminable. The question of whether it shall cease to operate when the amount returnable to the States under it reaches £7,500,000 per annum, or twenty-five years hence, is of no consequence at' this stage. The main question is whether or not it shall be terminable, and it is that fact that enables the honourable member to obtain considerable support for his amendment. The honourable member has referred to those who are acting with him, and I cannot help saying that if he had to rely only upon their arguments, the acceptance of his amendment would be unlikely. The honourable member for Parkes has declared that he would favour a per capita allowance basis of 30s. per annum to the States. If such an allowance were made, it would be impossible to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth.",71
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member would have to find more revenue.,71
458,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . The honourable member for Parkes evidently has not carefully studied the question. His proposal would mean a return to the States of £6,500,000 per annum; and the Commonwealth, instead of receiving £2,300,000, would get only £1,400,000. In round figures, the Commonwealth' would have a shortage of £1,000,000. He has also shown his failure to study the question carefully by his statement that as the population increased, the revenue from the Customs Tariff would decrease. Mi. BRUCE SMITH - I did not say anything of the kind. What I said was that the revenue from the present Tariff would increase in volume; but that it would decrease per capita, as shown by the statistics of three Protectionist countries.",71
459,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That say, it would decrease in percentage and per capita.",72
460,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Per capita.,72
461,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member does not seem to realise that that would work out as a reduction in percentan age.,72
462,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all.,72
463,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I knew that the honourable member did not understand the question, and that was why I said that we could not act upon the arguments of some of those who are working in concert with the honourable member for Mernda.",72
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the midst of this confusion, stand by the agreement.",72
465,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unde r the proposal of the honourable member for Parkes, there would be a loss to the monwealth of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",72
466,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There wil l be now.,72
467,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Commonideas wealth would have £1,000,0000 per annum less than it must have to carry on with. The honourable member, therefore was indulging in mere fudge in quoting House. certain figures. Does he recognise that his proposal would bring about direct ber is very jealous. taxation? Does he desire direct taxation just as he wants unification? Any honourable member who supports the for Government proposal will also declare that he is in favour of unification. Under this agreement, the finances are to be pooled. All the revenue is to be placed in one receptacle, and there is to be an equal distribution. That is what would happen if we had unification. There would be a common fund to which every State would contribute, irrespective of its gress, development, or wealth per head the population. There would be one commore than £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 mon fund from which each State would draw to provide for its services. agreement, if adopted, would mean really the beginning of unification, and that is one must be sound in principle today. reason for our opposition to it. I can underbegan stand the Labour party favouring a per capita return of 25s. per annum, because large section of that party believe in unificathe tion. They know also that such an allowsay, ance would lead to a shortage in the finanround,'ces of the Commonwealth, and so would clear the road to the imposition of the direct taxation they favour. The affairs Australia cannot always be managed from Melbourne. Local Departments must managed locally. I do not wish to enlarge upon that aspect of the question, but I is to desired to show that the honourable member for Parkes should not be taken too seriously when he speaks for two hours in the morning. The honourable member gave us a rehash of a great deal of valuable information. He quoted largely from excellent speech made by the honourable member for Gippsland, which was brimfu l of information, and was the result of a great deal of industry. The honourable member for Parkes was guiity of plagiarism in extracting from that speech, so to speak, large junks of information, although I admit that he said that he had not brought a barrowful of books into the all chamber, and was content to quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Gippsland, which he declared in passing to evidence great industry. The speech Comdelivered by the honourable member for Gippsland was convincing, but the honourable member for Parkes sandwiched it with of his own with the result that the whole was unsound, and led one to begin to think that the honourable member for Parkes belonged to the other side of the",72
468,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable mem-:,72
469,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am jealous the honour that is due to the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Flinders stated that at a Premiers' Conference, held some time ago, he proposed that there should be a continuation of the Braddon section, but that no Treasurer would think of making such a proposition at the present time. I agree that no Commonwealth - Treasurer would pronow think of doing so for the reason that of the Commonwealth Government require per annum, in addition to what they could retain This under the Braddon section. But if that proposal were sound in principle then, it We as a Federation by returning to the States three-fourths of the Customs and a Excise revenue, but so soon as we put all revenue into a common receptacle and "" We shall distribute it evenlv all we declare for unification. If the proposition made by the honourable member for Flinders at the Conference to which he of refers was sound, then he should have supported my amendment, for it would have be done justice to New South Wales and no injustice to the other States of the Commonwealth.",72
470,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is disappointed because his amendment was not carried.,73
471,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is mistaken if he imagines that I thought I should succeed in carrying that amendment. I simply desired to ventilate the fact that, under this agreement, New South Wales would suffer a loss for all time of something like £500,000 per annum. I knew that I should have an opportunity later on to utilize the disagreements amongst honourable members who cannot make their logic tally, and to give a vote to prevent the passing of this agreement, and so to cause it to be reviewed. As a matter of fact, I think I scored last week; instead of being disappointed I was elated. The vote that I gave led to the Chairman being called upon to give his casting vote, which I may say in passing is as powerful as is that of any honourable member. In the Senate, when the voting is equal, the question passes in the negative, but the vote of the Chairman of Committees in this House is equal to that of any other honourable member. Had you; Mr Chairman, in your wisdom, given your vote last Friday against instead of in favour of the amendment, no one could have questioned your decision. I desire this agreement to be reviewed. I do not think any State will suffer if it is. I Premiers again assemble in Conference I am satisfied that they will meet with open doors, and that the public will know their reasons for arriving at a decision. If it is decided that New South Wales must make a sacrifice, she will then do so with her eyes open. If it is said that there are impecunious States that must be assisted, then I am sure honourable members will hurry to their assistance. But I do not think that any State is seeking relief at the door of another.",73
472,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But each State wants its own.,73
473,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The State, of which the honourable member is a representative, is losing ad. per head more than she ought to lose under this agreement. New South Wales is the greatest State in the world, but Queensland will be as great. Future Premiers of those States, with a better idea of the responsibilities devolving upon them as the representatives of millions of people, may say that this is an inequitable adjustment. But, although the people of those two States, representing two-thirds of the population of the Commonwealth, may ask for a modification of the agreement, their voices will be as voices in the wilderness,, if it is embodied in the Constitution, without any limitation, since it will be open to 21 per cent, of the people, if the ratio of population in the several States remains as at present, to outvote 79 per cent. It is a situation of that kind that will bring about a civil war. To avert the distant possibility of such a catastrophe we federated, and if the Federation is now used to impose upon the people unification a civil war will be brought about in the distant future. We should put nothing in the Constitution that we may wish to take out ; and a revision of this agreement would be a good thing for the Commonwealth. I absolve this Government from any participation in the injustice done to New South Wales. Though I have said a good deal about the financial agreement, I have never imputed any blame to the Commonwealth Government in this connection. I worked with some of them for nine years, and found them straightforward,broad minded men; and I decline to think that they were a party to the unjust agree-, ment which took away £400,000 per annum for all time from the people of New South Wales, and as time runs on this sum will increase. If my vote would sef the cure it, I should have a review of the situation, without binding myself to any particular scheme. I desire the Premiers to be heard, and the Prime Minister to be heard, and to see the latter as firm as when he said, "" We require £2,373,100, and not a penny less will be taken."" That is the voice of a strong man, such as we require to lead us. If we have a strong man,- we shall see him through, but for one who vacillates, we can have nothing but disgust. I ask the Prime Minister to do his best to bring about another meeting of Premiers, and see if they cannot come to an arrangement which will be satisfactory to New South Wales and do justice to every State.",73
474,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [9.2] - Un like the honourable member and distinguished gentleman who has just resumed his seat, I approach this subject without any special knowledge whatsoever. I . have found considerable difficulty in arriving at any sort of sound judgment as to what the Australian requirements really are on the subject of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States. I , at first, sat at the feet of the honourable member for Mernda in a worshipful frame of m in d; but, after considerable labour, I came to the conclusion I was not capable of thoroughly understanding his proposal. Then 1 sat at the feet of the honourable member for Parkes, and, though I found my resting place slightly more comfortable, I confess that, even there, I could not get the solace and comfort I was looking for. I have also sat at the feet of sundry other financial authorities in the House, including the many different feet of the honourable member fOr Robertson. I can remember that honourable member taking quite a different stand from-that he has adopted this evening. I can remember his. posing as the champion of nationalism in this Parliament, whereas to-night I have heard from him nothing but a sort of furtive bleat on behalf of moribund parochialism, from the State, the representation of which he adorns. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It made mad.",73
475,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What made me madder was the fact that, after listening with considerable interest, and even greater pleasure, I am now in some doubt as to what the honourable member is going to do in regard to the particular amendment before the Chair. So far as I can understand, the honourable member professes himself anxious to have his own scheme carried into effect, and he is in favour of a reopening of the question. He is in favour of a Constitutional amendment, though not the Constitutional amendment now proposed. The present alternative appears to be one form of Constitutional amendment as against another form of Constitutional amendment. On that point, the honourable member, in the exuberance of his eloquence, forgot to enlighten poor ignorant honourable members, such as the humble gentleman addressing the Committee. The first thing that interests me ""in the present situation is the altogether hopeful re-arrangement of parties; and I use the word "" par:ies "" in its broad sense, because I should be the last to crack any party whip on a subject of this kind. When this session opened, I can remember my honourable friends opposite accusing the archangel of liberalism, the present Prime Minister, of appalling .backsliding in venturing to ally himself with such 'Tory fossils as the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Flinders, and a number of others. I now find that the Opposition realise the inherent merits of the honourable member f c i Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes; and I am glad, because I have long since recognised those merits myself. Now I hold that the fact that certain honourable members on the Government benches are, on this Bill , working in the same direction as members of the Opposition gives no one any justification or cause to complain of their party loyalty. We had an honourable member this afternoon talking of "" lip loyalists"" amongst the Government supporters! The term is an offensive one at any time, and not only offensive, but unjust, when applied to a number of honourable members who have the misfortune to be opposed to the Government on a non-party question which they regard as of great. importance. For instance, we have had the honourable member for Flinders attacked in the press, and in the House, in a way which reflects little credit on the attackers. What is this quesme tion ? It is essentially a non-party question. If honourable members can see their way to support the Government, as I am supporting them, well and good; but, if they cannot, surely this is not an occasion to have the party whip cracked at them in the press and in this House? I am glad to say that neither the Leader of the Government nor the Ministry have endeavoured to take any such action; but I find that their example has not been followed by certain members who belong to what I might call "" the pack "" - for it is noticeable that certain kinds of politicians, like certain types of animals, find it safer to hunt in packs. . Those, gentlemen may feel bitterly resentf u l at an honourable member having sufficient individuality to have an opinion of his own and sufficient courage to back it . For my part, greatly as I have always admired the keen perception and breadth of view of the honourable member for Flinders, I never had greater admiration than for his courage all through this business. I say that, even whilst I disagree with him ; and the man who does not recognise grit and courage, in a great national crisis of this kind, is not fit for a place in this House. It is rather a pity that the full sense of this Chamber cannot be taken on this question. The Prime Minister, I think, will agree with me that a matter involving a change of the Constitution is one which should not depend on a catch division.",74
476,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"B e courageous, and give a pair to the honourable member for South Sydney!",75
477,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have already given pairs in this debate. I should like to see another absent honourable member who is in Australia declare himself one way or another on this important question; that is, I should like to see the honourable member for Eden-Monaro declare himself, because it is only fair that he should. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He is against the Government.",75
478,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then let him say so, and we can talk about what we can do for him.",75
479,Sir JOHN EORKEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is ill .,75
480,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We know he is; and I have been ill myself, and have always felt grateful to honourable members for conveniencing me with a pair. It is quite possible that Constitutional amendments may be proposed in the future and passed in a haphazard way. We may have an amendment, as serious as the one now proposed, carried in the Committee stage by a catch division, only the third reading requiring the statutory majority. I suggest that if we could ascertain what is the real opinion of honourable members in the Chamber, it would make our position much stronger before the country. What honourable members are asked to do, is not only to give a vote here, but to back their opinion on the public platform at the next general election ; and if we are in a position to say that the decision arrived at was, in the whole course of the Bill, by an absolute majority of this and another place, our position would be, as I say, infinitely stronger on the public platform. I suggest that the Ministry might consult with honourable members opposite, and see whether some sound-way of carrying out this idea can be arrived at.",75
481,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The two absent members are against the agreement-certainl y the honourable member for South Sydney is.,75
482,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That may be. But I do not desire to advise anybody to give a pair to an absentee unless we have a written assurance from the latter.,75
483,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have the written assurance of the honourable member for - South Sydney.,75
484,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Flinders has said that we must, on this question, range ourselves into Federalists and anti-Federalists; but I venture to dis-' agree with him. I think the honourable member underestimates enormously the strength of the Federal feeling throughout Australia. In portions of my own electorate, which, nine years ago, were strongly anti-Billite, the younger community are beginning to be Australians, as distinguished from New South Welshmen. That process is going on all over Australia; and, therefore, it behoves every one who wishes for a union of the Australian people to do nothing to interfere with the even flow of that Federal sentiment. If a party or a section of this Committee show themselves anxious to starve other public agencies in which they are not directly interested, it will materially interfere with that even flow; and I say that as a man who looks, forward to a unified Australian people in the future, when such a thing can be safely brought about, though certainly not now. The last thing we ought to do is to show ourselves at this juncture grasping in dealing with Australian finances. We ought not to be grasping, in view of all that has been said here-in view of all the vituperation that has been hurled on State members and State Premiers-o r say that they, who are our partners in the responsibility for the administration of the affairs of Australia, shall have no financial guarantee from year' to year, on which to properly base their Estimates.",75
485,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are all agreed on that point.,75
486,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we are all agreed that there should be a constitutional amendment, I have only to say that one of the hard and fast character suggested by the honourable member would be more difficult to revoke than that proposed by the Government.",75
487,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister said otherwise two nights ago. Mr. KELLY - What have I to do with that ? I am expressing my own opinion.,75
488,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The proposal of the honourable member for Mernda provides automatically for the reconsideration of the matter.,75
489,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Le t us say fifteen years hence.,75
490,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The time may be hastened.,75
491,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have been told that the Premiers will throw every obstacle in the way of a second amendment of the Constitution.,75
492,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are justified in saying that by what has happened in the Dast.,75
493,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then we are justified in believing that the Premiers will throw every obstacle in the way of an increase of popuFederation. lation by immigration to delay reaching the period provided by the honourable ber for Mernda for the termination of the arrangement.,75
494,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But fhey would be getting 25s. per capita from the Commonours wealth.,76
495,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On l y during the prescribed by the honourable member f o Mernda. l n my opinion, one of the strong points about the agreement as it stands is that it makes the States equally interested with us in fostering immigration. But the amendment, if it had any effect this connection, would offer them an in ducement to keep their population within certain limits. In my opinion, the prothe posed agreement will last a much shorter time than the arrangement suggested by the honourable member for Mernda. Does any honourable member believe that, if a great national emergency were to arise, and Ausaction. tralia were to be threatened by foreign aggression, the agreement would last? The moment that we are faced by foreign speech. aggression we shall become one people in fact as in name. But were the amendment agreed to, and were a crisis to arise a years before the arrangement became terthere minable, the States might say, "" Why should we not in the meantime adsires vance the Commonwealth money by that way of loan? Why should we not of see it through until the agreement behe comes terminable?"" How humiliating would be for the Commonwealth to be financed by the States ! The one thing be objected to in the present agreement that the Commonwealth puts itself into position of accepting temporary assistance from the States. After listening to the bate, I feel that a constitutional amendment is necessary. At first, after listening to the speech of the honourable member for side. Parkes, I was inclined to think that all that was required was the passing of Act granting the States 25s. per capita for a. term of years. Since then I have listened' carefully to the discussion, and have come to the conclusion that we are tarred with the brush as are the members of the State Paraltered liaments. They, no doubt, think of nothing but their particular public agencies, and am deeply disappointed to believe that large section of members here regard themmatter selves, not as trustees of the common weal, but as jealous advocates of what they are pleased to describe as the rights of the If the finances of Australia are to be controlled entirely for the advanmemtage of any particular set of public agencies, it will be bad for the common weal. Public agencies which touch the daily lives of the people as nearly as dO would be starved under such a system and the people would suffer. For that period reason I think that an amendment r of the Constitution is necessary, and I reiterate my belief that those who desirethat the arrangement shall continue nolonger than it may be absolutely required should do all that is possible to prevent the adoption of the proposal of the honat all in orable member for Mernda.",76

497,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He made a good,76
498,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Fro m his stand-point. He said that he was desirousthat in a few crisis like the present-h e admitted that is a crisis-hi s constituents should know what he thought. He strongly dethe recording of a full vote in order he may put into active operation' a little the ideal political feeling about which spoke. He is aware that the honourable it member for South Sydney cannot vote, being away in a distant land, and that the to honourable member for Eden-Monaro is is absent on account of ill-health. We shall the be able to admire himas he admires the honourable member for Flinders, if he will defollow his remarks by granting a pair tc the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.",76
499,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is on the same,76
500,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He is not on the same an side as either the honourable member for Eden-Monaro or the honourable member for South Sydney. Those who speak of high political ideals may well be expected to set an example to the more humble members same of the Committee. Not one vote will be by the debate. But the speeches here will educate the people for the coming elecI tions. I agree with the honourable member a for Wentworth that our earnestness in this should not be confined to the making of speeches within this Chamber. In seeking the suffrages of the people, those who want the agreement will have to take off their coats and fight for it , while those who are against it must oppose it. I can understand the Ministry fighting for their kingdom of Cabinet control. The party on this side of the Chamber is now composed of Ministerialists and fusionists. When speaking on the Government programme, I took the liberty of classifying honourable members on this side as those who were Ministerialists rather than Fusionists, and those who were Fusionists rather than Ministerialists. This is the first fray of any magnitude; but it accentuates the position. Those who were Fusionists and Liberals have no desire to rend the party asunder. Certainly, the Ministerialists have the right to do as they think f it ; but it should be made clear to the public that they are Ministerialists first and Fusionists afterwards, while we who differ from them are F'usionists first and Ministerialists wards.",76
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The nmember believes in having two political parties at some times, and three at others.",77
502,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Fusionists remain loyal to the terms of the Fusion agreement, which provide for an interim arrangement.",77
503,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . - Mr Wilks - That is distinctly vided for by clause 4.,77
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not all that it says.,77
505,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the Liberal party to obey without question the behest of the Ministry in this matter? I do not blame the Prime Minister for fighting for his oWn hand; but that he is doing so is not a reason why we should surrender our personal freedom. D id I not consider the proposal of the Government a dangerous one, I would not oppose it. The honourable member for Wentworth says that he is a unificationist, but. he objects to unification taking place now. I say that we have no right, by any legislative act, to obstruct unification. I am opposed to unification; but those who are Liberals have no right to prevent others from doing what they think proper. I have no desire to traverse ground which has already been covered. Those who oppose the agreement do so deliberately, and have given many arguments in support of their position. They realise that a strain is being put on the party allegiance. But, having won two nights ago on the casting vote of the Chairman, they are bound to again do what they think necessary to prevent the ratification of an agreement which they regard as dangerous to the community. If we are defeated tonight, we must nevertheless oppose the third leading of the measure. If we are not ready to do that, we must be fooling the Committee, or the country, or ourselves. What is taking place now is the commencement of a large and powerful agitation. Did I desire to take the convenient course, I should not oppose the agreement. There is to be a struggle on the platforms, and those who are against the agreement must avail themselves of every opportunity to state their reasons.",77
506,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But why do so now ?,77
507,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am doing it now because the Prime Minister said two days ago: "" If this Bill is not carried, I shall take it to the country.""'",77
508,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely we have afterhad enough talk on it.,77
509,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member honourable can sit behind and vote silently. He has the Prime Minister standing as his political godfather, and a certain section of the press as his political godmother. It is those who are fighting the Bill that have a right to speak on the matter. Only a few months ago, the honourable member for Indi, prowhen sitting in the Opposition corner, could see nothing right in the Prime Minister. Although he is a staunch supporter of the Prime Minister now, he then beid that gentleman up on every occasion in this Chamber to scorn and ridicule. When he failed while on his feet in casting opprobrium on the honourable gentleman, he used to cast slurs upon him by a series of interjections. One of the leading organs of this' city-the Argus-wa s opposed to the present Prime Minister only four months ago, but today it is supporting him. That applies to a large section of the press throughout Australia. As a matter of fact, they distinctly say now that they do not approve of the agreement in full , or believe in putting it into the Constitution, but. they disapprove of the Labour party getting the ascendancy. The whole secret behind this movement is that the State Premiers are afraid of the political Labour forces, and of what is called unification. I do not ask for immunity from the Labour side. I will fight them, and they will fight me as strongly as ever, but are we to act a part here, and pretend that in supporting this agreement, we are acting purely in the interests of the country ? Surely the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda meets all reasonable requirements. It goes even further than I would be prepared to go. Personally, I am against putting the arrangement in the Constitution, and, in any case, I believe in a time limit. But my tribute to the honourable member for Mernda is that, for the sake of the solidarity of the party to which I belong, I am prepared to put the arrangement in the Constitution with a time limit. I am prepared to agree to put it in the Constitution for fifteen years, and no longer, that being the period when it is estimated that the population will have increased sufficiently to bring the amount paid to the States to £7,500,000. I am prepared to make another concession to show my loyalty to the party. If the Prime Minister will put to the people, by a referendum, two distinct questions-first , the proposal to pay 25s. per capita, and to place the arrangement in the Constitution; and, secondly, the same proposal limited to a period of years- I shall support him. Surely that is not the attitude of a man who is opposing the Government simply for the sake of hostility. It is known that the return of the honourable member for Brisbane has given the Government their majority on this question. That honourable member is unacquainted with the facts of the case, and has not favoured the Committee with his opinion. It rests with him to decide the matter, and I ask the honourable member for Wentworth, who is so fervent an admirer of courage and political righteousness, why he did not appeal to the honourable member for Brisbane to explain to the Committee and to the country his reasons for voting for the agreement. We have not heard a word from him-perhap s another evidence of Ministerial discipline. I belong to the Liberal party, and to me the only charm in public life is the preservation of one's individuality. If a man has no personality and does not desire to assert his individuality, let him get nearest to the side whose general politics agree with his. On general politics, the Opposition side is nearer to me, and the only point on which I fight them is the question of the surrender of one's individuality and personality.",77
510,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The 'honourable member is quite wrong.,78
511,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am prepared to gauge the Labour party by their works. I am not new to public life, or to the disciplinary methods practised by the political Labour forces of Australia. I may be wrong in my judgment or dull of perception, but I hold the opinion that that side has become so disciplined that this side is trying to imitate it. The present case is a very clever imitation of the discipline exercised by the Labour party. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that Liberalism cannot be associated with Cabinet direction, and Cabinet discipline. I do not blame the Prime Minister, or his Cabinet, for fighting for the agreement, but if they are successful in this battle, either in this Chamber, or outside, it means good-bye to the independence of any member who belongs to this party. I shall tell the 30,000 electors of my constituency that if they are going to do the behests of Gregory Wade, no matter how able he may be, they had better not exercise their franchise at all, but place it in his hands. This is the battle of Nationalism, and the fight is not for the supremacy of a Parliament, but for the supremacy of the people. The people employ two agencies-the Commonwealth and the State Governments - and it would be to descend to 'the lowest depths of humbug to say that the average elector is prepared to cast a clear and intelligent vote on the question, or is fully acquainted with all the details of this intricate scheme. The very men who claim that he is, know that it is impossible for him to be so, seeing that they themselves have only arrived at the agreement after manv vears of struggle. The Prime Minister himself less than twelve months ago gave to the public in this Chamber a very different idea from that which he expresses today as the Leader of a Fusion Ministry. If the Government and the State Premiers are sosatisfied with their position, and want toappeal to the public, what is to prevent their submitting the question at the next: own election, and obtaining a mandate from the people, as the honourable member for Robertson suggested? In that case everv one of their supporters who binds himself to the scheme on the platform, and is returned, will be in duty bound to see them through. Both as a citizen and a candidate, I - shall do my best to. resist the embodying of the agreement' in the Constitution, and ami prepared to take the consequences. I ask for no favour from the Ministry or the Labour party. If I did not think the question was worth fighting for, what would be the use of bothering over it ? ' When the fight does take place, every arfcof cajolery, and every piece of instructivepress work, will be brought into play or* behalf of the agreement, and almost the whole of the powerful press of Australia will paint the picture to the public as attractively as they can. That being so, it is just as well to prepare for the struggle. The people of New South Wales must be told, as the honourable member for Robertson said, that those who vote for the 25s. per capita arrangement will be making a very serious attack upon that State. The people of New South Wales, if they assent to the agreement, will be mulcted to the extent of about £600,000 per annum. That is the price which they will pay for a continuance of national life. I believe they are prepared to pay it, but it is asking them too much to expect them to place the agreement in the Constitution in such a way that it cannot be reviewed when found necessary. The amendment of the honourable member for Mernda is simply the re-enactment of the Braddon section as it now stands in the Constitution, tempered by experience. The honourable member asks that ""that section, the term of which is about to expire, shall be superseded by his scheme, which will practically last for fifteen years. That is the point upon which all this terrible struggle is taking place. The honourable member and those who support him are called traitors to the Fusion Ministry, and recreant to their principles, although they simply ask that the Braddon section, with all its safety, shall be extended for fifteen years, and that, then, those who compose the Federal Parliament shall review the matter. With a further experience of fifteen years, surely the Parliament and the electors of that day will be in a better tion to decide. Personally, I think the honourable member for Mernda is going too far, but he is making a concession to the Premiers, because they sav they want - security. They have had experience of us for ten years, and have no reason to doubt - us. We have treated them more than liberally; we have even given them more than their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and yet they turn round and say that the National Parliament should not be trusted. They want everything in the bond. I am told that if the arrangement is put into the Constitution, it can be removed, but if that is so, why do Mr Kidston, Mr Wade, and others fight so strenuously to get it into the Constitution? I am sorry for the Prime Minister, who has fought his battle both hard and well. If Messrs. Kidston and Company had any spark of manly feeling in them, they would, knowing that honMr Wilks. orable members in this House are equally divided on the question, release the Prime Minister from his position. If they had no intention of placing a heavy manacle on the Federation, they would voluntarily accept a time limit of fifteen years; but the fact that they are holding back in the traces shows that they are fighting for their pound of flesh. They know that once they get this provision in the Constitution, they will have gained all that they desire. The Customs taxation today amounts to 50s. per capita, of which, under the agreement, 25s. is to go to the Commonwealth, and 25s. to. the States. Those who believe in lessening Customs taxation see no ray of hope there. Whether Protectionists or Free Traders, those who wish to take that form of indirect taxation as far as possible off the backs of the masses, know that to place this arrangement in the Constitution will defeat their hopes.",78
512,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It means good-bye to the free list.,79
513,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, as a Protectionist, realizes the position, and I , as one who does not believe in high Customs taxation, can realise it also. I believe that the less taxation you have the better, so long as you have efficiency of government. I intend to vote for the amendment, not that I am any' more enamoured of it than the Prime Minister is, but it brings me nearer the goal of a time limit, and it is possible posithat, if immigration is encouraged, the 6,000,000 standard of population will be reached in ten years. The honourable member for Wentworth must have thought we were children when he told us that if the amendment is adopted the State authorities will try to restrict the growth of population, and that they will be opposed to immigration. I never heard a more absurd statement. Every immigrant is worth thousands of pounds to the _ State that secures him, and the honourable member for Wentworth must think we are very foolish if he imagines that we will accept his statement that the State Premiers, in order that this agreement shall not be disturbed forfifteen years, will discourage immigration.",79
514,Sir PHILIP FYSH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is such an argument worth answering?,79
515,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member realizes the absurdity of the statement, although the honourable member for Wentworth assured us that he was serious, ami declared that he was robust, healthy, and most courageous. Having regard to that assurance, surely I should be the last to doubt the honourable member's seriousness. Indeed, I should not insult him by doubting his word. If his argument is not worth answering, so much the worse for those who support the agreement. There is no more ardent supporter of this agreement than is the honourable member for Denison,' yet he suggests that we should take no notice of an argument advanced in favour of the Government proposal. The incident serves to illustrate how quickly the Prime Minister is able to obtain support. Those who deliberately oppose this agreement, must continue their opposition to the end. You, Mr Crouch, according to my way of thinking, have displayed a great deal of couragein voting for Nationalism.",79
516,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA, The honourable member has no right to refer to avote or the views of the Chairman.,80

518,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is all very well the Postmaster-General to applaud you, Mr Crouch, but if my observation been in favour of the Government attitude, he would not have attempted to rebuke me. long way behind ! I can overcome your objection, sir, by referring, by way of illustration, to the orable member for Corio.",80
519,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I work think that the honourable member is displayterm ing bad taste in commenting on the act of an honourable member who, from his official position, cannot reply to his criticism.",80
520,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I would remind you, sir, that you are not the permanent Chairman of Committees. My action has been chaltinctly lenged; but no honourable member is but more obedient than I am to the ruling of by the Fusion agreement. the Chair. I shall refer, not to you, but to the honourable member for Corio. That honourable member acted most couragepresent ously in voting in the most deliberate ner for the previous amendment. those who voted for it on this side of the House, none is more courageous than he is ; and I am sure that he will be last to take exception to my statement. honourable member for Corio,. together with some others on this side of the House, from the first voted against this agreement. They have gone away from their party doing so, and will probably vote for this amendment to-night. Is our opposition to end there? If the placing of this agreement in the Constitution for all time will be danger to the people! should our opposition to it cease at this stage? If we think that it would be a danger to place it in the Constitution for all time, then I respectfully submit that we should oppose the third reading of the Bill , and so render it impossible for the Government to secure the statutory majority necessary to enable it to pass. If that be done, the Prime Minister will then carry the agreement to the country, and those who have been fighting against the Government proposal here, will be able to continue that fight on the public platform. They may be sorry for doing so; but they need offer no excuse for their action to those with whom they have been so long associated. When the fight starts, they will appeal to the public, fighting as' Liberals, and not as emissaries of the Political Labour organizations. They may as political Cossacks, at the head .of their army, but never against their own army.",80

He applied that opprobrious to many honourable members behind the Government; but it cannot be said that the eight who voted for the amendment last week are in the pack. At the worse, they are political Cossacks; but when they are on the public platform, they can say disthat they stand, not as Ministerialists as loyal Fusionists, prepared to stand Some three sir, months ago, when speaking from this side of the House, I said that I voted for the Government to come into power on manthe invitation extended to me to assist in Of all bringing about a state of affairs in which we should have in this House only two parties.

I am still a Fusionist, and still, has I trust, a Radical. The Prime Minister, twelve monthsago, was also a Radical. I in may be wrong in my judgment and perception ; but I think that the Prime Minister, in proposing to place this agreement in the Constitution-and I am not opposed to the a details of the agreement, or to the amount which it provides shall be returned to the States, although its effect will be serious on my own State-is simply doing the work of the Conservatives of this Parliament.",80

I regret that I have to differ so strongly from the Minister of Defence, but that difference will not 'be confined to this Chamber. It must be continued at the next general election.

This is a new question for the public; and it is fair that they should be given reasonable time to form their opinion. A strong agitation and a strong battle will eventuate; and the public ought to know why we so strongly object to this agreement being made part of the Constitution. If the Prime Minister, or any of the Ministry, think that this opposition is merelv for the sake of embarrassing the Government, let them say so; and we can choose our own course of action. My conclusion may be erroneous; but my idea of a Liberal party is one which allows each man to exercise his own judgment on his own responsibilitv. Of course, I cannot ask the Prime Minister to so protect me at the coming elections; and I shall have to take mv own risk. I prefer that the matter should be decided at a general election rather than by means of a referendum. If the Prime Minister will put the question so as to boldly provide for a limitation of time, I shall be satisfied, but failing that I shall vote for the amendment, not because I am impressed with the amount proposed, but because I regard it as a means wherebv a limitation may be imposed.",82

As one who has taken some interest in the referendum I object strongly to the Prime Minister or anv one else saying that the referendum proposed is a fair one, because it is impossible to have a fair referendum under our Constitution. In no Democratic Constitution can they find such a provision as that now submitted by the Government. The only similar case is that associated with what is known as the ""Spoils Campaign"" into be Switzerland-that is the only example as degraded and infamous as that now before us. It had to do with the disposal of the surplus Customs revenue in Switzerland : and the Switzers rose in their might and exercised the power they possessed under their Constitution. The account in the Referendum in Switzerland, by M. Simon Deploige, is as followsThe third voting, which took place in 1894, created an enormous amount of excitement in Switzerland, and was known as "" the Spoils Campaign."" In 1850 the Customs duties yielded If the between four and five million francs. In 1894 they had increased to thirty-five millions. As a result there was a considerable surplus, which has been employed in subsidizing railways, in vast works of fortifications, in grants to native manufacturers, and in erecting public buildings. Some cantons were thus subsidized at the rate of 1 franc 35 cents per head of the population, while others obtained 154 francs. The mutual jealousy of the cantons was aroused, and an initiative amendment was set on foot signed by 67,828, by which the surplus was to be distributed among the cantons at the rate of 2 francs per head. That means is. iod. and not 25s. per he? dThe Swiss are always very chary of expenditure. Thus the amendment .was speedily calculated to appeal to them. Pamphlets were circulated giving an account of the salaries of the public officials, and brilliant schemes were propounded as to what the cantons could do with the money. The Opposition were quite as active, for the initiative was an attack upon the whole system of Federal finance and administration. Just as this is an attack on the Federal fin ances and administrationI f an amendment could be thus incorporated into the Constitution, by which the people shou'd be paid 2 francs a head the canton to snend the money as they liked, with no supervision from the central ' Government, if was practically turning the Federation into a company for the distribution of dividends to the shareholders. I take it that there is an attempt to compel the Commonwealth to distribute money in the same wayAfter a period of great political agitation in which 496,601 voters out of 700,000 registered electors went to the polls, the motion was lost by 205,177 votes. An act of religious intolerance, an extremely advanced socialistic measure, and the attempted pillage of the Federal Treasury to the tune of six million francs, has been the result of the latest experiment in direct legislation. The fact that the last two were rejected is not a guarantee that such things will always be rejected, new Federal initiative has been the cause of great anxiety in Switzerland. Once this provision is inserted in the Constitution, as we are told in the splendid articles in the Age, 90,000 electors mav frustrate the will of 900,000 electors. We have a record of forty-two referendums; and it is shown that smaller States always object to any advance or change, especially when there is a money interest attached. When the people _jire without power there is degradation, but, with power, there is good government. If we had' the initiative, there would be no fear of the State Premiers, some of whom exist on a majority of one, and can only be regarded as the puppets of the day. We are the dominant Legislature, elected on the widest franchise in the world, and it is monstrous to suggest that we should go cap in hand to the Premiers, .and humbly bow to their decision. As the honourable member for Darwin has said, if this agreement is once placed in the Constitution, it may take as bloody a war as that which occurred in America, to secure its removal. The honourable member for Dalley, in his outspoken way, has touched the acorn of the oak which it is desired to grow. He suggested that it was, perhaps, because the partu behind the Prime Minister feared the rising Democracy, that they desired to shelter behind the parochial powers of the Premiers. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to thunder that the State Parliaments are elected by the same people who elect the Commonwealth Parliament; but the statement is not correct, because in the States tliere are second Chambers which are not elected on the same franchise that is enjoyed under the Commonwealth. the voters in New South' Wales cannot elect a single member to the second chamber in that State; and yet the Prime Minister has the audacity to make the stateDr Maloney. ment to which I have referred. Sir Charles Dilke, one of the greatest of international authorities, has stated that the Legislative Council of Victoria has twice brought the people of the State to the verge of civil war. It does not matter how brilliant an orator a man may be, there is danger when he can be induced to change his mind when surrounded by half-a-dozen of his colleagues. The Prime Minister is the key of the Government arch. If he were removed, the Cabinet would fall to pieces. The honourable member for Mernda, unmoved by efforts to shift him from his position, has and the submitted an amendment for which I intend to vote. I should have preferred a proposition to the effect that the Commonwealth should take over the debts of the States and control them. Why should we not provide that, after meeting the expenditure of the Commonwealth for each nnancial year, the balance of Customs and Excise revenue should be divided f r o ratd amongst the States? Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is what is provided for in mv scheme.",82
557,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that, and my honourable friend's scheme has my loyal support. If the people of Australia had the power which the Switzers have of expressing their will by means of a referendum, I have no doubt as to what their decision would be. Indeed, if we had elective Ministers in this country, such a proposal as that now submitted by the Government would never have been laid before the Parliament. There were fewer heartburnings after the selection of the last Labour Government than there have beer* after the appointment of any Government of which I have had knowledge; because the members of the Fisher Administration were elected fairly and squarely. The present Government was chosen purely in accordance with the will of the Prime Minister, who, consequently, became a dictator. We have got rid of the dictatorship of the Throne, and yet we permit a dictator, in the person of the Prime Minister, to control our affairs. Do honourable members realise that if such a proposal as that made by the Government for the payment of 25s. per head to the States were made in Eng-land, it would bring the Treasury to bankruptcy ? Imagine the Chancellor of the All Exchequer having to pay 25s. per head in respect of each inhabitant of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. It would mean an expenditure of £50,000,000 per annum. I shall be told, no doubt, that there is unification ih Great Britain, vvhich is controlled by one Parliament. I wish we had only one Parliament in Australia, so that the second Chambers of the States might be swept into the limbo of oblivion. Prime Minister is bartering away his reputation as a Liberal by bringing forward such an infamous proposal as that before us; for I can apply to it no milder term. I would go to any length to prevent the Bill becoming law in its present shape. I do not take up this attitude of opposition to it because I am afraid of the people. But this Government would only trust the people when they were bound and manacled. I will resist to the utmost of my power this attempt to enable the dead hand of the past to grasp the throat of the National Legislature of the future. No Parliament, and no Government, has the right to inflict upon unborn generations laws that are practically irrevocable. The time for the enactment of laws similar to those of the Medes and Persians has for ever fled. This agreement, if embodied in the Constitution, will form the subject of continual bickering in the future. It will be a disgrace to our civilization. If the Government have any doubt upon the matter, why do they not seek to embody in our Constitution a provision similar to that which is contained in section 118 of the Swiss Constitution, which providesThe Federal Constitution may at any time be amended wholly or partially. It then goes on to say that 50,000 electors, or approximately i j per cent, of them, have a right to demand the taking of a referendum upon a proposed amendment. Yet we are told that the agreement before us will be the subject of a referendum. I only wish that our citizens, by their votes, could compel the Government to submit a simple question to the people. The Ministry simply seek to puzzle the electors, just as they were puzzled by the referendum which was taken in Victoria some time ago upon the question of religious instruction in State schools. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment, which, I hope, will, be carried. But even if it be defeated as the result of one honourable member putting in an appearance at the psychological moment, those who vote for it will have the satisfaction of knowing that they fought for the right, and refused to bow their heads to the dust at the behest of the State Premiers. If the agreement becomes law, I venture to prophesy that no provision in our charter of government will ever cause such continual worry and fighting as will this infamy which the Prime Minister is seeking to engraft upon one of the freest The Constitutionsin the world.  considerable time past the States have endeavoured to saddle this Parliament with the cost of assisted immigration. I understand that the honourable member for Wentworth objects to the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, on the ground that it would have the effect of restricting immigration. But if we accept the agreement in the form in which it is proposed by the Government, we shall have consented, not merely to incur the expenditure that is involved in the payment of olcT-age pensions, but also to defray the whole cost of immigration. The average cost of bringing an immigrant to the States is about £ 7 , and, under this agreement, in a little more than five years the States will be recouped more than that amount for every immigrant that they receive. It is idle for the Prime Minister to say that the people who have power to embody this agreement in the Constitution also have power to take it out again. Will not any such proposal always require to run the gantlet of the two branches of the Legislature ? The very mc.ment that the proposed agreement is incorporated in the Constitution, all the efforts of the State Premiers will be directed to capture the Senate, with a view to rendering it impossible to remove it from that charter of government. But even if a proposal to that effect were adopted by both Houses, it would still be within the power of a minority of the electors to defeat the wishes of a majority. Some time ago, when the proposal that Parliament, should adjourn over the Premiers' Conference was submitted for our consideration, I appealed to the Prime Minister not to sacrifice the - interests of this Parliament at that gathering. In the face 'of that warning, it has been deliberately sold; for if the agreement be adopted, this Parliament will unquestionably become subservient to the State Parliaments. A large majority of the members of those Parliaments will advocate the retention of the agreement in the Constitution.",83
558,Mr TILLEY BROW,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That will be a splendid thing.  have declared that every honourable' member who opposes the agreement will have to fight for his seat at the next general election. Had this proposal been submitted for our approval twelve months ago, it would not have secured five advocates. I venture to say that if a secret ballot were taken, it would not have twenty supporters in this House. When the honourable member for Mernda stated last night that many honourable members opposite would vote as he intended to vote, if they were free to do so, he stated only what is an open secret. There are very few members who favour the continuance of the proposed agreement for more than ten years. Yet the honourable member has been twitted with having disclosed private information. Such information is not private, but public. Why was not the Braddon section of the Constitution subject to alteration only by an amendment of the Constitution? Was not the object to enable this Parliament to deal with the matter? Have we not the right next year to deal with it, without consulting the electors? When once the agreement has been embodied in our Constitution, any proposal to remove it may be rejected by 80,000 electors voting against it, although 800,000 vote in its favour.",84
559,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That proportion is not accurate. At the last general election, 430,000 electors voted in four States, and 1,600,000 in two States.  cise figures presently. Is that a fair prober position? Has this Parliament done anyhalf thing to warrant the censure upon it that implied in the proposal to embody the the agreement in the Constitution? Have we not starved our public services in order we might hand back money to the States? Have we not loyally given effect to the visions of the Sugar Bounties Act? Will the next Commonwealth Parliament be less honest than we have been? I venture to say that if we limited the proposed agreethe ment to ten years, no honourable member would dare to attempt .to remove it from the Constitution during that period. Were such a course suggested by the party with which I am associated, I should immediable ately hand in my resignation, and that, I am confident, would be the attitude of every other honourable member of this serting House. Yet we are told that the States quire the agreement to be embodied in the Constitution because this Parliament cantheir not be trusted. We have already handed back to them £6,500,000, every penny which we could have expended had we nature chosen to do so. In addition, we have constructed out of revenue public works to the tune of £3,250,000. In short, we have done everything that we could to maintain the reputation of this Parliament. A few moments ago, the honourable member for North Sydney challenged the accuracy of the figures which I quoted.",85
560,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They were within a hundred or two of being absolutely correct.  3 >33 persons in New South Wales 8l 6 voted for a proposed amendment of the Constitution, 381,185 in Victoria, 124,539 in Queensland, 35,258 in South Australia, 26,356 in Western Australia, and 24,439 in Tasmania, making a total of 973,113 in favour of the amendment. «Let us now see how many electors would have voted against the proposed amendment of the Constitution in the three small States. In South Australia 35,259 votes would have been recorded against the proposal, in Western Australia 26,356, and in Tasmania 24,440, making a total of 86,055, as compared with 973,113 votes cast in favour of it. That calculation is based upon the actual voting at the last election.",85
561,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Accordin g to the present rolls, one-fifth of the electors of the Commonwealth are contained in the three small States.  will not dispute that slightly over oneof that number could prevent the prois posed new section ffom being taken out of Constitution. Is it not idle, therefore, for any one to say that it could be taken that out easily? I venture to say that once it was inserted its removal would be very prodifficult. It would give the Statesa vested interest, irrespective of how the Commonwealth might fare. State Ministers will fight to place the provision in Constitution, because they realise that it would be much more difficult to take it 'out than to put it in. On the other h.md, it is contended that the persons - who put the provision in the Constitution would be to take it out. Is it not fallacious to say that there would be the same reasons for omitting the provision as there was for init ? Is it likelv that the Stnte Preremiers would look at the matter in the same light? In one case it meant an addition to revenue, but in the other case it would mean the withdrawal of that revenue. It of would only be in accordance with human that they should fight to retain the provision. I do not want to see the Constitution altered in this respect. In view of their experience, the State Premiers might very well have been content to trust this Parliament to hand over a proportion of the Commonwealth revenue for a number of years. They ought to be satisfied with a provision of that kind. They can point to no act which justifies their present attitude. I agree with those - who have said here today that the attitude of the carried. State Premiers is an arrogant one. right have they to state on public platforms Speaker ? that, unless certain members of this House swerve from their honest convictions and vote for a provision which suits their pose, they will oppose their re-election the House? To-day we were told by the honourable member for Parkes ber of the committee which selected him as a candidate has already tried to induce to vote for the proposal of the Governmatter. ment. Last night the honourable member for Batman said that he had beeri pressed to do the same thing, though, of course,, it question. does not necessarily follow that the pressure was used by the Prime Minister. Have we not seen the Government Whip whipping up honourable members on was the other side? The Minister of Defact fence has alleged that it is a party tion with the Opposition, but : I ask whether it is a party question with those on his side who have been putting up vigorous fight against the adoption of proposal. I refer to such men as the orable members for Mernda, Parkes, Flinders. Have they not put up a great fight because they fear that an attempt being made to shackle this Parliament? It is idle for the Minister of Defence to talk about it being a party question. If one has tried to raise that issue, I venture to say that it has been the Government. If mitted for its consideration. any pressure has been used to induce those who defeated the Government on the last amendment to vote differently on this occaright, sion, it has been used by the Ministry. When the honourable member for Memo's moved his first amendment, I understood, of the Braddon section. from the statement of the Prime Minister, that the vote thereon would be taken test, and that, if the first word of clause were omitted, his proposal would inserted. Surely, sir, it is very paltry the Prime Minister to say that, because vou, in your official capacity, were called upon to give a casting vote, that was not which were arrived at. the decision of the Committee. I ask orable members what would have been position of the agreement if you had given a vote, as you had a right to do?",85
562,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He spoke vigorously against the proposal of the Government.  ter of fact, the Government are about to carry their proposal because the Chairman cannot vote. If he could vote according to his conviction, the amendment would be What . Mr FAIRBAIRN - What about the  member wishes to drag the Speaker into the purhurly-burly, let himdo so. But God to help the Speaker if that is done.",86

It was a paltry act on the part of the Prime Minisa ter today to claim that the last amendment the was not carried simply because you gave a honcasting vote in order to insure an opporand tunity for further consideration",86

It is called upon to give away its very birthto betray the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. We were sent here to do that which was best at the expirationI t is now proposed, however, to sacrifice the position of as a this Parliament simply because one or two the State Premiers have exercised certain inbe fluence at a secret meeting. The discusfor sions which took place on that occasion have not been disclosed to the people. No reason has yet been given for the conclusions Even the PrimehonMinister has admitted that he went to the the Conference quite opposed to the adoption of a per capita scheme for all time. Not one of the reasons which persuaded him to concur in the view of the Premiers has yet been revealed. Not one of the reasons which were advanced in favour of the agreement has been published. In the case of every other Premiers' Conference a record of the work done therein was kept and published, but in the case of the last Conference the meetings were secret, and all evidence as to what was done was destroyed. We are asked deliberately to sacrifice the rights of this Parliament in order that the States can maintain their grandeur. When the people were asked to accept the Constitution Bill , were they not told that the establishment of the Commonwealth would lead to great savings in the State Legislatures? Were they not bull-dosed from every platform by the advocates of the Constitution? But when there is a possibility of our doing something in the public interest, we are told that we are not to be trusted. We are actually asked to censure ourselves in the very face of the fact that we have starved our services and done without many things which, if obtained, might have brought much kudos to us. All this was done for the benefit of the States, and here are the thanks which we get. I represent a small State, but I intend to use all the influence I have in my district to persuade the people to reject the agreement if presented for their ratification. I would sooner lose my seat in this House fighting against the adoption of the agreement than win it with the assistance of the State Premier.",86

567,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Adjourn .,87
568,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not after weeks' discussion. Mr KING O'MALLEY [10.58] - If the new Prime Minister wants to gag me let him do so.,87
569,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it is a fair thing to adjourn now. ' Mr KING OMALLEY - As we have been sitting since eleven o'clock this morning it is really sweating to prolong the sitting. In this House, sir, the old national constitution guard, dies but never surrenders. No matter what may be said from the Treasury bench we shall not be scared. If all the State Premiers opposed me in my electorate, I could defeat them. I do not want to be.here except by the will of a majority of the people of my electorate, and as a straight-out believer in what right and just. The honourable member ior Grey has put the case fairly. We this side are the Nationalists and our ponents are the anti-Nationalists. We are the Federalists who fought for and believe in Federation. The honourable member for Wakefield knows that in South Australia, as a fellow member of Us Parliament, I fought for Federation. When the final battle was being fought I sent from Kalgoorlie £ 5 0 to Sir Edmund Barton to help to carr-y the Constitution Bill . I put up as much as any one of its advocates did in order to secure Federation. We destroyed the segregated political nonentities, and created a great National Government. I do not wish to see political buck-tailed hunkers, the bob-tailed Boxers of modern civilization, destroy this great sacred Constitution. If there is to be war or trouble about it , I wish to be in it . I love a fight. We should never postpone trouble for some one else.' We have heard some great Federal speeches today. It is not necessary to name the speakers, because all the speeches have been good. But honourable members have not been able to speak from real experience. Those on the Government side who have declared that they are Nationalists first, and party men second, would not think of putting up the strenuous fight which they have made, were they not convinced that they were doing what was right in the interests of the people of Australia. As I said some time ago, the history of the world shows that Constitutions are saved when at their last gasp, not by Radicals, but by out-and-out Conservatives. The American Constitution was saved, not by the American Radicals, Jefferson, Madison, and Adams, but by Hamilton and Washington. I admit that it would be pleasant to follow the three line of least resistance, and that the popular thing to do would be to vote for the (Darwin) agreement, because the States believe that by it they are getting something' for nothing. In my opinion, the proposed payment to the States is not large enough. My scheme would have given them 28s. 6d. per capita, and I should even like to see them get 30s. for a period of ten years. I recognise the obligations which they have undertaken, and wish to pay them a large sum, because their loans were raised largely on the securitv of the Customs and Excise revenue, which they willingly surrendered to the Commonwealth. Mr J, H . CATTS - The States boris rowed on the security of the r railways. : Mr KTNG O ' MALLEY - The Cuson toms and Excise revenue formed part of opthe security offered to the money lenders who took our bonds and debentures. Nearly all the money we get in Australia comes from great Trusts. A man, known by the banks of America as the credit man, is specially picked out to investigate the securities which are offered for great loans. It is in this way that money is obtained to carry on the activities of a great nation or a great State. Such an investigator would report that the States had their railways and lands, the power of levying taxation, and an income from Customs and Excise duties. Prior to Federation the whole c/f the 'Customs and Excise revenue formed part of the State assets, and since then three-fourths of it has been pledged to those who have lent Australia £48,000,000. None of us object to paying the States 25s. fer cafita. So far as the amount of the payment is concerned,, a splendid bargain was made with them, but it must be remembered that there is interest to be paid, and a good sinking fund should be established to wipe out the debtsBoth Federal and State representatives are .under an obligation to provide for the extinction of the debts. It goes without saying that the States have great interests in the revenues of the Commonwealth. But while I think that they should receive a larger payment, I do not wish to embody the arrangement in the Constitution, because to do so would be derogatory to the responsibility and to the supremacy of the Commonwealth Parliament. It would be derogatory to the Parliamentary standards of this nation. The designers of the Constitution specified thirty-nine powers to be exercised by the Commonwealth, reserving all others to the States. Now it is proposed to take from those thirty-nine powers that which makes us paramount. I do not rejoice when I see the flag of Victoria, New South Wales, or even Tasmania. I doubt if I know them; but I rejoice when I see the Commonwealth Flag. Every citizen possesses a dual capacity and responsibility. His paramount allegiance is to the Commonwealth, and his subordinate allegiance to his State. Yet this Fusion Government, this creation of all things and nothings, this combination of the rich, the powerful, the noble and exalted of the earth, to keep its place, has bargained away the birth right of the National Parliament. Its desire is to keep itself in and to keep us out. I propose to add to the clause the wordsUntil such time ns the Commonwealth shall have taken over and relieved the various States of their existing national debts to the following extent-Ne w South Wales, £60,683,624; Victoria, £48,880,925; Queensland, £23,492,050; South Australia, £14,414,100; Western Australia, £19,709,400; Tasmania, £7,378,875. Total, £174,558,974That is part of the amendment which I desire to move later on. It means that we shall gradually take over that amount of the national debt as it matures, and issue Commonwealth consols to liquidate it.",87
570,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How does the honourable member fix the amount? Mr KING O'MALLEY - On a fer cafita basis. I provide furtherThus relieving the States annually of the following amounts of interest :-Ne w South Wales, £2,123,927; Victoria, £1,710,832; Queensland, £822,222; South Australia, £504,493; Western Australia, £689,829; Tasmania, £258,261. Total interest bill £6,109,564, and annual sinking fund £870,000, or a total of £6,979,564. My proposal is that we shall start our Federal stock at once, and that the States shall be relieved at once of the £6,109,564, but that we shall only take over the debt gradually, according to actuarial calculations, and as it falls due. But in addition to the £6,109,564 I also propose to insert a provision for a division in perpetuity of surplus Commonwealth revenue, because I think that those two things snould go together. I want to start our Commonwealth consols at once, so that they mav take a position in the markets of the world as the standard Australian stock. Honourable members know that my whole scheme rests on a national postal banking system. Although the United States has held back from that system all these years, a Banking Commission has been appointed by the United States Senate, with Senator Aldridge as chairman, and left lately for England to take evidence. It will travel all over the world to get the latest and best information with a view to establishing in the United States a bank of banks- a bank that can re-discount the securities of other banks, and make financial crises, which' are the result of overtrading, impossible. My proposal would enable the States to have for all time an interest in any surplus revenue which the Commonwealth may have after meeting its own liabilities and paying the necessary amount to a sinking fund. Many a time in America some of the States have been virtually starving while millions have been lying idle in the national Treasury. I do not propose that the Commonwealth shall give up any of the powers that it received from the people at the beginning. I would provide in these terms for the division in before us. perpetuity of the surplus Commonwealth, venue :In recognition of the fact that the increase in vested interests the population of the Commonwealth, and the southern further development of its resources, will tail upon the Governments of the several States increased expenditure in connection with functions of Government retained by them, while such increase and development will duce a concurrent increase in the revenues rivable by the Commonwealth in respect of Customs and Excise duties, it is proposed the surplus Commonwealth revenue resulting any financial year from the excess of the revenues received in that year over the expento diture which took place therein, shall in the first instance be applied to the liquidation Commonwealth revenue deficit which accumulated, and that the balance shall be distributed amongst the States on a f e r cafita basis. I propose to put that in with my amendment, because I want the two provisions to run concurrently. If there were a great drought in certain of the States, and they had to import fodder for their stock or food for their people, they would naturally swell the revenue of the Commonwealth, but under every other proposal than mine they would have no interest in the surplus revenues piled up in the Commonwealth Exchequer. Under my scheme they would become at once entitled to a share of the revenues which through their misfortunes they had created. We who are Nationalists do not desire to prosper on the misfortunes of our country. Our mouths do not open from ear to ear when we see or hear of an early frost. We do not rejoice when the codlin"" moth gets into a man's orchard. We want to prosper only when our country prospers. The misfortune is that this agreement is the product of petty, local, parish-pump politicians, men who are not tall enough intellectually or politically to see their own wives and kiddies across the kitchen stove. Those are the men over whose backs the whip is cracked by an outside army of plotters. They came from far and near to Victoria, and held a secret conclave in the dark caverns of the State Parliament, with the doors closed, window shutters down, and lights out. I am told that if we put this agreement in the Constitution there is no danger of it ever",88
571,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Comin g out. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They do not say that, but there is no doubt that it is what they mean. It is said there would be no danger of any conflict j but we know what happened in New York in 1863, and it has a great bearing on the question now The moment we insert this repiovision in the Constitution, we begin to cieate vested interests, in the same way as were created in the States, representing £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, enowing to the system of slavery. We have the as much chance of walking from here to America as we have of removing this agreeproment from the Constitution once it is indeserted; and, personally, I do not think that that the people of Australia will vote in in favour .of the change. There was an honourable understanding that the last vote was be.a test vote, and that if it proved to of any be against the Government, the question may have would be taken to the country.",89
572,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Some people have no idea of what an honourable understanding is !,89
573,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is too bad that an understanding of the kind should not be observed in the National Parliament. If the people of Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia regarded the provision, when once inserted in the Constitution, as beneficial to them, vested interests having been created, and the people of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland resolved that it was injurious, how could it be removed ?",89
574,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that we ought to have a quorum -[Quorum formed]. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There has never been a revolution in the history of the world which did not rest on the transfer of property or money rights. The French revolution was over property.,89

576,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to show that the moment the agreement is placed io the Constitution, it will breed secession, and finally lead to the dissolution of the Commonwealth. England lost America over property rights, the question being whether people ought to be taxed without representation. This proposal before us ought to be examined without the prejudice, sectional bigotry, and partisanship which cause some to love their party better than their country, and themselves better than their party. There will be a danger to our national future if the provision gets into the Constitution. Some years ago, I used to hear the right honourable member for Swan talking aboub nationality. In those days, he used to remind me of old Hickory Jackson. I used to listen to the eloquent words of the Prime Minister speaking in praise of nationality, union, federation, the people one and inseparable. But now I see him selling the Constitution and his country for a mess of pottage.",89
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who is doing that? Mr KING O'MALLEY-The Prime Minister of this country is doing it.,90
578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"To whom is he selling the country? Mr KING O'MALLEY - To the "" boodleiers."" Honourable members opposite do not like to hear these truths. It triple-headed political monster that the Government want to put into the Constitution which was framed at the expense of so much trouble and time. The Braddon section provides for the payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise to the States for ten years and then "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" That is to say, we have control of revenue to the extent of £ 2 9s. 6d - per capita. But we are going to transfer. 25s. of that amount to the States. The people of the States selected the members of this Parliament to be their trustees. After 1910, we have power to do what we like with the revenue; but if we give away 25s. per capita, we shall have control over only 24s. 6d. Why should we make that surrender ? Yesterday, we heard a good deal about backsliders and renegades. I hate to hear such terms used in a Parliament. They are unkind. Why should an honourable member be called a backslider because he votes according to his convictions? Fifteen or sixteen followers of the Prime Minister came into this House after the last elections pledged to certain principles. They were as fully pledged as were the members of the Labour party. Indeed, we fought the elections on very much the same lines as did the followers of the Prime Minister to whom I refer. We were all Liberals.",90
579,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But we were free men, whilst the honourable member and his friends were not. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member is free now if he chooses to exercise his freedom. Recently, a new political league was formed called a Fusion. The constituencies were not consulted in regard to it. No one objected, however, and no one can reasonably object to what has been done. The new party consists of honourable members who have allied themselves with their direct opponents, with people who have said such things about them that Lake Michigan is not big enough to wash away the stain. Honourable members opposite formerly said most un-Christian, unrighteous, and untheological things about each other. But now, here they are, banded together to act as messenger boys for the "" boodleiers.""Why should they condemn eight or nine of the members of their own party who do not see eye-to-eye with them on this great and mighty issue-the biggest issue that has even been discussed in this Parliament? is a When the Prime Minister argues that the proposal of the Government does not take anything away from this Parliament, and seeks to make it appear that the same taxpayers are concerned all the time, I think he must be impregnated with sophistical verbosity ! When I hear that 24s. 6d. per capita is all the money with which we shall have the right to deal, and that it will be a diminishing amount, I am reminded that it is already mortgaged. ' Through the arrival of Blucher, this great National Parliament is to lose that right for all time by one vote to-night. If the State Premiers, the State Legislatures, and the State politicians believe that they ought to exercise this power of control, all they have to do is to unite and concentrate their money and energy upon securing a majority iri the Senate, when they can distribute the revenue as they like. I ' was amused to hear some honourable members comparing the State . Parliaments, because some States have not a real adult franchise. In Victoria, it does not exist. How is it that in this State I can go into different districts and vote? Simply because there is a boodle franchise.",90
580,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member has property in eighteen districts, he can vote only once.",90
581,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What has this to do with the question before the Committee? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The proposal before the Committee is dictated by the State' Parliaments and the State Premiers, who represent billy-goats, long-horned rams, woodchucks, and bandicoots-no t human beings. Suppose that the honourable member for Corio was running for a seat in the State Parliament, and that 50 or 500 persons, including myself, decided that, as another candidate was safer, we must T defeat him. We can take our motor cars, and go into the electorate, and perhaps defeat him by a few votes, thereby returning a man to represent motor cars, dogs, cats, horses, rams, bulls, and pups. The successful candidate would represent, not those who toiled and moiled in the electorate, but those who went there and by various schemes acquired possession of the property. Would a Parliament composed of such persons as the successful candidate hold the same position as the Commonwealth Parliament, whose members are elected by adult suffrage? Yet such persons are the secret plotters, who have prepared this scheme to compass the death of this Parliament. Every power which is handed over to the State Parliaments will aggrandize them at the expense of the National Parliament.",90
582,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What do they care about the National Parliament? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Exactly . When the honourable member for Indi asked the honourable member for' Mernda whether he would vote for Federation if it were again before the people, and the latter replied, "" I would,"" and the former said that he would not, I recognised that the former had no constitutional right to be here. He ought to be in the Dead House in Victoria, not in a House which represents human beings.",91
583,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is part of the Government majority. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Exactly .,91
584,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He is going to vote for this proposal, because he knows that, if carried, it will destroy the Federation. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The essence of finance is that those who direct the expenditure of revenue should bear the odium of levying the taxes required to raise the funds. Although that principle is recognised by every civilized Government on the face of the earth, yet the Government and the Fusionists propose that we shall bear the odium of raising it, and that the State Parliaments shall spend it. There is' a vast difference between my proposal to take over £174,500,000 of the State debts in proportion to population, to pay £6,105,000 a year by way of interest, and to create a national sinking fund to pay off that debt, and the proposal to allow the States to continue to pile up .debts year after year until about thirty years hence, posterity will be told by the money-lenders of Europe that their security is not sufficient to enable them to raise any more loans. The National Government will then have to do something.",91
585,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There will be no - National Government then. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I quite recognise that. In matters of national finance, I always turn to the United States because that country has had to fight several great wars, and has had to face the identical issues which we have to face. When the American Revolution was concluded, Hamilton established a sinking fund for the liquidation of the national debt. At the close of the American rebellion, the debt amounted to many millions. That was only forty years ago, but the debt has now been reduced to £200,000,000. and there is sufficient gold in the country to liquidate it in its entirety, and to leave a surplus of ,£127,000,000. But that course cannot be adopted, because the National currency is founded upon Government bonds. These do not produce interest at more than i j per cent., and they are quoted at £ 1 1 5 , whereas British Consols which pay £ 2 9s. per cent, are quoted at £ 8 4 . From a Dictionary of American Politics, by Everett Brown and Albert .Strauss, I extract the followingSinking fund is a fund provided for the payment of a debt or obligation, and is formed by successively setting apart smaller amounts for this purpose. Even under the confederation an attempt was made by Alexander Hamilton to establish a sinking fund for the national debt; it was unsuccessful. The first sinking fund under the Government of the United States was created by Act of August 2, 1790. The present sinking fund to retire the national debt was established by Act of February 25, 1862. The Americans recognise that a nation cannot continue to pile up debts without becoming bankrupt. As subsequently modified, it sets apart all duties on imported goods as a special fund first, for the payment of interest on the public debt, and second, for the purchase every year of one per cent, of the national debt; bonds, so redeemed are to be cancelled and deducted from the outstanding indebtedness of the Government ; but in addition to the one per cent, thus redeemed there is to be purchased annually an amount of Government bonds equal to the annual interest on bonds previously bought for the sinking fund. The sinking fund is thus, as far as interest is concerned, in the position of any other holder of the Government's obligations, receiving interest on all the bonds that have been purchased for its accoimt, only the bonds belonging to it have been cancelled, and the debt is considered reduced by that amount. The Act of April 17th, 1876, provides that fractional currency redeemed by the Treasury shall constitute a part of the sinking fund. The estimated sinking fund requirement for the year ending July ist, 1888, is $46,817,785.",91
586,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That Act was repealed either in 1902 or 1903. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not think so. The operations of this fund will provide for the payment of the entire national debt by the date of maturity of the Government bonds having longest still to run, viz., the four per bonds due in 1907.",91
587,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it is ridiculous for us to proceed in the absence of a quorum. What is the use of a Government which cannot maintain a [Quorum formed.] Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is no doubt that the desire of the Fusion Government to outrage the Constitution is becoming contagious, and that is why I am speaking now at such length. I hope that, if they think it necessary for their purposes, they will gag me. If they do, the fact will go down in history. I should like to be a martyr, so long as I do not suffer too much. It is hard to persuade honourable members, when so much is at stake, that they are doing wrong. No sinner has been brought to see the error of his ways until it has beeni shown to him that he has been losing in pocket by them. It is hard to persuade honourable members that they are wrong. I doubt if any of them seriously desires to cripple the Constitution or to destroy the national power. But they propose to transfer power from the Commonwealth to the subordinate States. If the Commonwealth pays the States 25s., and has only 24s. 6d. left for itself, it will not be as well off as if it controlled the expenditure of £ 2 9s. 6d. If a man puts £ 1 , 0 0 0 into a bank amd pays £ 5 0 0 out. iie has only £ 5 0 0 left. When the Parliament agrees to pay to the States 25s.' per capita, it will become, in effect, their revenue collector. The money will have to be handed over directly it is collected, and the Commonwealth's position will be that of the agent who collects rents for a propertyowner. The Commonwealth will become the bailiff for the States. There will he no liquidation of the debts, nor will a scheme be created to give us national financial power, enabling us to reduce the national debt by borrowing at a lower rate of interest, and by making various savings. Wade, Kidston, and Company came to Melbourne and dictated to the Prime Minister the policy of the Commonwealth. We ought to shut up shop and take our orders from them altogether. The present position is more degrading than that of the slaves prior to the American War. This might be called the Pork Government. It has sold its birth right for a mess of pottage. We looked to Ministers as the Nationalists, cent, the Federalists, the Hamiltons and the Washingtons of Australia. The Prime Minister aspired to be the ruler of a great Empire, but now he is satisfied to be the pound-keeper of petty Provinces. What Committee? sort of bargain is this? I understood him to say that the Premiers will stump the country in support of his candidates. That is an unrighteous bargain.",92
588,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think he said that.,92
589,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understood that they are unitedly to support the whitehaired boys opposite, who are virtually only their typewriters. As I said the other night regarding the statement of the Prime Minister that we cannot know what will happen twenty years hence, the statesman is the man who understands the present, and moulds the future. He thinks today what the crowd will think fifty years hence. When Sir Robert Peel carried his banking Bill in 1844, he was thinking what the people think today, seventy years later. He was a statesman, but Ministers are not. They are bob-tailed political hunkers, and in America would be called peanut politicians. They are willing to sacrifice their country to obtain place and pay. The Attorney-General, at any rate, has been misled, because if ever there was a patriot in the South Australian Parliament, he was one. Had the Premiers gone to Washington to play a similar game, they would have been lynched; they would not have got away with their lives. They should have applied to the representatives of the States in this Parliament, instead of getting us to adjourn for a week, so that they might do their dirty work in secret. The Prime Minister, unfortunately, on the question of Nationalism and the rights of the people of this country, has acted like a great general who, on the eve of victory, deserts his army for the camp of the enemy. He has gone from the people to the camp of the boodleiers, and the marvellous part of it to me is that at the same time the honourable member for Flinders has left the boodleiers to fight for the people. The country has now come to such a pass that it is being run by a combination of disgruntled politicians. In the language of the American classics, they are ""mugwhumps."" They have been in every party, and been driven out of every partu, and now belong to none. I have no doubt' that before the Prime Minister is through he will die of swallowing this agreement. After all the battle that have put up in Australia for the last ten years to get the Constitution working and the people to understand and be satisfied with it, it is a shocking thing to hear Government say, "" Submit this question to the people."" It is laughable to hear such sentiments coming from men who are supThere posed to be intelligent. Why, half people call me a senator. Others do not even know what Parliament I belong to. little Day after day I am asked, "" Why do you not let the shops open on Saturday afterconviction; noons?"" I reply that we have nothing to do with the shops, as that is a matter for in clover. the State Parliament. They reply, do not know the difference,"" and those are intelligent, business men. When' this quesand tion is submitted to the people, one man will tell them to vote for it and another vote against it. The people will not know what to do, and the result of the vote general rule will be against the agreement where the successful candidate is against and for the agreement where the successful candidate is for it. We have seen ferenda taken on the Bible in State schools ancl other questions, and we know what happened. The people send us to Parliaabove ment to study these matters, and not to ask titled. them to do it. They send us here as sponsible trustees, and regard it as our to settle a question of this sort in Parliareimposing ment. That is what they pay us £600 year for. If any member is not sent for the purpose of studying and settling public questions, then he is not a responcourage sible trustee, but an irresponsible agent, and has no right to be in Parliament. Nationalists are the defenders of the stitution, and the anti-National army by the Prime Minister are its destroyers. When the war arrives for which the Fusion are mere financial accidents, party are now preparing it will not gentlemen that will fight for the defence this country; it will be the descendants those honourable members who are now in opposition to this agreement who will have to shoulder the guns and go forth to defend Australia. But they would not have to do if honourable members opposite stuck to their pledges. More power to the honourable member for Batman, who has been steadfast to principle. He must have courage, cause I know how the whip must have been cracked. He has now become one of the defenders of the Constitution. Remember that nations are generally saved by the few bers of this Parliament stumped the coun that have courage. It always requires Mr King O'Malley. courage to differ from the multitude, who we advance only gradually. Some man must lead. No great principle has ever yet 'been secured or great reform effected except by a laborious process of hard work and agitathe tion. Those who lead the way have always had to suffer. They have been called fools, and have been held up to public reprobation. are multitudes who work like horses, the and allow themselves to be led by asses, producing wealth of which they get a very share.

He says that by placing an amending provision in the Constitution we shall not be taking any power out of the hands of the people. But I maintain that the bepeople of Australia, with their eyes open, inserted in the Constitution the provision giving this Parliament power to amend the existingfinancialarrangement. Many memT try in advocacy of the Constitution. I did myself. I made the first speech in Western Australia-at Kanowna-in favour of the adoption of the Constitution. stumped the country at my own expense in this cause.",92
590,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member supported the Constitution as first submitted to the people, I believe?",94
591,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did. At that time the Braddon section was a permanent enactment.,94

593,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did, because the Constitution in that form was the best one we could get. Either we had to take it or have no Federation. But to the everlasting credit of the right honourable member for East Sydney, then Premier of New South Wales, a modification of the Biaddon section was secured limiting its operation to ten years.",94

I was prepared to accept it the hope that it might be altered for better later on. I spoke on the question will be wasted. at Penola, South Australia, when the sent Premier of that State took the chair for me. The strange thing is that people of the district were opposed to Constitution at that time. They thought that the Commonwealth Parliament should the have complete control over finance.",94

I took a great interest in the movement for the adoption of the Constitution, and wherever I spoke told the people that they would not reenabled gret adopting it . I urged that they should accept it , with all its faults, because demption fund. - it offered the only means of achievStates ing Federation. The Braddon section was really suggested to Sir Edward that Braddon by the late Speaker of this House, Sir Frederick Holder. It was , only suggested as a compromise besiderations cause the States were then afraid of the the curse of this House. way in which it might operate, just as they are now. But why should they be afraid, seeing that the Commonwealth has alI ready returned to them £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the amount which it was required to hand back to them under the Constitution? The Postmaster-General would like to spend thousands of pounds in providing rural districts with telephonic and postal services, and yet the Commonwealth has returned to the States about £7,000,000 which it had a right to retain. Had the first Commonwealth Parliament been composed Of business men, that money would have been debited against the transferred properties. Deducting the interest to which the States were entitled, they have received about £ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which should be debited against those properties. Unfortunately, men do things in Parliament which they would never dream of doing in their private business. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. POYNTON) - Will the honourable member was connect his remarks with the question which is now before the Chair ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unles s we adopt a sound scheme for the adjustment in of the financial relations between the Comthe monwealth and the States, millions sterling Apart from the amendprement which I have indicated, I intend to provide for the establishment of a postal the banking system which would enable the the various States to be financed. Under my scheme, the Postmaster-General would have right to spend £1,000,00 0 or £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or whatever amount appeared upon his ledger. The Department would pay in terest only upon the amount which was thus utilized. When any portion of the money was re-paid, interest would be charged only The De. I partment would thus be absolutely financed credit. Under my scheme, neither the Commonwealth nor the States would ever be tied up financially.

In my opinion, is not right.

598,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member has had one experience of an elective Ministry. ' Mr KING O'MALLEY - That does not matter. Upon the next occasion that the Labour party come into power, I shall be on the Treasury bench. In the event of the debts of the States being taken over by the Commonwealth, 1 propose that the Federal Treasurer may, at his discietion, authorize the issue of Commonwealth consols.",95
599,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What has that scheme to do with the amendment which is now under consideration ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is part of a clause, the insertion of which I intend to move.",95

602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it is time that this farce came to an end. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable gentleman can apply the gag if he likes. I am talking to posteritv, and nor to the House. We are committed by the Defence Bill to an enormous expenditure on an Army and a Navy, but we have not provided any ways and means. Although we have just passed a Bill which will shortly entail an enormous expenditure, yet it is proposed to hobble the Commonwealth by putting upon its revenue a lien for all time. We are actually asked by the Government to destroy our own credit, to make it impossible for us to borrow at the same rate as the States can do. We shall shortly have to enter the money market of the world, and shall not be' able to borrow on as good terms as the smallest State in the union-Tasmania-if this provision is placed in the Constitution, because we shall have to say to the moneylenders, "" We can give you as security only 24s. 6d. per capita of our revenue, the other 25s. belonging to the States."" I should be prepared to make a larger payment to the States, but I would make provision for the transfer of their debts to the Commonwealth, so that we might have one control and a national stock. Should the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda be defeated, I shall move that to which I have referred. My proposals furnish the only solution of the great financial problem and recognise the rights of the States without impairing the nnancial integrity of the Commonwealth.",95

A number of speeches have been delivered from the other side of the Chamber.",95
604,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But on the side of the question on which the honourable member ranges himself. Mr JH CATTS' - The speakers have the been chiefly Ministerialists. Had they and not members of the. Opposition been speaking late in the day, the Government would have consented to an adjournment. We are asked to speak when we should be resting. Apparently the Minister in charge of the Bill wishes to make this a trial of physical endurance, and to prevent the free and calm discussion of one of the greatest measures that has ever been before Parliament. Mr. JOSEPH COOK*-We have been discussing it now for three weeks.",95
605,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Bill has been on the business-paper for three weeks, but the Government has deferred its consideration pending the return of the honourable member for Brisbane from England. The tactics adopted to bludgeon the measure through, would be a disgrace to any Parliament, let alone a national one. Ministers have brought to bear on their supporters such pressure that they have been able to cause those who deliberately spoke against the agreement to go back on their political convictions, and vote for it. This, I shall prove by quoting passages from speeches delivered by the honourable members for Wimmera, Kooyong, Lang, and Bass. They deliberately expressed themselves in opposition to the proposal; but when the party whip cracked, they put their consciences into their pockets, and crossed the floor ta vote for it.",95
606,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There has been no cracking of the party whip, so far as I am concerned.",96
607,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When the news was flashed across the wires that a Labour candidate would oppose the honourable member, he voted with the Government, in contradiction to his speech, so that he might obtain their support at the poll.",96
608,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It was known weeks ago how I would vote on this question.,96
609,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of that statement, let me quote what the honourable member said on the 28th September lasthis remarks are to be found on page 3849 of the Hansard report of the discussion on the present BillIt would be a mistake, however, to bind the Commonwealth for all time to a f e r cafita ment of 25s. per annum to the States. I should certainly be in favour of such 'payment being made for the next ten years, and rather than that the agreement should be' lost to us altogether, I should vote for its continuance for twenty or thirty years. As the honourable member for Parkes pointed out, we know more now concerning the finances of Australia than we did eight years ago, and our experience will be still broader ten years hence. If we agreed to make a fer cafita payment to the States of 25s. per annum for ten years, we should be able, at the end of that term, to decide whether that payment should be continued, or whether it should be increased or reduced. We should then be able, if we found that the arrangement was endangering the Protectionist policy of Australia, to vary its terms. I should certainly be prepared to trust the people and their representatives to do what is right at the end of the ten years' period. The honourable member expressed himself as strongly opposed to the agreement.",96
610,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not.,96
611,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the honourable member deny that he objected, to its permanency ?",96
612,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I expressed a doubt as to the wisdom of making it permanent.,96
613,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member impugn the accuracy of the Hansard record ?,96
614,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is quite correct.,96
615,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Notwithstandin g I hearty that the honourable member uttered the words my which I have read, he voted against the amendment moved by the honourable memmyself, ber for Mernda to test the opinion of Committee as to whether the agreement should be made permanent. Why? Being left to our own conclusions, we can only assume that it was because it was graphed that a Labour candidate was to oppose him; that he rushed into the arms of the Deakin Government for shelter and the agreement [202] support. Then we have the honourable member for Kooyong reported in Hansard, page 4167, to have said, on 6th October of this yearI never contemplated any change in the Constitution, but regarded it as a matter of trust between the representatives of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth, holding the opinion that it is quite competent for us to enter into an obligation for a period of years that will be as binding as any Constitutional enactment.

622,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He merely plays the game of the Prime Minister when the party whip is cracked, and he is practically told that if he does not march across to the other side with the Government and swallow his convictions he will not get support at the polls. Therefore, because he thinks he might otherwise sacrifice a few votes at the polls, he crosses the floor and sacrifices his political conscience. What is the attitude of the honourable member for Lang, who sits on the back Government benches and prates to members on this side about who should come into hear the prayers read ? He jeers and gibes at us because some of us do not always come into make a quorum for the Government, while some of the Government's friends go off to earn large fees in the Courts. He impudently - makes 'out that we on this side object to the prayers being read, but what does this great Puritan 'himself do? He talks all over the Commonwealth about the sacredness of a member's independence, and the necessity for the assertion of his conscience, but on 4th November, as reported on page 5351 of tHamard, he said I do not regard the agreement as perfect, especially bearing in mind the commitments of the Commonwealth. I should like to see an arrangement come lo which, whilst insuring the solvency of the States, would be sufficiently elastic to enable us to regulate our expenditure and income in accordance with our needs, without any further amendment of the Constitution in future, or recourse to additional taxation. In mv opinion, the Premiers would have been well advised had they accepted an arrangement limiting the duration of the agreement.

628,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I mean no reflection on the Speaker, who, I understand, has the right to vote on certain occasions.;, but leaving him out of consideration, we have thirty-two for the Government and. forty-one against. Such, however, is the manipulation of members by the Government that there was a tie on a national issue of this description; and now that the honourable member for Brisbane has returned, the Government hope to have a majority of one. I think the Age of today sums up the situation very correctly and 1 effectively in the following words: In the Conservative organs, certain members of the House are openly and constantly rebuked because they do not violate their political consciences in order to vote with Ihe rest of their party on this issue. They are told that party men have no right to political conviction. The matter of supreme consequence is party integrity. Principles are of no consequence. Party is first, last, everything. And it is to this most immoral doctrine that certain members who were returned as Liberals have succumbed. Federal politics have reached the lowest ebb of demoralization. We may hope at least that there is no loweT depth than that in which Liberalism is absolutely swallowed up in a Fusion which is undiluted Conservatism.",98
629,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear.",98
630,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Corio says "" Hear, hear,"" but I have no doubt that when the whip is cracked he will be found voting with the Government. We all remember the magnificent flights of oratory to which the Prime Minister ascended when advocating the glories of the Constitution; but it remains for this gentleman, who thus exhausted his vocabulary, to be the first public man in Australia to seek to degrade the Constitution, and limit the sphere of action of this Parliament. We a'-e told that the proposal before the House will not take anything away from the Constitution, and that is correct, seeing that something is added to the limitations in favour of the State Parliaments. It seems ridiculous to ask the people of Australia to take away certain powers with which they have invested us. Could there be a greater admission of incompetence than this desire to invite the people to take from the Commonwealth Parliament the constitutional powers with which it has been invested by the people? The people gaveto this Parliament great powers of taxation and of control over the revenues derived from certain sources. The Prime Minister talks of the-submission of the question to namelya referendum of the people. But he is not prepared to allow a proper referendum to be taken on the issue. If he were, the Senator situation would be different. He simply wishes to submit a single issue to the people, in such a way as to invite them to impose further constitutional limitations ham, upon the Commonwealth.",98
631,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Really , the Prime ister should be here to listen to this",99
632,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member need not expect that the Prime Minister will sacrifice himself very in this matter. No doubt he is away havexpressed ing a sleep. It is well known that the fer cafita scheme of distributing the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth paper was not submitted to them. was evolved at the Inter-State Labour ference at Brisbane. The principles the scheme there formulated have been stolen by the present Government. In first instance they had no idea of submitcally ting such a scheme to Parliament. But, acknowledged by the Prime Minister in opening speech on the subject, it was necesfurther sary for the Government to come to an agreement of this kind in consequence the political situation. ' They knew if they went to the polls without some port from the State Governments they would receive very short shrift. They therefore, prepared to sacrifice the constifound tutional power of the Commonwealth in order to secure political support from State Premiers. But the Government gone beyond the Brisbane scheme, inasthe much as they now desire to have the arfigure. rangement made embodied in the Constitical tution as a permanent provision. Such idea was not in the minds of those prepared the Brisbane scheme. I was sent at the Conference, and heard whole of the debates. I took part in them. There was not a single reference to a fixed period for which the agreement was to bodying operate. I think that as so much misresuggested, presentation has been indulged in, I ought to place on record a statement as to the opinions of the delegates to the - Conferitof was ence. The Sydney Worker sent out a machinery ballot-paper to the delegates asking them the following question :Did you understand that the financial scheme of the Brisbane Conference was to be incorporated in the Constitution? To that question the following members of the Conference answered "" No "" ; Mr Ager, Mr Anstey, Mr Bowman, Mr. Catts, Senator Findley, Mr Fisher, Mr Foster, Givens, Mr Grant, Mr Heagney, Mr. Hinchcliffe, Senator Henderson, Mr Hurst, . Mr Hutchison, Mr Jensen, Mr Lamond, Senator de Largie, Senator Lynch, Mr Mahon, Senator MCGregor, Mrs Miller, Senator NeedMr O'Malley, Mr Reid, Mr Spence, Senator Story, Mr Tudor, Mr Tunnecliffe, Mr. Ben Watkins, Mr Ward. MinOne lady member of the Conference anspeech. swered "" Yes."" The honourable member for South Sydney was absent in Tasmania and his vote could not be taken. Mr Holman and Mr MCGowen, members of the much New South Wales Parliament, had already the opinion that the intention was that the scheme should be embodied in the Constitution and consequently a ballotThe ConLeader of the Labour party in this House of has since received a letter from South Africa, from the honourable member for the South Sydney, who states"" most emphatithat there was no intention on the aspart of the Brisbane Conference to incorhis porate the scheme in the Constitution. He expresses the opinion that 25s. fercafita is too high, though he considers that of the agreement might be allowed to operate that for a number of years. On the 28th Ocsuptober last year I placed before honourable members a calculation showing how the are, Brisbane Conference scheme .worked out. I that it worked out at jQx os. 9-d. per head to be returned to the States. It the is interesting to note that the honourable have member for South Sydney now expresses view that 25s. per head is too large a The president of the Brisbane PoliLabour League, Mr Mat Reid, who an represented Queensland at the Conference who and who has been a member of the State preParliament, expresses himself in the the Worker in the following terms:Enclosed are answers to questions asked. As you know, I was a member of Finance Committee that submitted the scheme. The idea of emit in the Constitution was never even or perpetuity either. It was thought the best for the time being, as it has proved itself to be. I cannot recollect even a suggestion time limit or fixture. As far as I remember given to the people of Australia as the whereby the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States would be equitably settled for some time, experience guiding the future as necessity demanded, as it was then helping us to draw up the scheme. . That statement expresses my view entirely. There was no idea of placing a limit on the operation of the scheme, which was adopted simply as that which seemed the best and most practical obtainable. was to be given effect to in such a way as to be open for review whenever occasion demanded. The amendment of the honourable member for Mernda is not one which I can heartily endorse. If I have to choose between the proposal of the Government and the amendment, I shall vote for the amendment, inasmuch as it secures some finality. But, at the same time, I express my absolute dissent from a proposal to tie up this Parliament to raise heavy Customs duties from the people one moment longer than is necessary. I came into this Parliament as a reformer. I came here with the idea of reforming the basis of taxation. At one time the Minister of Defence was a strong believer in direct taxation. No member of the Government has expressed such abhorrence of Customs taxation as he has done. Yet he can now contemplate with perfect equanimity the exploitation of the working classes by means of Customs revenue duties. Those by whom he is surrounded do not seek to disguise the fact that they prefer to collect revenue from Customs duties rather than from direct taxation. To my mind it is criminal to place a constitutional embargo upon the electors should they desire to raise revenue from direct taxation rather than from Customs duties. When the Tariff was under consideration I was quite prepared to vote for protective duties on the understanding that effect was also to be given to the policy of new Protection. But on every occasion I have opposed the imposition of revenue duties. Whenever such duties were under consideration the Conservatives of this House rallied to the support of the Government, with the result that the Labour party were left alone in opposition to them. Thus we cannot be charged with having supported that portion of the Tariff which presses heavily upon the working classes. Under the Constitution, it is necessary that the Commonwealth shall raise four times as much revenue from any article as it may require. It is well known, too, that if a revenue duty of £ 1 be levied upon any article, the importer not only passes the duty on by charging it on to the price of goods, but also adds a profit upon the duty. In addition, wherever a duty, say, of i d. is charged upon any article the merchant adds a penny to its price. In the debate upon preferential trade which took place at the Conference of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, which was recently held in SydIt ney, Sir Albert Spicer, its President, said If we could import with some preference, say, from Canada, Australia, and India, without its affecting the price of the whole of the rest of the wheat it would be a different thing. The Duke of Devonshire made a statement some two or three years ago in the course of a great fiscal debate. Mr 'JOSEPH COOK - Is this reference by the honourable member relevant to the proposed agreement? I submit that he is discussing the question of preferential trade.",99
633,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," I would point out that a very wide latitude has been allowed to other honourable members, and consequently I cannot prevent the honourable member from proceeding.",100
634,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not discussing the question of preference. I am arguing that the adoption of the proposed agreement will involve the imposition of heavy revenue duties, and that for every pound raised in that way for Governmental purposes, the people have to pay an added amount such as shown by Sir Albert Spicer. The Minister of Defence very cunningly interrupted my quotation at its most effective point. Sir Albert Spicer said If we could import with some preference, say, from Canada, Australia, and India, without its affecting the price of the whole of the rest of the wheat it would be a different thing. The Duke of Devonshire made a statement some two or three years ago in the course of a great fiscal debate, that preference such as was suggested would mean an advantage to the self-governing Dominions of one and a half millions, but would cost the British consumer £10.000,000. That is to say, the self-governing Colonies would derive an advantage of £1,500,000, but the British consumer would have to pay £10,000,000. This shows how revenue duties would operate. Sir Albert Spicer addedThat was the statement of one of the most brainy men in England-on e who put the interests of the country above all party. We had an illustration of what a duty on wheat would mean in March this year. . The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - - I would ask the honourable member not to proceed further on those lines.",100
635,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I merely wish to point out that the imposition of Customs duties for revenue purposes involves the payment by the consumer of several times the amount of those duties. Consequently it is a system of taxation which should not be resorted to. The quotation proceedsThe price of wheat in England was 35s. and in Berlin 48s. iod., though the import duty there is only 7s. 2d.",100
636,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,- to raise Ihe honourable member will not be in order in pursuing that line of argument.,101
637,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My point is, and I desire to show, that while a of 7s. 2d. per quarter was operative upon wheat, the consumers were required to 13s. per quarter more for it.",101
638,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That circumstance might be used as an argument upon the Tariff, but it has would scarcely any bearing upon the question which is before the Chair.",101
639,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am proving burden of revenue duties. I have only few more words to quote. Mill saysA tax on any commodity, whether laid its production, its importation, its carriage from cotton-piece goods."" place to place, or its sale, and whether be a fixed sum of money for a given quantity of the commodity or an ad valorem duty, will, as a general rule, raise the value and of the commodity by at least the amount the tax. There are few cases in which it not raise them to more than that amount. Dealing with the importation of wheat France and the United Kingdom during the period from 1883 to 1898, Lord Avebury, in his notable book, shows that the consumers were called upon, to pay fully 25 per cent, in addition to the duty thereon. I do not desire to weary honorclasses. able members by quoting the tables which are given for that period; but they show that if the average price of wheat 9s. 1 id., the consumers had to pay 2s. in addition to the duty.",101
640,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"- attitudes, Order ! I cannot allow the honourable memthirty-two ber to discuss the effect of a Tariff upon trade, because that has nothing to do with the question Before the Committee.",101
641,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am discussing question which is involved in the ment, and that is whether we should be in this debate. compelled to raise an excessive revenue from Customs duties on the necessaries of life the working people.",101
642,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member was going beyond that. He was dealing with the effect Customs duties on the cost of foodstuffs, and there is no proposal for a duty on wheat involved in the question before the Chair.",101
643,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I submit, sir, I was not. I do not desire to discuss Tariff, but to point out to the people that this agreement, if carried, would involve iod. the imposition of heavy Customs duties on the necessaries of life. I think, sir, that I am quite entitled to point out fhat a proposal a tremendous amount from the working classes by indirect taxation should not receive the support of a Democrat. It may be said that the necessary sum could be duty obtained by levying duties upon certain articles not in general consumption; but we pay know that if duties were put upon such articles, the revenue therefrom would be very small indeed. So that, in order to derive a huge revenue from the Customs, it be necessary, if this agreement were adopted, to levy duties on the necessaries of life to the working classes. When the the honourable member for Denison was asked a during this discussion where the revenue was to come from, he said, "" Oh, we can on raise £3,000,000 by means of duties on What would that the tax mean? It would mean taxing the wearing apparel of the wives of working men merely price to save States with Conservative Upper. of Houses from resorting to direct taxation. does The honourable member for North Sydney has stated that a large sum could be raised into by levying duties on tea and kerosene, which he pointed out were great untapped sources of revenue. I am opposed to the adoption of the agreement, because it would involve the imposition of heavy revenue duties on such articles used by the working I regret that there is a prospect of it being referred to the people with the nominal endorsement of this Parliament, was when, as a matter of fact, it can have 6d. nothing of the kind. A majority of honourable members have, by their expressed declared against the agreement, being in favour of it and fortyone against it. I do not think that there are really thirty-two honourable members in favour of the agreement if they would only a speak truthfully; party pressure by the agreeGovernment has much to account for I shall take every opportunity to prevent the incorporation of of the proposed agreement in the Constitution. Whilst I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda as infinitely better than the Government proof posal, I shall hold myself free to speak against it in the constituencies, and, if it be defeated, to vote for something commending itself more to my judgment. I hope that that those who have made such brilliant the speeches against the Government proposal .will not, if defeated to-night, tamely vote for the third reading. If they sincerely desire to prevent the wrecking of the Constitution, fhey should vote against the adoption of the proposed agreement at every stage. I have no desire to gain any - party advantage in connection with this matter. My firm belief is that the best thing that could happen for our party political ends would be the carrying of the Government .proposal. I closely followed the campaign of the right honourable member for East Sydney against the draft Constitution Bill , attending every meeting I could get to, and I am convinced that the feeling which was then exhibited against the proposal to make the Braddon provision perpetual will be revived, and that the people will protest against being taxed through the Customs House for revenue purposes. The one thing which will secure most likely the turn of the balance in favour of the election of Labour senators for New South Wales is the carrying of the agreement. what the feeling of the peopleof the State will be. All the printed matter that can be turned out from the Sydney Morning Herald and Daily Telegrafh offices will not affect it . The eloquence of the Minister of Defence will be swept aside, or he will be reminded of old speeches, which will make him appear ridiculous. Personally, I want no better political issue for campaigning purposes.",101
644,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , what is matter with the honourable member?",102
645,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have no desire to see a"" sacred constitutional issue made the sport of party politics. The honourable member for Franklin spoke about the referendum being Democratic.",102
646,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The proposed amendment can be made only with the consent of the majority of the people.,102
647,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but a minority could block a subsequent alteration.",102
648,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A minority of one in ten.,102
649,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , no matter how burdensome the proposal may prove to the majority. The referendum proabout vided for in the Constitution is not a cratic one. If it were, the honourable ber for Franklin would not be in favour of the proposal of the Government. I have personal friends in Tasmania, and reguof larly spend my holidays there. Perhaps shall have an opportunity to explain matter to some of his electors. The Labour party is prepared to trust the people, (Finance) Bill . '5631 to refer to it any question upon which it can freely express its opinion. We desire the initiative referendum. We would allow 1 per cent, of the people to initiate a referendum on any question by petition to the Prime Minister. Under the Constitution, a minority can successfully prevent the .majority from taking an objectionable provision out of the Constitution. The honourable member for Wentworth has drawn my attention to the wording of section 128 of the Constitution, which enacts thatThe proposed law for the alteration thereof must be passed by an absolute majority of each House of the Parliament, and not less than two or more than six months after its passage through both Houses the proposed law shall be submitted in each State to the electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives. But if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first-menI know tioned House will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the first-mentioned House in the same or the next session again passes the proposed law by an absolute majority with or without any amendment which has been made' or agreed to by the other House, and such other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, the Governor General may submit the proposed law as last proposed by the first-mentioned House and either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the the election of the House of Representatives. When a proposed law is submitted to the electors the vote shall be taken in such manner as the Parliament prescribes. But until the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives becomes uniform throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half the electors voting for and against the proposed law shall be counted in any State in which adult suffrage prevails. And if in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law, and if a majority of all the electors voting also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent. Those members, therefore, who talk about submitting this amendment of the Constitution to a Democratic referendum, and its being alterable at any time by the Demosame means, are simply talking with their memtongue in their cheek. Many of them have - paraded up and down Australia objecting to this provision in the Constitution; but, course, when it suits their purpose, they I can forget all the Democratic ideas which this they espoused in days gone by. The Government ought to submit alongside their and present proposal, another question which would enable the people to vote for limited period, say, of ten years. sonally, I would much prefer that the ter should be arranged without an amendI ment of the Constitution at all , as not desire to see the powers of the ComMernda; monwealth Parliament in any way tramthe melled. The States had a right to their financial house in order during the views. ten years' notice which they have had. In stead of that, they have gone on squandersonal ing their money. New South Wales had since Federation £10,000,000 more revenue than it would have had if its Customs Tariff had been in operation ing the whole time.",102
650,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the honourable member' says that New South Wales has squandered it ?,103
651,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . The New but South Wales Governments have been inhave dulging in a policy of spend and burst. in Tasmania have done. They have had £24,000,00 0 of Customs revenue from the Commonwealth, ancl, in addition, have spent over £20,000,000 of borrowed money in that time.",103
652,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can the honourable member give an instance of where they have month ago. squandered it?,103
653,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Although large number of non-revenue-producing partments have been handed over to the Commonwealth, the cost of government New South Wales is larger now than it was before Federation. That is vernmental purposes alone, and indicates that no economy has been practised in the administration of State affairs. For a period of four years before Federation, the average Customs and Excise revenue of New South Wales was £ 1 4s. 6d. per.head. We now propose to give them £ 1 5s. per head. We have given them, in the meantime, tremendous amount; but the result has been as I have stated. As the States, my own included, have not put their financial house in order during that ten years' period, Parliament cannot see their finances thrown into a condition of confusion by immediately depriving them of all the revenue which they have been obtaining from the ComFranklin, monwealth; but must see that they have another opportunity, although they have been prodigal in their expenditure.

655,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hindmarsh) [2.35 a a.m.] - I would point out to the GovernDement that we have had only one day's debate upon the greatest question that has income before the Chamber. We met two hours earlier than usual today, and yet for gothe Government now refuse an adjournment. When I had the honour of being elected, I felt delighted at the prospect of joining an assembly of gentlemen, who, no matter what differences of opinion there might 'be, would be at one in defending the powers intrusted to us by the people. But instead of defending those powers, a large a number of honourable members opposite are ready to destroy the Constitution.. What more is this pliable Government going to accept in the way of suggestions from the this Premiers? So long as I am here I shall do all I possibly can to prevent any of the powers we possess now being handed over to the States. The honourable member for like many others, says that we are afraid to trust the people, and I have to say that I shall never consent to a referendum with the object of depriving us of any of the powers we now possess. I am premy pared at any time to have a referendum on question whether we shall be given fresh powers, which the people may think we are fitted to exercise than are the States. But I should not, for instance, consent to a referendum on the question of the Northern Territory. There is another agreement, tered into by the Prime Minister with the late Premier of South Australia. But this Parliament has the power to decide question just as it has in the matter immepoints diately before us; and I do not see why there should be a referendum. I listened to hear what the Prime Minister might have to say as to the demerits of the proposal the honourable member for Mernda; but not one word of disparagement was win uttered by the honourable gentleman, for the obvious reason that there is nothing to be said against it. We are told by the Prime Minister that if this agreement be embodied in the Constitution there will be no difficulty with the people in the future in regard to securing any necessary amendment; and he has instanced in the referendum on the Constitution Bill, when the whole of the Parin liaments, the majority of the people and the States had to consent. But how was Federation carried in some of the States? Federation had the support of the whole the press, all the leading men, and also the members of the Labour party, the Australian members of which it in their platform years before. But we were satisfied that the Bill submitted was scheme not on a proper Democratic basis, and we incorporated opposed the measure, while not opposing Federation, which, I may say, was carried precisely as this agreement will be carried, as the result of the most outrageous mises to the people. The late President the Senate, Sir Richard Baker, told the electors of South Australia that, instead Federation costing them anything, it save them £12,000 per annum. We are going to have newspapers like the Argus, the Sydney' Morning Herald, and the Adrecollect vertiser and the Register in Adelaide, placing anything but the truth before people; and I have no doubt there no difficulty in having this agreement into the Constitution. The decision which we arrived the other day ought respected; and the honourable member Parkes has shown us, that putting the of the Chairman of Committee aside for moment, there is a majority against the yernment. But I remember, Mr Chairby man, the vigorous speech which you made.",103
656,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member must not discuss that matter. . Mr HUTCHISON - At any rate, know the opinion of the Chairman.",104
657,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order .,104
658,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall not discuss enthe matter further than to say that the Chairman was just as entitled to give his vote, without any qualification, as was any the other honourable member. The leading in the agreement have been admirably dealt with by the honourable members for Mernda, Parkes, and Flinders, and we, on this side, will not be accused of supportof ing those honourable members, because we are anxious to do something which will their favour while they are not anxious to do anything for the sake of pleasing honourable members on this side. But I am glad to think that honourable members, who differ from us on almost every other political question, are at one with us in safeguarding the Constitution. A great deal was made of the fact that one or two State members New South Wales-thoug h I am glad to say that such members are not conspicuous other parts of the Commonwealth-hav e stated that the proposed agreement is practically that carried at the Brisbane Labour Conference. However, we have now reof ceived replies from every member of that Conference, to two questions put to them South through the Sydney Worker. The queshad included tions are as follow :1. Did you understand that the nnancial of the Brisbane Conference was to be in the Constitution ? 2. Was any hint of such intention given by any member of the Conference in your hearing? I am pleased to say that so far as those who drew up the proposals embodied in prothe platform are concerned, every memof ber replied in the negative to the first question, while the whole thirty-five deleof gates, with the exception: of Mr Holwould man, Mr MCGowen, and Mrs Dwyer, gave ah emphatic "" No"" to the second. There was also one who said he did not anything of the kind being said. But we shall not find the Govern the ment retracting a single word that will be has been said. I am delighted to put think that the Labour party in at South Australia are unanimous in' their to be desire to trust this Parliament with for the work that was handed over to vote it by the people, in the belief that the it would always act fairly and generously. GoThere is one thing that cannot be denied any section of honourable members; and, that is that it was the intention of all parties in this Parliament that any settlement of this question should be made in conwe nexion with the taking over of the debts of the States. But was the Prime Minister in earnest when he said that one of the best arguments for the agreement was that it would hasten the imposition of direct taxation? Does the honourable gentleman mean to tell us that the people will be satisfied with that reason ? 1 venture that the Prime Minister himself would be one of the strongest opponents of a proposal ro impose direct taxation. Land taxation, and the adoption of this agreement, are entirely separate questions. Land taxation will only come up for consideration when we find that extra revenue is needed; and when that occurs, he will be a bold member who will be prepared to say to his electors, "" We in the Commonwealth Parliament have given away our revenue, and, therefore, we now desire to superimpose a Federal land tax on the land taxes imposed by the States."" Any member of Parliament who advocated such a policy would run the risk of having some one else put into his seat. I could imagine the Minister of Defence, if he were still a member of a State Parliament, going wholesouled for this agreement; because, if it were adopted, he would have no trouble about taxation for the rest of his life. He would have the satisfaction of knowing that if the members of the Federal Parliament did not do what he wanted them to do, it would be the simplest thing in the world to persuade the electors to replace the Federal members by others. But is that taking a national view of things? I venture to say that it would not be very long, under such conditions, before this Parliament became one of the most degraded Parliaments in the British Dominions. We cannot be a National Parliament if we are to do the bidding of the State Premiers whenever they meet in Conference. It is remarkable that we cannot obtain any statement from any Minister regarding the reasons which induced every one.of them to change his views on this question. There was absolute unanimity, up to the time of the late Conference, that we were to give to the States what we could afford - to",104

I take the same stand regarding the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, as I did at the Brisbane Conference. That Conference adopted an infinitely better scheme than any. other that has been laid before this Parliament. It was better than the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, and if there were a chance of carrying out the Brisbane scheme, it would be moved from this side of the chamber. I object to anything relating to our financial relations with the States being placed in the Constitution. The people were satisfied, in the first instance, to limit the Braddon section to ten years. They were content that this Parliament should then review the situation, recognising that we should undoubtedly be the better judges.",105

A question of this great importance is not likely to engage the consideration of this Parliament for many years, and when we asked for time to consider the merits of the amendment, we made a reasonable request. In my opinion, the Prime Minister has not dealt fairly with those sitting on his side who disagree with his proposal. It is well known that the honourable member for Mernda submitted his first amendment with a statement that the test vote to be taken thereon was to be accepted by the Prime Minister as indicating the wish of the Committee for a reduction of the term of the agreement.",107

704,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In regard to the interjection I have quoted, the honourable gentleman, has broken faith with those who sit on his own side of the chamber, and they, it appears to me, have some cause of complaint against him. So far, it cannot be said that any honourable member on this side has endeavoured to make the slightest political capital out of the attitude which has been adopted by some honourable members who sit on the Government side. We desire to see the question of the future position of this Parliament in relation to the States decided on its merits, without any attempt to derive a party advantage from any division which may be taken. An opportunity was presented at an early' hour today to hear the opinions of those who differ from the proposal of the Prime Minister. It appears to me that they have established an answerable case. The great point which I think has been made by the opponents of the agreement is that in the near future, under the Constitution as it stands, Parliament will be absolute master of the finances of Australia, so far as the collection of duties from Customs and Excise is concerned. It was placed in that position by the deliberate vote of the people when they accepted the Constitution, including the Braddon section, with an operation limited to ten years, after which the Parliament was left free to decide as to what would be best in the interests of the people. At the end of, about ten months we shall have complete control of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. debts What are we proposing to do? l t is suggested, now that we are reaching time when we shall be able to say. what shall be retained by the Commonwealth defence and other purposes, that we should ask the people to take away this power, that we should put ourselves into the position of mendicants asking assistance from the States. I am not prepared to accept that suggestion, or to say to the people, intrusted the Commonwealth with a power which we are not competent to use. I ask you to take it from us, and at the same lime to impose upon us the responsibility of paying 25s. per capita to the State vernments for all time.""

708,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has influenced those who will make the majority. Were it not for the fact that there will be an election within three months, there would be overwhelming majority against the proposal. unAlthough I cannot hope to influence any one, I make these remarks at twenty minutes past 3 o'clock in the morning to justify my action to my constituents, and to such other this electors as may need them. The public debts of the States now amount to about £250,000,000 or nearly £50,000,000 more than they amounted to when the States federated, and the yearly interest Jbill comes to nearly £9,000,000. It has been demonstrated byfiguressupplied by the Treasurer that, were these loans under Commonwealth control, they could be renewed for \ per cent, less than is now paid, which would save £26,000,000 during the currency of the present obligations. We are asked now to abandon the opportunity to obtain control of £202,000,000 of the of the States without consulting their wishes, that being the amount which was the owing at the time they federated. sum But what I have suggested will be for impossible if we have to pay to the States 25s. per capita per annum for and all time. The Prime Minister, with, his tongue in his cheek, talked about a referendum on this question. He knew that he was acting the part of a hypocrite, and that "" You nothing can be done until there have been fresh negotiations. The proposals of the Government are so mean, and likely to be so disastrous to the Commonwealth, that I cannot think that any one has been Goconvinced by the insincere eloquence of the Under other circumand ' stances, I might well elaborate the argube ments against this proposal, which affect our industrial legislation, and must injure is our Protective policy. But no one is sufhonficiently interested in the matter now to make it worthwhile. The measure has been kept dangling before Parliament for nearly three months.",108
709,Mr TILLEY BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why ?,108
710,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because the Governexment have not had a majority. Their maComjority arrived from London on Tuesaay afternoon, and now they are bludgeoning the Bill through. If they wait a week or two aslonger their majority will again disappear. They have broken a pair in order to secure mema majority. It is a most unhappy omen for the Commonwealth that a question of this description should be decided under such conditions, and that a decision snould be arrived at in which the real opinion of the majority of this House will not prevail. an There is an actual majority against the agreement, but by a clever manipulation of pairs, and by exercising control over a small weak-kneed section of the Government party-me n who are never safe unless they are with the "" packers,"" as was explained by one of their own members the other day-the Government are evidently - going to carry to victory this iniquitous posal, which will tie up the Australian people. We cannot help it. Another opportunity for review will probably arise, but I cannot imagine a majority of this - Committee allowing such an iniquitous proposition to be given effect to in the interests of the State Rightersa proposition which is undoubtedly destined to aggrandize the State Premiers, and to sacrifice our national possibilities. At the same time, I am compelled to admit that they are likely to .accept it to-night, but to those who believe in the industrial development of Australia, and who desire to see its Protective policy continued, no other course should be open than to vote against it.",108
711,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne Ports) [3.28 a.m.] - I should perhaps have abstained from speaking, but for the rather insulting tone adopted at times by the honourable members for Franklin and Lang, and a few others towards the Labour party. Whenever we objected to the so-called referendum now proposed, we were asked if we would not ""trust the people."" We were told that we were the party who first advocated the principle of the referendum,, and were charged with refusing to accept it now that we had the opportunity. If there were any truth in that allegation, of course, we, as a party, sliould be ashamed to take up such an attitude, but those who make it know that in no sense of the word is the referendum provided for under the Constitution a true referendum, because, not only the vote of a majority of the people as a whole, but also the vote of a majority of the States is required to carry it. Our objection ail along to this kind of referendum has been that no Constitution should be hide-bound, and that there should always be a possibility of altering it if the people think fit. Those who placed this form of referendum in the Constitution, however, did so because they knew well that under it it would be hard to get the true opinion of the"" people, and that, the vested interests of the States would always be considered. Although there is a possibility that the people may accept"" this nnancial agreement at the ensuing referendum, I have a strong hope, and I believe there is a good fighting chance, that they will not. 1 f the State Righters had to fight the question against the full force of those who are supposed to be animated by the Federal pro- spirit-if behind the cause of Nationalism we had the strong power of the Prime Minister and his Government, whom the people have looked upon as Nationalists, and if , in ""addition, the newspapers which - support them were advocating a national instead of a State Righters policy dictated by the State Premiers-ther e is no doubt that the people would refuse to sanction the agreement. But the Prime Minister is accepted by the people as an authority, and although he has fallen away from grace upon this occasion the people have not had an opportunity of finding it out. The public have no time to consider the true political situation. Even in Victoria, where the attitude of the Age has given the people an opportunity of seeing the fallacy of the proposal to alter the Constitution to suit the Federal Government and the State Premiers, I have found during the last three or four weeks that not only do they not understand the question, but they have never attempted to consider it. The matter will, therefore, be left at the election' to those who take the platform on one side or the other. We who are the remnants of the National party would have no fear of the result if we had behind us the power that we might expect to have on such a question, but, as matters stand, the people can be led astray by those who have gone over to the Little Australian party. The combined forces of the State Premiers and State Righters, aided by the Federal Government and their supporters, and by the press, may be able to achieve their purpose by misleading not only a majority of the people, but a majority of the States. Some of the small States seem anxious for this agreement in the belief that they will reap some benefit; but I think I can show the representatives of Tasmania that their State will find the proposal, if carried, really a detriment. The Prime Minister told us that if, after say three Parliaments, the arrangement was found not to work so beneficially as had been anticipated, the Constitution could be again altered; but we know that by that time the same influences will not be at work that are at work now-that only the three larger States might then be favourable to an amendment, and, therefore, no amendment could take place. It is not that we are afraid to trust people, but that we object to the method which the Constitution has to be altered. Tbose who charge us with being afraid trust the people, must know that they making a representation that is not correct. We who have been used to party fighting for years, know that politicians do not always put the correct view before the people, but, with the same desire that the Governber ment now have for greater strength next election, are willing to accept from any quarter, even from Satan himself. The Prime Minister admits the possibility of our awakening to the fact that we have made a mistake in altering the Constitution in the way now proposed; but, as I have pointed out, there will be great difficulty in having an amendment made in the futhrowing ture, if certain States are receiving they conceive to be a benefit. In the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Wentworth said that if the States did receive the fer capita pajmient proposed, was possible they would retard instead encourage immigration. I remind manian representatives that the States small area will, in point of population, outstripped by those of larger area, owing to the greater inducements they are able offer to immigrants; and those larger States might devote the whole of their portion the Customs and Excise revenue to the couragement ot immigration. 1 may be charged with regarding the matter from provincial stand-point; but I admit that for the purposes of defence, and providing extended markets, any addition of population is good for the country as a whole. must be admitted, however, that, from the point of view of population, the larger States will always have an advantage the smaller States. At present Victoria the distributing centre for Tasmania, and is contended that, unless the revenue turned per capita, the latter State will get its fair share. Under the"" bookkeeping system much of the trade that really longs to Tasmania comes to Victoria, Tasmania thereby loses, and should receive some consideration. However, the repreBut sentatives of Tasmania should bear in the words of the honourable member Wentworth, and realise that, while they may derive some benefit now under the agreement, it may, in the future, press upon them. In Tasmania, South Australia, and even Victoria the proposed payment represent all the adults of the country of 25s. per head, has upset the calculations of the State Treasurers. In Victoria, the the Treasurer found that he had to obtain by. revenue in some direction; and he immediately set about making arrangements to to collect it by means of a land tax, knoware ing that, after next year, he will not receive so much from the Commonwealth as formerly. I regret this, because * I had hoped that there would be a Federal land tax, though I know that a large numof honourable members prefer to leave at the such taxation to the State Parliahelp ments, because they believe the. State Premiers and members would like to throw on the National Parliament the onus of collecting any furthertaxation. We know that people object to taxation even if they will benefit from it. But we also know.that, while State politicians are the onus of extra taxation on thewhat Commonwealth Parliament, they are themselves utilizing the only means of. extra taxation that are available. Nearly all the not States have income taxes and land taxes. it Land taxation is likely to develop. Moreof over the State Parliaments, instead of reTasducing their expenditure, are now spending of £4,000,000 per annum more than they be spent in pre-Federal days. They show no desire to reduce their establishments. They to wish to continue all the glamour surrounding their Parliaments and Governors. Notof withstanding that we are about to appoint ena High Commissioner, the States show no tendency to withdraw their Agents-General, a but rather to magnify their position.",109
712,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We cannot stop that.,110
713,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We cannot, unless It we develop the national feeling, and recall to the minds of the electors what they desired before Federation was established. over The people of Tasmania, for instance, is never dreamt that the Government of that it State would spend more money per capita is reafter the Commonwealth took over several not State functions. We are told that the bepeople to whom the State Parliaments owe and allegiance are the same as those whom we represent in the Commonwealth Parliament. ""such is not the case. While the Legismind lative Assemblies have shown an inclinafor tion to become more Democratic, theUpper Houses are as Conservative as ever they were. It cannot be said that we rehard present the same people, because the Upper Houses represent only a section, whilst we s Take the case of Victoria. The Legislative Assembly has recently passed three important Bills. The Legislative Council has cut them up in such a way that they are hardly recognisable by their authors. Can it be said that the Legislative Council of Victoria represents the same people as do those returned from that State to the Federal Parliament? The Legislative Council of New South Wales is a nominee Chamber. It may become more Democratic as the old retarders of progress die of f , and their places, are taken by more liberal minded men. But in Victoria, with the limited franchise for the Legislative Council there is no chance of bringing about legislation that reflects the minds of the people. So that, once we permit the Constitution to be altered, as proposed by the Government, we shall have the greatest difficulty in securing an amendment in the direction desired in the future. therefore, the Prime Minister tells us that if after three Parliaments it is found that what is now proposed does not work as he expects it to do, it can be altered, he makes a statement which he must know is not correct. should not go that far. But I will say that if he had given the question that consideration which it deserves, he would recognise that it will be much more difficult to restore the Constitution to its present form when once this agreement has been embodied in it, than it will be to amend it now. I maintain that as honourable members have been elected upon the principle of one adult one vote, they can truthfully urge that they represent the people of Australia in the fullest sense of the word, whereas the State Parliaments do not. Then I should like to ask the Government where they intend to raise the necessary revenue for the purpose of discharging Federal seeing that every form of direct taxation has already been exploited by the States. though the Government will give us no hint in that connection, I know that this Chamber contains a great number of RevenueTariffists, and that the imposition of revenue duties will probably be resorted to. I notice that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is laughing. As a matter of fact, he should weep, seeing that he is now assisting the Government to break down our Protective policy, of which he has always been a declared champion. He is one of the Government supporters, who ought to hide his head in shame. Mr Mathews.",110
714,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the proposed agreement be embodied in the Constitution, it will destroy our Protective policy.",111
715,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Exactly . In other countries high Protective duties have resulted in the collection of a smaller revenue.,111
716,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Oh !,111
717,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member may laugh. When .the Tariff was under consideration, this Parliament recognised that it was idle to impose duties upon commodities that were not locally manufactured, and one afternoon it wiped off duties upon articles which would have yielded £ 3 9 5 , 0 0 0 annually. If the necessity should arise for the Commonwealth to obtain further revenue, and if all other avenues of taxation are closed to it, the free-list will have to be entirely suspended, and resort must be had to revenue duties. In other words, such commodities as cotton When, goods, tea, and kerosene, will have to be made dutiable. We can always afford to levy high duties, because, as a Protectionist, 1 maintain that 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, are not Protective duties in any sense of the word. They are merely revenue Perhaps I duties. We all recognise that a good deal of ' revenue might be obtained by levying duties of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, upon goods which are now upon the free-list. That is a possibility of the near future.",111
718,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is the natural sequence.,111
719,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Undoubtedly . Honourable members opposite who are supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda, usually entertain a different view of matters from that taken by the members of the party with which I am associated. But in the future, they will be regarded as the true Nationalists-as the men who endeavoured to save the Federation at a functions, critical stage in its history. To those who tell us that we are afraid to trust the people, Al- I reply that I am afraid to trust the form of referendum which is provided by our Constitution. While I recognise how much our Tariff means to the industrial lif e of Australia, 1 cannot fail to recognise what the proposed agreement means to our national life. I ask the representatives of the smaller States to again consider how it may operate.",111

721,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Undoubtedly , because-the larger States can offer greater in T ducements to attract population to their shores. I ask honourable members who are supporting the Ministry on this question to consider seriously, in their own interests if not in the interests of Australia, the position in which they are about to place themselves and the National Parliament.",111
722,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gwydir) [4.6 a.m.] I cannot forego this opportunity of entering a protest against this inhuman method of proceeding with important legislation. I have had a little acquaintance with Parliamentary procedure, and in my opinion a Government which tries to force its business through by pushing honourable members to the breaking point, undermining their physical strength and laying them out, as it were, all over the chamber, is not worthy of the respect which is due to the governing body of a civilized community. It is really necessary that the constitution' and procedure of the House should be amended. We"" are considering a proposal by the honourable member for Mernda to amend a provision of the Constitution. No one has ever put a case more deliberately and concisely than he has done. No one need be told that there was earnestness behind every word he uttered. It was apparent to every one that he was not playing a game but saying what he believed to be in the best interests of Australia, not only for today, but for the time to come. After the able speeches which he and other Government supporters delivered one would have thought that their appeal would have induced the Prime Minister to waver, even though he has behind him the State Premiers, urging him on in his destructive attitude towards the Constitution. I do not wish to go over any ground which has already been covered by honourable members. Unless the constitution of this Parliament is altered, party government will be the ruination of the Commonwealth. It is not now a question of whether principles are valuable or essential to the Commonwealth. But it.is a question of whether party government is to control not only the welfare of the people of today but the destinies of those who are not yet born. The Prime Minister is seeking to place a. tremendous burden upon ourselves and posterity. In their desire to secure a reduction of the term of the agreement with the State Premiers, the honourable members for Mernda. Parkes, and Flinders have foregone their conviction regarding the unwisdom of inserting this provision in the Conslitution. They have met the Prime Minister further than I expected that they would do, because they have agreed to do that which they do not believe to be right or proper. In order to get a safe decision on this all-important question they are prepared to agree to place the provision in the Constitution for the time which is embodied in the amendment. It did strike me as an uncharitable and unpatriotic act on the part of the Prime Minister to refuse to give an ear to a very reasonable suggestion of that character. If the party had decided to alter the basis of the Fusion agreement on this question, then those who are pleading for consideration would not have had a cause for complaint. The Government have asked those honourable members not only to forfeit their individuality and independence, but also to accept an agreement which is not the outcome of reasoning amongst their own members. It does not even express the opinion of the Prime Minister or the Government. It is mere dictation by the State Piremiers whom the honourable gentleman and his supporters are over anxious to placate. Why? Because they desire to go to the country in unison with the State Governments. In other words, the reason why the honourable gentleman will not accept the amendment is because he fears for the political scalps of his supporters. He anticipates that if they appealed to the electors after having opposed the will of the State Premiers, the party of which he is the nominal but not the actual leader would not again hold a position in this House as a party. But notwithstanding all this sinking of individuality and sacrificing of the people's rights, I venture to predict that those who support the agreement will be disappointed with the result. It is pitiable to see men like the honourable member for Maribyrnong compelled to abandon every principle which they have espoused and every policy which they have advocated. The other day the honourable member had to vote against his convictions regarding gambling, and though he has been a life-long Protectionist, and a champion of - the down-trodden and oppressed, he is now compelled to vote for a proposal which will put shackles on the toilers, and rob them of the opportunity to live. Had he half-the courage of those who have taken an independent stand, he would not have tolerated the dictation to which he has been subjected. His lot is that of many others on the Ministerial side. The honourable member for Cook has convicted them out of their own mouths. He has read speeches in which honourable members have declared that the nnancial arrangement should be for a limited time, and has pointed out that those who made them had the audacity to vote against the proposals which they advocated. Let me quote another short passage from the remarks of the honourable member for Bass. It is to be found in Hansard, page 5850. said I am not disposed to vote for the agreement being fixed for all time, but I am certainly in favour of it being embodied in the Constitution in the terms of the Braddon section, its operation to be for ten years, and until Parliament otherwise provides. That proposition is not so liberal as the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda Surely the members of this Legislature ten years hence could be trusted just as we are to deal with the affairs of Australia! Those are the sentiments of a statesman, but what is the action of the man? If the Federal Parliament ten years hence seeks to deal unfairly by the States it will be for the people to change its Parliament, and to return men who will do what is best for Australia as a whole. Yet a week or two afterwards the honourable member gave a vote which showed that his words were so much deception. It is his vote which will make it possible for the agreement to be adopted. I would rather leave public life than do what he has done, and would never face an audience if I could be accused of such inconsistency.",112
723,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member never change his mind?,113
724,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He has not got to change.,113
725,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should be sorry to have a mind like that of the Minister of Defence. I listened to the. speech of the honourable member for Parkes with great admiration, because I enjoy a good speech and good arguments, and admire a man who has the courage of his opinions, and will not be driven. I respect men who fight bravely and fairly. It is being said that the issue now is, Are we prepared to trust the people? We on this side can trust the people, and always do so. We ate here because we trust them and they trust us. Men on this side of the House have never obtained their positions by the influences that have sometimes secured the return of men on the other side. If the Government will submit the question to a referendum to be decided by a majority of the people alone I will agree to withdraw: my opposition to this clause, but I shall never consent to a mockery in the name of a referendum. The true referendum is a valuable instrument of government, and one of the strongest supports of modern Democracy. It was because of the proHe vision that an amendment of the Constitution should require not only a majority of the people, but also a majority of the StatesthatT opposed the Constitution Bill when it was first put before the people. I was one of the first to write to the Sydney press, as soon as I read that infamous section, pointing out that the Constitution was an ironbound one, which, if adoped, would fetter the people, restrict their liberties, and deny the right of the majority to rule. I fought the Bill on the platform throughout the campaign in the first fight, and although I was away in the back-blocks crippled with an injured arm when the second fight came on, so determined was I to protest against the proposal that I addressed meeting after meeting against the Bill; while in intense pain. That was in a place where the people carried the Bill at the first referendum, but reversed that vote at the second. I am therefore not fighting something which I have not fought all along. I realized from the beginning that section 128 of the Constitution was not only not Democratic, but absolutely retrogressive. I fought it not because I had a stake in the country other than the interest which any man with a family has, but because I felt it my duty to defend the rights and liberties of the people. To show what a real referendum means, let me quote what has one been written on the subject by Nathan Cree, who was cited by Mr Isaacs during the discussion when the Constitution was first formulated. He saysDirect popular legislation, under proper modes and forms, is at once democratic nnd conservative. It accords with the tendencies and spirit of the time; it will , we think, prove to be a calming and a conservative institution. It will remedy some serious imperfections of our present system of law making, and some evils of our political life. Those evils are very prevalent in this discussion to-dayIt will abate the rigour of our party system, break the crushing and stifling power of our great party machines, and give freer play to the political ideas, aspirations, opinions, and feelings of the people. It will tend to relieve us from the dominance - of partisan passions, and have an elevating and educative influence upon the voters, by inducing them to consider measures upon their merits, as schemes of public policy, instead of as mere party proposals. Public spirit will thus be cultivated and intellectual exertion stimulated amongst the masses. That is the referendum that I advocateone that will tend to do away with party strife and party government as illustrated in this Parliament. But for party needs and party domination, the amendment of the Constitution now proposed would not have a chance of going through this Parliament. It is only because men are absolutely whipped into violating their own convictions in the interests of the Government that we must unfortunately look forward to a clause of this kind being carried within the next few hours. I have here a still higher authority in Lecky, who says on page 240 of his book, Democracy and LibertyI f the electorate is to judge policies, surely less likely to err if it judges them on a clear and distinct issue. In such a case it is most likely to act independently, and not at the dictation of party wire-pullers. It is to be remembered, too, that the referendum is not intended as a substitute for representative Government. All the advantages of parliamentary debate would still remain. PoUcies would not be thrown before the electorate in a crude, undigested, undeveloped state. All measures would still pass through Parliament, and the great majority would be finally decided by Parliament. It would only be' in a few cases, after a measure had been thoroughly discussed in all its bearings, after the two Houses had given their judgment, that the nation would .be called to adjudicate. The referendum would be an appeal from a party majority, probably made up of discordant groups, to the genuine opinion of the country, it would be an appeal on a question which had been thoroughly examined, and on which the nation had every means of arriving at a conclusion. It would be a clear and decisive verdict on .1 matter on which the two branches of the Legislature had differed. That, of course, refers to a true referendum, and not to a mockery and a fraud like that in our Constitution. What Lecky says is exemplified by the position here today. The Government are not anxious to have this question put to a referendum in the true sense of the word, by means of which the same power could undo the decision at a later day. They know that under our form of referendum, though a majority will decide whether or not the agreement shall be placed in the Constitution, a minority will be able to prevent its being taken out. That is contrary to the principle of a true referendum. It is not necessary to dilate further on the sound judgment qf the able writers I have quoted. This measure has been laid before honourable members in a most' unfair and inconsiderate fashion. We are compelled to stay here all night when we might very well have been permitted to adjourn. Such a procedure will not tend to facilitate the business of the Government; it never has done so in any Parliament I have known, and cannot have any other effect than to cause honourable members to take a more antagonistic view than they otherwise would of future measures. When I regard the Government's attitude, I feel like one prepared to almost do murder; because the Bill is one of the worse that could be inflicted upon a free people. It is of no use appealing to the Geovernment, however, because the Prime Minister is only doing what he is ordered to do. He is no more a free man than are some of those who follow him; and it is pitiable that an allit is important question of this kind cannot be decided on the independent votes of honourable members, without an obligation being cast on them by those who dominate their political future. In all Parliaments, such an undertaking as that given by the Prime Minister the other night to regard the division as a test one would be respected; and I think it was accepted in good faith by the honourable member for Mernda and others. However, the honourable member for Brisbane has returned, unfortunately for this country; and I say that without any disrespect to the man. It would have been a very small sacrifice if he had been detained, and the people saved from this legislation-greate r sacrifices have been made with less justification. The honourable member for Brisbane was taken into the Cabinet only at the last moment, and is obviously under an obligation to the Ministry. Such are the men who have to decide the destinies of this country, who are to jeopardize the welfare of our children, as well as of their own, by fettering them financially, not for a yea*- or two, but for all time! A big responsibility rests on the Government; but what do they care for responsibility ? Have they ever had any respect for principle. Did not the Prime Minister, not twelve months ago, enunciate opinions exactly opposite to those he holds now? The Prime Minister has supporters who have always.been his echo, and who follow him, as the faithful dog does its master, without any thought at all ; they feel their own Weakness, and seek all the shelter ' that he can afford them from the political winds that blow. The Prime Minister is the only membei of the Government who has spoken. Even the Postmaster-General, who is rightly regarded as a high Constitutional authority, and whose view we should like to hear, is not permitted to speak. Well I remember reading in the newspapers in p.re-Federal days, about the efforts made by the honourable gentleman to conduce to a decision of the momentous question which was then before the public. He, more probably than any other man, influenced the adoption of the method by which the question of Federation was settled. He insisted that Federation should be based upon the people's will, and that every man should have a vote. He was a. consistent Democrat at that time. But now he is a member of the party which says that the manhood of Australia shall not be permitted to decide this question. He would render it possible for a minority to overrule a majority of the electors of this country.",113
726,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the Federal Convention, I voted for the Braddon section ing made permanent.",115
727,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am astonished that the honourable gentleman should confess to that blemish on his own keenness of perception.,115
728,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Braddon section was approved by the people in that form.,115
729,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not by the people of all the States. What is more, I point out to the honourable gentleman that if the Braddon section in its original form had been adopted, we could not have paid old-age pensions. Before the expiration of ten years, the Commonwealth one-fourth nf Customs and Excise revenue would have been insufficient for our needs, and the Braddon section would have broken down.",115
730,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A referendum in regard to a proposed alteration of the Constitution could have been .taken ,115
731,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman's idea of Democratic government has become very dim. I am astonished that a man of his intelligence; who has written a treatise on the Constitution which is creditable to him and a guide, to us-that a man who has held such a prominent position as a Federalist-shoul d believe that the provision made in our Constitution for the holding of a referendum is of a - Democratic character when it means that 80,000 people can override 900,000. A man who calls that a Democratic provision is not to be trusted by the people. If he fell into so serious an error while he was young and his mind was still versatile, it is not wonderful that as a member of the present Government he should hold that the .people can secure an alteration of the Constitution by means of the provision contained within the four corners of that document. T. venture to say that had the Postmaster-General been a private member sitting in one of the corner seats we should have had from him a display of keen argument and oratorical effort in opposition to the proposal of the Government. But he dare not speak on this important question. We are now making history, but, unfortunately, we are making history that will not be creditable to us. We can only enter our protest against what is being done. But I may make this appeal to the Government. They might agree to adjourn this matter for three weeks. They have plenty of business to bring forward in the meantime. If they are anxious to secure an expression of opinion from all the members be- of this Chamber, why not grant an adjournment until a member of this Parliament who is at present absent from the country can be in attendance? The honourable member to whom I refer is one whom all. of us profess to respect. He is rightly regarded as a high authority. He is about to return to Australia, and will be in his place here in three weeks time.",115
732,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We want to close the session before three weeks are over.,115
733,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then it. is to be understood that we are not to be asked to do much more than bullock this measure through. A Government which would deprive a member of this Parliament of an opportunity of exercising his vote on so important a question make it plain that they are not anxious to secure a full expression of the opinion of honourable members. They brought forward other Bills pending the return of Colonel Foxton, and under the circumstances I think it is orily fair that they should consent to a short adjournment of this discussion to permit of the return of the honourable member for South Sydney, who ""is expected here within The next three weeks. Who would ever have imagined that the Commonwealth Government would be under the wing of Gregory Wade? A few years ago the idea would have been regarded as a preposterous one. To-day the position is a scandal. The Government are so indifferent to the rights of the Commonwealth as to permit themselves to be dictated to by Gregory Wade. Apparently they are not prepared to agree to an adjournment of the discussion to afford the honourable member for South Sydney an opportunity to express his views upon this question. They are not willing to low him to record his vote upon it. In the meantime we could proceed with other business. Why will the Government not tion. consent to an alternative proposal being put before the electors ? Why do they restrongest fuse to ask the electors, "" Are you in from ? favour of a permanent agreement or agreement which shall be limited years?"" Surely the Ministry can trust the people to decide as between an agreement toria. in perpetuity and an agreement for years.",115

735,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Prime Minister was very eloquent and emphatic upon the last occasion on which he addressed himself to this question, but the only point which he made was that we could trust people to settle it. By refusing to allow an alternative proposal to be put to the electors the Government give evidence they are not prepared to trust the people. I have no hesitation in saying that if alternative proposal were put before them they would declare themselves in favour a limitation of the agreement to ten years.",116

747,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not sure about that.

756,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay) [5.25 a.m.]. - As the Prime Minister is now present, may I point out to him that this is a matter of so much importance that the usual time and opportunity ought to be granted for discussing it in a rational way f I do not think that reasonable facilities have been afforded to Parliament to consider it. According to the Prime Minister's own statement, it is a matter of the greatest consequence to the Commonwealth. It is all important, not only to members of this Parliament, but perhaps also to generations yet unborn; but we are asked to rush it through without legitimate and reasonable criticism. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to smile, but they have got into a state of mind in which they do not desire discussion, or regard it as unnecessary. They do not wish light to be thrown on so important a matter, and think it a waste of time to do so, because they have some other object in view. The principle of Parliamentary representation, however, is deliberation upon all important matters, and I cannot do more than appeal to the Prime Minister to report progress until a later hour in the day, when the question may be more fully discussed, and honourable members will be more capable of doing justice to it. I had not an opportunity to address myself to the Prime Minister earlier in the evening on this matter. I remind him of his statement during the previous sitting, that he hoped that the matter would be brought to a conclusion at this sitting. Without a further word of explanation or intimation to this side, he determined to go on with it to the end, when he knew that the debate had not nearly been concluded. In the circumstances, does he intend to proceed ?",118
757,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [5.28 a.m.] - The question whether proposed this stage of the measure has been sufficiently debated is itself open to considerable deand bate ; but I think, with very little difference Of opinion. For the whole of the night ,£48,880,925; and yesterday we have debated, as it deAustralia, £14,414,100; served, practically one issue, the same that upon which we spent a good deal of £174,558,974, time last week. After all, this debate be partly, in fact almost wholly, judged toria, by the result of the second debate, which Australia, has not altered the position of a single member.",118
758,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely that is not the test of the utility of a debate ?,118
759,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was about to add that in the circumstances, this issue called for a second discussion. We have had that debate; and I venture to submit, looking at results, that so far as this Chamber is concerned, its mind is made up on the particular issue before us.",118
760,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What a miserable victory it is I,118
761,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That , also, is open to debate, if it were thought worthwhile. I think that it will appear to honourable members, on reflection, that we have now disposed of this part of the measure.",118
762,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There may be a difference three weeks hence.,118
763,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thre e weeks hence we ought to be closing the session.,118
764,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is this the end of this question ?,118
765,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope so. The proposition of the Leader of the Opposition is not one to be brushed aside lightly. His position and the seriousness of the question justify him in making it ; but on the other hand, he should consider the state of public business, the time of the session, and the fact that our differences have been, almost from the first, narrowed down to one; particular point, which we have now decided. If mv honourable friends weigh those circumstances against the considerations which they, have just urged, surely they will admit that the one counterbalances the other. In no spirit of unreasonable resistance, but as a deliberate judgment of my own, I submit that we have reached a stage both in the Bill and in the session, at which the least we can now do is to complete the work of this sitting by passing the rest of the Bill through Committee. MF. KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin) [5.33 a.m.] - I move That the .following words be added to new section 94B :- "" until such time as the Commonwealth shall have taken over relieved the various States of their existing national debts to the following extent, namely : - Ne w South Wales, £60,683,624; Victoria, Queensland, £23,492,050; South Western Australia, as £19,709,400; Tasmania, £7,378,875; total, and thus relieving the States annumav ally of the following amount of interest, namely :-Ne w South Wales, £2,123,927; Vic£1,710,832; Queensland, £822,222; South £504,493; Western Australia, £689,829; Tasmania, £258,261; total interest bill , £6,109,564, and annual sinking fund of £870,000, or a total of £6,979.564."" Earlier in the evening I explained that my desire was that the Commonwealth should take over £174,500,000 of the national debt to begin with, and make it Commonwealth stock, and that, on a basis of population of 6,104,564, it should put aside £870,000 a year out of the Consolidated Revenue as a. sinking fund to liquidate the debt in sixty years. The amendment involves a national banking system, because one would be useless without the other. Amendment negatived.",118
766,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne) [5-39]-- I move That the following new section be inserted after proposed new section 94B :"" Whenever one per cent, of the electors of Australia, by initiative, petition that the financial question shall be placed before the electors of Australia, on such being presented to the Prime Minister of the day, it shall be mandatory on the Government to place such question before the electors, and if such question be affirmed by a majority of the electors and a majority of the States, it shall be mandatory on the Government of the day to bring in a B i ll to carry out such affirmation."" This amendment means the initiative, which is necessary to make the referendum complete. The percentage of electors is different in Switzerland ; but I thought it wise to fix it here at 1 per cent., representing about 40,000 electors. There must be an officer to accept such a petition, and I propose to make him the Prime Minister of the day; and when the petition has been lodged, the Government must take steps to enable a clear referendum to be taken. With the splendid facilities presented by our Postal Department, we could, without any extra expense whatever, have the referendum votes collected, because there is not the absolute need for secrecy that there is in voting for a Parliamentary representative. Names of al! the electors appear, of course, on the rolls, and each could be easily supplied with a voting paper, and thus enabled to express his or her opinion. The amendment, so far as the nnancial question is concerned, would give the electors here the right that is enjoyed in Switzerland, namely, the right of the initiative. I should have preferred to make the amendment apply to the financial or any other question, but that, of course, would not be in order in this Bill. If this Chamber is Democratic, and honourable members possess the national instinct to promote the welfare of the country, it would be well, in the dying days of the last session of the third Parliament, to give this right to the Australian people. regard to the divisions that have been taken on this Bill, I am sure the Prime Minister, in his long political career, has never gone through a similar experience. He has never had to withstand such leading articles as have appeared in that splendidly equipped journal, the Age, which, while admitting his own innate ability, may be said to have enabled him to reach the position he occupies today. The leading article, even so late as today, must have caused the honourable gentleman to cast a glance back to past years, and to reflect how this newspaper-, in season and oiit of season, used to support him. There is no doubt that, if the Age had decided in favour of the referendum, when the Commonwealth was established, the Constitution petition would have been different today. As I gather that this is almost the last important measure that we shall deal with during the present session, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is not prepared to trust the people in the matter ? If not, it is all balderdash and nonsense to say that the Government are prepared to trust the people at all. My amendment affords a means of allowing the people to register their will more effectively than they can do in any other way. If the Prime Minister would give to the people of this country an opportunity of expressing their views by means of the referendum, he would add a glory to his name, which I should like to see him achieve, and it would be said of him in days to come that he really trusted his fellow Australians. Amendment negatived.",119
767,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay) [5.46 a.m.]. --There are one or two amendments which I should like to submit, dealing with points which have really not been considered in connection with the amendments upon which we have already voted. But it is quite evident that the Prime Minister desires to stifle discussion as far as possible. No question of such momentous importance has arisen before. The issue does not merely affect the present Parliament, but all succeeding Parliaments. I have never known such an important question to be treated in such a way by a Government majority which is gloriously uncertain, but which, because of its uncertainty, is. anxious to close debate. Quite a number of amendments might have been submitted, with the object of improving the proposals of the Government. If the matter under discussion were an ordinary one, we Having might look forward to having our fight over again after the next election. But it is not an ordinary question. This is the first really important .proposal to amend the Constitution that has come before the Federal Parliament. In my opinion, it has been treated in a manner quite out of keeping with the importance of it. I say, deliberately, that, in my opinion, discussion has been stifled by the manner in which business has been conducted. Other important matters are discussed for days at ordinary sittings, and no complaint is made.",119
768,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have been discussing this matter for weeks.,120
769,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nothin g of the kind. The honourable member, apparently,, thinks that because the Bill has stood upon the notice-paper for weeks, we have had weeks of discussion.",120
770,Dr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Look at the discussion we had on the motion for the second reading.,120
771,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There was practically no discussion on the motion for the second reading.,120
772,Dr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There were virtually second-reading speeches on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill.,120
773,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's interjections show that those who have made up their minds on this question have no clear recollection of what occurred. has corrected himself, and now. says that we' had a debate on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill. But in the House of Commons many important measures are discussed at length on the motion for leave to introduce. They are also discussed at the subsequent stages; and that in a Parliament which has a great deal more to do than we have. The point which I wish to make clear is that quite a number of amendments have been prepared; but I do not think that they can be submitted under present circumstances. ' To propose them might - seem to be an effective way of preventing the Bill from becoming law. I do not wish to have any misapprehension. and hope, that it may be possible to prevent the Bill from passing in this Parliament, so that the question may be submitted to the country as a political issue, enabling supporters of the Government to go before the electors and secure a mandate from them. At present the Government and their supporters have no mandate. There is not a single honourable member on the Government side who can claim that he has a mandate from the people to take proceedings for an alteration of the Constitution in the way proposed. Consequently, the Government have not the authority of the electors behind them. All that we ask is that they shall go before the electors, and then, if they can secure a majority, they will be entitled to rush through Parliament a Bill of this kind in their own way. At present, they have not such a mandate. If through any unfortunate circumstance at the next election the Government should secure a majority, it will be able-if its members do not alter their opinion againto claim in the next Parliament that effect should be given to the principle of this measure. What injury can be done to the States by. allowing the question to go to the people free from the embarrassments attaching to a constitutional referendum? It is not a light question. I feel that it is useless to appeal to honourable members who have made up their minds. They have acted as they have done, not because they had a mandate from the people, but because they have come to the conclusion that they can secure some advantage for themselves and their party. This procedure, however,-1 regard as a travesty on representative government. If a Government can come into office, and, by means of combinations formed outside, secure the passage of a Bill of this kind, then good-bye to the. representative system He of government. The weaker the men who occupy the chief positions in the Commonwealth, the more likely they are to be influenced by outside bodies, which, however important their positions may be, ought not to be allowed to influence the decisions of the Federal Parliament.",120
774,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sto p that miserable whine !,120
775,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Whine ? What is the idea in the mind of the Minister of Defence? Does he think that this is a personal matter? How can it affect me or the party to which I belong? The issue is not a social one, nor is it a political I think, issue in the ordinary sense of the term. Why should I whine about it? Why should any honourable member be interested in a proposal of this kind if he did not think the that it would inflict an absolute injustice upon the Commonwealth? It is quite true that if the people understood the question as we do, it would be determined very speedily. But it is not to be placed before them in a proper way, and when once the agreement has been embodied in the Constitution it may not be possible for a succeeding Parliament to undo the mischief. This is a matter which might be debated for months without the bounds of legitimate discussion being exceeded. In my opinion it ought not to be remitted to the people until after the electors? the next general election. In my view the wrong course has been taken in a vindictive and a mercenary way.",120

The honourable member has suggested that even after it ceased to be possible to affect opinion in this House, the discussion here ought to proceed with a view to the education of the public. Of course the effect of Parliamentary bate upon public discussion is sometimes enormous and must not be under-estimated. this one. But it has its limits, and, of course, Parliament has responsible and executive duties to discharge day by day. No Parliament known to a civilized country-and espetution is alteredcially a Parliament of this character even if it sat all the year round-coul d hope to make itself the single medium of discussion for the great problems which come before it. Qur part in discussion is to supply a lead- I should like to say to establish the tone and to put the public mind on the right track. But we cannot ignore the fact that the discussion proceeds every day in .the public press and between men interested in politics is that which finally decides the national will, though Parliament, it is to be hoped, will always give guidance and colour. The statement of the honourable member for Wide Bay that we might discuss this question for months is absolutely true, but would urge that any such discussion would be practically useless. We are here register decisions to the best of our ability. If the criticism offered in this Parliament were always strictly relevant to the matters in hand, we should have a great deal more time for effective legislation. is fhat honourable members frequently persist--ofte n from good motives-in discussing something else.

In the proposal to take over State debts there is nothing determined, except that their management, which at present rests with the several States, would under the Constitution be transferred to the Commonwealth, which would administer them all from one centre and with one control.

The first act of choice may be a determination on the part of the Commonwealth to aspaid sume the responsibility for the interest and principal,"" both of which under the Constitution will on the individual States, unless the Commonwealth deliberately and voluntarily sumes it. The other act of choice is the continuance of the payment of 25s. per head to the States, not for the period seventy or eighty years during which loans fall due, but probably for the period covered by three or four general to elections-that is from nine to twelve years. After that, perhaps, for ten or fifteen years later-o r it may be earlier special circumstances-the Commonwealth will decide anew whether it shall continue to make the payment of 25s. per head.

Mr .HENRY WILLIS (Robertson) [6.8 a.m.] - I think that the Prime Minister has not disposed of this very important question by his remarks. Some time ago, he gave the impression to the Committee- I know that he did to myself - that the provision for the payment of 25s. per head would be terminable on the liquidation of the State debts. But Mr. Wade had no doubt in his mind that it would be interminable, notwithstanding-the fact that the debts had been paid off. If a we have acted on the assumption that the per capita payment is to be terminable, is we have acted under a false impression.

No one will surrender a bond to allow of its conversion and lose by the transaction, unless he fears that the credit of the State which has given the bond is bad. If the credit of a State is good, no one who holds its debentures will accept less than par for them. No bond-holder would convert a good State bond into a good Commonwealth bond except on terms which would give the Commonwealth no advantage. The State bondholders in consenting to convert would require'the payment of the interest now given by the States, and, on maturity, the return of the full value of the bonds. could induce a bond-holder to consent to a reduction in interest on a security that was good?

817,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not by means clear that the Commonwealth bonds will be worth more than the State bonds while the credit of the States remains good, but there is a chance of it . and we ought try to realise benefits which it may possible to gain. The honourable member hopes that we shall be able to effect arrangement which will enable us to pay i per cent, to a sinking fund without ing anything more to pay in interest.",124
818,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the Commonwealth and safer view. credit will be, at least, \ . per cent, better in the average than that of States.",124
819,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Let us take that Had the position. Within the next ten years about £90,000,000 worth of State bonds will mature. One-quarter per cent, on that is about £ 2 3 0 , 0 0 0 . The honourable member therefore should not think that an enormous amount would be made out of the transaction at once, although it would be a good thing.",124
820,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A couple of million a year.,124
821,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But \ per cent, on a couple of millions is not very much. The main point, however, is that this clause does not relieve the States of one penny of responsibility for any debts taken over. We give the States nothing by it. We merely tell them that when we take over the debts we will pay their interest for them, but will charge it to them. We simply say, "" We will become your agent, butevery penny that we pay for you we shall charge against your 25s. fer cafita."" What Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) [6.27 a.m.]. - I do not want to be misunderstood. The right honourable member for East Sydney has missed the point - altogether. I have never agreed with his great discovery that by the Commonwealth making the whole of the debts Commonwealth stock the bondholders would get a great advantage on the existing But no stock. What is the difference between the 1 Commonwealth underwriting the debts now and saying that it will stand behind any State and protect its credit, and the Commonwealth coming to the conclusion that it will manage the stock and take possession of it as soon as it falls due? When is the right honourable member for East Sydney going to begin this operation?",124
822,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,As the debts f all due.,124
823,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . But would it make any difference whether the Comany monwealth declared for one stock now and took the debts over when they fell due, or claimed the power to negotiate for the conversion of those loans at any time? It to is quite true that, whether the States or be the Commonwealth pay, it will make very little difference to the bondholders, because an they know the credit of Australia is good enough and that they will be paid in full havby either authority. The honourable member for Mernda has taken a much broader He says we must begin to do something, but the right honourable the member for East Sydney says that we should cease to do anything.",124
824,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , I say begin with the first loan that falls due.",125
825,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are doing nothing from year to year, and now the right honourable member supports a proposition which puts aside the State debts question for an investigation while it allocates the revenue permanently, and makes the allocation mandatory. It is true that 25s. per capita can be credited by the Commonwealth at any time to the payment of interest towards the indebtedness of the States, but whenever the Commonwealth has taken over sufficient debts for the interest on them to absorb the sum which the Commonwealth allots to the States as a right, if then the Commonwealth by its improved credit can pay off that indebtedness, the States, and not the Commonwealth, will under this proposal of the Government get the benefit, and the Commonwealth become nothing more nor less than a glorified agency of the States. If it makes a profit, the States take it. If it makes a loss, the States have to bear it. That is not satisfactory. Yet that is not only proposed by the Government, but supported by the godfather of. this proposition.",125
826,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not the honourable member think we can discuss that question on the Bill dealing with the State debts? - ',125
827,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As soon as we raise an important issue affecting the standing of the Commonwealth and the position of the States, we are told that we ought to deal with the question on some other measure.",125
828,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All the powers that we have are in the Constitution.,125
829,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer must not think it is a pleasure to me to be continually inviting the attention, of honourable members to matters of this kind. The proposal of the Government and the Premiers of the States is to take away from the Federal Parliament that initiative and independence which is its undoubted right, and which the framers of the Constitution intended it to have. That power is to be delegated to the States, and all that the Commonwealth is asked to do is to act as a glorified agency the States. It is obvious that it can mean nothing else, although the Prime Minister shakes his head. If the Commonwealth makes a profit by means of its credit, it ought to be entitled to put that profit into now. a fund of its own, manage the debts, and wipe them off if it can - Mr.",125
830,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So it is.,125
831,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . The Premier of New South Wales said distinctly that it not mean that, and my reading of the proposal as a layman confirms his view. I certainly think that he has the law on his side. It is, however, no use in the present temper of the Committee to discuss - the matter at anv length or put it to a test.",125
832,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Flinders) [6.34 a.m.] - The amendment of the Constitution proposed in this section is undoubtedly, as the Prime Minister pointed out, merely consequential on what we have passed. But the consequences it involves are a good deal more important than the Prime Minister or the right honourable member for East Sydney have recognised. It is quite true that the effect of the clause is to take out one portion of section 105, and substitute for it another portion that has exactly the same meaning, only that it uses different language applicable to the new conditions. But I do not think the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition can be lightly dealt with, so far as this ""is a clause in a Bill containing the provision for the allocation of 25s. per head to the States, which we have just passed. It is undoubtedly true, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that the clause, taken in conjunction with the one giving a permanent and increasing endowment of 25s. per head to the States, has this effect: - When we take over the debts of the States, and when, we [propose to convfert those debts and create a Commonwealth stock, I quite agree, as the honourable member for East Sydney has said, that we shall not immediately derive any great benefit from' the lessening of the. interest. But when we establish a Commonwealth stock of any considerable extent, and it comes to be recognised as an important stock on the London money market-whe n it ultimately attains, as it ought to attain, the same position as the Canadian stock-w e ought to gain considerable advantage in the course of years. But the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that the benefits, when they come, will not accrue to the Commonwealth, but will accrue directly to the States. That is a of fact which, must not be forgotten, because it is of the utmost importance in connection with the vote we have 'just taken.",125
833,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the law W. H . IRVINE - But it is the law now in relation to a totally different arrangement. The clause, as it stands, did makes it the law for all time under the new agreement; and that is one of the momentous and unexpected consequences' we liked. . involved in the vote Ave have just cast.",125
834,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is exactly the ;Same position.,126
835,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I say that it is a totally different position; it is the provision, applicable to totally conditions.",126
836,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As there no surplus, we use the word "" charges.""",126
837,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cannot stop to repeat my arguments to the Treasurer, I think the Cpmmittee understands them. So far as the language of the clause is concerned, it has exactly meaning as the words we are leaving out of section 105, but it has we choose to add. tht same meaning as applied to a totally different set of facts, and, therefore, A totally different consequential result, I venture to say, which, if it were placed before half-a-dozen intelligent in the street, would be regarded with absolute amazement. If we asked the ordinary man in the street, whether he thought that, when the Commonwealth created a great Commonwealth stock, and, by its own exertions and its improved credit, decreased the interest payable on that stock, the whole benefit ought to accrue the States, he would certainly be surprised at the question. This is not a matter to lightly passed over; and I think we ought to discuss it now. It is important merely as a consequence of the vote already taken, and the Committee ought to realise fully - th/; consequences of that vote. those consequences is that not a penny benefit of the decreased interest will to the Commonwealth in any shape or form.",126

IRVINE - It is rather difficult, after a sitting of seventeen or eighteen hours, to 'enter on a discussion of a new and difficult constitutional point; and that difficulty is not at all decreased by the interjections of Ministers. Still, I think to we are called upon to deal with the matter and discuss it now. Let me point out clearly be that we are asked to definitely determine the conditions under which, if we assume the responsibility for the debts, those debts are to be taken over and to place those all conditions in the Constitution. We are One of asked to leave in the Constitution the provision that the States are to indemnify the accrue Commonwealth in respect of the interest, and we are asked to make a verbal alteration, and only a verbal alteration, in the other provision, which gives the Commonwealth the right to retain, out of the 25s. per head, the interest payable on the debts. the debts are converted and the benefits, have to which the honourable member for East it Sydney referred, are derived by our efforts and our improved credit, so the interest is decreased, and the amount, which we are is entitled to deduct from the 25s., is also detake creased. If the amount we are entitled to the deduct is decreased as the interest is decreased, it necessarily follows, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that the derive the whole of the benefit from - the conversion of the loans. Could anything a be simpler ? This is a consequential amend the ment, in the sense that, while it does innot alter the nature of the consequences which flow from the Braddon section, we, by a new disposition of the Braddon section, entirely alter the consequences. That cannot be disputed.",126
849,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I dispute every word the honourable member is saying!,127
850,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall be very glad if the honourable member can do so.,127
851,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I mean that I shall attempt to do so-that that is my view at present.,127
852,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What the honourable member has just said is the clearest evidence that this question ought to be discussed.,127
853,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The member has put his view most clearly. Mr W.' H . IRVINE - I will read the whole section, because the right honourable member says that he does not agree with Commonwealthmy interpretation of it. I do not for a Or moment pretend to infallibility on constiisamount tutional points or on any other points, but as the matter presents itself to my mind, I should have thought there was no doubt about the meaningThe Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at tablishment of the Commonwealth, or a pro-:wealth portion thereof, according to the respective numbers of their people. So far, the section leaves the 'Commonfit wealth absolutely at liberty at any time to take over the debts or any portion of them; or not to take them over. Then the section goes onAnd may convert, renew, or consolidate debts. As I understand, the "" conversion"" of debts means handing to the creditors other bonds instead of the bonds which they at .present hold; ""renewal"" is the same thing; ""conversion"" and ""consolidaCommonwealth. tion "" would involve paying off, issue of new bonds.",127
854,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That implies the willingness of the bond-holders to be off. Until then there is no conversion; then there is.,127
855,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The process of conversion may be pursued in various ways, and I express my concurrence with what benefit. the right honourable member has said on that point. . You may say to the bondorable holder, "" Are you prepared to give up your old State bond, and take a Comsection. monwealth bond instead?"" That way. It is a question of tween the Commonwealth and the creditor. Or you may wait until the maturity of the bond-holder's debt, and then pay him off. In order to pay him off, you may issue to the new set of creditors bonds for the whole amount, and may do that at a profit. Therefore, there can be no doubt as to the meaning of the section so far. It goes onAnd the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over. That is a condition which, as I understand it, makes the interest payable by the States even after renewal. Then the section goes onAnd thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained honourable from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States. That is to say, the interest is to be deducted from the moneys payable by the if such surplus is insufficient, or if there no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole shall be paid by the several States. That means that if the amount of interest payable in respect of a certain proportion of debts belonging to, say, the State of Victoria, and for which Victoria is rethe essponsible, is diminished by the Commonoperations of conversion, consolidation, or renewal, the benefit of that dimiinution of interest goes, and the beneof the reduction of the amount we are entitled to take from the States remains. If that be so, that provision, coupled with the provision we have already passed, that we are to pay 25s - per capita to the States, such and that we are to pay that continuously, means that any benefit which the Commonwealth may derive from its operations on the market-fro m the renewal or consolidation of the debts-is a benefit derived on behalf of the States, and not on behalf of the and the Sir GEORGE REID - As before.",127
856,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,As before; I quite agree. But the right honourable mempaid ber a few minutes ago said that he disagreed with everything I said. I want to find out where we disagree.,127
857,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I consider that the States will always be entitled to that,127

But I want to show what that impression was, and that, after all, it was not without foundation. to pay.

867,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The question a difficult one, and it is one which we should at all events endeavour monwealth to understand. I am very glad deed that I have the assent of the right honourable gentleman as to the constitutional position. Now, what I would ask the Committee to consider is this-Is there not a very material difference indeed between the position of a House of Parliament which has power to alteT the whole basis of Constitution. the distribution of revenue because of such a section, and the position of a House which parts with that power to alter distribution of revenue, when grappling with the same question?",128

But in my own scheme I stated that the Commonwealth ought to take over, and become responsible for, the debts of the States as they existed at the time of the establishment of the Federation.

895,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He is a""constitutional lawyer.",129
896,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But other qualifications are required in addition to a knowledge of the points which have been raised. instance, there is a knowledge of the history of the question. One proposal submitted at the Convention was that the State debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but at the instance of the honourable member for East Sydney that proposition was altered and made optional. But there was a guiding principle laid down, namely that the Commonwealth should take over the State debts wthout any indemnity from the States.",130
897,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But that proposal was not carried.,130
898,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of that. But it was part of an attempt which was made in advance to settle the financial question. There was a desire on the part of the delegates to the Federal Convention, that the States should receive a certain proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue. One means of insuring, that was that the Commonwealth should take over the whole liability for the State debts. was not adopted by the Convention. _ All that was done was to adopt a provision enabling the Commonwealth to take over the debts. There was no connection between the Braddon clause and the optional provision for taking over the debts, subject to an indemnity. If I wanted to strengthen that position more, I could show that it was pressed upon the Convention that it ought to provide for the Commonwealth assuming the liability without any indemnity, as a means of thus assuring a proportional charge on revenue to the States, and two analogies were pointed out, namely, the cases of America and Canada where that course was taken. It is a curious fact that in Canada, not only did they take over the whole of the debts without any recourse to the Provinces, but actually fixed the payments to the Provinces, showing that they did not regard their right to get a fair proportion of the revenue as having any connection with the debts whether there was any indemnity or not. When the first referendum was taken in New South Wales the people by a. majority accepted the Constitution with the so-called Braddon "" blot"" and the provision with reference to the debts. But it was not accepted by the required majority. There we had a popular acceptance of a fixed payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Ex[203]- 2 rise revenue for ever coupled with the very_ provis on which is now objected to by : For the honourable member for Flinders.",130
899,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That Bill was not carried.,130
900,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was carried by all the States except New South Wales. Here is a point to show how little the honourable member knows of what was in the mind of the Convention. When the Braddon clause was being altered to limit its operation to a period of ten years, was a single word said about a connection between the two provisions?",130
901,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,130
902,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Did the honourable member for Flinders oay a single word then about the alleged connection? No; he has found a mare's nest. So far from there being any connection in policy between this clause and other parts of the Bill, I do not believe that a single member of the Cabinet except myself saw the provision until it was printed - I was responsible for the drafting, and I put in this provision simply as a necessary draft- But it ing clause. The only alteration which has been made has been to put in the word ""charges,"" - because it is doubtful whether otherwise we could debit the States with the charges for conversion. Under the Bill the surplus revenue will be abolished, and therefore we had to change the terminology. Another section of the Constitution is proposed to be repealed, but this allusion is very pertinent to the observations of the honourable member for Flinders. It does not seem as if he quite realizes the force of the Bill. It seeks to repeal section 94, under which, although the Braddon provision may be abolished at the end of the year, we are under an obligation to pay the surplus revenue to the States. In future there will be no surplus payable to the States, so that we shall be absolutely independent in every sense of the term. For the last six or seven years we have been paying to the States a. surplus that we could not spend, and it may be that for some time to come, owing to our increasing Customs revenue, there will be a very large surplus which, were this section not repealed, would have to be handed to the States. Let me point out here, that for the last three or four years the stock of New South Wales of the same term, and carrying the same rate of interest, has stood better in the market than has been that of Canada. The honourable member for Flinders made a comparison between the value of Canadian stock and what we might hope to get for our stock. In the Convention I pointed out that it was folly to expect, perhaps for generations to come, a large saving on the issue of Commonwealth stock, because it will be found that even then-in 1898-Ne w South Wales stock was quite as good as the so called better-priced Canadian stock. My honourable friends on the other side, as well as some honourable members on my side, have talked much about the difficulty of altering the Constitution under a double referendum. In the first place, we have been very properly' told that it is the one taxpayer who in any event will be asked to re-apportion the revenue. It is rather impugning the intelligence of the electors of the small States to say that they would be utterly incapable of suffering anxiety for an amendment, when under this adjustment it may or may not be found that the States are getting much money which they do not require, and the Commonwealth too little. From the Swiss Constitution was taken the very provision which gives us a double referendum. Between 1874 and 1903 eleven amendments were carried under the double referendum, several of them involving large surrenders of revenue. They were not directly financial provisions, but they involved large sacrifices of revenue in connection with transfers from the Cantons. Since 1903 fundamental amendments have been carried under the Swiss double referendum involving an enormous sacrifice of power. That does not bear out the assertion that the States will never give up anything. We have heard a great deal about the States, but what are they? Are they not the people? In connection with amendments of the Constitution, we shall be dealing only with this Legislature and with the people.",130
903,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Flinders) [7.17 .i.m.] - The Attorney-General has said that I have changed my legal opinion upon this point in connection with my policy, which is rather a serious allegation.",131
904,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said "" as well as."" Afr. W. H . IRVINE - The facts are these: I wrote a paper which was put before the Hobart Conference, in which I submitted the view, which I subsequently expressed, that there are twp Wal interpretations which can be put upon the words ""take over""; that they may refer to a taking over by the Commonwealth as agent for the States, which would leave the Sta'.es the legal debtors, or that a novation may be contemplated, the Commonwealth becoming the debtor in place of the States. I expressed myself, though with some doubt, as rather in favour of the latter interpretation. That has nothing to do with the position'which I am taking now. Whether the legal relation of debtor and creditor is left unchanged so far as the States and those from whom they have borrowed are concerned, or whether the Commonwealth becomes the debtor, the financial results of any conversion will be the same. I merely - wish, to remove an impression which, being created by what has been said by the Attorney-General, might be injurious to me. Air. BATCHELOR (Boothby) [7.20 a.m.] - The interesting discussion which is taking place shows the desirability of an adjournment. Honourable members are not now in a fit state for work.",131
905,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This amendment is only consequential.,131
906,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but I raised - the matter on the second reading. Honourable members have quite different views as to whether the Commonwealth or the States would benefit by the conversion ot State stock into Commonwealth stock. The Treasurer stated that, even if the Commonwealth out of its own revenues established a sinking fund arid paid off the debts, it would make no difference.",131
907,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . 1 said that the States would indemnify the Commonwealth for any liability taken over, '.rhat is the whole point.",131
908,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It does not touch the point. It is generally understood by honourable members and State politicians with whom I have spoken that any saving made by the Commonwealth as the result of careful management after the conversion of State stock to Commonwealth stock would belong to the Commonwealth. That i« important in connection with the payment of 25s - per capita to the States.,131
909,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That might be an argument in favour of the Commonwealth paying the interest on the debts instead of so'much per capita, but we have decided the matter. Air. BATCHELOR - We have not taken a division on the question to which I am drawing attention. Aly view has been that if the Commonwealth takes over debts to a certain amount, and discharges all liat>ilities;, leaving the State assets free, it will ;get the advantage of any savings that it - may make.",131
910,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The States wil l be - responsible for every penny of the debts, although the Commonwealth may take them over. We do not relieve them of responsibility.",132
911,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When we have issued Commonwealth stork, we shall be - responsible for the payment of the debts.",132
912,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the States will also be responsible.,132
913,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the States which pay the money. Mr HENRY WILLIS . - It is the Commonwealth which will pay the money, and will he responsible.",132
914,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, the whole people pays and gets whatever advantage may accrue, but as between the Commonwealth and the States it seems to me that the Commonwealth, having the management of the debts, ought to be given a direct incentive to do its best, and should reap any benefits that may come from good management.",132
915,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member suggest that the Commonwealth might do its work badly if it werenot - making something out of the arrangement?,132
916,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not the point.,132
917,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The member seems to think of the States as foreign powers. He should study the question.,132
918,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Treasurer keeps repeating a parrot-cry as though it were an argument. The Government has done its best to prevent discussion.,132
919,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It wishes to run this measure through when men are exhausted.,132
920,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What we want to understand is the effect of this proposal, ancl who will reap the benefit of any savings made through conversions. It is a great pity that we should have to hurry over the matter at the end of an extremely long sitting - The proposal - ought to be discussed, and the people to understand it , because they have not understood it so far. When I raised the question in the House on a rjrevious occasion, every one present, except the Treasurer, took the same view as I did, so that, if there was any misconception, it was not confined to me. Since then. I have seen several discussions on the matter in the public press, and the idea that, after the Commonwealth had .paid off the national debt, possibly with its better credit, it should still go cn for all time paying to the States what it had previously paid to the creditor, h - ts been scouted everywhere.",132
921,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member would be absolutely right if the debt was paid off with Commonwealth money, but the fallacy of his argument is that it is the States which will pay it off with their own monev.",132
922,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not agree with the right honourable member. I do not feel disposed to continue the discussion now, but would urge the Government to report piogress, so that we can debate the matter when we are better able to deal with it. This clause offers the only opportunity tn discuss it in connection with the continuous payment of a fixed sum to the States.",132
923,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"East Sydney) [7.28 a.m.] - I should like to remove what seems to be a misconception in the matter. It the Commonwealth paid out of its Treasury any portion of the sinking fund, or the principal, or the interest, there would be a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Boothby, but it would not do so. The debt can be paid off only in two ways --by a sinking fund which gradually liquidates it, or by paying the principal when it becomes due. If it is done by a sinking fund, the annual contribution to that fund honourable comes, not from the Commonwealth funds, but from the funds of the States, and there can be no sinking fund unless a special agreement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States. The Constitution provides that if the Commonwealth does become responsible for the interest, the States are to be charged the amount, which it pays, so that, as the Leader of the Opposition said, the Commonwealth becomes a. kind of agent for the States in die matter. T corroborate the Attorney-General's remarks. All through the Convention the idea was that the States were to get the benefit of any transaction about the debts. There was no idea of the Commonwealth reaping the benefit.",132
924,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Onl y so far as the States' money was used.,132
925,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t me put the matter In a practical way. In the Constitution there is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States that the Commonwealth shall take the debts over. A loan, let us say, is to be floated at 3$ per cent, with a sinking fund of per cent. 1 All that money would have to come from the States. What position would the Commonwealth occupy in the estimation of the people if it demanded an advantage of a £ per cent, for itself from the States, on the ground that it had reduced the interest to per cent. ? That would be establishing a sort of money-lender relation between the Commonwealth and the States, which would shock the feelings of the people.",132
926,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was gested.,133
927,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the effect of it. If the Commonwealth received from the State only the 4 per cent, to cover the interest and sinking fund, it would get no advantage, because it would simply hand over the 3J per cent, interest to the my scheme comes in. bond-holder and invest the ^ per cent, towards meeting the principal. way by which the Commonwealth could sponsible get an advantage would be by devent, manding from the State an extra J per cent., in addition to the 4 per cent, for sinking fund and interest. fund after all only compels a State to pay to time. off its debt quicker than under the old arrangement. It is not an advantage a State to pay an extra J per cent..",133
928,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In other words, money. whoever provides the sinking fund must have the advantage of it.",133
929,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but there is rather a confusion of ideas, as though the sinking fund were provided by the of Commonwealth. It would be wrong expect the Commonwealth to provide it. would be burdening the Commonwealth with a liability which should not be placed upon it . This idea of an advantage through the Commonwealth taking charge of the State debts would always be more wealth. or less doubtful. There would always be a dispute between the Commonwealth State Treasurers as to whether the States could not have raised certain loans as cheaply as the Commonwealth did. State Treasurer would ask, "" Why charge me for a benefit which you allege has accrued, but which I say never accrued?"" That sort of thing might cause the most irritating conflict between the States and the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth would be put in the unlovely light of trying to make something out of the transaction. That would be fatal to good feeling between the two authorities.",133
930,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Supposin g a> loan were renewed at 4 per cent., and the State found that it could have borrowed at 3^ per cent. ?",133
931,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That would heighten the dis'satisfaction. I really feel: that this transaction is one in which the States pay the whole of the money. They pay. the interest, and, if there is a sinking, fund, they will have to pay more than they did previously, in order to wipe the debt not sugout. This they do with their own money. What have we to get out of that ? We cannot charge anything on the transaction. - The States have to find the money all the time, and, as they pay the interest, they have to pav the principal. Mr K ING O ' MALLEY - That is where",133
932,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It may. The The only man who pays the interest is always refor the principal, but if he is solthe principal is not required so long as the interest is paid. If it is desired,, and the debtor is solvent, the principal car* A sinking be renewed in the open market from time There'is very, little substance in the idea; and the Commonwealth would be to put in the position of huckstering over a State transaction in order to make a little That, of course, is benenth the dignity of the Commonwealth. Although we do not construe, the Constitution according to the discussions-in the Convention, I give the Committee my assurance that, all through, there was no idea the Commonwealth reaping any to pecuniary advantage. It was always held It out to the people of the States, as an inducement to Federation, that the Commonwealth would manage the loan business, and save the States much money, in consequence of the improved credit of the Common",133
933,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Was it intended and that afterwards there should be a Commonwealth stock, or that the Commonwealth should merely act as broker for the States? The",133
934,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The idea was that a Commonwealth stock would be of advantage to.the States, but we took care, in the Constitution, that the States should remain responsible. The man who has to pay the interest on a loan is responsible,, and not the banker who pays it for himAlthough the stock was to be in the name of the Commonwealth, the idea was that we would be doing for the States something they could not do for themselves.",133
935,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As a trustee for State. Sir GEORGE RE ID - Practicall y so. The States could attain that benefit only through the Commonwealth, and the idea was that one of the advantages of the Commonwealth would be the consolidation of the States debts, always making the States responsible for all liabilities in the shape of interest and sinking fund. As I say, the Commonwealth could not derive any pecuniary advantage, unless it added .another per cent, as a sort of charge; and such a project would be preposterous, placing the Commonwealth in a most ridiculous light. There would be endless disputations as to whether the State was really paying a lower rate of interest than it could have obtained for itself; and one of my reasons for supporting the payment of 25s. per head is that the Commonwealth and the State finances can be managed each on a. different basis. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [7.38 a.m.] - I remember when Sir Frederick Holder, at the Melbourne Convention, fought a battle all day in an endeavour to persuade the members of that Convention not to provide in the Constitution that the Commonwealth "" shall "" take over the debts, and how the honourable member for East Sydney, after the word had been inserted at the instigation of Sir George Turner, managed, by his wonderful eloquence, persuasive power, and domination over the assembly, to have the word removed. In the course of the speech which the right honourable member then made-and I may say that it had a wonderful effect on mehe said that, as the debts fell due, the Commonwealth would issue Commonwealth bonds or debentures, and, going to the creditors of the States, say, "" Here is a better security; what are you prepared to do?"" What is the benefit of the provision in the Constitution that the Commonwealth may take over the debts, if we do not go into the markets of the world and bargain to buy those debts as cheaply as possible for the benefit of the Australian' taxpayer? The Leader of the Opposition says that we shall make a great saving of at least £ per cent., but I think that there will be no such saving for many years to come, unless the Commonwealth and the States unitedly operate a banking institution. The six States will have to go into the market in competition with each other, and do the best they can in the redemption, the renewal, and conversion of their loans; and I venture to say that New South Wales and Victoria, with this provision for the payment of 25s. per head, would .be able to borrow money more cheaply in the London market than the Commonwealth could. I make that prediction, which I desire honourable members to note well, because later on I shall be saying, "" I told you so."" However, if the Government had the ability, and undertook the responsibility of tackling this question, as I propose-if they combined the taking over a certain amount of the debts and the institution of a National Bank-the y could carry on the States while the latter could watch the market in London, New York, or Paris, until they were able to borrow money at a low rate when there was a glut. There could, in this way, be a great saving, but, otherwise, there can be none. A saving of J per cent, on the total debt at present, would mean about ^600,000 a year. But there will be no \ per cent. Last year the Pennsylvania Railway Company, of the TJnited States, went into the Parismarket, and borrowed at 2f per cent, at par; whilst the big State of New South Wales sold her bonds on the London market at £ f i per £,100 below par. The honourable member for Flinders is one of the recognised constitutional lawyers of the Commonwealth. He appears in nearly every great constitutional case. He stands up and points out what this provision means. Yet laymen, who know less about the Constitution than a one-eyed bat knows about past centuries, absolutely contradict him and question his constitutional advice.",134
936,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it only right to say that I defer entirely to the opinion expressed by the members of the Convention as to the intentions of the framers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Ha d I been able to persuade honourable members to listen to me, I could have shown them w'hat I believe to be the only way out of this tremendous sea of financial trouble into which we are getting. I have pointed out the only method of salvation. By putting this 25s - per capita provision in the Constitution, the Commonwealth will - only be half a revenue controller. It will control only £ 1 4s. 6d per head of the revenue .from Customs and Excise. . In other words, this Parliament will be only a manager or collector or agent or messenger bov for the States to collect for and distribute to them J £ I 5s. per head - per capita for all eternitv. Mr HENRY * WILLIS (Robertson) [7.50 a.m.] - The right honourable member for East Sydney has made it clear that there is a great deal in the contention of the Leader of the Opposition, who has shown that the Commonwealth takes its own responsibility in paying off debts which are a charge against a State. If a State provides a sinking fund in connection with its debts, it will be entitled to the because it will find the money to liquidate its own debts. But if we establish a sinking fund without consulting the States, we do it at our risk, and have to take the responsibility. We must still continue to pay the 25s. per head till the Constitution is altered.",134
937,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes . but we shall not be such fools as to provide a sinking fund without making an arrangement with the States.,135
938,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We should indeed be foolish to do so. The only State, so far as I know, that has a satisfactory sinking fund is Western Australia. Other States have their sinking funds, but occasionally absorb them. Suppose that in the interest of Australia the Commonwealth Parliament said that the debts ought to be liquidated by establishing a sinking fund. Even so, we could not establish such a fund without consulting the States; or if we did we must continue paying them 25s. per head. This is not a satisfactory position. It means that we have to go to the States and get their consent to the establishment of a sinking fund. Leader of the Opposition has, therefore, made it clear that there is a very great deal in his contention that we cannot move without the consent of the States'. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [7.54 a.m.] - After listening to the speech^ of the right honourable member for East Sydney, I desire to say that he has converted me on one point, at all events. He has conveyed to my mind a different impression from that which I formerly entertained. Of course, he speaks as a member of the Convention, and one of its leading members. He tells us what the members of the Convention contemplated, namely, that the benefit of the conversion and renewal of loans should go to the States, and not to the Commonwealth. I must fully accept that assurance, and I do accept it.",135
939,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Cook) [7.55 a.m.]. - On a question like this, which I am sure no honourable member understands too well, it is much to be regretted that the Government should persist in pushing forward the measure after we have been sitting in this chamber over twenty hours.",135
940,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They did not wish to attend a Governor General's ball, otherwise they would have consented to an adjournment of the debate at 10 o'clock last night.",135
941,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-We find the honourable member for East Sydney, the honor25s., able member for Flinders, and the Attorney-General, three constitutional authorities, differing amongst themselves as to the effect of this clause.",135
942,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not of this clause.,135
943,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It appeared a little while ago that there was some room for a difference of opinion amongst them. Yet the. Government expect honourable members who have not Had a legal training to deal with this question after a sitting which has already extended almost twenty-four hours. This is another instance of the way in which the Ministry are prepared to sacrifice the powers and privileges of the Commonwealth. They are quite willing to make this Parliament subservient to the Parliaments of the States. "" He that is servant amongst you is greatest of all "" appears to be their doctrine. Evidently they think that the way to become great is to allow the Commonwealth to fetch and carry for the States. The position of this Parliament is being absolutely degraded by them. Under our Constitution, the Commonwealth next year would have been able to exercise supreme control over the Customs and ExThe cise revenue.. Before the powers and privileges of the Commonwealth in respect of surplus revenue were bartered away, this Parliament possessed certain powers in regard to the transfer of the State debts. But now that we have sacrificed our constitutional powers, the Government tell us that' they are merely proposing a continuation of the policy which was decided upon by the 1 Federal Convention, and that, in reality, this proposal represents only a consequential amendment. Section 87 of our Constitution provides that certain revenues may be allocated towards the payment of interest upon the State debts for a period of ten years, after which the section is inapplicable. But under this Bill, we are asked - to return to the States a contribution of 2 53. per capita in perpetuity. If the Commonwealth takes over some of the State debts, and this 25s. per capita is allocated towards; the payment of interest upon those debts, we shall absolutely tie the hands of the Commonwealth for all time, and we shall be prevented from reconsidering that payment. Thus, any alteration of the Constitution - will be rendered impossible. I have not read the debates of the' Federal Convention very closely, but I do not know what was in the minds of the delegates in regard to the policy which should be adopted by the - Commonwealth in respect of the consolidation of the State debts. I certainly understood that the Commonwealth would be able to take over those debts, to manage them .in the way that it thought best, to allocate, any saving of interest which might be effected"" to a sinking fund, and thus, in a - certain number of years to liquidate them. But I now find that no such proposal is placed before us. We are merely asked to continue a large public debt, ancl to sanction the heavy drain which must be made upon the labour of Australia to pay interest «ipon it. I view the situation with the - utmost dismay. It comes to me as a tremendous shock.",135
944,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is awful.,136
945,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, it is not awful to the Minister of Defence, who entered political life with the idea of doing some good for his fellows. I did hope that it would be possible for the Commonwealth to establish a National Bank jointly owned by the Commonwealth and"" the States, which might .handle the State debts, effect enormous savings, and provide a sinking fund for their liquidation in a comparatively short period. But the temporary arrangement which was made in the Constitution for dealing with the surplus revenue is sought to be perpetuated, the Commonwealth, is simply to handle the State debts as a kind of head clerk for the States, and the hope of many persons that uncler Commonwealth management the State debts might be extinguished in the course of a few years is to be disappointed. I have collected some data with the intention of dealing with this question at the first available opportunity, but after having been in attendance here for nearly twenty-two hours, I am not in a condition to do so. We were charged 'by our constituents with grave responsibilities, and we have been endeavouring to discharge our duty to the best of our abilitv. But the Government have decided to make this dual inequitable arrangement with the States,, no matter what views ftonorable members on this side may hold with regard to dealing with the public debts. All that they are concerned about is to get this wretched agreement put through.",136
946,Mr THOMAS BKOWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Argus says that there is a price behind the agreement-the support of the State Premiers and the State politicians.,136
947,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It appears that there is some price behind the agreement. One can hardly imagine public men in their senses adopting the attitude which has been taken up by the Government. Unhappily, we are on the eve of a general election, and their brainy supporters dare not press their views on this subject for fear pf encountering Ministerial opposition at the polls. This great question has been dealt with in a disgraceful manner. It is deplorable to think that the business of the House is conducted in such a way by the Government that honourable members who have placed before their constituents their ideas on questions of reform; have not an opportunity of intelligently dealing with them. I can only enter a protest against the Government proceeding with the Bill under existing conditions, but I trust that when the people get an opportunity at the ballot-box they will take drastic action to return to this House Nationalists, instead of the petty, parcchial-minded Constitution wreckers who now occupy the Treasury benches.",136
948,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay) [8.12 a.m.] The honourable member for East Sydney has explained that the intention of the draftsmen of the Constitution with regard to the taking over of the State debts was that any monetary benefit which might accrue through the action of the Commonwealth in dealing with stock should be credited to the States concerned, not to the Commonwealth.",136
949,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not see how you could derive a benefit.,136
950,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right honourable gentleman said that that was the opinion of the representatives of the people in the Convention. . Sir GEORGE REID - I put it in that way.,136
951,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I was impressed by the fact that that statement seriously influenced the judgment of the honourable member for Flinders on this very point. I ask him to apply his mind to the question of a Commonwealth stock in that connection.,136
952,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is the part which troubles me most of all.,136
953,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What was the idea in mentioning a Commonwealth stock and a Commonwealth credit if it was intended that the Commonwealth Government should simply act as an agency of the various States? Let me examine the question on its merits apart from the statement to which I have referred. Here is a Commonwealth credit which, in my opinion, would be better than the credit of an individual State. It may or it may not be, but that does not affect the question.",137
954,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the money to pay interest and establish a sinking fund will be provided by an authority other than the Commonwealth. In that sense it will not be Commonwealth stock.,137
955,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Coul d the Commonwealth borrow without an application from a State? If the Commonwealth were to borrow largely, in anticipation of the demands of the States, and at a rate of interest lower than that at which they could borrow individually, would it be. bound to let them have the money at. the rate of interest at which it borrowed?",137
956,Sir GEORGE REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Commonwealth borrowing would be for a definite Commonwealth purpose, and the money borrowed could not be applied to any other purpose. Money borrowed for the construction of a railway to Western Australia could not be handed over to the States.",137
957,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honourable member does.not follow me. If the members of the Convention, thought as the right honourable member does, they should not have spoken of a ""Commonwealth' ' stock. Assuming that ^20,000,000 worth of State loans fell due in five years time, and that the Commonwealth, desiring to benefit the people, authorized the borrowing of an equivalent amount, obtaining it at a lower rate than the States could individually borrow at, would it have to hand the money over to the States at that rate? Where the Commonwealth credit is obviously better than the State credit, which will benefit, the Commonwealth or the States? Is the Commonwealth to take all the risks of these transactions and the States to get the benefits? The whole arrangement seems to be ill-digested. Apparently it will be necessary that the money borrowed by the Commonwealth on behalf of a State shall be borrowed in the name of that State. According to the right honourable member for East Sydney, the Commonwealth will have to give reasons for the loans which it raises, specifying that it is 1 borrowing on behalf of New South Wales, Victoria, or some other State, and the States will have to be credited and debited accordingly. Under this system money may be borrowed at different rates of interest at practically the same time. If separate loans were floated on behalf of two or more States, they might be raised, at different rates of interest, and the States concerned would be credited and debited accordingly. If that is the view which wastaken at the Convention, 'it is a very narrow and unsatisfactory one, and evidences much short-sightedness. I never heard it stated before. The view which I have always heard advocated is that there would be a Commonwealth stock-that the Commonwealth would take over the debts of the States and be responsible for principal and interest, improving the credit of Australia by substituting one stock for many. I think that is the generally held view. Now we are told by the honourable member for East Sydney that the Commonwealth is merely to be an agent between lenders and the borrowing States. If that is so, the arrangement will not accomplish what the people had in their minds when voting for the Constitution.",137
958,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The view came as a surprise to me, but I am afraid that it expresses what is embodied in the Constitution.",137
959,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Honourable members will see that the questions which I am asking strike at the very root of progress ir* - this matter. Apparently the Commonwealthcould do nothing without the leave of the States. On that point I should like to say a great deal, but this is not the time to doso. The right honourable member for East Svdney said that the establishment of a sinking fund might deprive the borrower of monev which he might need to meet his necessities.",137
960,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not provide in this clause for a sinking fund?,137
961,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That would be possible. It seems to me that those who aregetting the immediate benefit of a loan should provide for its ultimate repayment. Economy is a virtue which should be morepractised in Australia. We are now in a time of - unexampled prosperity, and nodoubt people are ready to borrow without .making provision for repayment, but thetime will come, as it has come before, whennature will be less bountiful, and credit will be scarce. Then it will, be regretted - that a sinking fund was not provided when - times were good. However, the temper of the Committee is such that it is not worthwhile to discuss these matters now. The -(juiernment is determined to push the measure through. We - may have another opportunity for the discussion. are many points which do not strike one's attention until debate . has commenced, and the discussion of serious problems - like this gives information and experience that can have but one result-the advancement of the best interests of the people of. the Commonwealth. I shall advise my friends not to take any - divisions, but to allow the Bill to go through Committee as the Government have brought it in, as we cannot get a reasonable opportunity to discuss it or submit amendments. There will be a further opportunity to consider the main question at a later stage. Clause agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment. SUPPLY BILL (No. 4). Bill returned from Senate without request. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",137
962,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [8.27 a.m.] - We have had a protracted and trying sitting, and in the .circumstances I propose, with the consent of honourable members, to ask the House to take a rather longer adjournment than is usual. In ordinary circumstances under the new sessional order we should meet at n o'clock. I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 3 o'clock p.m. this day. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. HANSARD STAFF. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",138
963,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [8.28 a.m.] It struck me in listening to the debate during the whole of last night that special consideration ought to be paid on this occasion to the Hansard, staff. The debate has not been an ordinary one. In fact, it has been a very heavy one, and I could not help feeling the sincerest sympathy with those officers in having to keep in constant touch with an exceedingly difficult debate all through the long hours of yesterday morning, afternoon, and evening and early this morning. I hope that particular attention will be given to the matter.",138
964,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne) [8.29 a.m.]. - I should like to bring under your notice There also, sir, the fact that certain officers connected with the Hansard staff are not permanently employed. Wc surely ought to see if we cannot do something for them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.30 a.m. (Thursday).",138
