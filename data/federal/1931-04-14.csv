2,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [3.2] - by leave-In August of last year the Sugar Inquiry Committee was constituted for the purpose of investigating every phase of the Australian sugar industry-the growing of sugar-cane, its manufacture into raw sugar and then into refined sugar, and the various means of making the finished products available to consumers. Pourteen separate terms of reference were laid down for the attention of the committee. ton The committee commenced its work on the 15th October last, and its reports were made finally handed to the Government on the 26th March, and were laid on the the House on the same day. The Government has since given careful consideration to the several reports received. committee was unanimous on seven be subjects. The majority and minority reports both recommended the coneach oftinuance of the sugar agreement for five years from the 1st September next, and are practically in agreement in their views on efficiency and possible economies in sugar production. In regard to the remaining subjects to dealt with in the separate reports, the following summary of the recommendarebate tions made will indicate the different conclusions arrived at. The majority report recommends1. The embargo should continue to renewed indefinitely, subject guards from time to time for the various classes of consumers in relation to manufacturing and retail selling prices and to effective control of production. 2. The next sugar agreement should operate for five years from the 1st September, 1931. 3. The present selling prices and distributing margins for sugar, golden syrup and treacle should continue for the first three years of the new agreement. 4. An allowance of 4s. 9d. per ton should be made to Hobart purchasers in order to remove certain disabilities existing in that city as compared with other capital cities-provide d this allowance is passed on by wholesale merchants to their customers. 5. The special relationship between the soft fruit s industry and sugar costs, together with the depressed position of the soft f r u it s industry, justify the present assistance from the sugar industry of approximately £205,000 per annum being increased to £315,000 per annum for the next three years, subject to the conditions set out in the majority report. G. Sugar prices and the f r u it concession should be reviewed by the Commonwealth Government at the end of the first three years in the light of the circumstances then existing, and be so determined for the last two years of the new agreement. 7. There is no justification for any further increase in the Australian production for many years, and every effort should be made by the authorities to keep production within the present limits. The m in o r it y report recommends1. The sugar industry should take definite steps to reduce the unprofitable surplus production. 2. The present prices to Australian consumers should be reduced by £2 6s. 8d. per (or i d . per lb.) for the two years ending the 31st August, 1933, by which time a review of the conditions of the industry should be by the Commonwealth Government with a view to determining the practicability of a table of further reduction in price. 3. The responsibility of seeing that the proposed reduction is passed on to domestic conThe sumers by wholesale and retail distributors to placed on the sugar industry by a definite provision in any new agreement. 4. A committee comprised of a representative (a) The Commonwealth Government; (6) The Queensland Sugar Board; (c) The proprietary f r u it processors; (d) The co-operative f r u it processors; (e) The proprietary fruit-growers; (/) The co-operative fruit-growers, be established for the purpose of disbursing the present home consumption fruit-processing of £6 Ss. I d . per ton, together with the proposed reduction of £2 6s. 8d. With regard to those portions of the report upon which the committee was be unanimous, the actual recommendations to proper safewere as follow:NA STJQAB INDUSTRY. The committee recommends that the wages and conditions of employment of all persons employed in any industry receiving any direct benefit as a result of the sugar agreement (i.e., sugar and f r u it industries), should be fixed by arbitration, and that, in the case of any employees or section of employees, who are now, or who may subsequently be, removed from the operation of any existing tribunal, the Commonwealth Government should establish a suitable tribunal for the purpose of fixing the wages and conditions of employment for such employees. A LIEN PENETRATION INTO THE SUGAR INDUSTRY. Only 10.1 per cent, of wholly foreign persons are engaged in all phases of the industry; there are also 10.1 per cent, of naturalized British subjects. The whole problem is passing through a transition stage, and satisfactory communities will eventually be evolved. The committee agrees with a continuation of the policy of the Commonwealth Government (in co-operation with the foreign Governments concerned) that visas shall be granted only in respect of female relatives or fathers or sons of aliens already residing in Australia. THE UTILIZATION OF SUGAR BY-PRODUCTS. Every possible avenue has been exploited for the utilization of by-products, but so far there is nothing to indicate, on the information now available, that the costs of sugar production can be further lowered by the exploitation of by-products. should not deter the industry from making further investigations. The committee recommends that the Queensland Government, in co-operation with the sugar industry, should examine the position regarding recent experiments in the use of "" B "" sugar syrups for the manufacture of power alcohol, and, if the economics are sound, that the Queensland Government endeavour to secure the co-operation of the suppliers of petrol in arranging for distribution (i.e., of a composite motor f u e l ). THE VALU ES OF LAND USED FOR SUGARThe whole committee has accepted, for costing purposes, average values under £30 per acre, which are distinctly moderate. There is no advantage to be derived from the manufacture and marketing of mill-white sugar under Australian conditions. SUCHAB PROCESS OF MANUFACTURIN G SUGAR. Technical experts advised the committee that savings in costs are not likely under Australian conditions by making Suchar sugar. The committee suggests that, on the occasion of the next visit abroad of a Queensland Government technical officer, the officer should make full inquiries into the Suchar and any other processes regarding raw and refined sugars that arc claimed to have advantages over the present methods. Taking the unanimous reports first, I have to announce that the Government has approved of all the recommendations made. However, in regard to the recommendation that the wages and conditions of employment of all persons employed in any industry receiving any direct benefit as a result of the sugar agreement, that is, the sugar and fruit industries, shall be fixed by arbitration, it has been decided that the principle of preference to unionists, which now exists under the. law, must be maintained. Ifr. Scullin. Coming now to the majority and minority reports, it will be seen from the two lists of recommendations that I have quoted that there is a difference of only i i . per lb. in the proposed selling price for the first portion of the new agreement. On the other hand, it is important to note that the minority members consider that the sugar industry should take definite steps to reduce the surplus production, whilst the majority members, although urging that production should not be allowed further to increase, take the view that an arbitrary reduction to home consumption requirements would result in certain disadvantages that would nullify the reduction of However, this Jd. per lb. in the local price so made possible. Shortly put, the two differing reports may be said to turn on the issue of over-production. The minority report does not indicate how the reduction in production should be effected, what the extent of the reduction should be, or the amount per annum, nor does it offer any advice on the all-important question of the absorption into other vocations of the very large number of surplus sugar growers and workers, and persons inGROWINQ. directly employed. After an exhaustive review of the whole situation-the present urgent MILL - WHITE SUGAR. necessity for retaining the £2,000,000 credits in London derived from exported sugar, the undesirability of increasing unemployment in the far north and of throwing probably 120,000 acres of land out of cultivation, and the fact that practically every other primary industry into which the dispossessed sugar-growers and workers might enter is also over-producing and exporting its surplus at less than the Australian price-the Government has decided that, in the public interest generally, its sugar policy cannot be based upon reduced production. The direct saving to local consumers, if over-production were completely eliminated, would be not more than - Jd. per lb., or about £1,500,000 per annum, or only 4s. 7d. per annum per person. This extra charge provides employment for 14,000 individuals, and a living for about 60,000 with wives and families. But the charge is equalized by the introduction of approximately £2,000,000 per annum from the sale of surplus sugar, most of which amount finds its way to the southern States for the purchase of groceries, clothing, boots, implements and a multitude of other protected commodities, thus returning indirectly to the main body of consumers, in wages and profits on the goods sold to the sugar producers, what those consumers lose directly in the price of sugar. The immediate reduction of i d . per lb. in the selling price of refined sugar, as recommended by the minority members of the Sugar Inquiry Committee, is based upon their finding of £18 7s. per ton as the present cost of producing raw sugar. The majority members fix the cost of production at £22 7s. 9d. per ton. The return on raw sugar for 1930, was £18 17s. 6d. per ton, and is not likely to be greater for the coming season. A reduction of i d . per lb - whic h is £2 6s. 8d. per ton-woul d thus clearly result in a loss to sugar producers. After analysing the two reports and the situation generally, the Government is of opinion that the majority figure of £22 7s. 9d. per ton must be substantially accepted as the cost of production. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, the Government has decided to renew the Sugar Agreement and embargo for five years from the 1st September, 1931, on the following conditions:1. The present selling prices of sugar to be continued for the first three years; 2. The f r u it industry assistance plan recommended in the majority report to operate for the first three years; 3. The selling prices of sugar and related conditions, and the f r u it industry assistance plan to be reviewed before the end of the three years in the light of the circumstances then existing, and be so determined for the last two years of the agreement; 4. Award conditions and preference to unionists to bo continued in respect of any industry receiving direct benefits under the Sugar Agreement; 5. An allowance of 4s. 9d. por ton to be made on sugar sold in Hobart, to cover certain disabilities existing in that city as compared with other capital cities-provide d that this allowance is passed on by wholesale merchants to retail grocers; 6. The present arrangements, for the supply of extra sugar to Hobart purchasers under guarantee-wit h the view of ensuring adequate supplies against emergencies-to be continued; but if any shortage of sugar should occur in Hobart, and the Commonwealth Government finds that it is not due to Hobart purchasers making insufficient use of the guarantee system, the Government may call upon the Queensland Government to establish a sugar depot at Hobart; 7. Every effort to be made by the authorities concerned in Queensland and New South Wales to keep the production of sugar within the present limits, and the assignment of sugar lands and the peak year system to be rigidly administered to this end; 8. In order to adjust as equitably as possible the position which would arise from any alteration in the present volume of production, sugar wages and conditions, or the value of export surplus sugar during the currency of the new agreement, the following plan will operate:(a) an average price of £22 per ton for raw sugar w i ll be taken as the approved maximum basic return on an annual production of 500,000 tons or over for the purpose of the following adjustments: (6) for every 10,000 tons by which the total production falls below 500,000 tons per annum, the maximum basic price of £22 will be increased by Is. 3d. per ton to a l i m it of £23 per ton for the estimated Australian requirements of 340,000 tons-this adjustment being on account of the larger overhead costs that occur when the volume of production is reduced; (e) Tho basic price or prices so calculated will be varied each season to the extent of any alteration in sugar wages or working hours made after March, 1931. Any such price variations will be calculated on the present wages proportion of 55 per cent, of an estimated present bare cost of £18 5s. for producing raw sugar (i.e., including depreciation but excluding interest on capital). {d) A trust account under the joint control of the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will be created. Each season, this account will be credited, on behalf of sugar consumers, with an amount equal to the excess return, if any, on raw sugar to the producers over and above the maximum basic price for the season calculated as just described; or the account will be debited, on behalf of the sugar producers, with any deficiency in the actual return for raw sugar below the maximum basic price so calculated. An amount equal to the net surplus in the account at the end of any season to be made available by the Queensland Sugar Board for investment as approved by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments, and to be held until there is sufficient money available to permit of an effective reduction (say i d . per lb.) in the price of sugar being passed on to manufacturing and domestic coni Burners.",10
3,Mr LATHAM,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Immediatel y before the House met, I received a printed document entitled "" The Majority Report of the Sugar Inquiry Committee""; it does not include the minority report. I ask the Prime Minister whether the minority report will be made available to honourable members, and whether that will be bound up with the majority report?",13
4,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"I issued the instruction that Doth the majority and the minority reports should be printed and distributed to honourable members, and was unaware that the minority report had not been sent to honourable members.",13
5,Mr LATHAM,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,It is not included in the document that I have received.,13
6,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,I shall ascertain the cause of the delay in printing both reports and distributing them to honourable members.,13
7,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,Will an opportunity be given to honourable members to discuss the statement of the Prime Minister in respect of the Bugar agreement?,13
8,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,I cannot say exactly when an opportunity will be given to discuss that subject; but I hope that it will be given soon. Honourable members can materially assist in that direction by facilitating the passage of measures before this House.,13
9,Mr NAIRN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he has not overlooked an undertaking given to this House on the 18th March, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Barker?",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,It is not in order to ask a question based upon another question asked earlier in the session.,13
11,Mr NAIRN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"I shall put my question in another form. Did not the Prime Minister on the 18th March last, give an undertaking to this House that before any agreement was arrived at on the question of sugar, the report of the committee of inquiry would be laid upon the table of the House and a full opportunity given to honourable members to discuss it? If the Prime Minister gave such an undertaking, why was it not honored before the Government came to any decision on the matter?",13
12,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Eve r since the sugar agreement has been in existence, the Government has taken the responsibility for its decisions regarding it. Never before has an opportunity been given to the House to discuss this question, but this Government is now proposing to make such an opportunity available. The agreement has not yet been made, but the Government has placed its decision before the House in the same way as it would place a bill before the House. It must have a policy when it meets the House.",13
13,Mr GULLETT,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,Has the Government any policy?,13
14,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Ye s it has, and the Labour party is the only partyin this House with a policy. The policy of the Government regarding the sugar agreement is contained in the statement that I have given to the House.",13
15,Mr NAIRN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,That statement is the determination of the Government.,13
16,Mr SCULLIN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"It is the determination of the Government, just as the provisions of any bill introduced into this House embody the determination of the Government, and the House will be given an opportunity to discuss this determination of the Government, and to vote upon it. PEARL SHELL.",13
17,Mr NELSON,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Will the proposed ordinance, to limit the output of pearl shell in North Australia, have legal effect in Queensland and Western Australia; if not, what action are the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia taking to restrict the output of pearl shell in those States?",13
18,Mr BLAKELEY,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Some time ago the Government of Western Australia, the Pearl Shellers Association of Broome, and the Pearl Getters Association of Thursday Island made representations to the Commonwealth Government, asking that the output of shell in Australia be limited. The Commonwealth Government has no power to regulate the industry at Broome and Thursday Island, but I entered into prolonged negotiations with the Darwin Pearl Shell Getters in an endeavour to persuade them to arrive at some decision to restrict the output of pearl shell, and they refused to do so. I was therefore compelled to issue an ordinance to deal with the matter, but it applies only - to Worth Australia; it has no legal application to either Western Australia or Queensland. Definite steps, however, have been taken at both Thursof day Island and Broome to bring about such a restriction. That action has ready had the effect of increasing the price of pearl shell by £10 a ton. SALES TAX .",13
19,Mr WATKINS,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Is the Treasurer far reaching. aware that the sales tax which, I take it, waa intended simply to tax imported and other manufactures at the source, is now being charged in bills issued by retailers, thus placing the tax on the person who buys the goods.",14

Melbourne Argus to have saidThe Baving effected on Monday amounted about £1,750, and a similar saving would from each of the other three holidays that had been scheduled. Will the Postmaster-General say whether the Postal Union asked for this action be taken; will he state how the saving stated to bave been effected is made up, and whether it compensates for the creased inconvenience to the community and the less efficient postal service?",14
22,Mr A GREEN,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"If the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper, I shall give him a specific reply to it. The press statement to the them. effect that the saving amounted to £1,750 in one State in one day was incorrect. A rough calculation showed that that amount is saved over the whole Commonwealth. That these services are not required is shown by the fact that they are not availed of. They have been continued because the Government is anxious to make all the economies posto sible. PRIMAGE DUTY.",14
23,Mr HILL,CONDITIONS OF THE WOBKEES EMPLOYED INTH E,"Has the Government yet reached a decision in regard to the request a deputation which waited upon it some time ago for a remission of primalage duty on corn sacks, on sacks for superphosphates, and on the ingredients of superphosphates ?",14

Thd in Government is administering a scheme for the granting of assistance to prospectors under which more than 60 menare working in North and Central Australia.

Evans, Commonwealth Sub-Treasury Accountant, Brisbane; and Charles Fitzpatrick, President of the Miners Union, Queensland. A notification to this effect was despatched to the honourable member on the 8th April, but I suppose it reached his Brisbane address too late for delivery to him prior to his return to Canberra. Mr. Rowe, who has agreed to act as chairman of the committee, is in communication with the Honourable John Gunn, a member of the New South Wales committee, and Mr Gunn has been asked to give some oversight to the operations of the Queensland committee, and to make money available to it as soon as it is ready to receive it. I believe that Mr. Gunn and Mr Rowe are consulting about the matter today. The honourable member forwarded to me a list of names of persons who desired assistance, and this has been referred to the committee. No doubt the claims will be investigated when the allocation of the money is under consideration. PETROL INQUIRY.",15
29,Mr LACEY,GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR,"Has the Prime Minister yet received the report of the officer deputed to make inquiries into the price of petrol? If so, does he consider that the investigation has been sufficiently exhaustive to determine whether the petrol sellers are exploiting the public ? Has any inquiry been made into the question whether the private petrol companies are working in collaboration with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries?",15
30,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR,"Severa l lengthy reports have been received on this matter, but Cabinet has not yet had an opportunity of considering them; so I cannot answer the honourable member's questions. NA SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT.",15

32,Mr THEODORE,INTEREST PAYMENTS BY NEW,"I cannot answer the right honourable member's question off hand. I have not received any information from the New South Wales Government regarding the payment of Coal local interest for April. I understand that such interest has been paid up to now, but how long the New South Wales Government will continue to pay it, I do not know, though I understand that the Premier of New South Wales has intimated that he will continue to pay local interest until the State Parliament has dealt with the bill relating to this matter, which is now before it. NA SALARIES.",15
33,Mr MORGAN,MELBOURNE TRADES HAL L,"In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has suggested that the 10 per cent, cut in wages sanctioned by the High Court was wrong and unjust, will he give us his opinion of the action of the Melbourne Trades Hall authorities in reducing the salaries of its officials by a similar amount?",15
34,Mr SCULLIN,MELBOURNE TRADES HAL L,"I have never suggested that a 10 per cent, wages cut by the High Court was wrong, for the High Court has not, to my knowledge, made any such cut.",15
35,Mr MOBGAN,MELBOURNE TRADES HAL L,I should have said the Arbitration Court.,15

37,Mr MORGAN,MELBOURNE TRADES HAL L,"If the right honourable gentleman suggests that a 10 per cent, reduction in certain wages sanctioned by the Arbitration Court was unjust, will he express an opinion as to the action of the Melbourne Trades Hall authorities in reducing the salaries of their officers to a similar extent?",15

NA AND REGULATIONS. - Mr GREGORY - This morning £ received a notice to the effect that in future only those honourable members making special application will be supplied with copies of ordinances- I do not know whether the notice is intended to cover regulations also. As it is imperative that honourable members should be supplied with copies of all ordinances and regulations, I ask the Prime Minister if he will have the notice rescinded?",15
39,Mr SCULLIN,DISTRIBUTION OF ORDINANCES,"Any honourable member wishing to receive copies of all ordinances and regulations has only to send a notification to that effect and they will be supplied; but some honourable members are interested only in particular ordinances or regulations, and some do not require any. Many copies are not even removed from their wrappers. As this is a time when economy should be exercised, the Government thinks that the new procedure is necessary. STATE DISABILITIES .

DEFICITIN ACCOUNTS. FORMAL MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT.",18
72,Mr SPEAKER,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Hon;. Norman Makin). - I have received from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The deficit of £19,953,000 in the current accounts of the Commonwealth for the first nine months of the financial year."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",18
73,Mr LATHAM,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Kooyong) [3.48] The monthly return of the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Account was published last Friday, and I am sure that every honourable member, as well as the public as a whole, saw with amazement that the deficit in the current act count was very nearly £20,000,000. It is true that during the month of March there were heavy interest paymentsheavier than occur in a normal monththat there were heavy payments on account of exchange, and that in addition there was a payment of £592,000 which was rendered necessary by the repudiation and default of the Government of New South ""Wales. It is true, also, that the receipts from income taxation will decrease the deficit in the final three months of the year. But it is equally plain that the great leeway in Commonwealth revenue is not being made up, and that an enormous deficit is certain at the end of the current year. When the Prime Minister (Mr . Scullin), as Treasurer, introduced his budget last July, he budgeted for a surplus of £11,230. In the course of his nnancial statement he saidParliament must recognize, however, that no further drift in Commonwealth finances can be permitted, and that the balancing of the budget is an essential step for the restoration of the credit of Australia. The Government proposes to watch the financial position closely throughout the year, and, without waiting until the end of the financial year, will not hesitate to take immediate steps, if such action appears to be necessary, in order to prevent any serious disturbance in the budgetary position. When the Treasurer presented budget he was told that not one of his estimates would, or could, be realized, and experience has amply borne out the t r u th of the statements then made from this side of the House. But the Government, heedless of warnings, insisted on its budget. Immediately there was a backward d r if t to the extent of £2,000,000 a month, and as early as August it was necessary to assemble a special financial conference in Melbourne, at which the heads of the various Australian governments agreedThat the several governments represented at this conference declare their fixed determination to balance their respective budgets for the nnancial year 1930-31, and to maintain a similar balanced budget in future years. This budget equilibrium will be maintained on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia of existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. Further, if during any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure, immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the budgets shall balance. Ifr. Latham. Everybody knows that, owing in large measure to the absence of a policy on the part of the present Commonwealth Government, it is now beyond the bounds of possibility to balance the Commonwealth budget in this financial year. At the end of the October quarter there was a deficit of £6,747,000, and a new budget was brought down in November by the then Acting Treasurer, the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Lyons). Admittedly, the proposals therein made were inadequate; but the Government ever since has permitted the affairs of the country to d r if t . No action at all has been taken to deal effectively with the budgetary position.",18
74,Mr HOLLOWAY,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,The Government has been hindered by the Opposition.,19
75,Mr LATHAM,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"No one can point to any action of the Opposition that has hindered the Government from dealing with the situation, though the difficulty of the problem has been aggravated by the conduct of the Premier of New South Wales, which has caused further charges to f all upon the Commonwealth revenue. How have the commitments of the Government been financed? They have been met largely by means of treasury bills. On Saturday last a warning by the Commonwealth Bank Board was directed that to the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) to the effect that there must be some l i m it to the issue of treasury-bills in future. This is a very grave warning, indeed, because it means that we are in imminent danger of default. The treasury-bills that have already been issued and utilized to raise money are producing a dangerous inflation. This cannot go on indefinitely; in fact, it cannot go on very much longer. The financial proposals of the Government, which provide for the issue of what is called a fiduciary currency of £18,000,000, make no contribution to the solution of the budget problem. It is interesting to observe that, since these proposals have been introduced, the word "" fiduciary "" has changed its meaning in Australia instead of suggesting good f a it h , it is now a common word for anything that is a sham and a pretence. The Commonwealth Government is proceeding with its proposal to issue the so-called fiduciary currency, notwithstanding all the dangers incidental to this "" desperate and unsound remedy "", as the Prime Minister ing (Mr Scullin) described it in a cable patched in November to the then Acting Treasurer (Mr Lyona). In a recent debate in this chamber, the Prime Minisproposals ter said that he would not deal on that occasion with what he had said in that cablegram as he would have another portunity during the discussion of the Fiduciary Notes Bill. Yet during that discussion the Prime Minister *uid nothing on the subject. He uttered not a word about the opinions which ne bad expressed in such strong language in cablegram to which I have referred. This Government is incapable of stopbench ping this drift towards national bankits ruptcy. It has no credit in or outside the House, in Australia, or anywhere country. else in the world. It has not a majority for its so-called policy either in this chamber or in another place. It depends for its continued existence upon the temptuous support of some of its political enemies, the followers of the Premier New South Wales, and avowed repudiaThat tionists; it is only by reason of this port that the Government is able to renitude main on the treasury bench. desired by a vote on this motion to show the community just where the Bupport of the Government comes from. It is true that the Opposition has ject. not adopted in relation to the important subject of finance or any other proposal the attitude of the ister when he was Leader of the Opposition. When the Prime Minister honourable was Leader of the Opposition he cussion declared that it was not duty of the Opposition to make Standing suggestions to the Government. In cussing the budget in 1927 he remarkedI consider it to be the duty of every able member to call the attention of the vernment to the totally unsatisfactory mic state of the country, even though they may have no remedy to suggest. The Governre-asserting ment should find the remedy. It cannot its responsibility iby saying "" You show remedy "". I now ask the Prime Minister to observe the maxim laid down by him so reon cently as 1927 and to provide a various remedy. As Leader of the Opposivernment. tion I never have adopted the position which he took up when he was time Leader of the Opposition. the budget debate in July deslast and during the second budget debate in November last, there was nothing lacking in particularity or precision in the made from this side of the House. Since then there has been such a drift that further steps will have to be optaken to remedy the financial position; but the first step needed is to get rid of the present Government, with its record of folly, indecision and ineptitude. The only contribution that this Government can make to the welfare of the Commonthe wealth is to resign office. Let us have an early appeal to the people, so that there may not remain on the treasury a government with a licence from avowed political enemies to continue the mismanagement of the affairs of this",19

77,Mr LATHAM,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,No . On some occasions I received notice only half an hour before Prime Minthe meeting of the House.,20
78,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"The motion of the gentleman requires a wide disof the public finances, which is the not possible in the time allowed by the Orders. The honourable member dismust therefore have been actuated by some other motive than the desire to deal honorwith the subject of his motion. Perhaps Gohe is endeavouring to establish his claims econoto a future Prime Ministership by his qualifications for the evade leadership of the Opposition. Doubtless us the he fears that his leadership is being seriously challenged, or may be called into question tomorrow or Thursday next at a joint meeting of the parties in opposition to this GoSurely the honourable gentleman does not pretend that, in the brief allowed to him this afternoon, he Durwas able to deal with this subject adequately. He finds fault with the Government's financial policy, and claims to have drawn public attention to the gravity of the position disclosed by the heavy deficit in the Commonwealth public accounts. But attention to the state of the Commonwealth accounts has been directed by myself, as Treasurer, in statements issued to the public press and published broadcast throughout Australia. Does the honourable gentleman wish the people to believe that, if he had not submitted this motion, they would have been unaware of the heavy deficit with which we are faced, because of the serious shortages in revenue from customs and excise duties, the sales tax, direct taxation, and the post office ? It is not likely that a deficit of £19,900,000 will be shown in the accounts at the end of the year-the revenue to be received in the remaining three months will, no doubt, considerably reduce the present shortagebut it is not denied that there will be a heavy deficit when the accounts for the year are closed. No one with a knowledge of the manner in which trade in the Commonwealth has declined in the last few months expected the position to be otherwise. Eevenue from imports has declined more than it was possible to predict at the beginning of the financial year.",20
79,Mr MORGAN,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,The Treasurer told the electors that this Government would remedy that.,21
80,Mr THEODOEE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Every one knows that, for the last nine months, Australia has been in the trough of a trade depression caused by circumstances for which this Government is not responsible. Internal trade and commerce and industry have been seriously disturbed; and our overseas trade has been so gravely affected that it would have been impossible for any government to balance its accounts, no matter how heroic the measures adopted. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) referred to the agreement arrived at in Melbourne in August last by Commonwealth and State Ministers, the object of which was to secure the balancing of budgets during this financial year. It was then the earnest desire of the Ministers representing the Commonwealth and the various States to balance their accounts this year, but there is scarcely one who, today, will not admit the impossibility of giving effect to that undertaking.  never attempted to honour the agreement.",21
81,Mr THEODOEE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"The Leader of the Opposition attacked this Government for its failure, as he put it, to balance its budget in accordance with the Melbourne agreement of August last.",21
82,Mr GULLETT,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,It has made no attempt to do so.,21
83,Mr THEODOEE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Can the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett), point to any State Nationalist Government which has balanced its budget, and thus honoured the Melbourne agreement? Let me remind the House that Mr Bavin and Mr Stevens, the then Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales, were parties to the agreement. Did they balance the State budget?",21
84,Mr MARR,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,They made a start.,21
85,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"They did not even do that. The Bavin Government allowed Parliament to be dissolved and the general election to take place in October without even submitting to Parliament the annual budget. They were defeated at the elections and left the finances of New South Wales in such a condition that in that State a deficiency of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 was in prospect. Queensland also, under a Nationalist Government, has a deficit for the nine months of about £1,750,000 and it is expected that, at the end of the year, the deficit will be £1,000,000. Honourable members do not criticise the Nationalist Government of Queensland. They excuse the failure of State Nationalist Governments to balance their accounts, and concentrate their attention upon the administration of the Commonwealth Government. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that on an earlier occasion he indicated how the Commonwealth might balance its budget this year. He offered what he termed a policy of sound finance, and was indiscreet enough to submit his proposals in detail. Let us examine the scheme which he propounded as the means of saving this country from a heavy deficit at the end of the financial year. By reductions in public service salaries he proposed to save £1,000,000. He would also have saved another £200,000 from the amount set aside for maternity allowances; £146,000 from bounties paid to industries; £1,500,000 from the moneys made available to the States under the roads agreement:; £1,000,000 from the money appropriated for unemployment relief; £150,000 from the amount intended to assist the coal-mining industry by way of export bounty, and assistance to repatriate excess miners; and £3,000 by cutting out the expenditure to finance the industrial peace tribunals, making a total saving, according to the honourable member, of £3,999,000. _ May I remind the House that even if his proposals had been adopted in full there would still have been a deficit of over £10,000,000? He was going to withhold £1,500,000 due to the States under the Boads Agreement. He was going to renounce that agreement, under the plea of economy; I do not suppose he would admit that that would have been repudiation. The withholding of that money would merely have effected a saving for the Commonwealth Government at the expense of the State governments. Then, the honourable member proposed not to spend £1,000,000 which had been allocated for the relief of unemployment. What wonderful economy that would have been! He would withhold money that was intended to relieve the distress of unemployed persons. He would deny them the succour of which they stood in need, and call that economy!",21
86,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"And what did the Government do about that £1,000,000 grant?",22
87,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"At the August conference to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) referred it was resolved that £750,000 of the amount should be paid to South Australia to tide her over her special difficulties. Eliminating those so-called economies, which could be achieved only by filching money from the States, or by repudiating our contractual obligations, the total savings possible under the honourable member's proposals would amount to only a little over £1,000,000. But this Government has effected greater sayings than that in the course of a year. We have made actual savings during the current year of £1,230,000, by cutting out expenditure to which the country had been committed by the Bruce-Page Government.",22
88,Mr MARR,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,Mostl y by sacking returned soldiers.,22
89,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Not at all; money has been saved by putting an end to unnecessary services, and by cutting out superfluous sub-departments, commissions and boards created by the administration of which the honourable member who has just interjected was a member.",22
90,Mr MARR,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,Has the Government effected an actual saving by the elimination of any board or commission appointed by the previous Government?,22
91,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"Yes , by the abolition of the Development and Migration Commission, to give one instance.",22
92,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,The Government still has the members of that commission round its neck.,22
93,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,Because they were appointed by the previous Government for terms of five and seven years. A great many commitments of that kind were passed on to this Government by the administration of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) was a member. Some of the contracts entered into by the previous administration could not be terminated or varied.,22
94,Mr LATHAM,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,Then are we to understand that everything is quite right so far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned?,22
95,Mr THEODORE,ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF,"That is not my attitude, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. As I have explained, the Government has, during its term of ofiice, effected important economies, and the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) has announced that action is to be taken to adjust Public Service salaries and emoluments so as to save a further £1,000,000 for a ful l year. Yet all that the Leadeof the Opposition was able to suggest, after running afine-toothedcomb through the Estimates, was a real saving of a little more than £1,000,000. It is not necessary to answer at further length the charges brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition.

SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 19th March (vide page 369), on motion by Mr. PAEKEE MOLONEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",24
103,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Wimmera) [4.33] This is the third bill which the Government has introduced during the present session to grant relief to the wheat-growing industry, and perhaps a brief review of the two measures that have preceded it may be necessary in order that we may accurately assess its importance as well as that of the problems involved in it . With a view to carrying out a promise made by the right honourable the Prime Minister in his appeal to the wheat growers of Australia to produce a record crop, a bill was introduced last April providing for a cash guarantee of 4s. a bushel to the growers upon delivery of f.a.q. wheat at railway sidings. As a result a record area was put under crop. I do not suggest that, in any circumstances, even s without the proposed guarantee, a very large area would not have been cropped; but, undoubtedly, in the wheat-producing States a considerable area was sown with wheat that would not have been cropped but for the anticipated price for which provision was made in the bill then before this chamber.",26
104,Mr GBEGOKY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,No doubt a special appeal was made by the Government to the wheat-growers.,26
105,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yes ; but it must also be remembered that the bill was introduced in April, when the wheat seeding season had already commenced. It was debated in April and May, but, unfortunately, was defeated in another place in circumstances well known to all.",26
106,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The honourable member says "" unfortunately "".",26
107,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I do.,26
108,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Then , the honourable member does not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett).",26
109,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I do not. I am not attempting to square my views with his on this matter. The action of the representatives of the wheat-growers in another place in rejecting the bill introduced by this Government and passed by this House was one of crass stupidity.,26
110,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,They were not representing the wheat-growers; they were representing the community.,26
111,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Quite so; but the wheat-growers are an integral part of the community, and. the people as a whole were morally bound by the Prime Minister's promise and, consequently, acquiesced in a bill the terms of which induced the wheat-growers to put a record area under wheat in an endeavour to redress Australia's adverse trade balance.",26
112,Mr MACKAY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,The Prime Minister made that promise on his own responsibility.,26
113,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I did not hear any persons or any section dissociate themselves from that promise as embodied in the bill.,26
114,Mr MACKAY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Some certainly did.,26
115,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I have since heard some criticism of the provisions of the bill, particularly in the light of what might have happened had that legislation been passed. I take this opportunity to say that, although the wheat-growers' occupation is one that has drawn expressions of sympathy from all sections in this House, and although no political party has ventured to suggest that the wheat-growers should not be given assistance, the only difference of opinion being as to the form it should take, it is most extraordinary that, after twelve months of endeavour to get something practical done by legislation, not one wheat grower has yet received one pennyworth of assistance from the Federal Government.",26
116,Mr MACKAY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,That is owing to the failure of the Government.,27
117,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"There are, of course, various reasons for this. But I want at once to express my disagreement with the attitude taken up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), and the Deputy Leader (Mr Gullett) in connection with this matter. I listened to their speeches with great disappointment. They took up the most extraordinary and untenable position of ridiculing the promise made by the Prime Minister, and embodied in the Wheat Marketing Bill, claiming that a guarantee of 4s. a bushel would have involved the Commonwealth in the loss of from £15,000,000 to £18,000,000, and describing it as a fantastic financial proposal which it would be impossible to carry out. But strangely enough, during the passage of the bill last year, the Leader of the Opposition moved the following amendment :That this House is of the opinion that, while the present circumstances justify a guarantee by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of a minimum price of 4s. per bushel for f.a.q. wheat, season 1930-1931, delivered at railway siding, legislation providing for such a guarantee should be introduced separately from any legislation providing for the establishment of a monopoly in the marketing of Australian wheat by means of a compulsory pool. In other words, the honourable gentleman committed himself, and incidentally his party, to a guarantee of exactly the same amount as was offered by the Government, and said that circumstances justified such a guarantee. When a few weeks ago he scathingly criticized the Government's proposals because of their financial impracticability, he overlooked the fact that such criticism could be directed with even greater force against his own proposals, because in the light of subsequent events it is clear that his proposal would have involved a greater loss. Attached to the Government's guarantee of 4s. a bushel was a scheme for controlled marketing; the price for the local market would have been fixed, and the Government would have been relieved of any possibility of loss upon the home consumption quota of approximately 33,000,000 bushels. The marketing of the wheat is not yet completed, but on present appearances there would have been a loss of 2s. a bushel on the 150,000,000 bushels of wheat exported. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition would have involved a loss of 2s. a bushel on 180,000,000 bushels. There is a moral obligation on this Parliament to assist the wheat-growers. People have asked why the wheat growers, more than any other section of the community, are entitled to State help. Other sections, we are told, are receiving less than production costs, and if the Government is morally bound to assist the wheat-growers, it is equally under an obligation to other classes of producers. I refer such questioners to the appeal made by the Prime Minister to the farmers to grow more wheat in order to assist to reduce the adverse trade balance which was then, and is still, one of the outstanding problems confronting us. That was indicated again by the statement of the right honourable gentleman this afternoon that it was inadvisable to reduce the export of sugar because of the need for maintaining credits abroad at as high a figure as possible.",27
118,Mr LACEY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Does the honourable member agree with that policy in connection with sugar?,27
119,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I shall deal with sugar at the appropriate time. So far as I am aware, no appeal was made to any other section of the community that is comparable with that made to the wheat growers. To a man of my fiscal views, it is significant that the Prime Minister made no appeal to the boot factories, woollen mills, and other secondary industries in his electorate, to work three shifts daily in order to produce morti goods for export to the markets of the world. There is an unlimited market overseas for blankets, boots and shoes, provided they are sold on the same conditions as the wheat-growers are expected to sell their product, namely, at world's parity prices. The secondary industries not only failed to put forth any special effort to lift Australia out of the financial mire, but they actually threw their machinery out of action and turned hundreds of their employees into the streets to join the ranks of the unemployed. To the wheat-growers, however, a definite and direct appeal was made.",27
120,Mr MARTENS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Did the member endorse it !,28
121,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I did, and so did all the State Governments that were interested. The Victorian Labour Ministry appointed a "" Grow more wheat"" Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Erank Clarke, and placarded the railway stations throughout the States with ""Grow more wheat"" appeals.",28
122,Dr MALONEY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,The post offices also were utilized.,28
123,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"That is so. Every letter delivered by the Postal Department was stamped with the exhortation "" Grow more wheat"". It is undeniable that the whole nation was behind the Prime Minister's appeal to the producers.",28
124,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,The Government offered a guarantee of 4s. a bushel; but the farmers did not get it. Who was responsible ? Mr GULLETT.'-The Government.,28
125,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"We can pay farmers out of the deficit of £19,000,000.",28
126,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"All that the farmer knows is that a direct appeal was made to him; a promise was made by the Government and it has not been honoured. Certainly the Government has proposed successive measures for assisting the wheat-growers. The first was the Wheat Marketing with the accompanying offer of 4s. a bushel. That was defeated, and just before last Christmas another measure was introduced to provide for the payment of 3s. a bushel. That, too, went amiss. Later, the Loan Council proposed to float a loan for the payment of a bounty of 6d. Then Mr Lang made a speech, or something else went wrong, which led to that proposal being abandoned. Now the Government is offering 4^d. Eirst, 4s.; then, 3s.; then 6d., and now, 4Jd. The last offer is attached to one of the most contentious financial measures ever presented to this House, and we are told that if wo do not pass the Fiduciary Notes Bill, the farmers will receive nothing. I strongly object to being told that I must vote for a financial measure of which I do not approve, or bear the accusation of being unwilling to assist the wheat-growers. Such tactics are unfair to all honourable members who are opposed to the Fiduciary Notes Bill. honourable Mr JONES - Are not the wheat-growers divided on the subject?",28
127,Mr LACEY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,They are in favour of it.,28
128,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Not much.,28
129,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It is true that meetings of farmers have expressed support of the Government's proposal for the creation of paper money. But always they have been told that by that scheme alone can they get anything.,28
130,Mr LACEY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It is the only way to assist them.,28
131,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Thei r support of the Fiduciary Notes Bill is not evidence that they approve of the principle of it ; rather, does their willingness to support almost anything that they think will help them to survive, exemplify their desperate position. Many farmers have said to me, as they have said to other honourable members, ""We do not like the Fiduciary Notes Bill, involving the creation of paper money, but our difficulties the are such that when the Government assures us that this is the only means by which w'e can be assisted, we are forced to pass motions in favour of the scheme "". That is convincing evidence of the dire necessity of the wheat-growers. I regret that the Government has tacked this proposal to the Fiduciary Notes Bill.",28
132,Mr THOMPSON,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"There is nothing in Bill, this bill to say that it is tacked to the other measure.",28
133,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"No ; but both the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) and the Min have stated plainly by interjections that the giving of this relief is contingent upon the passage of the Fiduciary Notes Bill. If I am wrong, the Minister for Markets can now, by interjection, put me right.  surer has tried every other means of ting assistance for the farmers, as the honourable member for Wimmera knows. Because of the failure of those efforts, he now says that the Fiduciary Notes Bill is the only means by which the money can be got.",28
134,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"As a representative of the wheat-growers I am not concerned as to what party affords relief to them; I am prepared to support proposals from any party that will adequately meet the situation. Indeed, I consider that the best way of getting relief for the wheat growers, having regard to the fact that all parties are agreed that something should be done, would be to appoint a committee representative of all sections in the House to meet and produce within 48 hours a scheme of relief that could be supported by all honourable members here and in another place. Surely that is practicable, and I commend that course to the Government for consideration.",29
135,Mr RIOBDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,There was no better scheme than the proposed guarantee of 4s. a bushel which the Commonwealth Bank agreed to finance.,29
136,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), has again brought up the subject of the 4s. guarantee. I suggest to him that we arc not discussing that now, and that we gain nothing by discussing the past. We have to decide what we shall do now to assist the wheat-growing industry. I assure the honourable member that the position of the growers in the wheat-exporting States is tragic. Of course, I do not place Tasmania and Queensland in the category of wheat-exporting States. This Government has made a great deal of the failure of another place to pass legislative measures which would undoubtedly have assisted the wheat-growing industry. Actually the Government has done nothing, although it has attempted to do something to alleviate the position of the wheat-growers. But at the same time it has extracted hundreds of thousands of pounds from their pockets by means of the primage duty on cornsacks, superphosphates and other necessaries of production. This is being done at a time when the wheat-growing industry is up Trea- against the greatest crisis in its history, get- and the unfortunate wheat-growers are being demoralized by the relentless pounding of economic forces and the tremendous collapse of wheat prices throughout the world. Practically every Government of the wheat exporting countries throughout the world, with the exception of Australia, has done something to assist its wheat-growing industry. We have done nothing to assist the wheat-farmers; on the other hand we have placed additional burdens upon them. This year there will, unfortunately, be a large reduction in acreage in Western New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. The wheat-growers are unable to obtain supplies of superphosphate with which to sow this year's crop.",29
137,Mr GIBBONS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,They cannot get kerosene.,29
138,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"They cannot get kerosene for use in their tractors. In many cases they cannot obtain the necessaries of life to maintain their families. I referred a little while ago to the moral aspect of this question in respect of which there is an unanswerable case for something to be done to assist the wheat-growing industry; but in addition there is the humanitarian aspect to be considered. Hundreds of the finest citizens of this country-me n who have been farming all their lives-ar e today being driven off the land. Every country newspaper that one happens to read contains numerous advertisements of sales of assigned estates by mortgagees, terms being strictly cash. Behind every one of those advertisements is a tragedy. In addition to the moral and humanitarian aspects, there is to be considered the economic aspect taken in relation to pounds, shillings and pence and our national solvency. We shall never lift Australia out of its present difficulties unless we place our primary and exporting industries on a sound footing. The greatest industry in Australia today, in relation to employment, and its beneficial effect upon railway revenue and secondary industries, such as superphosphate and machinery manufacturers, is the wheat growing industry. It is true that the wool industry has a greater intrinsic value, but the amount of labour employed in the production of wool is not comparable with that employed in the production of wheat. To-day this great industry is beaten to its knees. We have the prospect of a tremendous reduction in wheat acreage. The only way to rehabilitate this country is to select at the starting point of reconstruction those industries that are exporting, to do everything to assist them, and, above all, to the legislative burdens that are upon them - to take, in racing parlance, the lead bags out of the saddle and give the Australian farmers a fair go.",29
139,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Lou d cheers from the Labour party.,30
140,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I do not like the interjection of the honourable member, because it is an endeavour to keep alive the party spirit in this debate. I am not one of those who think that this industry can be placed upon the road to permanent prosperity by a grant from public funds or by a bounty. I believe that in the last analysis we shall have to cut production costs. If this Parliament tackles the problem of reducing production costs in the wheat industry, it will soon become possible for Australia to compete favourably with any other country in the markets of the world.",30
141,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Is the honourable member including Russia?,30
142,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yes, because we can produce a quality of wheat that Russia cannot produce. Wheat prices today are far below production costs in Australia. But at the same time. I do not think that Russia or any other country can produce wheat profitably at the present prices; so there is hope for this industry in Australia. The following is an expression of opinion which appeared in yesterday's Age. THE WHEAT INDUSTRY. EXPERT'S OPTIMISTIC NOTE. Giving evidence before the Federal Public Accounts Committee on Saturday, Professor Richardson, director of the Waite Institute of Agricultural Research, said he did not the competition of Russian wheat. If Australia could get back to the pre-war ratio internal prices to export levels and research and educational services could maintained we could grow wheat in comjust petition with the world. He said about a million pounds a year must be charged to agricultural industry in South Australia depreciation of farm machinery. South Australia was absolutely dependent on primary production, and particularly on wheat, which was the least pampered industry in Australia. I have for many years been associated with Professor Richardson in connection with agricultural research work, and I know of no man better qualified than he is to express an opinion in regard to the lift future of wheat-growing and production costs. We should aim at placing this industry upon a sound and permanent basis. During the last wheat growing season, the price received at sidings for f.a.q. wheat was somewhere between 4s. 3d. and 4s. Sd. a bushel. This year the price has ranged from Is. 6d to Is. lOd. a bushel. There has, within the last twelve months, been a collapse from an average price of 4s. 6d. to an average price of Is. 8d. No other industry has suffered such a tremendous reduction in prices. Honourable members have talked about a 10 per cent, reduction in wages and a 25 per cent, reduction in share values on the Stock Exchange; but those reductions are nothing in comparison with the reduction in wheat prices. Por that reason it is essential that the industry should be given some temporary assistance in the form of a grant from public funds, but only as palliative. To place this industry on a proper basis, we must reduce production costs, and there are many ways of doing that. It can be done, not only by legislative action, but also by co-operative action by the growers themselves. In the past they have, in connection with the marketing of their wheat, been lacking that co-operative spirit which should have been shown in their own interests, and in the interests of the industry generally. Let me indicate briefly one or two ways of helping the wheat growing industry to compete successAdelaide, Sunday. fully in the markets of the world. First, we should have an Australian-wide system of bulk handling of wheat. New South Wales pioneered that system, and, fear like all other pioneers, made mistakes, of which the other States can avoid if they provided adopt the system. New South Wales be expended large sums in erecting silos after the war, when the prices of the cement and steel, and all construction for costs, were at the peak. Notwithstanding that, it cannot be said that the bulk handling system of New South Wales has been a failure.",30
143,Mr GIBBONS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It has been a success.,31
144,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"-That is so, and it is steadily gaining favour among the farmers. We spend millions of pounds per annum in purchasing imported sacks, filling them up with wheat and sending them out of the country. Instead of that we should institute the bulk handling system. We should adopt a basis under which we can sell wheat in various grades, and at a price which will give the grower some incentive to produce wheat of a better quality. Under the present f.a.q. standard, there is no incentive to produce wheat above that standard except in certain towns in which the millers, knowing the milling value of the varieties of wheat, are willing to give a premium for better wheat. Under the f.a.q. standard we have bred wheat to produce the greatest bulk yield. We have not bred wheat to produce high flour strength and milling qualities such as would be produced if a premium were given for them. We have found, in experimenting, that wheat of a high milling strength does not as a rule return as much as that of low milling strength. It oftens happens that one variety of wheat, because of its actual milling strength, is worth from 3d. to 4d. a bushel more than another variety, but under our present system both varieties would be classed at the siding as f.a.q., and no price incentive is given to grow wheat of a higher quality. We must reconstruct the whole Bystem of wheat-growing by 'the introduction of bulk handling and the adoption of a system of payment in accordance with the quality of wheat produced. Even under the f.a.q. standard we produce wheats that are sought by millers, and are famous in the markets of the world. I maintain that the standard can be materially improved if we set to work systematically along the lines I have suggested.",31
145,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Eve n under the f.a.q. standard the quality of our wheat in a normal year is equal to that of the world's best.,31
146,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"We can make it as greatly sought after as our merino wool in the markets of the world if we tackle the matter in the right way. An f.a.q. standard for wool would be absurd. This is one of the lines along which I suggest we can lower production costs. Marketing costs are a more contentious subject. To-day there is a considerable leakage under the open competitive system of marketing. In the station yards of all the wheat-producing States we have the spectacle of four, five, six or more buyers, each with different stacks, and a different set of lumpers, and each scrambling for the trucks that are made available, and are rationed out by the railway departments. Those departments run special goods trains of 20, 30, or 40 trucks that may be consigned to half a dozen different consignees. In Victoria some may be taken off at Williamstown, others at Geelong, and others at various flour mills at Kensington. The shunting and sorting of trucks causes a considerable amount of economic waste, and in that avenue there is room for a big reduction of production costs. There are many other directions in which costs could be reduced. Professor Richardson has shown that there is room for tremendous improvement in the continuance of research work concerning the breeding and production of wheat. I can say on behalf of the wheat-growers that they are alive to the importance of that aspect of the matter. I know of no body of men who are keener than the wheat growers to increase production and to improve yields. I do not question for a moment the Government's sincerity in attempting to assist the industry; but I do doubt the wisdom of its proposals, and the form in which they have been put forward. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), on behalf of the Country party, has made a proposal which, if adopted, would provide means for giving assistance to the industry. If the Minister believes that it is not possible to raise a loan, the Government at least has the power to impose a sales tax on flour.  able member for Wimmera knows quite well that such a proposal is opposed by the Ministers for Agriculture in the States that are taking steps to fix a local price. They have all protested against it .",31
147,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"That excuse of the Minister is open to the criticism that some of the States which are asking the Commonwealth Government to refrain from imposing a sales tax on flour have so far taken no action in the matter. The Minister knows better than any other honourable member opposite how desperately urgent is the need of the farmers. If any form of assistance is to be granted to them it ought to be made available this month, so that they will be in a position to plant next year's crop.",32
148,Mr GIBBONS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The New South Wales Government has imposed a tax on flour, but has not given any relief to the wheat growers.",32
149,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,That is evidence against the suggestion of the Minister.  for Agriculture in New South Wales has taken the necessary steps to introduce the required legislation.,32
150,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Everybod y is in favour of doing something for the wheat grower, yet nothing is being done because of continual wrangling regarding ways and means. When the Government introduced its fiduciary note issue proposal, upon which the financing of this measure is dependent, I said to my colleagues in the Country party: "" It is useless our opposing the proposals of the Government unless we are prepared to suggest something constructive to take their place."" That is what has been done; and action along the lines suggested can be taken even now.",32
151,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It will have to be taken.,32
152,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Apparentl y there is no difference of opinion regarding the necessity for helping the wheat-growers. I commend to the Minister the suggestion that a committee be appointed to investigate the whole matter thoroughly. It is not my intention to move for the appointment of such a committee; that is the responsibility of the Minister. He is unable to plead that he cannot command the votes of a majority of honourable members of this House; he can do as he wills in this matter. If I were to move for the appointment of a committee, and the Minister were to oppose the proposal, failure to carry it would be inevitable. Yet within 48 hours a committee of honourable members representative of all the wheat-growing districts would be able to bring forward a proposal that all parties, both in this House and in another place, could support. Something must be done immediately to help the industry. The wheat-growers are scattered all over the country and cannot mobilize as can other sections of the community. Honourable members who are not in touch with the position in the industry cannot realise its absolutely desperate nature. I have never encountered such a spirit as that which exists today in the Mallee and Wimmera districts of Victoria and the back Mallee country of South Australia. The spirit of the pioneers, about which poets have so often written, is broken today. In other words, they "" do not care a damn"". They are broken in pocket as well as in spirit. Having made commitments in the light of the promises of this Parliament, not one of which has been fulfilled, they suffered the greatest collapse in wheat prices in the history of the world, and are now being pursued by their creditors as though they were criminals. That is a position which this Parliament cannot ignore, and which it should take steps to remedy.",32
153,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Echuca) [5.21] - I do not like the bill, and fear that it will prove to be a "" dud "", as has been the case with similar legislation passed within the last twelve months.  it that if you like.",32
154,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I intend to try to make it effective.  Minister whether it is a "" dud "" or not.  honourable members opposite to put it through.",32
155,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I am opposed to Clause 2, which provides for the repeal of the Wheat Advances Act 1930. To-day I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) whether that act had been proclaimed, and, if not, whether he proposed to proclaim it ; but the reply that I received was not a satisfactory one. The wheat growers of this country, whom I am constantly meeting, expect the Government to proclaim that act and to put it into operation. They cannot understand why such action has not already been taken. Under it they were guaranteed 3s. a bushel on a seaport basis. It also provided that the Commonwealth Government should make arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank for an advance of 2s. 6d. a bushel; but that advance has never materialized.",32
156,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Who is responsible for that?,33
157,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I do not know whether the bill was badly drafted, or was unconstitutional; but the fact remains that the farmer has not received 2s. 6d. a bushel at country sidings or 3s. a bushel f.o.b. It is the duty of the Government to explain why the act is to be repealed and why its provisions are not to be given effect. I protest against its repeal and the failure of the Government to make the advance of 3s. a bushel.",33
158,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Was not the withholding of the advance due to an objection raised by the Commonwealth Bank?,33
159,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I do not know. The Government should be in a position to explain why it was not made. If it has a solution of the difficulty, it should bring it forward.  has been given over and over again.",33
160,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"My concern is to see that some help is given even at this late hour. I feel sure that none will be given under the provisions of this bill. The Government will have an opportunity to show whether it is sincere in its desire to help the wheat-farmer, when I propose certain amendments in committee. I have been informed that those amendments will not be accepted ; but I intend to have them circulated and incorporated in Hansard. The Minister and the Government will then have thrown on them the responsibility of turning them down. I believe that they embody the only solution of the difficulty. Honourable members on this side are perfectly satisfied that the Fiduciary Notes Bill will not pass another place. The Government also holds that belief. What is the use therefore, of proceeding with it? I shall vote for this measure even in its present form; but I maintain that it can be improved materially. The position of the Australian wheat growers today is so serious that one need offer no apology for endeavouring to help them. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has vividly explained the position of the wheat growers in Victoria, particularly in the Mallee district, where the conditions are comparable with those in many parts of the other States. As the honourable member for Wimmera explained, fully SO per cent, of the wheat producers are insolvent. In large areas in Victoria there are districts in which, prior to last season, practically no wheat had been grown for several years, and where, in view of the Government's promise, the growers expected to reap a good crop and to obtain some return as a result of the 4s. a bushel which the Government guaranteed. Seeding operations have now commenced in many districts in Victoria, and also in the other States, and I have been informed by the honourable member for Wimmera and others, that, in some instances, farmers are sowing the seed on land which has not been fertilized. How, in the name of Heaven, they expect to reap a crop without the use of artificial manures, is beyond my comprehension. They might as well leave their holdings as expect a return in such circumstances. I am still hopeful that the Victorian Government will do something to assist the wheat-growers in that State; but it is undoubtedly the responsibility of the Federal Government to render some financial assistance to all the wheat growers in Australia who are in necessitous circumstances.",33
161,Mr RIOBDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The Queensland Government is at present paying 4s. a bushel, and growers in the other States could have received a similar amount.",33
162,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"If we were not producing more wheat than is required for local consumption the price would, probably, be in the vicinity of 7s. 6d. a bushel.",33
163,Mr RIOEDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Brea d is cheaper in Queensland than elsewhere in Australia, although the growers in that State are paid approximately 2s. a bushel more than is paid in any of the other States.",33
164,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I propose to deal later with the price of wheat as it affects the price of bread. The honourable member for Wimmera dealt very extensively with the campaign initiated by the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) and supported by the State Premiers, in which the wheat growers were urged to grow more wheat. I do not propose to go into that matter in detail at this juncture; but the fact remains that the proposal to grow more wheat was taken np so enthusiastically by the wheat-growers that, instead of an average crop of 120,000,000 to 130,000,000 bushels being produced, approximately 209,000,000 bushels were reaped. Had it not been for a dry spring and an abnormally wet harvesting season, it is probable that the production last season would have reached 225,000,000 bushels. ""We eau safely assert that the appeal of the Prime Minister and the State Premiers, and the promise of 4s. a bushel, increased the yield from wheat by 50,000,000 bushels. The Australian wheat-growers produced approximately 50,000,000 bushels more than would be reaped in a normal season. The additional quantity harvested did not assist them, but was actually a factor in depreciating prices. The growers, relying upon the promise of the Government of a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, incurred additional expense in sowing larger areas. If a farmer put in only an additional 100 acres he would have to spend an additional £25 on fertilizers, £20 on seed, and also incur further expense for sacks, horse feed and labour. By sowing bigger areas the growers actually incurred greater losses. A measure providing for the payment of 4s. a bushel was passed by this House, but rejected in another place. There is no doubt that the rejection of that measure was of great relief to the Government, whose enthusiasm for the measure waned considerably during its passage through this chamber.  trary to what the honourable member has stated previously.",33
165,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I believe that the Minister sincerely desired the bill to be passed by both branches of the legislature; but as time went on the price of wheat dropped to such an extent that by the time it Teached another place there were many supporters of the Government who were pleased to see it rejected. Having been relieved of the liability to pay 4s. a bushel at country sidings it was the duty of the Government to introduce another bill providing for the payment of a smaller amount. The Minister will remember that he was interviewed from time to time by various honourable members, and by deputations representing those engaged in the industry, who pointed out that, although the measure providing for the payment of 4s. a bushel had, rightly or wrongly, been rejected, the Government had been relieved of a great responsibility and liability. Prior to the adjournment for the Christmas vacation, when some wheat had actually been harvested, a measure providing for the payment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. was passed by both Houses. That measure has never been proclaimed, and the wheat-growers are continually asking why they are not being paid 3s. a bushel as provided for in it.  been told why.",34
166,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Is the Government going to stand up for the act by having it proclaimed, and if not, why not? The Government has made no pronouncement in regard to its intention with respect to the act. ",34
167,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"At conferences and gatherings of representatives of wheat growers which I attend, I am always being asked when the Government is to make the money available. Up to the present it has not made any move in that direction. We were informed in the first place that the Government proposed to borrow £6,000,000, of which £3,500,000 was to be used in paying a bounty of 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus of 140,000,000 bushels, and that by raising the export parity the price for local consumption would automatically rise. Those who understand the marketing of wheat know that that is not correct. Had the bill provided for a bounty of 6d. on all wheat exported, the local price would have been increased by that amount. This measure does not provide for a bounty of 6d. a bushel on the whole of our exportable surplus, but on only 75 per cent, of the wheat produced, and sold or delivered between October, 1930, and October, 1931. It is assumed that the exportable surplus this year will be 75 per cent, of the total quantity available for marketing overseas. On the latest estimate it is calculated that*instead of there being 75 per cent., equivalent to 141,000,000 bushels, for export, at least four-fifths or 80 per cent., equivalent to 153,000,000 bushels, will be exported. Had the bill provided for a bounty of 6d. a bushel on all wheat exported, the local price would have been increased by that amount, and the farmers would have received an extra 6d. instead of 4£d. a bushel. Although the Government proposed to raise a loan of £6,000,000, that was not proceeded with, because the Government knew that there was no possibility of raising such a loan until it had reduced expenditure, placed its house in order, lived within its income, and restored the confidence of the investing public. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), offered to co-operate with the Government in any action which might be considered necessary to adjust our finances, so that the whole of such an unpleasant responsibility should not be placed upon the members of one party. That offer, which was declined by the Government, would not have been made by the Labour party had it been in opposition. The Government now proposes under the Piduciary Notes Bill to issue £18,000,000 worth of additional notes, £6,000,000 of which are to be spent in relieving necessitous wheatis growers. My contention is that if the wheat-growers were to accept money raised in this manner their position would ultimately become worse. If the bounty were to be paid on all wheat, excluding seed and feed wheat, instead of on 140,000,000 bushels, the amount involved would be £4,750,000 instead of £3,543,000 - no t a very large increase. The easier and most equitable manner of raising the necessary money is by imposing a sales tax on flour, and I urge the Government to accept an amendment to provide for that. About 650,000 tons of flour are used annually for local consumption, and the quantity is gradually increasing. This equivalent to from 31,500,000 32,000,000 bushels of wheat. With a 209,000,000 bushel harvest, including Queensland, we should have, after deductthe ing 20,000,000 bushels for seed and feed, a balance of 189,000,000, or, say, imposed, 190,000,000 bushels. A sales tax on flour of £2 10s. per ton on 650,000 tons of flour penny. over a period of about four and a half years would provide exactly 6d. per desperate bushel all round on the 190,000,000 Mr mil. bushels, and also allow £2,500,000 for distribution among necessitous farmers. This proposal would appeal to growers in all States as being equitable. The Government's reply to this proposition will probably be that its acceptance would result in an increase in the price of bread. My answer is that the price of bread need not be raised materially, if raised at all. Bread is selling at from 8d. to l i d . per 4-lb. loaf in various parts of Victoria. In one of the suburbs of Melbourne the price was reduced to 6d. per 4-lb. loaf by a bakery firm. I am prepared to vouch for the accuracy of the statement that an opposition baker then opened a number of shops in the area supplied by the baker who was selling for 6d. and sold bread over the counter at 4^d. cash for the 4-lb. loaf. It was thought that this would effectively deal with the man who was selling for 6d., and put him completely out of action; but the result was that the baker who was selling for 6d. cut his price to 3Jd. per 4-lb. loaf, cash over the counter. This shows clearly that one of the most gigantic swindles ever known being perpetrated by the bakers who are charging 9d., 10d., and l i d . per 4-lb. loaf for bread at the present price of flour. In my opinion, a sales tax of £6 a ton could be placed on flour without causing bread to be any dearer. In fact, bread should be cheaper in the areas where 9^d. and l i d . is now being charged. The value of the wheat in a 4-lb. loaf with wheat at 4s. 6d. per bushel, after allowing for the value of the offal, is 2.691d., or less than 2fd. per loaf. Even if the price of bread were raised slightly, the great bulk of the people would be well able to pay it. An increase of 6d. per bushel in the price of wheat would is add only .429d. to the price of a 4-lb. to loaf. There is no means of bringing about a uniform price for growers other than through a sales tax on flour. If present price of flour remained firm, and a sales tax of £2 10s. per ton were the increase in the cost of a 4-lb. loaf of bread would be less than a halfThe farmers of Australia are waging a struggle against heavy odds, but the Government has done nothing but pile up the costs of production. Primage duty alone accounted for the following additional charges this year:66,000,000 cornsacks for wheat . . 88,000 12,000,000 sacks for super . . 16,000 Phosphatic rock for super . . 32,000 125,000 tons sulphur . . Nitre .. .. .. This total does not include the tax wool-packs, chaff-bags, potato-sacks, sian, &c. These charges are being heaped on to men who have not a feather to with. Many of them do not know where their next penny will come from. Many men who went abroad to fight for Aushad tralia are now being forced to live cracked wheat and treacle. The man on the land is not a bolshevik by nature. He has had no time to land. think or act in a radical manner. erally speaking, he is a law-abiding loyal citizen. But I take the full responsicalled bility for saying that unless something is done to help him, and done quickly, he may at any moment step over the baker, border line, and do something desperate. These men have been placed in their present position through no fault of their own, and by influences over which they have had no control. A man who cannot see a ray of light ahead is inclined to let things go. ""When he has been obliged to wage a losing fight against droughts, floods, bad seasons, and unprofitable prices, and on top of this forced, because of his unsheltered position, to carry those in the sheltered industries, and every form of tax that the mind of man can conceive, inevitably he becomes wellnearly nigh broken in spirit. An ugly temper pervades the farming community in many districts today. Many a man has been looking for some lightening of the burden he has had to carry. But the Governbushel ment has heaped on him the last straw, and I warn it that it will not come as surprise to me if in some of those districts which are so badly hit the men decide take the law into their own hands. I am not advising them to take this course, but it is hard for those who have worked hard for many years to stand idle with starvation staring them in the face. [27] There has been grumbling amongst a section of the workers because they have had to submit to a 10 per cent, reduction £ in wages. But what about the thousands of men on the land who have worked 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours every day for the 22,750 last twelve months for nothing, only to 1,000 find themselves deeper in debt by hundreds of pounds at the end of the year £150,750 than they were at the beginning of it ?",34
168,Mr YATES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"What about the 400,000 on men who are unemployed ? Many of them heshave had no work for years!",36
169,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Many of our community fly have been in good positions for years. They have enjoyed good wages and continuity of employment. But others have no work at all, and have had to live on on the dole. I sympathize with these. There is still another class of people. These have worked hard and received nothing for it ; I refer to the men on the I know of farmers in Victoria who Genhad a small taxable income for the and previous year, and are this year being upon to pay an unemployment tax, although they have no means at all. The storekeeper, the butcher, the the machinery firms, the fertilizer companies, and the cornsack merchants, are all clamouring for payment. In addition, there are municipal rates, rail rates, water rates, State and Federal land tax and Federal income tax to be paid. In many cases, also, mortgagees are waiting to get their interest. The majority of the wheat-farmers have nothing whatever with which to pay these bills. Last year 18,167,000 acres were sown to wheat. The previous highest seeding pay was 14,904,000 acres in 1929-30. From the season just closed we harvested, as as can be ascertained, 209,000,000 bushels of wheat, which gives an average yield of 11.28 bushels per acre. The f.o.b. value of wheat in Victoria today is 2s. 3id., which is equal to Is. 8d. per at country stations. After deducting the exchange charges it is worth only a Is. l^d. per bushel, and after deducting the cost of the containers, the cornsacks, to it is only worth lO^cl. per bushel. The average wheat yield for this year is l l i bushels, which is almost exactly the average for the past seventeen years. During that time 188,852,000 acres have been sown to wheat, and the gross yield has been 2,151,265,000 bushels, or an average of 11.4 bushels per acre. If we take H i bushels at Is; 8d. per bUshel at country sidings, less cornsacks at 3d. per busheh. we get the magnificent return of 16Si 3id. per acre to cover all Costs of rent, interest, ploughing-, scarifying, harrowing, seeding, manuring, harvesting, carting, &c., and the bulk of our wheat is grown on fallow land, which means a crop every two years, if the weather permits. Each crop has, therefore, to pay two years' interest or rent. I quote these figures merely to show the utter impossibility of continuing under present conditions. The farmers want something more than promises. The Government should set its house in order, live within its income, cut down its expenditure, remove the hindrances with which the farmer is beset, restore confidence, and abandon its fiduciary proposals. The people recognize that if the man on the land goes down, all others will go down with him, and 1 believe that they will admit the justice of the proposal put forward for a small sales tax on flour. Two things which the farmer must have are sustenance and fertilizers. In almost every instance he has seed> feed, and machinery; but without the wherewithal to provide sustenance and fertilizers, he cannot produce another cirop. It may be argued that wheat is not worth growing; vvbat then is he to do? Is he to abandon the land and live on the 'dole in the city? I am not one who believes that these low prices oan continue for any length of time, notwithstanding the f act that wheat growers the world over are in much the same position as we are here. I believe that if the Government will remove the hobbles that hinder us, and give us some practical help, with the object of removing our present disabilities, the wheat growers of Australia will prove to the people of this country, ana of the world, that they aTe not afraid to meet competition, Mo matter from whence it comes. Only remove our bonds, 'let us stand on our own feet, and give us a fighting cu!a'nce, and we will show what we can do. Are those engaged in the secondary industries prepared to make a similar declaration? The wheat-grower gets no benefits from the Arbitration Court. He aiid his family and workmen labour Under Mr Bill. conditions much worse than those of other industries, both as to hours and pay. The moment his wheat reaches the station the Unequal conditions apply. The lumper takes charge of the grain, and from that time until it reaches the consumer the labour employed in handling it is subject to Arbitration Court awards and provisions. This year machinery merchants obtained assignments over farmers' wheat to the exclusion of fertilizer companies, storekeepers, and others. These assignments were secured under threats that, where accounts were not paid, machines would be taken away, or duplicate parts would not be supplied, in which case the crops could not have been harvested. I Urge the Government to accept the suggestions put forward by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). What is to be done must be done quickly. No time should be lost. The farmers' immediate need is sustenance and superphosphate. Most of the growers have seed, feed for stock, and the necessary machinery. The Government's duty is clear. The growers have been patiently looking for assistance for months. How much longer must they wait? In con elusion, I shall read an editorial from the Manitoba'Free Press of the 6th December last, which describes 'the position of the wheat-farmer in Canada. While this article sets out the position of the prairie farmers in Canada, one cannot help feeling that in doing so, it just as accurately describes the position of the wheat-growers in Australia. It is headed, "" The Emergency in the WestThe Eealities of the Situation,"" and reads as follows:Canada, as everybody in the Dominion by this time is full y aware, is fighting with all the collective strength 'and intelligence she has, in a general trade and industrial 'depression on a scale, and of a gravity not hitherto encountered during her history as an organized and progressive country. In Western Canada the depression has hit agriculture, and as agriculture is the foundation on which the west has been built, and by which the western - social structure is maintained, a serious depression in western agriculture has adverse consequences on the fortunes of the West country. That is, upon ourselves in Manitoba, and on our neighbours tin the provinces of Saskatchewan .and Alberta. The facts as they are now affecting us can. in some degree, be Stated simply and witli accuracy. All of the west has grown up on the large-scale production and export sale of cereal grains; wheat being the great cornerstone of the farming edifice. What is happening in Western Canada can begin to be measured by what is happening to Canadian wheat, and that can be seen by comparing the prices wheat was fetching one year ago, and what it is fetching today. Grain prices, as published in the grain tables, do not represent the amount of money the farmer receives for his grain; they represent considerably more, and this has to be allowed for when! discussing what the farmer actually is getting. The comparative figures, taken from the tables, and in round numbers only, are as follows:No. 1 Northern cash wheat, December 4th, 1929, 1.43 dollars (5s. l l j d . ) ; same date this year,. 1930, .60 dollars (2s. 6d.) Ifro m these figures there would have to be deducted some seventeen cents (8Jd.) for average freight and other charges, and the farmer today getting the quoted price of 60 cents a bushel for Noi 1 Northern wheat would, actually receive,, in. cash, 43 cents (Is. 94d.)These are the prices for the top qualities. When the wheat grades lower than No. I Northern, or when it is "" tough "" or damaged, the price falls in proportion to the lower quality. Fully one-third of. all western wheat delivered during. November, graded "" tough ""\ which meant a further reduction to the farmer of about three cents. The farmer, therefore, whose wheat was graded No. 1 Northern tough last month received in actual money 40 cents a bushel for what he sold. grade was No. 2, or No. 3, or No. 4, the price came lower stall. These are the prices as they affect the individua l farmer, and represent his cash income for his year's work in wheat. Taking the larger figures, which show the relation of wheat sales to the national income, the following comparisons t e l l the story:From August to October, 1929 - Wester n farmers delivered, to country elevators 173,891,000 bushels: net money valuation of this wheat, 220,546,101 dollars. For the same period of this year, 1930Tliere were delivered 17.9,650,000 bushels, with a net valuation of 107,359,511 dollars-. For six million more bushelsdelivered this year the valuation, therefore, is well over a hundred and thirteen million dollars less. This represents the shrinkage in. value of the stocks1 of wheat we still, have to-offer. We may be able to sell them, but on the basis of the above figures, we must sell them for less than last year; the goods on the national shelf have fallen in value. On what has been sold we can find the comparison, tooFrom August to September, 1929, sale of Canadian wheat and wheat flour totalled approximately 45,000,000 bushels, valued at nearly 04,000,000 dollars. For the same period this year, 1930, exports of wheat and flour were approximately 85,000,000 bushels-, valued at 711,000,000 dollars. These figures represent commercial transactions, actual trading and sales, and they show that in three months of this year, 1930, we exported over 40,000,000 bushels of wheat and flour more than we exported during the same three months in 1929, and received only. 7,000)000 more dollars in return; which, on the comparison of the two prices;, means that in 1930 we sold 40,000;000 bushels of wheat for 7,000,000dollars. These figuresdemonstrate clearly two facts; first, the buying power of 1 the western farmer has been more than cut in t w o ; and, secondly, the Dominion of Canada has suffered a loss of 51,000,000 dollars on the export of approximately 25 per cent, of her surplus, wheat on the basis of last, year's values. These are part of the statistics of the situation with which Western Canada has been at grips for months, and wit h which we must all' be prepared to grapple with increasing vigor as the months come on. The national income has shrunk. Translated into human terms what does this mean?' Western Canada is one of the strongest and best endowed areas on the world's surface. Its people have hadsteady prosperity for many years.. They have created an agricultural empire on the great western plain, which extends to the foot of the Rockies. They have built great cities, such as our own city of Winnipeg; their industry has enormously enriched the entire dominion, and they have accumulated capital reserves which even in this crisis enable them to face the future with courage and without panic. Rut it is a crisis. It is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude, When the world-wide in its complications,, and this gigantic depression, which has h it our country like an earthquake, and against which our people: areas helpless as though it were a plague blown, down on them from, the air, is beginning to strike disastrously into our communities. Shrinkage by hundreds of millions in the national income means straitened conditions throughout the country. We are now ; at the place where actual physical suffering may be forseen as the crisis continues. Shortage of food, of clothing, and of fuel, whole districts, perhaps up against destitution, with, nothing coming in from the crops, and the rigors of winter now upon them. The country is bursting with wheat and grain and fuel and resources of every description, and yet by the inexplicable operation of world conditions our western people, in considerable numbers, may be caught and. squeezed in the iron pincers of a poverty they do not in the least deserve to suffer. The situation is emergent. It is partly on us now, and it will have to be faced and dealt with as a national responsibility and as a national duty. There will be many districts able to stand thiswinter's siege on their own resources, but there will be weaker districts needing help, and there will be necessitous cases in the better-situation communities who will need help too-wh o may be needing it now, And help, by one device or another, will' have to be provided. There is danger of large-scale suffering on the western plains this year, and the equipment to relieve it should at this moment bei n preparation, or in readiness. The emergency constitutes a national condition with which the Federal Government will have to grapple as a problem in relief. It is not a question of politics, or of who may be to blame. It is a question of devising remedial machinery for the prevention of a catastrophe which, if allowed to develop, may shake the country to its roots. The west is looking to Ottawa for action. Time is running on. The action should be immediate, comprehensive and sympathetic to the struggles the west itself is making to fight its way through to more solid ground. The Government is well aware that it is unable to finance the scheme. When the bill is in committee I intend to submit certain amendments in order to throw upon the Government full responsibility for its failure to assist our wheat-growers. I shall move for the omission of clause 4 with a view to providing that a bounty of 6d. a bushel shall be payable upon all wheat of the season 1930-31 sold or delivered for sale before the 31st October, 1931, but not payable upon wheat sold for seed purposes or used for seed. If this amendment is accepted, I shall move for the insertion of a new clause to provide for the imposition of a sales tax at the rate of £2 10s. per ton of 2,000 lbs. upon the sale of flour, meal or other gristed products of wheat for home consumption. The revenue to be derived from this tax will be applied exclusively to the repayment of moneys borrowed under the provisions of this bill and to the payment of interest and administrative charges.",36
170,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Will the tax be paid by the millers?,39
171,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,They will be held responsible for the tax in respect of all sales.,39
172,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,But will they be able to pass it on to the general public ?,39
173,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yes . My proposal simply means that if, prior to the imposition of the tax, flour is quoted at £6 5s. it will be sold at £S 15s.  honourable members opposite will support that amendment?",39
174,Mr HILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"We shall see when the bill is in committee. I intend to give the Minister an opportunity to put himself right with the wheat-growers of Australia. They expect this Government to bring forward a practical proposal. If the Minister will father the amendment which I have outlined, I will stand behind him.",39
175,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Kennedy) [6.10] Honourable members opposite are now bewailing the fate of our primary producers. They were not so much concerned last year when the Wheat Marketing Bill, introduced by this Government to provide for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, was before another place. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) has just indicated an amendment which, he suggests, will test the bona fides of the  Moloney). If he and his friends are really concerned about the welfare of our primary producers, why did not they bring pressure to bear upon members of another place last year? The farmers will welcome this scheme, which will make available to them £6,000,000 of currency, negotiable in Australia, and storekeepers in all States, to whom primary producers are heavily in debt, will be glad of the relief which it will afford them. What objection can there be to this proposal as against the raising of £6,000,000 in an unfavorable market at 6 per cent, or 6^ per cent.? Our wheat-growers are in a desperate plight owing to the collapse of overseas markets. Honourable members declared last year that the Government could not finance its proposal to pay a guarantee of 4s. a bushel. On that point all I wish to say is, it was the responsibility of the Government to find the money, and they would have done their part if honourable members opposite had brought pressure on their friends in another place to pass the bill. Reference has been made in this debate to the position of wheat-growers in Queensland. The State Government is paying 4s. a bushel for wheat, and bread is as cheap in Queensland as in any other part of Australia.  is favor of our proposal to impose a sales tax on flour.",39
176,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The Queensland Government, acting under powers conferred upon it by the Sugar Acquisition Act, has commandeered all flour from the millers, and is able to pay wheat-growers an additional 2s. a bushel for wheat sold for home consumption. Other State Governments could do likewise, and wheat growers throughout the Commonwealth could get an additional 4d. a bushel without any guarantee from the Government. What has been done in Queensland is due largely to legislation passed by a previous Labour administration. Honourable members opposite for many years supported a government which took no action to organize the marketing of our primary products. This Government has been in office for only eighteen months.",39
177,Unknown,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,40
178,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The Opposition seems to be very worried as to where the money would have come from to finance the wheat pool had the Government's Wheat Marketing Bill been passed over twelve months ago. I remind them that the responsibility for raising that money rested upon the Government, which had received an assurance of support from the Commonwealth Bank authorities. In another place the friends of honourable members opposite threw out the bill, for reasons which are well known to honourable members both on this side of the House and on the other. The agitation against the bill did not come from the farmers, but from those who have been farming the farmers all their lives. The middle-men moved heaven and earth to have the bill defeated. The so-called representatives of the farmers in another place answered the crack of the whip, and did the bidding of the middle-men because those middle-men supply their party funds at election time. Their troubles about the farmer! Honourable members opposite say that the Government sent the bill to the Senate knowing that it would be defeated. What an opportunity the Opposition, in the Senate had of putting the Government in a hole, simply by passing the bill! Had that bill been passed through the Senate, the farmers would now be receiving 4s. a bushel for their wheat, the people would be paying no more for their bread, and the Government would have been able to finance the whole scheme at very small loss. Such loss as was incurred would have been more than compensated for by the fact that the farmers would have money to spend, and would be able to provide employment for those out of work. At the present time the price of flour is down to bedrock. The farmers, for whom honourable members opposite are pleading, are unable to sell their wheat, yet bread in Sydney is 5^d. a 2-lb. loaf, and 6d. a loaf booked. The price of flour is lower than it has been for a number of years. The price of bread at Cloncurry, in Northern Queensland, is hardly more than at Sydney, although the flour used in Cloncurry has to be carried by boat from Sydney or Brisbane up the coast to Townsville, and then railed 500 miles inland. Who is getting the rake-off? Not the farmer, who gets no more for his wheat, and certainly not the people, since they are not getting cheap bread. Those who have benefited are the persons who were lobbying the Senate just before the wheat pool bill was defeated twelve months ago. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who stated his case broadly and without party feeling, said that he was not going to support the bill.",40
179,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I did not say that.,40
180,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Well , the honourable member said that he would not support the Government's financial proposals which are essential to finance this bill. The Government has endeavoured by negotiation with the Commonwealth Bank authorities to finance some scheme for helping the wheat-farmers. Some of the negotiations were conducted by these two heaven-born statesmen, who are now chasing about the country conducting a campaign against the Government. We had them with us for eighteen months, and they were not able to do anything for the farmers. If they are able to do anything to save themselves, let alone the nation, within the next three months, I shall be very surprised: This matter of assistance to the wheat farmers has been frequently before the House. I remember on one occasion the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), speaking on the adjournment of the House, said that the Government had an obligation to do something to assist the primary producers. His remarks were supported by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons), and other members on this side of the House. They pointed out that the farmers had been asked to grow more wheat on the understanding that they would receive 4s. a bushel for it . Members of the Senate practically gave an undertaking to the Government that the Senate would pass the necessary legislation. However, the Opposition in the Senate had no qualms about repudiating that undertaking. Ever since this Government assumed office it has been hampered by party intrigue. In the eyes of honourable members opposite, nothing it has done is right. Every measure it has sent forward to the Senate has been defeated. It is strange that members of the Opposition in this House can state quite definitely that our financial proposals will not be agreed to by the Senate. Is the Senate an independent chamber, or is it not? Can it be said that the Senate did its duty by the country and by the primary producers when it turned down the Government's proposal for the assistance of the wheat-farmers, a proposal for which the Government was to accept financial responsibility? When the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) was Acting Prime Minister, he appealed to the banks tofinancethe wheat pool. After the wheat pool bill was defeated, the honourable member for Wimmera, and other honourable members representing wheat-growing constituencies, met at a non-party conference, and decided to approach the banking authorities to see if something could be done for pay income tax. the assistance of the farmers. The banks very generously offered to guarantee a price which was about 7^-d. a bushel less than, could at that time have been obtained for wheat in the world's markets. The Labour party was prepared to guarantee the farmers 4s. a bushel for their wheat and the Commonwealth Bank undertook to finance the proposal. Subsequently, when the proposal for guaranteeing the farmers 3s. a bushel was submitted to the bank board, it was turned down. Who, I ask, is to lay down the policy of this Government, the Commonwealth Bank Boara, or the elected representatives of the people in Parliament? Representative government becomes merely a. mockery if governments are to be dictated to by banking authorities. Objection was taken by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill), to the methods by which the price Mr Biordan. Government's proposal for helping tha farmers is to be financed. I am not surprised at that. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) must remember that the then Opposition took exception to the Fisher Government's financial proposals, which involved the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank, and when a Commonwealth note issue was proposed they declared that ""Fisher's flimsies"" would not be worth 2s. each at the end of a few months. Later, when the war broke out, those same notes were found to be worth a great deal. The Government now proposes, instead of burdening the people with a loan of £18,000,000, to issue notes to finance its schemes for assisting the farmers, and for the relief of unemployment. This does not savour of heaping burdens on the primary producer, as complained of by the honourable member for Wimmera.",40
181,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I said that the Government was placing burdens on the primary producer through the sales tax and primage duty.,41
182,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"If the farmers are in as bad a position as the honorablo member claims, they cannot be paying anything, either in sales tax or primage duty. You cannot get blood out of a stone. If a man has no income he cannot  sacks is a heavy burden on the primary producers.",41
183,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The Sales Tax Act was passed only a few months ago, and it is possible under that legislation to give relief to any section deserving of it. I believe that the farmers should be given relief. The Government has always been sympathetic to those who have difficulty in paying taxation. Special treatment has been granted, for instance, to selectors and graziers in my electorate who have been unable to pay income tax for which they were assessed immediately preceding a severe drought. They were sent before appeal boards, and they have been treated with leniency by the department. No effort has ever been made by any government other than a Labour government to assure primary producers satisfactory prices for their products on the one hand, or, on the other, to control the at which the product was offered to the consumers. In Queensland the farmers have their own marketing organizations; they are practically in charge of their own wheat marketing arrangements, while the Cane Prices Board, on which the farmers have representation, fixes the price which they receive for their cane. The wheat farmers receive a fixed price for their wheat, and the public are not exploited when they buy bread. These things have been done through legislation passed by Labour governments. Mr M . CAMERON - It is of no use the honourable member quoting what has been done in Queensland, because there is hardly enough wheat grown in that State to supply its own requirements.",41
184,Mr BIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Of course the honourable member objects to my quoting anything which does not suit his case. I maintain that the experience of Queensland has proved that the farmers can be guaranteed 4s. a bushel for their wheat without the consumers being charged exorbitant prices for their bread. The honourable member for Echuca referred to the prices of wheat, flour and bread, but he would not, I think, agree to any proposals for fixing the price of flour, because that would hit the class which contributes to his party funds. There are two schools of thought among members of the Opposition-the Nationalists, who do not believe in fixing at all, and the members of the Country party, who believe in fixing the price of wheat, but who are not prepared to carry the thing to its logical conclusion. The honourable member for Wimmera is prepared to support the Government in financing the farmers to the extent of 6d. a bushel on their wheat, but he refuses to do anything for the country's 300,000 unemployed, and rejects the proposal of the Government to make available £.1,000,000 a month to relieve unemployment. The project of the Government to raise £18,000,000 by means of a fiduciary issue, £12,000,000 of which would relieve unemployment, aud the remaining £6,000,000 finance our wheat-growers, would give all sections of the community considerably enhanced purchasing power, which is so badly needed at this juncture. Surely it is admitted by all that the case of the unemployed is even worse than that of the farmers. They are unable to obtain credit, and in many cases have not a roof over their heads. Only the other day I received a letter from a man in the Canberra Hospital, asking me to send him along a little tobacco. He hails from Burketown, and is one of the finest workers I know. The whole thing is tragic. Let honourable members go to Vaucluse, Sydney, and see the unemployed camped under the sandhills. It is a crying shame to any government. The honourable member for Echuca cleverly tries to place the responsibility upon the Minister for Markets and Transport. Most of the present trouble arises from that very desire to shift the blame on to the shoulders of some other person. There is too much wrangling among those who should be endeavouring to overcome the difficulties that confront the nation. This Government proved its sincerity by taking upon itself the responsibility of introducing the Wheat Marketing Bill. The measure was rejected in another place. That fact cannot be burked. Honourable members of the Opposition are seeking to undermine the Government by tempting its supporters to cross the floor of the House. To any member of the Labour party who is prepared to shirk his duty, they offer immunity from Nationalist attack and price- support at the next election. They will go to any lengths to push the Government out of power. Despite their intrigue, the Government will continue in office. Only recently in Western Australia, Senator Colebatch debated the Fiduciary Notes Bill with a member of the Labour party before an audience of some 300 farmers, who overwhelmingly declared in favour of the measure. "" Happy Harry "", from Henty, smiles. His smile will be a wry one when the farmers and the people generally deal with the honourable member at the next election. He is one of those "" farmers "" who farm the farmer. The honourable member for Wimmera suggests the appointment of a committee. What for? This Government is specifically offering the farmers a bounty of 6d. a bushel on their wheat.",42
185,Mr GREGORY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"No , 4^d. a bushel.",42
186,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Clause 5 of the bill reads "" The rate of bounty payable under this Act shall be 6d. per bushel.""",43
187,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"That is only on wheat exported from Australia, which will amount to 75 per cent, of our total production.",43
188,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"For the moment I am ignoring home consumption. The important thing is to give our farmers an immediate bounty of 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus so that they may purchase their seed and fertilizers for the coming year. Then we may deal with home consumption, fix the price of wheat for local milling, and so give a guarantee to the farmers on wheat consumed locally, without increasing the cost to the consumer. The honourable member for Echuca supports a sales tax on flour, which proposition he is putting up to the Minister for Markets. That is a very astute political move, but, though it may give the honourable member'fi party a considerable amount of kudos, it will not give the farmers any money. The Queensland Government was able to guarantee 4s. a bushel for wheat produced in that State, without resorting to any sales tax on flour. Mr M . CAMEBON - Queenslan d has no exportable surplus of wheat.",43
189,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I am dealing now with the home consumption. In Queensland wheat is bringing 2s. a bushel more than world's parity. A similar price could be fixed for the whole of Australia, and a guarantee of 4s. given on wheat used for home consumption. That would mean an additional 4d. a bushel on the f armer's exportable surplus.",43
190,Mr HUGHES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,What is the price of flour in Queensland?,43
191,Mr RIORDAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Considerabl y higher than it is in New South Wales. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons) informs me that it is £12 10s. a ton. The cost of a 2-lb. loaf of bread in Queensland is 5-Jd - A similar price is charged in Sydney for cash, 6d. being booked cost; and that, notwithstanding the fact that flour is only £10 a ton in the southern State. It has to be freighted up to Queensland. There must be a fair rake-off for the southern middlemen. Because of the price fixing legislation which operates in Queensland, bread sells in Townsville at the same price as it does in Brisbane, while as far out as Mount Isa the cost is only I d . a loaf dearer. During bread price wars I have seen it as low as 4d. to 4£d. a 2-lb. loaf. The Queensland marketing boards operate at very little cost to the people, and similar organizations could be instituted for the whole of Australia. Honourable members will remember that when the Wheat Marketing Bill was being debated the lobbies were well packed with representatives of South Australian and New South Wales middle men, who urged members to resist the measure. We were inundated with sheaf after sheaf of letters claiming that the farmers would be ruined if the bill were passed. That had its effect in another place, and, as a result, the farmers have received no assistance, and are now in a precarious position. This Government should go further than it proposes to do and guarantee the farmers a price for their wheat over a number of years. There will be fluctuations in the price of the grain, but during boom periods the amount in excess of the guarantee could be placed in a trust fund and utilized to meet losses during lean years. The methods of finance proposed by the Government are encountering the serious objection of honourable members opposite. It is merely a repetition of the old, old story. I have already referred to the Jeremiahs who decried the banking legislation introduced by the late Mr. Andrew Fisher, and have related how scornfully his "" flimsies"" were received. The success of that legislation is now history. Whenever a government encroaches upon the preserves of private banking and insurance interests it meets with hostility from every section of the Nationalist press and organizations. Recently, half a dozen members have seceded from the ranks of the Federal Labour party. Later they will have much spare time on their hands in which to repent. The man who acted as Prime Minister during the absence of Mr Scullin, and his colleague who acted as Treasurer were always crying a poor mouth. When discussing the matter with his "" better half "" the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) said "" We have no money, but we have a lot of principle "". Yet those very same gentlemen have just appointed a publicity agent to their diminutive party at a salary of £1,200 a year; a man who was previously receiving £900 a year from this Government for similar work. Assuredly the task of balancing their budget will be a difficult one. Such methods of finance are beyond me. Evidently, there is a fairy godfather watching over them. While theso "" saviours of the country "" expound their theories on finance, the workers and the primary producers may starve, and be hanged. This party has but one policy, to assist those in need. The Opposition is seeking desperately, but ineffectively, to put the Government out of office before it can give effect to its policy. Despite all obstacles the Government will assist the unemployed and the primary producers, and do its utmost to make order out of the chaos that reigns after seven years of Nationalist government, dictated by business interests.",43
192,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Darling Downs) [8.29]. - I made my attitude on this issue very clear when I spoke some weeks ago on the no confidence motion that was then before the House. At that time. I took the opportunity to say that I was opposed to this proposal, both on its merits and because it is based on afinancialprinciple that is hound to end in failure. The Government knows as well as does the Opposition that the measure has no possible chance of becoming law.",44
193,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Why not?,44
194,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"It has been said from this side of the chamber and it is known in every political quarter by those who give any thought to such matters, that this legislation has no chance whatever of getting through another place. That is as well known to the Government as it is to the Opposition and that is why I question the sincerity of Ministers in this particular respect. The only possible course open to the Government to help the wheat-growers of Australia in the crisis through which they are now passing is one which it has studiously refused to follow. This is the third attempt in this Parliament to render some assistance to the wheat-growers. The first, a bill to prolegislation. vide a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, was an ignominious failure.",44
195,Mr KEANE,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Why ?,44
196,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Because the bill was rejected by another place. I was one of those who voted for the measure, and if the same conditions existed today I should do so again. Then I had some faith in the sincerity of Ministers. To-day I have positively no faith in their sincerity. The second attempt, a bill to guarantee 3s. a bushel to the wheat-grower, ended in an equally ignominious failure. And now we have this third proposal to provide £6,000,000 to help the farmers, not with real money, but with fiduciary notes which we know will be so much rotten paper as soon as they are issued. When interrupted by an interjection, I was saying that the only possible course the Government could have followed to render useful assistance to the farmers was one it had not taken. That course was to impose a sales tax or excise duty on flour. When the matter was brought up earlier in the evening by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Gibbous) interjected that the State of New South Wales had imposed a tax on flour, but that it had given no assistance to the farmers of the State. I am not in a position to question the honourable member's assertion, but I can say that a similar policy when applied in Queensland rendered substantial assistance to the wheat-growers of that State. I believe that if the Commonwealth Government had had the courage to implement a similar policy a similar degree of assistance would have been afforded to the wheat-farmers of Australia generally, The position in Queensland is quite well known. Having absolutely no faith in the Commonwealth Government's proposals to help the wheat-growers, the Moore Government took steps to implement a sales tax on flour on the lines of an excise duty, and today the position of the Queensland wheat-farmers is better than that of the farmers of the other States.",44
197,Mr MABTENS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"And it has been for a very long time now, thanks to Labour",44
198,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I am not so blind as not to realise that the Government of Queensland has opportunities to help the farmers of the State that are not available to the other Governments of Australia, but the principle for which I am contending remains unaltered. Queensland Government, exasperated at the failure of the Commonwealth Government to do anything useful for the wheat-growers, implemented a tax on flour and has thereby succeeded in rendering very valuable assistance to the farmers of the State. I do not propose to repeat remarks I have made upon this subject on other occasions in this House, but in passing I may say that we shall never have a prosperous country until our primary producers are prosperous. That, I think, is axiomatic. However much we may disagree as to details, that root principle remains unchallenged. The only reason for giving to any section of the community anything beyond what it can get in the open market is the fact that it is handicapped by costs of production. That the farmer needs assistance is definitely established. He is facing a crisis; he is confronted today with conditions such as he has hitherto never faced; he is asking for assistance; he expects it and by all the canons of right doing and justice he ought to get it. The causes that have broiight him into his present position may be grouped under many headings, including not only the cost of labour on the farm, but also many costs away from the farm, which press very heavily upon him, such as handling charges; railway freights; shipping; loading; costs of machinery; supplies, and interest. He has to pay rates of Wages fixed without any regard to the economic conditions that prevail today. The cumulative effect of all these being, ing on the farmer with such undue severity, makes it necessary to apply, shall I call them, adventitious aids, or at any rate the aids which we are seeking to bring to his relief. Any one with a knowledge of the subject knows that the farmer works fifteen hours a day and for much less than the basic wage. Whatever conditions are laid down by arbitration tribunals he has still to keep his nose to the grindstone and work out his own salvation. Tariff-mongering has produced conditions that press unduly heavily upon him. He lacks the shelter afforded to almost every other worker in the community. He labours under all The these difficulties, yet the present Government has nothing better to offer him than the political shoddy contained in this bill.",45
199,Mr MAKTENS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,And the honourable member would not even have that.,45
200,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I have said it before, and I say definitely now, that I would not have it under any circumstances. Mr CUSACK: - Ye t the honourable member claims to represent farmers.",45
201,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I do, and I am prepared to do all that is humanly possible to assist them, but I refuse to make myself a party to any attempt to further mislead them. On three separate occasions this Government has misled them, and has brought about a state of turmoil among them which is a positive discredit to it. I believe that it will continue to mislead them so long as it remains in office, and so I propose to take a definite stand against this bill, hoping that it will not be long before we get the present Ministry off the treasury bench. We shall then have an opportunity to implement measures that will give the farmer some definite, real relief. That he will never get from this Government. The theory of honourable members opposite seems to be that civil servants and workers who are unionists must be sheltered and must get their bread at a price which will leave the farmer no hope of profit. The only workers in this country who seem to be regarded as not requiring some degree of shelter are the very people who, as I have said before, are entitled to a greater degree of help than any other section, because they are press- unduly handicapped by heavy costs of production. I repeat that we shall not get back to any degree of prosperity in this country until our primary producers are prosperous. No Administration has so misled the primary producers as this Government has done. This proposal to provide £6,000,000 of fiduciary notes for the assistance of the farmers is absolutely insincere.",45
202,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Hon. Norman Makin). - The honourable member is not in order in stating that the proposal of the Government is insincere. I ask him to withdraw the statement. Mr MORGAN"" - I withdraw the allegation of insincerity; nevertheless, I believe that the proposal to offer £6,000,000 of rotten paper money to the farmers is beneath contempt. Despite what has been said by Government supporters I know that the right thinking section of the farmers recognize that the offer is worthless, and will not help them in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if this scheme is implemented, it will do the farming community, and incidentally the commercial community, incalculable harm. It is not a serious attempt to help the farmers, and is not so regarded by them. In view of the fact that, although the bill may be accepted by this House, it will not have the slightest chance of being passed in another place, I question the seriousness of the Government in submitting it. Relief for the primary producers is imperative and urgent and something must be done. Ever since this Parliament was elected this matter has been trifled with. The Government has worried itself with various legislative proposals, but the net result has been nil. ""We have heard from this side of the House, and from the ministerial bench, that the farmers are in such dire straits that the Commonwealth must go to their aid immediately; yet we never get past, and are not likely to get past, the stage of talk. This Government will merely continue to repeat that something must be done, and nothing will be done. The fact is that unless the Government is prepared to impose a sales tax or excise duty on flour, it will have not the least prospect of achieving anything to relieve the farmers, and all its protestations of concern will continue to ring hollow in the ears of the people. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was generous enough to express appreciation of the sincerity of the Government in its attitude towards this subject, but my conviction is that there is no sincerity in it at all.",46
203,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Order ! The honorduring able member has already been called order for charging the Government with insincerity, and he is now aggravating his offence. I again call upon him to withdraw the statement and to apologize for having repeated it.",46
204,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I am sorry for having unconsciously repeated an expression to which you, Mr Speaker, have taken exception: I withdraw it and apologize. I regard this measure as a contemptible bribe-a n electioneering ruse to benefit the Government at the expense of the primary producers, particularly the wheat-growers. I dislike it generally, and I have no faith in it because the financial legislation to which it is attached has no possible chance of being accepted by this Parliament. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, as a proposal for the relief of the farmers, the bill is an absolute farce.",46
205,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Indi) [8.52] - The sensible and practical speeches of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) were in marked contrast to the observations of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan), who has just resumed his seat. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was careful not to introduce party bias into his speech, and severely castigated honourable members on either side whose interjections were calculated to arouse party feeling.",46
206,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I suppose the honourable member's attitude is entirely non-party ? . Mr JONES - It is, and I suggest to honourable members that this is preeminently a measure that should be submitted in a non-party spirit, because all parties are agreed that the position of the wheat-farmer is deplorable. The  Moloney) has on several occasions availed himself of the valuable advice and assistance of the honourable members for Wimmera and Echuca, both of whom are generally recognized as authorities on the wheat-growing industry. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Morgan) referred to the £6,000,000 that this bill offers to the farmers as ""rotten paper money"". I remind him that the war approximately to £400,000,000 worth of this so-called ""rotten paper money"" was raised in Australia. If that amount of fiduciary currency could be issued to help Australia play its part in the war, why cavil at a mere £6,000,000 to help the farmers out of the desperate plight in which they are today? Members of the Opposition would have us believe that the issue of £6,000,000 of paper money to lift the farmers out of their desperate position would r u in Australia, but if "" rotten paper money"" was good enough to finance the war surely it should be good enough to meet the existing emergency in the wheat-growing industry. I can see no justification for opposition to a proposal to raise £6,000,000 for the purpose of lift in g the farmers out of the mire. The Government's first legislative proposal for the assistance of wheat growers was the Wheat Marketing Bill which proposed a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for f.a.q. wheat at railway sidings. The offer of such a guarantee was justified by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) who, speaking on the second reading of the Wheat Marketing Bill , said:Having regard to the difficulties of the existing situation, and the invitations of the governments in those States in which wheat is grown, I am prepared to support the guarantee of a minimum price of 4s. a bushel for this season's crop. To-day the Deputy Leader (Mr Gullett) said that the rejection of that bill was the best thing, that ever happened Australia. The honourable member for Wimmera on the other hand said that the bill was "" unfortunately defeated another place."" Clearly, the honourable member differs from the Deputy of the Opposition. The latter whence the money could have obtained to finance the 4s. offered by the Government., He chooses to overlook the fact that the scheme to which he and his leader subscribed would have involved the Commonwealth much greater loss than would have arisen under the Wheat Marketing Bill. wheat harvest for last season was approximately 205,000,000 bushels. If we allow 15,000,000 for seed wheat and fowl food, 190,000,000 bushels is left, of which 33,000,000 bushels would have been required for Australian consumption, leaving 157,000,000 bushels available for export. The guarantee under the wheat Mr Jones. marketing scheme would have involved the Commonwealth in a loss of approximately 2s. a bushel on probably 157,000,000 bushels; no loss would have been sustained in respect of the 33,000,000 bushels gristed in Australia because the home market price would have been controlled by the pool. The scheme endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy would have caused a loss of 2s. a bushel on 190,000,000 bushels, because the guarantee would have applied to all wheat marketed and no machinery was contemplated for the regulation of the home consumption price. Therefore, the loss under the Government's scheme would have been less than under the proposal of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked where the money would have come from to finance the Government's guarantee of 4s. a bushel. I ask hi m whence the money would have come to finance the greater loss that would have been involved in the proposal to which he and his leader subscribed. The Leader of the Opposition, having said in his second-reading speech that he was prepared to support a minimum price of 4s. a bushel for this season's crop, went on to sayI conclude by distinguishing again between the two proposals of the bill-the guarantee of 4s. a bushel which I am prepared to support and the compulsory pool to which I am to strongly opposed. There was then no question about raising in. the money to finance the Government'9 proposal. All that the Leader of the Leader Opposition objected to was the compulasked sory pool. He desired that the provision beeu for a compulsory pool should be kept guarantee separate from the legislation providing for a minimum price of 4s. a bushel, and to that end he moved the following amendment:in a This House is of the opinion that while present circumstances justify a guarantee by The the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of a minimum price of 4s. a bushel for f.a.q. wheat, season 1930-31, delivered at rail sidings, legislation providing for such a guarantee sliould be introduced separately from any legislation providing for the establishment of a monopoly in the marketing of Australian wheat by means of a compulsory pool. The wording of that amendment shows plainly that the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to support the payment of minimum price of 4s. a bushel for wheat. He further statedIf the Government persists in joining guarantee with the compulsory pool, thus priving the farmer of his freedom and of opportunities for selling his production through any of the various agencies which at present exist, I shall be compelled to oppose the bill. The ground on which the Leader of the Opposition opposed the Wheat Marketing Bill was the association of the compuldesperate sory pool with the guarantee of 4s. a bushel. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) at that time said I intend to support the amendment of Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), provides that the Coinmoniwealth shall guaranway tee the price and itself meet any loss that be incurred. Where did the honourable member expect issue to find the money for that guarantee?",46
207,Mr GREGORY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,We had the assurance of the Treasurer that the money could found.,48
208,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Honourable members opposite knew that the money could found, and had the bill passed through another place the wheat-farmers would land? today be obtaining 4s. a bushel for their wheat. Probably a measure of inflation tion of Australia. would have been indulged in, of which the public would have heard little or nothing about. The Wheat Marketing Bill was passed through this chamber and rejected by another place. I congratulate the Country party in this House on having supported a Labour Government on that occasion. The only opposition to the bill came from members of the Nationalist party. The next effort of the Commonwealth Government to assist the wheat-farmers was the introduction of a bill providing for a guarantee of 3s. a bushel. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) asked this - afternoon what had happened to that legislation. I understand that the Commonwealth Bank's legal advisers tinue questioned the validity of the measure safeguard the bank against any loss incurred uuder the guarantee, and for that reason it did not function. Government is now proposing to assist the farmers by a fiduciary issue of £6,000,000.. It was said this afternoon that, although this Government has as a attempted to assist the farmers, little or nothing has been done in that direction. But it is not the fault of this Govern the ment that something has not been done defor the farmers. They are in a desperate the position, but it cannot be denied that the Government is also in a desperate position in its effort to find the necessary finance to assist them. This proposal to raise £6,000,000 is a drastic remedy to meet a situation. Why should we cavil at raising a loan of £6,000,000 to assist the wheat-farmers in their terrible plight? We raised loans amounting the to £380,000,000 for Australia's operawhich tions in the Great War, without in any involving this country in financial may disaster. In view of that, why should the raising of £6,000,000 by a fiduciary be likely to bring Australia to ruin ? We are more likely to have financial disaster if we fail to assist the wheatbe growers. The security for this issue of £6,000,000 will be the keeping of the farmers on their holdings, and the be guarantee of future crops. What will happen if the farmers are forced off the",48
209,Mr MCNEILL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It will mean the ruina,48
210,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Of course it will. The honourable member for Echuca said this afternoon that many farmers would this year be compelled to put in crops without superphosphates. I understand that the Victorian Governmeut is assisting farmers in necessitous circumstances by guaranteeing payment for 50,000 tons of superphosphates to be delivered to necessitous farmers, who would otherwise be unable to obtain supplies because of the manufacturers insisting upon cash on delivery. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) has said that the farmers want real money. I contend that this fiduciary issue, if it enables the farmers to put in their crops and to conon their holdings, will be real money to to them. They wish for nothing .more real than that, and they are not likely to take much notice of the bogies that have been The raised by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) that costs of production should be reduced far as possible to enable the farmers to export their wheat at a profit. I also agree that there is a moral obligation on the Government to 'help the farmers. The Commonwealth and State Governments appealed to them to grow more wheat. They responded loyally and now that wheat prices have collapsed it is up to the .Government to see that the farmers receive a return covering at least the cost of production.",48
211,Mr MORGAN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Why has not the Government done something for the farmers ?,49
212,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Because it has been thwarted in every direction by the party to which the honourable member belongs. The farmers themselves realise that position and refuse to tolerate it any longer. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that the primary producer should be assisted in every way by means of the tariff. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) has asked why should the farmers complain of the sales tax, seeing that they have no-sales. They have no sales because of the primage unities and other burdens under which they are labouring today. Therefore, as tar as possible, the farmers should be given every assistance by means of the tariff. Certain honourable members qpposite who, when the Wheat Marketing Bill was before the House, were prepared to support the proposal to guarantee 4s. a bushel for wheat at railway sidings, are nqw contending that the scheme was fantastic; but it is easy to be wise after the event. The honourable member for Darling Downs referred to the fiduciary issue as rotten paper money, but let me remind him that Australia was able to play its part in the Great War only by raising a loan of £380,000,000-most of it fiduciary mpney. That loan did not ruin Australia, so there is no reason to suppose that the raising of a mere £6,000,000 to relieve the desperate plight of the wheat-farmers of Australia is likely to have any harmful effect upon this country,",49
213,Mr KILLEN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Riverina) [9.13]-The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr for Stewart) and the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) have ably and fully stated the case for Government assistance to the wheat industry. The pictures tha they drew of the deplorable conditions of the wheat-farmers were in no way exaggerated. Their references to the Victorian farmers apply equally to the wheat farmers of New South Wales, and particularly those of the dryer districts. The western part of the Riverina has suffered three successive years of drought. Many farmers have grown no wheat at all. Others have obtained only small crops, some quarter crops, and a few half crops. The average throughout those three years of drought would not be anything like a quarter crop. Last year throughout the greater part of the season the rains came and the crops in a great part of the Riverina were good; but in the western part, because of the lack of spring rains, the crops, to a great extent, failed, and the farmers there suffered their fourth year of drought, many of them not getting even half crops. Following the disaster of the droughts came the disaster of the fall in price. When the farmers had no wheat or very little wheat to sell, the price was high, but when they had plenty of wheat to sell the price fell to a figure which made wheat-growing unprofitable. Two such calamities have never previously followed each other in the history of Australia. To-day, the farmers, through no fault of their own, are in a desperate position. Because they responded to the appeal of the Prime Minister to grow more wheat, they are heavily in debt. They hoped that the promised price of 4s. per bushel would enable them to recover from past troubles, and many of them incurred debt in order to sow the largest possible area. If they had not sown such a large area, their debts would not have been so heavy. But, today, those who sowed the largest area are the most deeply in debt. The urgent need of the moment for these men is fertilizers for use in sowing their crop for the coming season. Unless immediate assistance can be given them they will have to sow without fertilizers, which will mean a very poor crop, or else they will not sow any crop at all. To my mind, the honourable member Echuca (Mr Hill ) has indicated in his amendment the only means by which adequate assistance can be given to the farmers. It is futile for us to persist t with this bill, for it is well known that there is not the slightest prospect of it being passed in another place. If the Government desires to do something usef u l for the farmers, it should make provision for the imposition of a sales tax on flour. So far as we know the only reason why it will not do so is that it fears an increase in the price of bread. But the honourable member for Echuca has shown clearly that the price of bread is higher now than it should be, and that the imposition of the proposed tax should not cause an advance in price. Even if the tax is imposed the price of flour will be considerably lower than it is today in Queensland and New Zealand where the price of bread is no higher than it is in the southern States of Australia. If this extra taxation caused an increase of i d . or $d. per loaf, it would be well worthwhile if it were the means of granting assistance to the wheat-farmers. The alternative to the granting of such assistance is that the farmers should cease growing wheat. This would mean the abandonment of holdings, and many other deplorable troubles. If the farmers ceased wheat-growing, we should have to import wheat to make flour, and the price of bread would then be double what it is now. That would be inevitable. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. Jones) said truly that if the Government allows the farmers to leave their holdings, the result will be calamitous. In my opinion, the farmers will be forced off their holdings, and the disaster predicted by the honourable member for Indi will occur, unless the proposed sales tax on flour is imposed. The Government has it within its power by this means to give immediate aid to our wheat-farmers, who are today the most sorely tried section of the community. If the wheat-farmers are relieved, all classes of the community will also be assisted, for it will be possible to continue producing wheat at a reasonable price and this will mean that bread will be sold at a reasonable price. The people in the cities are realizing today as they have never before done the extent to which they are dependent for their prosperity upon our primary producers. Sydney is feeling the pinch of an unprecedented depression. Empty houses are to be seen everywhere, and many houses are occupied by tenants who cannot pay their rent or can pay only a fraction of the rent they previously paid. I , therefore, urge the  Moloney) to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , for it will not only make possible the granting of relief to the wheat-growers, who, next to the wool'growers, are the most important section of primary pro^ducers in Australia, but it will also assist every other resident of Australia.",49
214,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Eden-Monaro) [9.24]. - The subject-matter of this bill does not interest me quite as. much as it should interest the honourable member for Eiverina (Mr Killen), for there are not many wheat-farmers in my constituency; but I realise the importance of the wheat growing industry to Australia, and believe that the Government should do its best to help our farmers to overcome their difficulties. It gives me, as a commonplace philosopher, a good deal of concern to notice that the honourable members who represent agricultural communities in this House can look at this subject in such a two-faced manner. They pretend to be anxious to help the farmers, but refuse to adopt the only means by which they can be helped. I am at a loss to understand how they can deceive the farmers as they are doing. The farming community, however, is intelligent, and it will not be misled by the sophistry or hypocrisy of honourable members opposite. The speech just delivered by the honourable member for Riverina reminded me of a story I heard years ago of the daughter of a certain farmer who would not marry the son of a neighbouring farmer, because he lived near a river, and she was afraid that their children might be drowned. The wedding was postponed so long that in the end there were no children to drown. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) pretends to be anxious to help the farmers, but he has talked a lot of cant and humbug about the money which the Government is endeavouring to find for this purpose being nothing but "" rotten paper."" The honourable member for Riverina is one of the fortunate people in this country who, by fortuitous circumstances, have been able to make money on the land. He is now misrepresenting the primaiy producers in this chamber,. I am ashamed that he and others who hold similar views to his own should insult Australia by saying that the money which the Commonwealth Government desires to put in circulation would be valueless and useless for the purpose of helping the farmers. It is a disgrace and a scandal that such things should be said. For my own part, I should be quite willing to accept the I.O.TJ. of the honourable member and try to negotiate it . If I found that it was valueless, I should then tell the honourable member what I thought of him. The Government endeavoured to pay the farmers 4s. per bushel for their wheat, but its efforts in that direction were nullified by the Opposition in this Parliament. The Opposition claims that the Government could not find the money. Then why did it seek to save the Government from such a humiliating position. These gentlemen are now trying to tell us that the money which the Government would have paid for the wheat would have been useless. Why they should seek to humiliate this Parliament, and carry their hostility to a Labour government to such lengths, I cannot understand. We have been told that the Government should be put out of office, because it has failed to assist the farmers, and now we are being told that it should be put out of office because the money it wishes to provide for the assistance of the primary producers is not acceptable to certain sections of the community. It has been said that if a government composed of certain honourable members opposite could be placed on the Treasury bench it would be possible to get sufficient money to assist the farmers. But there are nearly as many parties opposite as there are members. We are being told today that a government formed by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) would command the confidence of the people.",50
215,Mr BAYLEY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I rise to a point of order. We are discussing the Wheat Bill and I submit that the honourable member's remarks have nothing to do with this subject. Mr ACTINGDEPUTYSPEAKER You w (Mr Yates) - I presume that the honoryou able member intends to connect his remarks with the bill.,51
216,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I certainly intend to do so. I propose to show how futil e i is to expect a government supported by honourable members opposite to grant any real relief to the farmers. To this end I wish to read a quotation from a speech by Mr Lyons on party loyalty. The extract is as follows:Mr J. A. LYONS, M.H.R. His VIEWS ON PAKTX LOTALTX. Those who are now acclaiming the ex-Labour member, Mr Lyons, as Australia's new leader may be interested to read his opinion on party loyalty and the fate of Labour breakaways. Mr ACTINGDEPUTY SPEAKER. - Does the honourable member intend to connect these remarks with the bill?",51
217,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I believe that I shall be able to convince you, sir, that I am using a most potent argument in support of the bill In the Hobart (Tasmania) Daily Post, 16th November, 1916, Mr Lyons was reported as having said: "" Experience has shown that those who had at any time departed from the Labour movement, after having formed part of it, had invariably failed to block the growth and progress of the movement. As a matter of fact, very few men have survived as politicians who have stepped out of the Labour ranks. Having failed their own party, the opposite party has but a cold affection for them and cannot be expected to show confidence in them."" Mr Lyons, speaking at the Hobart Domain, also said, referring to the breakaway of Senator Ogden from the Labour party Mr ACTINGDEPUTYSPEAKER . - Order !",51
218,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND," "" Senator Ogden comes into the city today, and has no one to bid him welcome. He will go out tomorrow, and there will not be one to bid him Godspeed."" Mr ACTINGDEPUTY SPEAKER. - Order ! The honourable member is transgressing the Standing Orders and defying the direction of the Chair. The loyalty of Senator Ogden has nothing to do with the subject matter of the bill . I ask the honourable member not to proceed along those lines.",51
219,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I have concluded the quotation. I may say, sir, that although I may not have been clear in my enunciation, you will realise its significance and relevance when you read it in Hansard. ill then realise that I am right and are wrong. At present the farmers are in a desperate position. Attempts have been made by those who claim to be their friends, to assist them, but the Oppot sition have stood relentlessly in their way. What would be the position if this measure became law? The issue of fiduciary notes would be of great benefit to the wheat-farmers. I heard of a farmer who has £800 worth of wheat and who possesses a property valued at £3,000, who is unable to buy a loaf of bread. Tbat farmer was anxious to purchase £200 worth of sheep to place them on the stubble to fatten them for market, but was unable to do so because financial accommodation was not available. If it had been he would have been able to make a profit of about 50 per cent, on his chase. But he could not buy the sheep because credit could not be obtained. On the other hand, there are farmers in Cooma and Adaminaby who have more sheep then they can feed, and who are anxious to make a deal with the man who has the pasture available. The sale could not be effected because the financial tem of the country would not enable the farmer who had the feed to get sufficient credit from the banks to make the purchase. Therefore, the man who has the sheep and who cannot provide the feed has to allow them to starve, while the man who has the feed cannot purchase the sheep because he cannot obtain credit. If the Commonwealth Bank was to make credit available the farmer would be able to go to the bank and obtain, say, £300, which would not be paid to him in cash. Probably it would be in notes-no t neces- pushed out. sarily fiduciary-o r he might simply be given credit. In effect, all that would happen would be that the credit would be made available to the man who wished to purchase the sheep. Probably no money would change hands at all. The person who desired to purchase the sheep would be given credit, and payment in the form of a cheque would be handed to the seller, who would probably bank it in the same bank the following day. The cheque would simply be a via media to enable the sheep to be shifted from paddocks where there was no feed to a spot where ample pasture was available. The transaction is a simple one. It would not involve the production of gold or notes, but would simply mean a book entry. Honourable members should not imagine that actual cash would be handed over in such cases; it would simply be a matter of providing credit. This country is suffering today because there is no possibility of releasing credits, irrespective of the value of the securities available. We are suffering the result.' 1 of a financial famine, in consequence of which the wheat-growers particularly are experiencing great hardships. We have heard at times of action being taken under very old statutes, passed even as far back as the time of Charles I . Let us consider the conditions which existed in this country hundreds of years ago when "" K in g Bill y "" was purin supreme control. Would the aborigines in those day have allowed themselves to starve when opossums and snakes on which they fed were plentiful, simply because money-was not available as a medium of exchange? There were no fiduciary notes in those days, but the aborigines would not allow themselves to sys- starve when snakes and opossums were available. The other night I dreamt that I was on the summit of Mount Ainslie, where I discovered a library which contained valuable data, and records of events which occurred 4,000 years ago. To me the library appeared second only to that at Alexandria which was destroyed by the Calif Omar. I also dreamt that somewhere in the vicinity of the Molonglo there was a sanctuary for snakes. The tribal laws at that time provided that any one who killed a snake within the sanctuary would have his eyesl r",51
220,Mr MAXWELL,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,What did the honourable member have for supper?,52
221,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The honourable member also came into my dream. He was welcoming such persons as Niemeyer and Professor "" Duckenheim """,52
222,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I rise to a point of order. I should like to know, Mr Speaker, whether opossums, snakes, sheep, Calif Omar, children drowning in creeks, Niemeyer, and Professor "" Duckenheim "" are associated with the subject matter of the bill.",52
223,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Hon. Norman Makin). - The honourable member for Eden Monaro must confine his remarks to the bill, and express himself so as to comply with the Standing Orders.",52
224,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I submit that as it has been contended by honourable members opposite that the fiduciary notes, which it is proposed to make available to assist the - wheat-farmers, will not a means of financing transactions between the producer and the consumer, I am justified in showing by way of illustration that the laws under which we live permit people to starve in a land of plenty. I am showing that under conditions which existed hundreds of years ago the aborigines would not think of starving when ample food was available. The laws which existed then were more humanitarian than those in operation today, under which people are permitted to starve in the midst of plenty. It occurred to me that the illustration would be most edifying even to men like the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), who I believe has recently been prepared to place upon the grey hairs of his brow a crown of political stinkworts.",52
225,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Order ! The honourable member must not indulge in personalities.,53
226,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I deprecate them myself, but when at war one is justified in using the weapons of one's opponents. Under the laws which obtained in Australia more than a hundred years ago no aborigine would go hungry while food was available, and some such law should be in operation today. In those days the way in which a young queen displayed her scansorial ability in obtaining food jfor the aged and infirm who could not secure their own was the admiration of the tribe and in that way she endeared herself to her people. The present system of government is crude. When there is an abundance of clothing, food and shelter the people should not be deprived of such necessities simply because credits are not available. Why do we not establish credits? It is recognized by every political economistI do not profess to be one of great significance, but I am a financial authority in some respects, and also a financial diagnostician-that credits should be made available to enable the producer to make his products available to the consumer. Credit, which is money, can be created by a bank or a government by a stroke of the pen. If the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) went to the Commonwealth Bank tomorrow, and asked for credit of £1,000 in order to purchase sheep provide of that value to prevent them from starving, credit could be made available by a book entry. The purchase of sheep to that value would increase the food supply, provide work for drovers, and enable the Government to collect a sales t &",53
227,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Order ! The bill provides for the payment of a bounty on the production of wheat, for the making of loans to necessitous wheat-growers, and for other purposes. The honourable member must keep within the confines of the measure.",53
228,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"As a nation we are producing more food than we can consume. In Great Britain there is open to us a very large market, and a bounty that would enable us to transport our surplus production to that country would be exceedingly valuable. The best means of discrediting the Government would be to prove the proposed bounty a failure. Let it be given a trial. If it should fail, honourable members opposite would have the satisfaction of knowing that their criticism was justified. According to a report that has appeared in the public press, an ex-Minister of the Commonwealth, Mr Jensen, who is now a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, has recounted the fact that on one occasion during the Prime Ministership of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), while that gentleman was in America, a cable was sent to Australia by Great Britain asking to be supplied immediately with £10,000,000 worth of gold, and stating that a letter would follow the cable explaining why it was required. The Cabinet met and deliberated upon the matter. Although, in its opinion, the amount of gold in Australia did not represent 25 per cent, of the then currency, they took whatever risk was involved in further depleting the gold reserve and complied with the request of the Government of Great Britain. The letter with which that Government followed up its cable disclosed the fact that the gold was needed to purchase wheat from the Argentine, because that country would not supply it unless payment was made in that form. This incident shows the fallacy of the propaganda that is being indulged in against the issue of fiduciary notes; because a certain proportion of the currency in circulation at that time must have been fiduciary in its nature on accoimt of the fact that the gold reserve was depleted below the statutory requirement. But, notwithstanding that fact, they were successful in meeting the needs of the nation. Similarly, the fiduciary notes that the Government now desires to issue will prove successful in alleviating the burden of the existing depression. I understand that at a later date, when Great Britain required a further supply of wheat, Australia tendered for the contract, but lost it to the Argentine, whose price was lower to the extent of %d a bushel. If we were tendering today, and our farmers were given a bounty of 6d. a bushel, other nations would have to produce their wheat at more than 6d. a bushel below our price in order to outbid us. The granting of a bounty would possibly result in the circulation of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. All that the Government proposes is that the farmers shall have credit made available to them. Why is it being withheld from them? Because in another part of this building there are men who are prepared to support the financiers. They urge that if the Government's proposal is agreed to the value of money may be reduced. The financiers today want to lend money to the farmers at an interest rate of 6 per cent. Where do they propose to get it? Will they borrow it? It will be merely paper money. They are afraid of their profits being reduced. The amount on deposit in the private banks is approximately £400,000,000, and it is loaned out mostly to farmers. A reduction of 2 per cent, would mean a loss to them of £8,000,000 a year. There is plenty of money available, but honourable members opposite will see that the farmers do not get it at a cheap rate. Australia must see to it that the stranglehold which these financiers have upon the community is loosened. It is the policy of the Government to make money cheap for the farmers. If its proposal should prove ineffective or financially unsound, the Government must fall. I urge honourable members opposite to "" give it a spin."" The farmers are waiting for it. Let them not try to pull the wool over their eyes any longer. I do not think they will be able to do so, because the farmers are becoming more enlightened. The Farmers and Settlers Journal is subsidized by those who .are afraid of money becoming cheap, and prints articles which deceive the farmers. They have been deceived for years, and have been regarded as the only section of the community upon whose eredulity Nationalists can impose. But the straits in which they now find themselves will compel them to accept the proposals of the Government for their relief. If honourable members opposite were in power they would possibly be able to raise money at 6 per cent., but that is not what is wanted. It is the £1,000,000 a week interest bill that now crushes Australia. It is the interest charge that is ruining Australia today. Yet honourable members opposite would add to it, so as to make the financiers more prosperous at the expense of the sweat and blood of the farmer. They are now being offered an opportunity to provide the farmer with cheap money. Why should they stand up in this House and hypocritically pretend that they are studying the interests of the farmer?",53
229,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Order !,54
230,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I use the term in a political sense only.,54
231,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It s use is not permissible even in a political sense.,54
232,Mr CUSACK,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Ha d the Government been fortunate enough to be elected some time ago with a majority in both Houses, the payment of 4s. a bushel would be the law of this country today. The farmers must realise that the reason why they have not been given that measure of relief is that, under the Constitution, obsolete members of another place have been enabled to prevent the passage of the Government's legislation. With the assistance of a cock-eyed press, those members have been able to make the farmers believe that they have been studying their interests. Very soon the farmers will be disillusioned. Many of the older men will die of starvation because of the action of honourable members opposite, and of their friends in another place. Their successors will be more enlightened, better educated, and will not be deceived by the sophistry that has succeeded so well in the past. It is necessary to pass this measure as quickly as possible, so that the financial stranglehold may be removed from the neck of Australia. If it were possible for such an incongruous body to do so, the Opposition should rise as one man, and with one voice declare to the Opposition in another place that unless it ceases its obstructive tactics it will incur the full extent of the wrath of the suffering farming community. The conditions in Australia are desperate, because the Government has the misfortune to be unable to enact its legislation. A man who has in his veins 14 lb. of blood ought to be healthy; but if the application of ligatures prevents the circulation of his he is rendered a prey to various diseases. The blood flow of Australia is represented by credits, production, and the will power of those who have made it prosperous. If credits are made available the blood of the nation will circulate. The making available of credits would be similar to the untieing of ligatures. Should that occur, the nation will be healthy. Let those who have tied the ligatures realise that they are responsible for the diseases from which the nation is suffering. If honourable members opposite rise to their responsibilities, and recognize how inhuman they are when they stand in the way of progress, the recovery of the nation will be speedy.",54
233,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Angas) [10.0] - Th honourable member who has just resumed his seat remarked that there were not many farmers in his district. I should say that it is fortunate for the farmers that that is so. He likened the wheatboast grower to a drowning man, and said that if a boat were not available with which to save him, we should hand him a was plank, or give him any assistance that was available to avert disaster. I suggest that one of the things which it would be unwise to throw to the struggling wheat-farmer is a bar of lead, to which some honourable members on this side consider that the proposed fiduciary currency might well be likened. It not my intention to-night to review the tragic results of the efforts of the year to assist the wheat-grower. I have no desire to make a post mortem examinarelief tion of the measures that have been subthat mitted to this Parliament. Prior to Easter adjournment, the honourable memdo that. ber for Calare (Mr Gibbons) said, in effect, that any honourable member who objected to this bill must be unfamiliar with the needs of the farmers or must oppose the measure for political reasons. The farmers in my own district, up to a year ago, had experienced three years of drought, and many of them had had no crops at all, while in the present year a great number of crops have been more or less spoilt by rust. Therefore it is not necessary for me to be told how great is the need of the farmers in my own district, or in that represented by the blood honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart). If I intended to oppose this bill",55
234,Mr LEWIS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Has not the honourable member yet made up his mind on the matter ?,55
235,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I have, and I do not need a caucus to make it up for me. One well acquainted with the farmers' needs might conceivably oppose the measure, not on account of what the bill itself contains, but because of the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) that the Fiduciary Notes Bill is the pivotal measure round which all the other Government proposals revolve. I approach the consideration of this bill without regard to anything that the Treasurer has said: I take the measure as it stands, and I can support it because it contains no e reference whatever to the proposed fiduciary currency. I do not understand the statement of the honourable member for Calare that one might oppose the measure for political reasons, since the heard from the Government benches is that the farmers want the bill. If any member opposed it on the ground that it associated with a fiduciary currency, he would, according to the arguments used by Government supporters, be doing something to his political disadvantage. If the measure made provision for assistance to the farmers only by means of a fiduciary currency I would oppose it. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. is Jones) remarked that the late war was financed to the extent of £380,000,000 by past means of loans, and he asked why we could not today find £6,000,000 for the of the farmers. I hope to answer question in the course of my remarks. the There is a good reason why we cannot",55
236,Mr GIBBONS,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,It is because the side on which the honourable member now sits was too long in office.,56
237,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"I am now on the side of the people of Australia. I stand here to-night, as an independent member, using what power I have in the interests of the people generally. Since the late war the debt of this country has increased to the extent of nearly another £400,000,000. The loans raised during the war period are not comparable with the proposed fiduciary currency. The present proposal for providing £6,000,000 for the farming community, and £12,000,000 for the unemployed, is merely a preliminary stage. I shall not quote instructions I received from the South Australian Labour party as to the action to be taken whenever a loan was due for renewal. The currency of this country was to be used, and these loans wiped out progressively as they fell due. Owing to what has not been revealed there is danger in the proposal of the Government for a fiduciary currency.",56
238,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The scheme to pay a bushel, as agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition, would have cost a great deal more than £6,000,000.",56
239,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Not in the light of things at the time of the original proposals of the Government. I do not accuse Ministers of insincerity in the matter of assisting the farmers. I know that a number of members opposite really desire to help them; but the majority of the supporters of the Government are not so much concerned about assisting the farmers as with the initiation of a scheme for the provision of easy money. The farmer and his need is only one of the levers to be used in making that easy money available.,56
240,Mr JONES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Would the bill help the farmer to put in his crop ?,56
241,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"If the Government had' the confidence of the people, it would have no difficulty in raising a loan sufficient to provide for the planting of crops throughout the length and breadth of the country. If confidence were restored by a change of government it, would still be possible to do something for the wheat-farmers, but, unfortunately, it is too late to help some of them, because their planting time has arrived. It has been stated that some of them have put in their seed wheat without superphosphate. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) has announced that he intends to support the bill because, so he says, it is the only chance of giving relief to our farmers. Does any honourable member supporting the Government believe that the Fiduciary Notes Bill will be accepted in another place? They are, of course, well aware that it will not pass the Senate, and that, therefore, the farmers will not be able to obtain any relief under this bill. The honourable member for Grey added that he would be prepared to sit up all night in order to ensure the speedy passage of this bill. That statement. I regard as so much "" eye wash "". If he is really sincere in his desire to assist our primary producers, let him urge the Government to provide the House with an opportunity to discuss the various tariff schedules which are hindering and hampering our farmers.",56
242,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND, The honourable gentleman will not be permitted to discuss the tariff.,56
243,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Our primary producers have been waiting in vain for assistance from this Government. We know that the Fiduciary Notes Bill will not be passed by another place. We know also that this bill will be useless unless the proposal submitted by representatives of the Country party, for a sales tax on flour, is incorporated in it. A sales tax of £2 10s. per ton is equal to only about i d . per lb. This should not make much difference to the cost of bread. At the most, the increase would be i d . for a 2-lb. loaf., If that scheme were adopted, the Commonwealth Bank would be prepared to finance it.",56
244,Mr STEWART,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,And it would do that immediately.,56
245,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,I am sure it would.,56
246,Mr YATES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Does the honourable member say that the Commonwealth Bank would provide finance immediately?,56
247,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yes , by inflation.",56
248,Mr YATES,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Then the bank, by withholding finance at the present time, is strangling the farmers.",56
249,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The difference between the proposal made by the Country party and the Government's scheme is that, under the proposed sales tax, the amount of liability would be progressively reduced as returns from the tax were received, and at the expiration of five years the total liability would be liquidated and the inflation cancelled. In reality, it would not mean inflation. Such a scheme is necessary, it is practical, and it will afford immediate relief. Earlier in the debate the Minister in  declared that all State Ministers of Agriculture were opposed to the imposition of a sales tax on flour. Does he include the Minister for Agriculture in South Australia? The Minister is silent. We may therefore assume that his statement, as regards South Australia at all events, is incorrect. As a matter of fact the Minister for Agriculture in that State was prepared to support a much higher tax than is suggested by members of the Country party in this House. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), referring to those of us who have severed our connection with the Labour party in this chamber, implied that we had supported the Government for eighteen months without saving the country. The fact is that during the whole of that time notice was not taken of many proposals which we urged should be incorporated in Government policy for the benefit of the people. The honourable member for Kennedy knows very well what I mean. He and other Government supporters must admit that if the Labour party had followed the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton), and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons), in their budget proposals, Australia would not be at present in - such an unsatisfactory financial position. The honourable member for Kennedy also sneeringly declared that we were posing as the saviours of our country, and went on to remind us that we would do well if we could save ourselves in the next three months. I hope that the Government will give us an immediate opportunity to test the feeling of the people concerning recent events. But, as we know, Ministers are determined to cling to office; they will have to be scraped off the treasury bench. I am prepared at any time to face a general election. I shall then be free of all party ilr. Galb. pledges. I remind Government supporters, who declare that in supporting this bill their one desire is to assist the farmers, that, just prior to the adjournment in December the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde), under direction from caucus brought down an export duty on sheepskins. Need I tell the House what happened inside the party room in regard to that matter?",56
250,Mr SPEAKER,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"The bill contains no reference whatever to an export duty on sheepskins. I , therefore, cannot allow the honourable member to discuss that subject.",57
251,Mr GABB,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Ver y well, Mr Speaker, I shall not pursue it further. The Treasurer (Mr Theodore) has lately been quoting, with a good deal of approval, the views of Professor Copland in support of his fiduciary notes scheme. I may, therefore, be excused if I read the following extract from a statement by Professor Copland which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on the 5th March last:An amount of £6,000,000 is to be used for farm relief, and there is admittedly a strong case for some relief to the farmers. It will be well, however, to realise that the relief offered in this way may increase the farmer's difficulties and force him to be a suppliant for further relief. There is nothing in the proposal to suggest that costs of production will fall. On the contrary it has been shown that taxation will have to be increased on account of the higher Government payments. The farmer will, therefore, be left in his present position with high internal costs and low export prices. It cannot be too often reiterated that the export prices of farm products have fallen by about 50 per cent., while there has been no substantial reduction in industrial products, produced behind the natural shelter of the tariff wall in Australia. I commend that statement of Professor Copland, particularly to the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones). Every form of inflation, whether disguised as an issue of fiduciary currency or otherwise, has, in the past, been associated with a rise in price levels. France's experience showed that with an increase of five times in the amount of currency there followed a rise in price levels to the extent of five and a half times. If our currency is inflated, the farmers will have to continue selling their products in the markets of the world on the basis of deflated world currency. Whatever is done with the currency in Australia cannot alter that position. If we increase production costs, there is a danger that the last state of the farmers will be worse than the first, and that before long they will be coming to the Government again as suppliants for further relief. I intend to support the bill because there is in it no reference to a fiduciary currency. In doing so I wonder, however, whether I am not in some way helping further to fool the farmers. I do not wish to do that. I say to the farmers fTom my place in this House that they have no chance of receiving assistance from the present Commonwealth Government, and they might as well recognize that fact. However, we now have this proposal before us, and the Country party is hopeful of amending it by associating with it the imposition of a sales tax on flour to provide funds for the relief of wheat-farmers. I hope that the Government may yet be persuaded to do something along those lines. In that hope I propose to support the bill, at the same time making it plain that if it contained any reference to a fiduciary currency I should certainly oppose it . Debate (on the motion by Mr CUN NINGHAM ) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT.

252,Mr SCULLIN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [10.23] - I move That the House do now adjourn. After consultation with the industrial organizations concerned, the Commonwealth Government has appointed Mr . T. M . W. Eady and Mr Robert Taylor, to act as delegates representing the employers and workers respectively, at - the forthcoming International Labour Conference at Geneva. This year it is not proposed to appoint a Government delegate to attend the conference.",58
253,Mr GREGORY,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Swan) [10.24] - Is it the intention of the Prime Minister to afford honourable members an opportunity of discussing both the minority and majority reports of the Sugar Investigation Committee, and of voting on the recommendations ?",58
254,Mr LATHAM,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Kooyong) [10.25] Honourable members must have heard with interest the announcement of the Prime Minister with respect to the representation of the Commonwealth at the International Labour Conference. I am aware that every effort must be made to reduce expenditure at the present time, and I should like to know whether the gentlemen who are to represent Australia are being sent from this country or whether, on the other hand, they are at present on the other side of the world. In the past it has often been found possible to appoint as a representative some one who has bben travelling abroad, and who was qualified to attend the conference. I regret that it is not proposed to have a Government delegate this year. It costs only a small sum to send a representative from London to the conference. While the International Labour Organization has not functioned in such a way as to please everybody up to the present, I am convinced that it is highly desirable, particularly for a country like Australia which regards itself as advanced in industrial affairs, to do everything possible to improve indust r i a l conditions all over the world. This should be done, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for economic reasons, having in mind' the welfare of Australia.",58
255,Mr CEOUCH,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,Is it not a fact that most of the decisions arrived at by the conference can be put into operation in Australia only as a result of State legislation ?,58
256,Mr LATHAM,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"That is so, owing to the distribution of industrial powers between the Commonwealth and the States. That, however, does not dispose of the obligation of the' Commonwealth to keep abreast of industrial developments, and to make a contribution towards raising industrial standards in other countries. That has been the tendency of the International Labour Conference since its inception. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister whetheT it would not be possible to have Mr Fuhrman, whe is now in London, to represent the Commonwealth at the conference, as ht, has represented it upon other occasions. Australia will cut a rather poor figure as compared with other countries if we are represented at the conference only by nominees of employers and employees. I suggest that, unless there is a satisfactory reason for acting otherwise, the Government should take steps to have a direct Government representative at the conference.",58
257,Dr EARLE PAGE,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Cowper) [10.27]. - This afternoon I asked a question regarding the payment of interest by the New South Wales Government. I understand that that Government intends to pay 3 per cent, interest on various Australian loans negotiated for it during previous years, and also upon loans raised in America. So far our only information in this regard has been received from the newspapers, and I should like to have an authoritative statement from the Prime Minister.",59
258,Mr LATHAM,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,The New South Wales Government is to pay the full amount of interest due on American loans.,59
259,Dr EARLE PAGE,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"This interest was due on the 1st April, and as April is now considerably advanced I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Government has received any definite information regarding what is taking place ? This matter is of importance, not only to the people of New South Wales, but to those of the Commonwealth as a whole.",59
260,Mr SCTJLLTN,SUBMARINES OXLEY AND,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [10.29] - I hope that some day next week an opportunity will be given to honourable members to discuss the sugar agreement. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) regarding the importance of the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and it is only because it is necessary to exercise economy even in small matters that the Government has decided not to send a direct representative, even though one might be sent from London. After all, if the employers and employees are represented at the conference, Australia's representation will be fairly complete. We are fortunate that the gentleman chosen to represent the employers is already abroad on a trip, but the representative of the employees is in Brisbane, and will be sent from here. In regard to the payment of interest by New South Wales, I understand, but cannot say definitely at the moment, that the interest for April has been paid on loans raised in the TJnited States of America. I do not think that anything has been done to reduce the rate of Australian interest, but I shall know more definitely when I inquire at the Treasury. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",59
