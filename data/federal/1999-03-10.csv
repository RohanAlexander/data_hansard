If the minister needs to conduct to have reviews from time to time-then while these young people are being put into enhance the skills that they have learnt at very with disabilities who have become skilled at raised, and often with a great degree a crime to then let those young people sit at all, what these young people need is the that they have learnt so they can retain them. in my view she should release that money and young Mitche11 and hundreds of other young kids the opportunities that they richly deserve. (Time speaking on these three appropriation bills: Bill (No.4) 1998-99 and the Appropriation I would like to draw a direct link between fund the massive redundancies in Centrelink, which and the government's general policy of reducing attitude to junior wage rates as expressed in in the first week of this sitting this year. for a reduction in the existing youth wages, does Industrial Relations Commission to insert new are not presently in force. That particular bill, the major cause of youth unemployment and are not able to provide sufficient work move by this government to use the current high workers or to prevent workers receiving be based on the principle of equal pay for scale of competency, base classifications and the role of the Australian Industrial Relations wage rates are discriminatory. They result in they reach a certain age, being replaced by NA Wednesday, 10 March 1999 I will refer to a number of briefings obtained commend for their excellent work on our joint expressed. For example, it is stated in the ascribed to three factors: inadequate levels would all agree with; unsustainable levels of side of the House; and structural and technologically something which I think is generally accepted. In my view, there is a fallacy being promoted that many, if not the majority, of our young wages and are either too intimidated to It is clear that the statistical evidence Over time there appears to be a strong, positive unemployment, economic activity and unemployment also seen evidence presented that leans towards a more pronounced effect on the employment males. However, I would suggest that changes of work are playing quite a larger part in wages. This is where the government has lost zoning in on what the real problem is. In a report entitled Youth employment: a Standing Committee on Employment, Education Deputy Speaker Gash, were a member, page 3 states: Changes in the composition of the labour market level jobs once the domain of teenagers entering in skilled trades has been strongly negative, falling was once an industry which gave large numbers of teenagers transformed the industry and entry level jobs have of employment for under 21 year oids has fallen from since 1987.

Now there is nil or happened to some extent in the apprenticeship area. Where are all the potential young employees? time or casual employment on low wages, and are now once again being supported by their keeps recurring and recurring about issues amongst our youth. Why therefore do we keep hearing continual employers that cutting youth wages will solve the penny drops with the government that cutting we will then see the government moving unemployment-a general wage cut. We are seeing so close you can feel it breathing down your for Bennelong and Flinders so long to raise MAIN COMMITTEE 3673 through the Bills Digest service, which I behalf. I do not agree with all the views brief that the causes of youth unemployment are of total demand in the economy, which I think we youth wages, which we do not agree with on this induced changes in the labour market, widely that youth wages are too high. I believe unprotected youth are being exploited by low object or need the job too much to complain. presented does offer something of a mixed picture. relationship between the levels of total amongst the 15to 19-year-olds.

Again and again the theme other than wages being the cause of unemployment harping on and on by the government and some all our problems? It is my firm belief that, when youth wages will not relieve unemployment, into the only solution that they have to this almost on a daily basis and that is neck. I am surprised it has taken the members that issue in this House. They are both so NA 3674 stereotyped in their attitude to the workers of in our so-called enlightened 1990s.

The problem with that decision is that it from this runway being built. Furthermore, its Airport Corporation, strong proponents of and objectively undertake an impartial analysis Dracula in the blood bank situation whereby asked by government to go through the motions as come up with some flight path impacts of makes his final decision. From the perspective a credible process. Where it leaves us is that the final stage and the proposed parallel runway, is one developed by the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan. The major development plan, document for construction to commence. This raises the basic question: how long community has legitimately expressed to occasions. The Brisbane Airport Corporation's worry, it's off in the never-never,' the problem Brisbane Airport Corporation they say that new by the year 2006. Most engineers will tell you the predesign phase through to completion, requires about 2002. If you look at the approval process yet approval of the major development plan, and are looking at a process of perhaps a year those two years of submitting and gaining approval brings us back about to where we are at the process is an imminent one. It is not far interests of a corporation like the Brisbane deceivingly, to tell a local community that current concern. That might make for a smart honest dealings with the local community.

This is a concern which my me through many public forums and on many public response has constantly been, 'Don't being that in the published documents of the runway capacity is required at Brisbane airport that to construct a runway from the beginning, about four years. That brings us back to to be gone through with the development and an associated environmental impact study, we or two.

Reclaiming material from the national institutions of other countries a delicate issue, and Australia has encouraged its overseas postings to use their influence wherever possible to encourage overseas bodies to release human remains. A more active role has been played by Aboriginal organisations, notably by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC) which, with minimal assistance from ATSIC, has utilised visits to institutions, and correspondence, to persuade overseas institutions to offer remains in return. Because of its independence, the TAC had not been obliged to account to the Commonwealth on its actions, and it is not possible, therefore, to report on its success with individual institutions. Proposed future funding of T AC by ATSIC will carry with it an obligation to report back against mandatory performance indicators requiring an account of research undertaken. The Queensland Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action (FAlRA) has been funded to maintain a researcher in the United Kingdom has over the last couple of years. This researcher has NA been involved in researching the provenance of known collections, such as that of the University of Edinburgh, rather than making overtures to further institutions. There was, however, some media reporting earlier this year of an alleged refusal by the Natural History Museum in London to make records relating to Indigenous remains in its collection available to FAIRA. Campaigns by Aboriginal groups to return ancestral remains have focused on the United Kingdom, and overtures to continental European institutions have to date been largely successful.

Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia advises that comprehensive details are not readily available on how many occasions aircraft have taken off in cross winds in excess of 15 knots since the Long Term Operating Plan at Sydney Airport was adopted and the circumstances in which those take-offs have occurred. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan (Question No. 151) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to question No. 2616 (Hansard, 28 May 1998, page 4224), since the Long Term Operating Plan was adopted (a) on how many occasions have pilots nominated a runway to land their aircraft at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport which was other than that nominated by Airservices Australia and (b) what were the circumstances in each case. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has advised that comprehensive details are not readily available on the number of occasions or the circumstances when pilots have required a runway other than the runway nominated for landing since the Long Term Operating Plan was adopted. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Air Traffic Control Clearances (Question No. 152) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2619 (Hansard, 24 June 1998, page 5280), how many failures to comply with air traffic control clearances occurred at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in the two-year period before 4 February 1997. (2) Have failures to comply with air traffic control clearances related to directions, requests or instructions made by air traffic controllers as part of their implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan occurred since 4 February 1997; if so, (a) winds in how many and (b) in what circumstances. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Airservices Australia has advised that in the two year period to 4 February 1997 there were 552 instances of pilots failing to comply with air traffic control clearances or requirements. (2) Airservices Australia has advised that their records on pilots' failure to comply with air traffic control clearances or requirements do not specifically identify whether the occurrence is related to the Long Term Operating Plan. Long Term Operating Plan: Pilots (Question No. 157) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2617 (Hansard, 28 June 1998, page 4224), what steps must be taken for Airservices Australia to obtain the information which I requested about how many times pilots have refused Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) based landing directions and will he direct Airservices Australia to take the steps. (2) Have pilots refused LTOP based take-off directions since it was implemented; if so, (a) how many times, (b) what are the details of the circumstances in which the directions were refused and (c) what reasons did pilots provide for refusing the directions. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foIIows: (J) Airservices Australia has advised that it is working with the airlines to introduce a system which will result in Airservices Australia being advised about the reasons that pilots have had an operational requirement for other than the nominated runway. (2) Airservices Australia has advised that comprehensive records are not available on the number of occasions or the circumstances when a pilot has required a runway other than the runway nominated for take-offs since the Long Term Operating Plan was adopted. Aircraft Fuel (Question No. 158) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) What approximate quantity of fuel is carried by a Qantas Boeing 747 travelling from Sydney to Los Angeles when it takes off. (2) What is the average tonnage of reserve fuel carried by a Qantas Boeing 747 landing at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (3) Is there a greater risk of ground fatalities in an accident which involves an aircraft heavily laden with fuel. . Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foIIows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has provided the following information: (1) 162 Tonnes (2) 10 Tonnes (3) A greater amount of fuel on board does not add to the chances of an aircraft becoming involved in an accident on take-off or landing. The take-off and landing performance of all heavy transport aircraft is governed by regulations which are designed to ensure that, in the event of an engine failure, aircraft can still out-climb all obstacles in the flight path. The total weight of the aircraft is restricted by these requirements. Aircraft Incident (Question No. 162) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Was a Qantas passenger jet forced to take evasive action to avoid a turboprop Metroliner freight plane about 10 p.m on 22 July 1998; if so (a) what were the circumstances and (b) will he review operating procedures for pilots crossing runways to ensure that pilots stop before crossing a runway and wait for permission to proceed from the control tower. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, there was an incident on 22 July 1998 involving a Qantas passenger jet and a turboprop freight plane. (a) According to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the circumstances surrounding the incident were as follows: * A Metro aircraft landed on runway 34R, with an instruction to exit on taxiway Tango 1 and taxi via taxiway Juliet (for identitlcation purposes, runways are named in accordance with the international phonetic alphabet). When approaching a mandatory holding point on taxiway Juliet, the pilot contacted the surface movement controller (SMC) and was instructed to taxi via taxiway Bravo and hold short of runway 25. This instruction was read back correctly by the pilot. * Tower controllers subsequently observed the Metro taxiing along taxiway Juliet, past the entry to taxiway Bravo, towards runway 34L. At that time a Boeing 737 (B737) was touching down on runway 34L. The SMC instructed the pilot of the Metro to stop. As there was no reply the instruction was immediately repeated, and was subsequently acknowledged. The Metro came to a stop at the edge of runway 34L. The pilot of the B737 was also instructed to stop immediately, but the aircraft was too close to the intersection of the runway with taxiway Juliet to comply. The B737 was steered to the left of the runway centreline to increase its separation from the Metro, subsequently passing about 25 metres in front of that aircraft, at about 80 kts. * At the time of the occurrence the weather was fine, there were no works taking place in the vicinity of the runway/taxiway intersection, and all relevant taxiway lights, runway holding point lights and movement area guidance signs were reported to have been functioning normally. The investigation is continuing. BASI will send a copy of the final report if requested to do so. (b) According to Airservices Australia, aerodrome procedures were reviewed as a result of this incident. Procedures for pilots requiring to cross a runway are detailed in the Aeronautical Information Publication. The runway crossing point is marked by holding lights and illuminated signs identifying the runway. Communications between air traffic controllers and pilots have been amended to further clarify the need for pilots to obtain a specific clearance to cross a runway. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Infrastructure Developments (Question No. 164) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) What infrastructure developments relating to ground or air movement of aircraft are under way at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) What further developments are anticipated. (3) What is the cost of the developments which are (a) under way and (b) anticipated. (4) Have developments which are under way or anticipated been treated as major development proposals under the Airports Act 1996; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Taxiways enhancements to improve the efficiency of Long Tenn Operating Plan operations, relocation of the runway 25 threshold to improve usage of that runway, and the construction of aprons that will increase the capacity of the Interofficers national Terminal by 10 gates suitable for widebodied aircraft and expansion and refurbishment of Â° the International Terminal Building to manage these additional 1 gates. (2) Further developments planned for Sydney Airport are an Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 25 and runway lighting enhancements. (3) The costs of the developments which are under way are $44.7m for the taxiway enhancements, $700,000 for the relocation of the runway 25 threshold and of the order of $88m for the apron Date 30/6/93 111/94 30/6/94 1/1/95 30/6/95 111196 30/6/96 1/1/97 works. The costs of the developments which are planned are yet to be fully determined. (4) Under Division 4, Part 5 of the Airports Act 1996, a major development plan is required to be submitted for Ministerial approval for works including taxiways, passenger terminals and buildings where the cost of construction exceeds $10 million or where the works meet other prescribed triggers. The Airport Regulations (Regulation 5.03(1) and (2Â» do, however, provide transitional provisions. Regulation 5.03(1) states that: a major airport development that is the subject of written pennission or approval (however described) of the Federal Airports Corporation when it was the operator of the airport concerned, is exempt from Division 4 of Part 5 of the Act. I am advised that the developments under way were approved by the Federal Airports Corporation prior to 1 July 1998 when Sydney Airport became subject to the Act. Australian Federal Police Officers: Western Australia (Question No. 254) Mr Edwards asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 2 December 12998: How many sworn Australian Federal Police served in Western Australia in each (a) calender and (b) financial year since 1993. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The following chart identifies the number of Australian Federal Police personnel in Western Australia at the start of each calendar year and the end of each financial year. Sworn and unsworn personnel are accounted for in this table as both are involved in operational teams and reflect the operational capacity of the AFP. Personnel numbers in WA 115 115 114 115 120 110 109 107 Date 30/6/97 111198 30/6/98 Centrelink: Case Managers (Question No. 264) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) How many case managers were employed in the Centrelink customer service centres in the electoral division of Barton on (a) I July 1998, I July 1997 and (c) ] July 1996. (2) How many clients were managed by each case manager employed in the Centrelink customer service centres in the electoral division of Barton on (a) I July 1998, (b) I July 1997 and (c) 1 July 1996. (3) Under the new service delivery model announced by the Minister on 9 November 1998, how many (a) case managers will be employed and (b) clients will be managed by each case manager in the Centrelink customer service centres in the electoral division of Barton. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) None. Centrelink does not employ case managers. (3) (a) and (b) The number of customers in any officer's pool will vary, depending on the intensity of assistance required by different customer Second Sydney Airport: Drinking Water Contamination (Question No. 275)  and Regional Services, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent Sydney water quality crisis, which highlighted the vulnerability of Sydney's water storage and distribution systems. (2) Will he ensure that there will be no impact on the drinking water quality for the residents of Sydney as a result of airport activities if the Badgerys Creek proposal is allowed to proceed. Personnel numbers in WA 112 105 100 Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The recent debate on the quality of Sydney's water is a matter for the Honourable Member's State Labor colleagues. (2) It is clearly not possible to ensure that aviation activity in a major city will have absolutely no impact on the environment. All reasonable steps will be taken to minimise the impacts of a (b) second Sydney airport on the Sydney population and the natural environment. Badgerys Creek Environmental Impact Statement: Meteorological Data (Question No. 277)  and Regional Services, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) When planning the construction of an airport, what period of historical meteorological data is considered sufficient to reach well informed and reliable conclusions regarding operational factors, noise impacts, and air quality effects. (2) What is the accepted practice in the USA and internationally with respect to meteorological data and the construction of airports. (3) What period of meteorological data was used in respect of 8adgerys Creek. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourgroups. able member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3) See my answer to Question no 272. Work For The Dole Program (Question No. 327) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 9 December 1998: (I) In each region administered by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, (a) what work-for-the-dole programs have been (i) initiated and (ii) completed since the program started; (b) who was the sponsor of each project, (c) what sum did the Commonwealth provide for each project, Cd) was funding obtained from other sources; if so, in each case (i) what sum and (ii) from what source, and (e) how many persons (i) were employed on each project, (ii) participated (A) voluntary and (B) compulsorily on each project and (iii) went on to employment or training after each project. (2) Will there be a formal and public assessment of the successes and failures of the work-for-thedole program to ensure public accountability for Commonwealth funds; if so, when. (3) Did he state in the House on 7 December 1998 in answer to a question without notice that the pilot program suggested that 30 per cent of participants were going on to employment or training; if so, was the statement based on information provided by the Department from a formal procedure and assessment and, if so, when will the results be made public. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Since the Work for the Dole program commenced: 179 Pilot Projects were approved in October 1997, 174 commenced and as at 29 January 1999 135 of these had been completed; 301 Round ] Projects were approved in August 1998 and as at 29 January 1999258 had commenced. (b) and (c) Details about each Work for the Dole project is contained in a Table which has been provided to the Table Office. This table contains information about the sponsor, project name, participant numbers and funding for each project for each Labour Market Region. A further 388 Round 2 projects were announced on 18 December 1998-these are planned to commence from February 1999. (d) Work for the Dole project funding comprises a Commonwealth contribution and funding provided by the sponsor and/or other sources. Most of the funding provided by the sponsor and other sources for Work for the Dole projects is in the form of 'in kind' support which is not quantified and in many cases is not specified by the sponsor. In addition, information about other funding which is provided by the sponsor is unreliable as there is no formal process by which the sponsor is required to declare or acquit funding/support from sources other than the Commonwealth. (e) The Table provided to the Table Office indicates the number of participants who were undertaking work experience on each project. Data on compulsory and voluntary participants for the Work for the Dole Pilot projects indicated that there was a reasonably even split nationally between voluntary and compulsory participants. With the introduction of expanded Mutual Obligation requirements to include a variety of choices in activities from 1 July 1998, voluntary/compulsory data was not required to be maintained. Departmental data from post program monitoring surveys indicate that of those who left or completed the Pilot Work for the Dole projects and did not proceed to further employment assistance, around 32 percent had found un subsidised employment three months after leaving their project, with a further ] 0 percent proceeding to education or training. Reliable outcomes estimates at the project or regional level are not currently available. (2) The Department's Evaluation and Monitoring Branch, Labonr Market Policy Group is currently undertaking a formal evaluation of the Work for the Dole pilot program. A report on the evaluation is expected to be provided to Government in March 1999. A further assessment of Work for the Dole is planned as part of an evaluation of the broader Mutual Obligation Package for young people which included the expansion of Work for the Dole beyond the Pilot phase. The timing of this evaluation is yet to be determined. (3) Outcome data for the Work for the Dole Pilot program was based on information supplied to the Department from program sponsors. This information was used as a guide until the Department's Post Program Monitoring surveys could provide reliable data. Department of Defence: Conditions of Employment (Question No. 349) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: (1) How many employees in the Minister's Department have their principal conditions of employment set by (a) an award, (b) an industrial agreement, (c) a certified agreement and (d) an Australian workplace agreement. (2) What is the classification of each person in the Minister's Department employed under an Australian workplace agreement. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (c) 17137 civilian employees have their principal conditions of employment set by a certified agreement in conjunction with an award. (b) None. (d) 96 civilian employees have their principal conditions of employment set by an Australian workplace agreement. (2) The classification of the 96 people employed under an Australian workplace agreement are: Senior Executive Service Band 1:-61; Senior Executive Service Band 2:-15; Senior Executive Service Band 3:-5; Chief of Division Band 2:12; Chief of Division Band 3:-2; and Medical Officer Class 6:-1. Area Consultative Committees (Question No. 362) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: (1) How many area consultative committees (a) were operating before 2 March 1996 and (b) are operating in February 1999. (2) What is the (a) name, (b) contact address and (c) telephone number of the (i) chairperson and (ii) executive officer of each area consultative committee. (3) What levels of financial and other support does his Department provide and (b) did the Department's predecessor provide before 2 March 1996 to each area consultative committee. (4) What are the terms of each area consultative committee's charter for operation and responsibilities. (5) Have the terms of the charters varied since 2 March 1996; if so, how. (6) Have area consultative committees been given responsibility to collect data on regional skills shortages and job vacancies; if so, (a) what responsibility, (b) how successful has been the data collection, (c) how is the data made available to the public and (d) how is the data incorporated in a national information system. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) 61 and (b) 58. (2) Detailed list has been provided to the Table Office. (3)(a) An allocation this financial year of $7 million has been provided for Area Consultative Committee (ACC) operations. Actual funding of individual ACCs varies based on consideration of the particular needs of each ACC, for example allowance is made for the additional meeting and travel costs incurred in the more remote and larger ACC regions. In addition, $1.2 million has also been provided nationally to allow ACCs to promote themselves within their local communities and to assist them to disseminate information to the local community and employers about the operation of the Job Network. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business obviously also has close working relationships with ACCs. ACCs are thereby provided with ongoing support from departmental officers with, for example, advice on departmental and government programs and policies, assistance with a variety of administrative, operational and planning matters and information on labour market trends. A national ACC Web Site is also maintained by the department with developments currently being undertaken to enhance the site to improve inter ACC communication. (3) (b) For the 1995/96 financial year national operational expenditure on ACCs was $1.8 million.

The terms of the charter outline the role of area consultative committees for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2001. The charter calls for a three year regional strategic plan for ACCs to enable the development of more effective job market and employment training strategies for their regions. The charter reflects ACCs' role in providing a mechanism for regional consultation, identifying appropriate project activity under the Government's Regional Assistance Program. promoting a range of Government-wide initiatives and in providing feedback and advice to Government on these programs and policies. .
