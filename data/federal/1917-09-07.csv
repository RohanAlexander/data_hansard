Debate resumed from the 6th September (vide page 1803), on motion by Sir JOH N FORRESTThat this Bill be now tread a second time.",23
31,Mr WEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"East Sydney) [11.16] Last night I drew attention to two items on the Loan Estimates, which seem to be of the same nature as items upon which ih the past loan moneys have been spent by State Governments. In this respect it would appear that the CommonwealthGovernment proposes to follow the bad practice of the State Governments. If the expenditure proposed to be taken out of loan account were for works of a permanent character we could ignore it ; but one item on our Loan Estimates is "" office expenses."" I am justified in assuming that "" ofiice expenses "" will cover f u r n i ture, blinds, and floorcloth. These things are necessary in the furnishing of an office, b ut I do not think any person in the community would justify the expenditure of loan moneys in order to provide an office with blinds,' oilcloth, or f u r n i ture. Blinds are articles which are easily destroyed; they do not give sufficient length of service to justify a timepayment furniture warehouse in supplying them to their clients on the timepayment system. I think that the time has come when honourable members should try to put a stop to this wholesale borrowing which has been carried on by State Governments, and which it is now proposed to inaugurate in the Commonwealth - Objection f o such a policy was emphasized in the 1910 election. The people then exercised their judgment on the question, and their meditated judgment was that such services should be provided for out of revenue. I do not say that we can avoid loan expenditure altogether. There are many works of a permanent character that can justifiably proposed to be built out of loan account.",23
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"On a point of order, it is quite apparent that the honourable member is going beyond the rulin g given last evening by discussing items on the ordinary loan estimates, which is not permissible on the motion for the second reading of this Bill .",23
33,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE," I was waiting, to hear the honourable member connect his remarks with the Bill . It is apparent to me that he is going beyond the scope of the measure before the House.",23
34,Mr WEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,I was merely taking the items on the loan estimates.,24
35,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"The honourable member must connect his remarks with the Bill before the House. can show that the items are connected with the proposed loan, he cannot debate them. He will have his opportunity of dealing with items in the loan estimates ,in Committee of Supply.",24
36,Mr WEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"I have looked up previous debates, and I thought that I was simply following the practice hitherto followed.",24
37,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"The point of order was raised last night, and I had. to rule other honourable members out of order on the same ground.",24
38,Mr WEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"I was under the impression that the point of order raised last night was entirely different. One of my reasons for endeavouring to direct attention to the loan proposals of the Government is that many members of the present Government held office in what was known as the Fusion Government, which was very extravagant in its expenditure, and showed utter lack of economy in its administration of the finances of Australia. When the Fisher Government came into office there was a deficit of £450,000. It left office with a surplus of £2,653,000, which the present Treasurer afterwards converted into a deficit of nearly £1.000,000 in the shortest time on record. Honourable gentlemen with such a record are now asking us to pass a loan Bill for £80,000,000, and when I see items in the loan, expenditure which this Loan Bill is required to meet, I cannot help criticising them, and endeavouring to elicit some information as to what it is proposed to do with this large amount of loan money. Whether orable members feel disposed to ignore the matter or not, there is a serious position ahead of us. If we prefer get as much taxation as we can out of the people, but to rely on loan moneys, such a policy will have a most injurious effect upon Australia. In my the present is a more favourable time for securing revenue than will be provided after the war. In any country with a population of only 5,000,000 people, where £40,000,000 or £60,000,000 of loan money is being circulated, a considerable portion of it must go into the pockets of the citizens. We are treading on very dangerous ground in attempting to extract heavy loans from the people, and in not providing out of taxation for a lot of the expenditure it is now proposed to meet out of loan funds. I do not say Unless he that expenditure out of loan funds is not justifiable, but I hold that we should rely, more upon taxation. In the next five years Australia will be called upon to redeem in London loans amounting to £78,645,569. In Australia during the same period, we will be called upon to redeem loans amounting to £57,617,922. The total amount to be redeemed in five years is £136,263,491, and what makes the position more serious is the fact 'that these loans have all been raised at rates of interest much below those at present prevailing. Sooner or later the Treasurer must tackle the question of the redemption of loans. In fact, the matter might, very well be discussed now, because the necessary machinery for the redemption of these loans will take some time to bring into operation. Ministers individually and collectively have told the people of Australia that at the present time Parliament Could very well deal with measures that are of a non-party character,' or are not likely to ' create friction. However, I shall avail myself of every opportunity of bringing before Parliament the serious position ahead of us. The sooner we tackle it the less will be the difficulties to be overcome in connection with the redemption of our loans, and also in connection with our wholesale borrowing. I have placed a few questions on the notice-paper in reference to the last flotation. I am sure that the people of Australia, when they have the information brougbt under their attention, will give hon- it a little meditation, and will support a Government that is prepared to spend revenue on many items that it is now not to proposed to provide for out of loan. In 1910 we had an experience of what the people think of loan expenditure. They gave their decision in a very commendopinion, able manner when they said that they would not have the naval expenditure proposed by the Fusion Government paid for out of loan moneys, and that only expenditure on works of a permanent character that would convenience future generations^ should be paid for out of loan funds. I do not desire to oppose the Government for the sake of opposition, but I am in earnest on this question, because I see danger ahead of us, and I believe that this matter is of sufficient importance to engage the attention of a deliberative assembly, the function of which is' to conserve the best interests of the people. At the time when the Liberal Government introduced a Loan Bill for £3,500,000 for the purposes of naval defence, there was sufficient money in the Surplus Reserve Pund to finance that expenditure, but the Government were so wedded to the policy of financing from loan that they overlooked the surplus revenue.",24
39,Sir WILLIAM IBVINB,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,What has Bill to do with surplus revenue? ' The honourable member is mentioning ancient history.,25
40,Mr WEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"It may be ancient history, but the same tendency is evident on the part of the Government today, and if the honourable member would give to this matter the same amount of attention as he gave to the war-time profits tax he would agree with me that there are items in this Bill that ought not to be charged to loan account. that borrowing is an easy way of financing,' and that at the end of their term of ofiice the Government will be able to say to - the country, ' ' See what great financiers we are. We have carried on the affairs of the country without in creasing taxation,"" but they will not tell the people that they paid for out of loan account items which no business man would agree should be financed with borrowed money. I do not know whether my words will have any effect, but I shall persevere in calling the attention of honourable members to the seriousness of the proposed expenditure from the loan account. The total loan borrowings of Australia today amount to £500,000,000, and the annual interest bill is £22,000,000. In 1918 we shall have to redeem matured loans to the amount of £36,312,625 . I feel sure that honourable members are not thoroughly seized of the gravity of the position in regard to our loan account. opposition to the second reading of the Bill because many df the accounts mentioned in it must be paid, but in Com-' mittee I shall avail myself of the opportunity of repeating my .objections to some of this proposed expenditure from loan, and of impressing upon honourable members the necessity for giving more attention to this matter than has been given in the past.",25
41,Mr MATHEWS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Melbourne Ports) [11.35] - On this question I differ altogether from most of the members on this side of the House. I believe that the Treasurer has adopted the proper course, in proposing to borrow and charge to loan account as much as possible of our war expenses. There is a vast difference between this Bill and the Bill providing for the borrowing of £3,500,000 for the construction of the River class of destroyers. The latter measure was introduced in peace time, and I agree with' the honourable member for East Sydney that the this Government had no right then t'o borrow money for naval defence. The surplus in the revenue fund should have been applied to that purpose. In peace time we should provide out of revenue all defence requirements, but when war is in progress the Government should borrow for war purposes, and allocate the revenue to the ordinary needs of government. The Treasurer could not have done better than to allocate as much as possible of the expenditure on war serI know vices to loan account; by so doing we shall be able to know in future how much the war has cost the. country. At the same time. I object to much of the expenditure that is proposed in this Bill . There are today what are known as volunteer workers; we, on this side, apply another term to those who "" scab "" on the Labour movement. At cinema shows and in the illustrated newspapers we see pictures of the volunteer workers, and they are in uniform. The Government are not only trying to break up the unions by volunteer labour, but are providing money out of loan so that those men may clothe themselves as Nationalists. Mr J. H. CATTS - In New South Wales they are feeding them with cartloads of beer.",25
42,Mr FINLAYSON,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Eleve n lorry loads of beer were sent into the cricket ground I offer no Mr SPEAKER (Hon . W . Elliot Johnson) - I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the Bill . The remarks the honourable member is making will be in order if he can show that a portion of the money to be borrowed under this Bill is to be expended on uniforms for volunteer workers. Mr J.

45,Mr MATHEWS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"The Treasurer is doubt proposing to borrow £80,000,000 for war purposes, which include the provision of uniforms.",26
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"It is the principle of the measure which is under considerafor tion, not the details.",26
47,Mr MATHEWS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"W h i 1st agreeing with the Treasurer in his general loan taking place in Australia today. policy, I am showing that I disagree f him in allowing some of this, money expended on uniforms to be worn by volunteer workers on ships. There other purposes for 'which loan money being, improperly used. The censorship is a war service, and the censors ought to be paid out of loan money. The purthat pose of the censorship is to ensure that no information is conveyed to the enemy, and that nothing is published to injure the Government in the conduct of the war. But the censorship is being in other directions. For instance, can there be any connection between war, and the trouble in the Northern Territory over the re-appointment of D Gilruth? Y et the censorship, which financed out of loan money, is used interfere with the public protest at win against the action of the GovernMinistry ment in making the appointment. The Government ought not to do these for war purposes. things. Why should they allow the censor to interfere with a matter of this kind? I have been expecting certain communications from the Northern Territory, but have not received them. They are censored - I have endeavoured to ascertain whether the censorship is carried out by the military or by some funds. officer of the Department of Home Territories, but, so far, have been The censorship is intended to be used for military purposes. The service is paid for out of loan money, and to my complaint is that it is being used to prevent information reaching us in regard to difficulties in the Northern Terriam .tory associated with the re-appointment If we agree to the raisused ing of the loan for war purposes, it in should be used only for such purposes. About a fortnight ago I received from Port Darwin a letter, in which the folsent off lowing statements occur: Your wire to band. Contents noted. I intend to forward to you at earliest convenience details of conditions obtaining in the Territory, including other matter dealing with the Administrator and staff generally. No you are aware the trouble we have to contend with up here is the despotic system of censorship which is carried out in anything but a national manner, inasmuch as that any postal matter whatsoever dealing with the maladministration of the Territory is generally censored to such an extent that it is impossible the receiver of the epistle to draw from the remains of same any intelligent meaning. This proves my statement as to what is Will r o m the Treasurer explain what connection to be there is between the administration of the Territory and the war ? Why should are the censor who is stationed at Darwin is especially to see that nothing shall be sent out that is prejudicial to the intert ests of this country, take up the. attitude every little incident associated with the administration of the Northern Territory may have some bearing on the winning of the war? There are people who ask, concerning every action taken used by the Government, "" Is this the way you how are going to win the war?"" People canthe not be blamed for putting such a question, in their ignorance, when the Gor . vernment allow their own officials to use is the censorship to prevent the disclosure to of information which really has nothing Darwhatever to do with the war. I urge the to takecare that money allocated for war purposes shall be used only",26
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"This matter has no relationship to the motion for the seoond reading of the Bill .

Hitherto we have not had an opportunity to discuss them until something like twelve months after money has been expended. Notwithstandhave ing all that has been said by the Opposition regarding certain little expenditures out of loan moneys, the fact remains the Government are proposing to expend be applied. out of revenue this year £4,702,000 in excess of the amount expended out of revenue last year.

It is the intention of the Parliament that this money shall be utilized in-connection with the world-wide conflict now raging, and the Government should not be allowed to betray the confidence of the people by turning the strength obtainable from their patriotic enthusiasm for the welfare of the Empire into the channel of internal disputes between two sections of the community in Australia.

89,Sir JOHN FORREST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Furthe r issues must be considered on their merits. Money may be cheaper or may be dearer. We cannot tell now. Hitherto the Government have been supported in their financial proposals, and I am surprised that an honourable member, who was Treasurer for a little while, by proposing to introduce another system which he did not adopt when he was Treasurer, should try to take the control of the finances from those really responsible to the House and the country. I am informed by those in financial circles that if we adopt the same system as an our previous four flotations for war loans-it will be viewed more favourably than by adopting another system-and , acting on that information and also on my own judgment, and on the judgment of Ministers, I have clearly stated ,to the House what we proposed to do. I hope that honourable members will trust the Government to do the best they can. The Government know all the facts. Some people always like their own way, but I hope that the honourable member for Grey will not persist with his proposal. It is .really in the nature of a no-confidence motion. The Government are acting with the full concurrence of - the Commonwealth Bank, the associated banks, and the financial authorities, and in accordance with what we think is best for the country.  withstanding what the Treasurer has said about taking the business of the country out of the hands of the Government, I think that the honourable member for Grey should be complimented for moving his amendment. He has put up a very good case. Those honourable members' in the corner who were so solicitous last week, and on Wednesday, about the interests of the small business men and the farmers-the backbone, if not of Australia, at least of Victoriaand particularly the honourable member per cent, for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), who, while the Treasurer was speaking, was saying "" He a r , hear!"" all the time, have an opportunity of preserving the interests of those small, men by agreeing to the proposal before the Committee. If we continue to exempt the interest earned on Commonwealth war loan scrip from income taxation, it will be the small men of Australia who will have to pay the income taxation of the future. If honourable members understood the position thoroughly they would pot consent to allow the big man to escape the payment of income tax*- The honourable member for Grey pointed out last night that already one-sixth of the wealthy people of the Commonwealth escape paying income taxation on war loan bonds..",30
90,Mr RODGERS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,Of course that was not correct.  for Grey gave figures to prove his statement. He gaveus the benefit of the knowledge that he gained while holding the office of Treasurer.,31

I prolost, pose to direct my attention particularly to the honourable member for Wannon, who last week, on the War-time Profits Tax Bill, pleaded so hard for the small man. If he is'anxious to assist the small man he has the opportunity to do so by supporting the honourable member for Grey. By exempting the interest earned by investors in Commonwealth war loans from income taxation we are robbing the States of revenue. If we find that are proceeding on a wrong course, surely to goodness we do not propose to conright tinue on that course, as the spendthrift does, until insolvency brings us up. would be prepared to agree to the ment of 6 per cent, interest rather than give this freedom from income taxation.",31

The fact that have been doing wrong in the past is no reason why we should continue doing wrong. I do not wish to take the financial problems out of the control of the Government. I would rather leave them where they are now, because if Ministers go on. as they are doing they will be the best political organizers that the Labour party could have. The honourable member for Grey has done service to the whole of the people of Australia by drawing attention to the .effect of this exemption, from income taxation. Is there anything dishonourable or dishonest in admitting that we have done wrong, and getting on to the right track so far as the future is concerned? No man should escape taxation, whether he is wealthy or not. Every person should contribute to the expenses entailed by the war, so far as he is able to do so. It is quite wrong to bring in a Bill to relieve anybody from taxation required for the purposes of the war. » *",31
94,Mr RODGERS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Wannon) [12.42] When the first War Loan Bill was brought before this House I made a speech very much on the lines of' that which has just been made by the honourable member for Maranoa. I pointed out, as well as I was able, that we had just passed through a great drought, in which a great deal of capital had been and that when people realized that they could get 4£ per cent., and secure immunity from income taxation, they Would invest what I may call the movable capital of Australia in the war loan, .realizing that in so doing they would be placed in a very advantageous position. I had a deeply-rooted objection to the proposal.' I considered that a mistake was made in instituting it , and that it was a mistake to continue it , but when we already have £80,000,000 raised in we Australia at a fixed rate of 4£ per oent. interest, the Treasurer is proceeding on lines when he seeks to float another £80,000,000 on the same conditions. I The immediate effect of the proposal of paythe honourable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton), if it were carried out, would be either to depreciate the stock of the loans, or to depreciate the new If the honourable member wished to correctly inform honourable members as to which was the better inyestment, he not have come here so ill-prepared in making his proposal to alter the finanwe cial arrangements of the country. He had the opportunity, as Treasurer, to cure an analysis of the effect of the emption of £80,000,000 from income tax, but he did not make that investigation. He simply told us that £80,000,000 would not bear its fair share of income taxation. It was a fallacious statement. he had been desirous of putting the positheir tion before honourable members correctly he would have analyzed the character of the subscriptions to the war loan; and ascertained what amount came from the smaller capital that would not pay the income taxation .to which, the honourable earlier loans will be at a discount. member referred. It is ridiculous that the interest on the £80,000,000 already invested in our war loans would sources. pay income taxation at the rate of 6s. 3d', in the £ 1 . I believe that the honourable member Grey was the first Treasurer ""to endeavour Government. to popularize war loans. We went from factory to factory in the endeavour to induce the workers to subscribe, and they did contribute millions of pounds, their employers backing them up and finding the monev in advance on certain terms. Included ' in the £80,000,000 of previous take. war loans is an enormous proportion of money provided by men of small means. Then the big companies, such as the Ausfor tralian Mutual Provident Society, in order to insure the success of the loan and safeThat guard the credit of - the country, made contributions of £1,000,000 and upvest wards. Every Treasurer ornaments loan prospectus in order to improve the chances of the flotation, and the honorwhich able member for Grey adopted exactly war. the same proposal as is being made by the present Treasurer. In every country the man who is responsible for making a sucfor cess of a loan flotation adopts make the issue as attractive as possible. In Great Britain .we had to pay 5 per cent., and in addition we made a concession on the prinactivities cipal,, the loan being floated at £ 9 8 In Australia tihe concession was in .the nature of six months' interest for a few ception of building. weeks' use of the money. When the honourable member for Grey was appealing the money market he was not concerned about the equity of giving six months' interest' which had not been actually earned. On the first War Loan Bill I resolutely objected to the principle of exempting this stock from income tax, but the prinwhen seciple has been admitted, and already exapplies to £80,000,000 of war flotations. The effect of putting the new stock on the market will be to depreciate either the old stock or the new.

107,Sir JOHN PORREST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Swan-Trea surer) [12.55] - I urge honourable bers to support the Government in this matter. Already the idea has gone forth able. that the conditions of our war loans will be changed and that a higher rate of interest will be offered. The effect doing that would be only to appreciate the value of existing stock. On that prospect there has been, I believe, recently a great deal of buying of 4£ percent, stock.

114,Mr TUDOR,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Yarra) [2.15] question we have to consider is whether the principle involved i h the proposed new clause is right or wrong. Theoretiwould cally, every investor in our war loans ceives the same| rate of interest, but, having regard to the varying effect of the exemption from income tax, in practice that is not so. Our income tax begins at, of £80,000,000. roughly speaking, 3d. in the £ 1 , and rises on a graduated, scale to 5s., or plus the per cent, increase, to 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 married man with an income of £156 per annum is free from income tax, and is a married man with two children whose loan 9 income amounts to £200 per annum. If Mr TUDOR he receives £300 a year, and has two children under sixteen years of age, pays income tax on about £100, at the rate of something like 4d. in the £ 1 that income were derived from an investper ment in the war loan he would thus be at relieved of the payment of income tax amounting to 4d. in the £ 1 , but a w#,r loan investor whose income amounted to over £7,000 per annum would be rean lieved of the payment of income tax amounting to 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 .",34
115,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,There are many so situated.,34
116,Mr TUDOR,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Quite so; but surely our laws should be equitable.

I hold that the honourable member for Grey's pre- proposition should be accepted. We have no right to say that a man who is in receipt of an income which, without the exemption of these loans ..from taxation, would be liable to pay the highest rate of income tax shall be in a better financial position than his less fortunate investor Federal who has asmaller amount to invest. I frankly admit that I was a member of the Government which first exempted from taxation income from war loans, but at that time we did net have a progressive Federal income tax, and when we find that we have made a mistake we should be prepared to acknowledge it , and - to make a fresh start.",34

We have already raised £80,000,000 in respect of war loans; it is now proposed to double that indebtedness, and we shall be acting wisely if we adopt this proposed new clause, and so get upon right lines without further delay.",34

In order that the in come of £3,600,000 from this loan of £80,000,000 may be liable to taxation, we are asked to give a bonus to the holders of £357,000,000 worth of State securities, plus £80,000,000 of Commonwealth war loan, or a total of £437,000,000, and at the same time to make'the success of this loan very questionable.",35

124,Mr FALKINER,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"I am referring to the fact that £357,000,000 of State securities and £80,000,000 of Commonwealth securities will be free from taxation, while investors in this war loan will be taxed.",35

There are many businesses earning fro m 8 per cent, to 10 per cent, that have put money into our war loans. Surely we cannot expect money to be taken out of those businesses, and to be invested in a war loan at 5 per cent., if the income so earned is to be liable to taxation ! I doubt whether the public would be inclined to subscribe to the loan under such conditions, and the honourable member for Grey would be well advised if he withdrew his proposed new clause.",35
127,Mr FENTON,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Maribyrnong) [2.30] There seems to be a considerable difference of opinion as to whether the principle embodied in the proposed hew clause is right or wrong. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the only persons who will receive no benefit from the adoption of this proposal are those who are in receipt of an income of £5,000 a year and upwards. Below that amount the holders of stock or debentures under this Bill will , in a sense, be in a better position than theywould by investing it at per cent. It is very difficult to know how the new clause would operate. For instance, there are big mutual insurance societies, such as the Australian Mutual Provident, the National Mutual, and other institutions, who, with the Commonwealth Bank, are the largest investors in our war loans, and who will still invest.

Great Britain is a lending country, and has always been floating loans for the assistance of the Commonwealth and other parts of the British Dominions where money is required. On the other hand, Australia is a borrowing country. The war loans in the Old Country were floated at 3 per cent, at the outbreak of the war. The rate of interest is now 5^ per cent. That is an increase of 2^ per cent. The honposition orable member for Grey proposes that we should increase our rate of interest by f per cent.

The crux of the honourable memthat ber's argument is that in order to a man from making about 30 per cent, we should raise the rate of interest on the Commonwealth war loans by 2 per cent.

However, intend to reserve my remarks on this bonds. question for some future occasion.",39
183,Dr MALONEY,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Melbourne) [3.14] I have always had doubts as to whether is wise to issue bonds the interest which cannot be taxed. The Napoleon said that property sisted of two kinds-that was movable, and that . which was immovable, the latter being the land. W it h the exception of a few lands for church purposes in the Orient, no perty in any country has been given munity from taxation, and it is somewhat incongruous that in this twentieth century we should issue bonds the in terest on which is placed beyond the of taxation. That system makes it sible that the terrible word repudiation may be used by our successors. I have never advocated repudiation, but, as sult of ja system of evolution the compulfifteen sory surrender of these bonds may be manded in the future, and the holders forped to accept the full market their stock in Commonwealth notes. The figures quoted by the Leader of the Opshowed that the small man holding bonds to the value of from £ 3 0 to £100 will derive practically no benefit from this exemption. If such a man has of a an income of '£156 he pays no income tax. If he has an income of £200, and is - blessed with two children, he also will be. - free of income tax. If he has an income in of £300 he will pay an amount so small he will not feel it . A man who has debar an income of £5,000 from war bonds would be paying in the ordinary course an income tax of 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 ; but . under this B i ll such income will be by immune from taxation. That policy is There is no financial expert but which recognises that this war has brought about a change in finance that no other 4* epoch has shown. Economists are recognising that the nations engaged in war will not be able to struggle along under The load which Pilgrim had to carry is nothing to the debt of the British Empire, and that debt is mounting higher and higher. Today it is £7,^)00,000,(100, and if the war continues it will be £10,000,000,000, of which, at 5 per cent., will absorb The Empire The 5 whisper has reached me that men of large conmeans wbo are anxious to escape income I taxation are investing largely in war I believe the Treasurer could count on the fingers of his two hands the wealthy men who, from patriotic impulse, it are returning to the Treasury the interest upon they receive from their war bonds. It great would be interesting to hear from the conTreasurer the exact number of wealthy which men who are doing that. The exemption of war loan bonds from interest hits the small investor every .time.

It may be that, if the needs of the Empire so demand, every penny over a certain income will be seized by the . State. Therefore I view with some perturbation the borrowing ol £80,000,000, the interest for which will be free from taxation. War bonds to the value of £80,000,000 are already in circulation, and with this new issue of £80,000,000, a total of £160,000,000 will have been removed from the taxable assets of the country. If this system is carried further, we may give immunity to the whole of our taxable assets.",41

Every financial expert and economist is apprehensive of the troubles that will confront the nation when the war ends. I commend the honourable member for Grey for moving, the amendment.

Taxation in some of the States is very heavy. In New South Wales it is much heavier than in Victoria, while in Queensland the taxation on the larger incomes is still heavier. - A number of very large investors have put their money into the war loans in order to escape Eederal and State taxation.",41
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"The honourable, member will admit that when he was Treasurer he was treated perhaps inore generously than any of his predecessors.",42
195,Mr HIGGS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"On e reason why I was not interfered with by the right honourable gentleman and the present Treasurer was that the Government of which I was a member was proposing to float a war loan at 4£ per cent, free from taxation, so that we were doing exactly what they desired we should do in the interests of the big investors. Mr. JOSEPH: COOK - That is not point I had in mind. I am suggesting that, as the honourable member will have ample opportunity to discuss this question in the immediate future, he should allow us to get this Bill through today. '",42
196,Mr HIGGS,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Anothe r place will be occupied with the War-time Profits Bill next week, so that there is no immediate hurry for the passing of this Bill, more especially as we have lying idle in the Commonwealth Bank some millions that we shall not be called upon to expend for some time. The honourable member for Hindmarsh suggested that a Treasurer, in floating a loan, has to adopt methods very like those followed by business people in selling their goods. A man anxious to sell stockings marks them at, say, 2's. l instead of 3s., hoping in that way to induce unthinking people to buy them. I would remind the honourable member, however, that we cannot deceive the investor Those who accumulate money are men of brains; even if they do not themselves calculate the return which an investment will give, they have clerks and accountants who do so for them. The various banking companies, before advising the Treasurer to issue this loan at 4-J percent., probably asked their actuaries to figure out whether they would be better off if they invested £1,000,000 at 4£ per cent, free of State and Federal taxation than they would be if they invested it in a loan at 5J per cent, liable to taxation. The Treasurer tells us that the Government have been advised by the financiers to issue this loan at 4$ per cent. As a matter of fact, the actual return will be a little more than that. In the case of the last 4£ per cent, loan, I think that the return amounted to £4 13s. lOd. per cent. We ought not to pay too much attention to the financiers of the country. They naturally ask themselves, "" What is the best form of investment for our surplus wealth? Shall we invest it in State stocks or in Commonwealth war loans? Shall we invest it in gas or insurance company shares, or in the shares of - electric light companies?"" They run over the whole gamut of investments, and select what they think the best. The old gentleman who has a large amount of money to invest, and wishes to leave it to his relatives in such a way that they will not have to look for some time for other in the vestments, will probably put it into Government stocks. The longer the term of the loan the better, in his view, for those who are to come after him, since they will not have to seek a new investment. The proposal is, I think, that this loan shall be payable in 1927. When that time arrives I dare say the funding process will be gone through, and all these war loans will be put into one big loan covering twenty-five or fifty years. The rate of interest to be paid will depend upon the state of the money market. Meantime investors look upon these war loans as a very profitable form of investment. We find that the Commercial Banking Company put £750.000 into the last issue in August, 1916'; the Bank of NeW South Wales, £750,000; the 'Bank of Australasia, l j d . £500,000; the Union Bank, £250,000; the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, £100,000; the National Bank, of Australia, £100,000; the Australian Bank of - Commerce, the London Bank of Australia, the .Colonial Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Victoria, £50,000 each; and the Queensland National Bank, £25,000. Certain individuals - also invested largely in that loan. I am pleased to observe amongst the subscribers the name of "" F. B. S. Falkiner "" for £13,000. It is wrong to suppose that the man who has money has no brains, or that the man who has no money is without brains. Everything depends upon a man's temperament. Some men of brains like to devote their time to money making; others prefer to spend their time and energies in other ways. I have gone into this matter as fully as possible in the brief time at our disposal. Had the honourable member for Grey given notice of his intention to submit this proposed new clause, he would probably have secured for it a much wider support. I would point out that .Finlayson, an investment of £100,000 at 5 i per cent, Heitmann, E. E. would give a return of £5,250 per annum. If the investor were living in New South Lamond, Wales, his State and Commonwealth taxaLynch, J. t i on on that income would be £1,446 per annum. Under the Treasurer's proposal Archibald, W. O. the investor who put £100,000 into this Atkinson, L . war loan at 4£ per cent, will receive Best, Sir Bobert £4,500 per annum, and that return will Boyd, J. A. be free from State and Federal taxation. Brennan, Frank On the other hand, if this proposed new Cook, clause be adopted, then the man who in - Corser, E. B. C. vests £100,000 in this war loan at 5£ per cent, will have to pay £1,446 by way of Fowler, J. M. taxation, which will bring down his in - Glynn, P. MCM. come of £5,250 to £3,804.

229,Mr FINLAYSON,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE,"Brisbane) [4.46]. - I am one of those unfortunate persons who are not of the opinion that the Daylight Saving Act ought to be repealed. I find, myself still a supporter of the principle of daylight saving. Unfortunately, daylight saving was introduced into Australia at the wrong time last year, and suddenly brought upon 'the people new conditions and new arrangements for which they were entirely unprepared. Had it been introduced in September, as was originally intended, and the people had become gradually accustomed to the change, I think that a very different result would have been attained. However, I do not think that daylight saving is as applicable to Australia as it was to England - Honourable members know that in this matter we followed the example of Germany and, later, of Prance and Great Britain with that slavishness which has been adopted by the. present Government all through. We followed the daylight saving legislation with unsatisfactory results. I believe that in the winter time a Daylight Saving Act would be an excellent thing in Australia. AYES. We legislated on the subject because it had been dealt with in Great Britain . Fortunately, we have found out our mistake, and the community as a whole, I believe, thought it was a mistake, and now it is proposed to repeal the Act. ' We have had, other illustrations. I might instance the War Precautions Act and the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill as two glaring illustrations of where we have f o i -' lowed the example of the older country, and increased our difficulties, and landed NOES. 6urselves in unexpected circumstances which have been far from .happy and agreeable to the interests of Australia. In this case we can retrace our steps with little difficulty, and, although I am not going to hinder or obstruct the passage of this measure, I want to express my opinion that the parent measure was wrongly conceived and wrongly worked It was stupidly brought into operation, with no consideration of the effects in Australia as compared. with the effects in Great Britain. I believe that even yet the principle of daylight saving could be applied, to Australia with satisfactory results. I , for one. will be prepared at any time to support a measure which will give to the people of Australia the opportunity to do. their work in the daylight, instead of under artificial conditions, thereby saving, not only the health, but money of the people. However, the people say that they are tired of this measure, though, in my opinion, they have not had a fair chance of testing i'tl, or otherwisethey would probably not be so anxious to repeal it .

For nearly five weeks now the Central Wool Committee have been very busy tryi n ing to get the machinery more perfect m than it was on the last occasion to deal the 1917-1918 clip. We have been working with a technical advisory committee of about twenty-five; and every day there have been questions asked the honourable member for Capricornia, which seem to me to reflect more or less quite clear. on the committee, or some members of committee.

I was Then I asked what If was the name of the firm, and whether any other firm might enter into an agreesimilar to that made with the Colomemnial Combing and Weaving Company and Whiddon Brothers. Did I get a straight No, it was I was of then forced to iask another question. an Even then I did not get a candid anAs honourable members will obfrom the. questions I have put, I a fair have been compelled to ask them because of the difficulty of getting information from the Prime Minister or the Central This conWool Committee. I amasking my questions because - it is said that one of the members of the Central Wool Comis largely interested financiallv in the agreement to share the profits of the of wool tops with the Government. for I am endeavouring now to get from the Wool Committee a list of the shareholders of the Colonial Combing and Company, in order to discover to what extent this particular member of the committee is interested in the I could not obtain that in formation. The Prime Minister had to the refer me to the Registrar for New South Wales. He said that the Government not a list of the shareholders of 'the company, although according to the of agreement made with the company a list of their shareholders should have been furnished to the Government. The comWhy assodid not the chairman of the Wool Comcall upon the company to do so ? I am not reflecting in any way upon, the of the committee, but his lanv my lot guage to me and the language of the for lionorable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) this afternoon prompt me to suggest that, however able the chairman of the Wool Committee and the honourable him member may be, the committee appears to bave been caught napping- I will go e that far-by this gentleman, who is one of the members of the committee, and What is who has been able to secure an agreeComment with the Commonwealth Governany ment which apparently no other firm has the privilege of securing. ter has been done in such a way that, in my opinion, it has not been openly done.",48
241,Mr FALKINER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I take exception to those remarks.,49
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Will the honourable member indicate what words he takes exception to?,49
243,Mr FALKINER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The agreement entered into by the full Board, and the honourable member has said that, it was not entered into in an open manner.",49
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That is not out of orders,49
245,Mr HIGGS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"When I say that the agreement was not entered into in an open manner I mean to say that in the case of a business proposition of this kind from which the Government expect to make £70,000, and from which the Colonial Combing and Weaving Company will make at least another £70,000, the public of Australia generally should have been invited to enter into it Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - Are we making £70,000 out of it ?",49
246,Mr HIGGS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The Prime Minister said that the Government would make that much out of it . The honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) must see that in a business transaction like that in connection with which a firm like the Colonial Combing and Weaving Company may make such profits, a similar opportunity to participate in the profits on the sale of wooltops should have been afforded to the public generally of Australia. vertisement should have been inserted in the newspapers to the effect that the Commonwealth Government were prepared to enter into an agreement with any company possessing wooltops manufacturing machinery, or prepared to bring it into Australia, upon certain terms that would be fair and aboveboard.",49
247,Mr FALKINER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Will the honourable member say what other firms would be concerned ?,49
248,Mr HIGGS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That has nothing to do with it .,49
249,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Our own mill, at Geelong, and Foy and Gibson's make wooltops.",49
250,Mr HIGGS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That has really nothing to do with the question. The Government desired to enter intb an agreement in connection with this business, and they The mat* had a right' to let the public know. The Central Wool Committee, and the members of the Government knew all about this matter, and they entered into this private arrangement-privat e in so far as the public knew nothing about it - with the Colonial Combing and Weaving Company. My questions on the subject have been direct and straightforward, and was they should have been answered directly and straightforwardly. I put a question on the paper about this matter today, bu t the Prime Minister could not answer it straight off. He asked me to give him three or four days' notice, and it is to be answered next Wednesday. This question is asked to enable me to learn who is the member of the Central Wool .Committee who is interested in this matter. I am aware that the committee is an honorary committee, and that its members are not paid. There are eleven members of the Government, and if they were largely interested in a contract with the Government, would the honourable member for Hume consider that regular? The Central Wool Committee are no doubt carrying - out their duties very ably, and in an honorary capacity, but they should not in their position enter into an arrangement with a company privately that is not open to the general public. Does the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) not see that? This is the reason for my question. When I get a list of the shareholders of the Colonial Combing and Weaving Company and discover whether it is true that a An admember of the Wool Committee is in terested in the agreement, it will be my duty to ask the Government to give me an opportunity to discuss the matter, or take advantage of such opportunities as I may be able to secure under the forms of the House to do so. I can assure the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) that, so far as I am concerned, he will then have every opportunity to answer any statements I may make. I believe thatthis business has not been carried out as' it ought to have been, and that is owing, I believe, to the fact that the Central Wool Committee has been caught napping, as I said before, by one of its members, who is a little more clever than the rest. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.10 p.m.",49
