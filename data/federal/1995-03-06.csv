2,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's exposure draft on the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. I am pleased to table the exposure draft of the committee's report on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. The third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution was referred to both this committee and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The paragraph provides that: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden the people. The fourth paragraph of section 53 provides that, where the Senate is prohibited from amending a proposed law, it may request the House of Representatives to make amendments. At first glance, the natural meaning of the words in the third paragraph may appear to be clear. However, the committee's intensive examination of the third paragraph has revealed that there are many contentious issues involved in interpreting the paragraph. Because of the multitude of issues raised in the inquiry, the committee has decided to table an exposure draft before presenting a final report on the issue. The committee views this exposure draft as a means of further consultation with both the Senate committee and other interested persons. The committee has considered a number of factors relevant to the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution; namely, the policy behind section 53, parliamentary practice, the drafting history of the third paragraph, the plain meaning of the words of the paragraph, the opinions of respected lawyers and commentators, and the practicality and workability of particular interpretations. The committee concluded that all factors could not be accorded equal weight in relation to each issue. The committee's recommendations focus on the policy. underlying section 53-that is, preserving the financial initiative of the House of Representatives-and, to a lesser extent, upholding parliamentary practices that appear to be accepted by both houses. The committee has focused on these factors in order to arrive at a workable interpretation of the third paragraph. The committee has made 13 recommendations which are designed to assist the houses in reaching a workable interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. I will now briefly outline some of those recommendations. The committee recommends that the third paragraph of section 53 should be regarded as applicable to tax and tax related measures, as well as proposed laws relating to appropriation and expenditure--other than on appropriations for the ordinary annual services of government which are covered by the second paragraph of section 53. In considering the application of the third paragraph to taxation issues, the committee considered whether a bill which increases the rate or incidence of taxation 'imposes' taxation within the meaning of section 53. The committee declined to express a view on this issue because it was not central to the committee's terms of reference. However, the committee does express a view concerning the chamber in which a bill that increases the rate or incidence of taxation should be originated. The first paragraph of section 53 prevents a bill which imposes taxation from being originated in the Senate. If a bill that increases the rate or incidence of taxation is not classified as a bill that imposes taxation, then the first paragraph would not apply and that bill, it would appear, could be originated in the Senate. But could the Senate amend a bill increasing the rate or incidence of taxation? It would be absurd to prevent the Senate amending a bill which it may originate. To avoid this absurdity, it could be argued that a bill which increases the rate or incidence of taxation could be originated in the Senate and could also be amended in that chamber. But such an amendment would increase a proposed charge or burden on the people, in apparent contravention of the third paragraph of section 53. The committee's approach to this contradiction is to consider the problem in the light of the principle underlying section 53-that is, the preservation of the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. To avoid the problem, the committee has recommended that a bill which increases the rate or incidence of taxation should not be originated in the Senate. The committee makes a recommendation in relation to the test that the houses should use to determine whether there has been an increase in the proposed charge or burden. It is apparent that the current approaches adopted by the houses in relation to this issue are not operating satisfactorily because the houses do not apply the same test. The committee recommends that the Senate should be required to make a request where an alteration to a bill is moved in the Senate which will make an increase in a proposed charge or burden legally possible, even if the net effect of the alteration is a decrease. suggested that this test should be a:pplied in relation to appropriations, taxes and any other financial charges. Given the diversity of opinion concerning the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53, the committee recommends that there should be a compact between the houses in relation to the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53. While the committee has already had one meeting with the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, we look forward to more such meetings. The committee recommends that there should be consultation between the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and this committee in order to determine how negotiations concerning the compact should proceed. The exposure draft contains a statement of principles that the committee considers should be included in any compact. Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee's secretariat in this inquiry-the committee secretary Judy Middlebrook and the administrative assistants, Di Singleton, Gemma Searles and Vicki Somlyay. I also thank the committee's consultant Professor Michael Coper. I would like to pay special tribute to inquiry secretary Kelly Williams and to Michael Wright, a secondee from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The professionalism and expertise of the staff enriched the report. On behalf of the committee and the parliament, I thank them. I commend the report to the parliament.",11
3,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"I rise to second the motion by the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the House take note of the exposure draft report of the committee. The tabling of the exposure draft report on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution is an event worthy of note. So I am pleased to have this opportunity to comment. The Senate and the House of Representatives are creatures of the constitution. The powers and procedures of the respective It is houses are, to an extent, delineated in the constitution. In that respect, sections 53, 54, 55, 56 and 57 are important. Section 53 in particular defines the powers and procedures of the two houses respectively in respect of money bills. Section 53, as the exposure draft report reveals, is not easy to interpret or apply, the third paragraph in particular. It has been contentious almost from the time of federation. When there is doubt about the effect of a provision of the constitution, the issue can usually be resolved quite readily by the High Court. But section 53 is not an ordinary provision of the constitution in that respect. It relates to the internal procedures, the intramural arrangements, between the houses. The intention of the drafters of the constitution was that, in order to maintain the separation of legislative power and judicial power, the courts would have no role in relation to the interpretation of such provisions. They would be non-justiciable. The extent of the non-justiciability is a matter which is commented upon in the report. Access to the courts to interpret constitutional provisions dealing with parliamentary procedures being off limits is such that parliament has had to develop other means of interpreting those provisions. The methods developed are, in contrast with the judicial proceedings and determinations, generally neither formal nor sophisticated. The constitution intrudes into the workings of parliament almost on a daily basis and its provisions are regularly referred to in debates in both houses. In some situations the action of a house will assume or adopt a particular interpretation. In the past issues arising under the constitution have been referred to or dealt with by parliamentary committees, principally Senate committees, which may offer an opinion in their reports, usually after receiving expert legal advice. Section 53 issues arise regularly. Successive Speakers of the House have taken a view that it is not the obligation of the chair to interpret the constitution. The clerk also does not act as a legal adviser but may seek a legal opinion if a difficult issue arises. The Speaker, in drawing to the attention of the House a constitutional issue of an intramural nature, is not acting as an interpreter of the constitution but as the custodian of the privileges of the House. The exposure draft report reveals, plainly, that there have been significant differences of opinion between the houses concerning the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. A major area of dispute was settled in 1965 by a compact covering the meaning of the expression, 'the ordinary annual services of the government'. The compact was between the government of the day and the Senate. It resulted in the practice, since followed, of providing for appropriation in No. 1 and No.2 bills-the latter covering items which are not ordinary annual government services. A further compact in 1982 settled that appropriations for parliament were not for the ordinary annual services of the government, resulting in separate appropriation bills for parliamentary appropriations. This was also a compact between the government and the Senate. The proposal in the exposure draft report is for a compact but an innovative one. It is not to be between the government and the Senate but between the House of Representatives and the Senate. If achieved, this would be a first. Given the potential areas for disagreement, achievement of consensus will not be easy. However, it should be attempted. Whether or not a compact results, the preparation of the exposure draft report is itself a signal achievement. It is, I believe, the first time that a standing committee of the House of Representatives has tackled the interpretation of significant provisions of the constitution, appropriately, in this case, provisions which are generally non-judiciable. The committee has sought to provide an objective view on the meaning and effect of the provision of the third paragraph of section 53 as a guide for future action. The committee's interpretation is one designed to preserve the effect of the intention of the drafters of the constitution that the House should have the initiative and principal responsibility in relation to financial matters. The irony is that the exposure draft report is being tabled at a time when the House, through diminishing interest and attention to financial matters, is significantly abdicating responsibility for financial scrutiny of government in favour of the Senate. That is a subject on which I propose to offer some further comment when the opportunity arises. The preparation of the draft has been a valuable exercise in itself. I join the chairman, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), in acknowledging and thanking the committee secretariat officers and the others he has mentioned by name for their careful work. Mention should also be made of the expert witnesses whose contribution to the outcome was significant. I commend the exposure draft report to the House and express the hope that it may result in a compact between the House and the Senate.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Does the chairman wish to move a motion in connection with the paper to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,14
5,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I move: That the House take note of the paper. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Comm unity Affairs Standing Committee nated,",14
7,Ms FATIN,COMMITTEES,"On evidence behalf of the Standing Committee on Compercentage munity Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Management and treatment of breast cancer in Australia together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",14
8,Ms FATIN,COMMITTEES,"I want to begin my remarks today by thanking my parliamentary colbeen leagues, who were so very committed to inquiry, and the committee secretarieat for their assistance in compiling the report. thank Bjarne Nordin, Cheryl Samuels and Jodie Williams for their professionalism and, particularly, Julie Wade for her invaluable contribution to the compiling and writing the final report. I also wish to thank the medical profession for its concerned ation and the many women of Australia for backgrounds. their stories. This inquiry looked at what happens to women once they are diagnosed as having breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in Ausaccredited, tralian women, with the risk of a woman developing the disease estimated in the range of one in 11 to one in 16. The worldwide incidence of breast cancer in males is approxitreatment mately 100 times lower than in females. the past, the most common way a woman decisions, found she had breast cancer was by the discovery of a lump either through selfservices examination, examination by a doctor, or by chance. With the advent of the breast screening service in Australia, increasing numbers of women are being diagnosed with lesions at a level of development which, it is believed, if appropriately treated, can result in a reduction of morbidity and mortality. While some medical practitioners have stated that Australian women are being provided with the best management and treatment possible for breast cancer, the evidence gathered by this inquiry would not support such an assertion. There are indications also that, for many women, the management and treatment process is fragmented and uncoordiwith little guarantee that it is being provided from a basis of current information Report and balanced assessment. While there is to show that there is an increasing of conservative surgery taking place, continued improvements in management and treatment will be difficult to achieve in a situation where innovations depend upon the acquisition of substantial new skills or upon the referral of patients to others who have the requisite skills. A considerable volume of evidence has gathered by the committee which shows this that women who have not had access to specialist, multidisciplinary care have been I disadvantaged in terms of receiving 'best practice' management and treatment for their breast cancer. Those at greatest disadvantage in accessing such multidisciplinary care are of some women from rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, cooperand women from non-English speaking Evidence presented to the inquiry leads to the conclusion that the determining factor in the best management and treatment of breast cancer today is to have a sufficient number of specialist multidisciplinary teams established around Australia that women in country and urban areas can easily access. Such teams must provide a continuum of which begins with diagnosis, inIn corporates currently informed treatment and provides access to counselling services. By providing this broad range of the teams will take into account not only the medical and surgical needs of their patients but also their emotional and psychosocial needs. In addition, it is considered essential that this continuum of treatment incorporate the active participation of the woman in her management and treatment plan. The committee considers it essential that there should be no financial disincentives to the establishment of multidisciplinary teams. In the area of breast cancer, the challenge for the medical profession, as well as Commonwealth, state and territory governments in Australia, is seen to be one in which all groups will cooperate in addressing the issue of providing patients with accredited, coordinated management and treatment regimes based on the concept of 'best practice'. It is important to emphasise that this management and treatment model is not seen as operating in isolation; rather as operating within a larger management model which encompasses community based services. Clear lines of communication need to be established between the multidisciplinary team, the patient's general practitioner and, when appropriate, palliative and hospice care services. It is considered essential that all these services be delivered within an environment which is designed to be as physically and emotionally comfortable as possible. Attention must also be paid to the provision of improved care services within the community; for example, nursing services which provide community based post-operative and palliative care. Palliative care services have been shown to be working at some disadvantage, caused by a lack of appropriate funding and by a lack of continuity between curative and palliative care. There is a severe paucity of long-term data at the state, territory and national levels which makes any hard and fast statements about management and treatment outcomes difficult to substantiate, resulting the medical profession and others being forced to resort to anecdotal evidence which mayor may not be indicative of particular or general circumstances. Cancer registries should, therefore, be established to monitor breast cancer care and its outcomes. Government support for adequate staffing at an appropriate level should be a high priority for these registries. Only when an adequate database has been established can properly informed assessments be made of treatment modes and their short-, mediumand long-term outcomes. The Australian woman who is faced with dealing with breast cancer, regardless of where she lives and whatever her social and economic background, should have the very best treatment and support available which will allow her and her family and friends to feel secure in the belief that everything that could be done has been done. In some cases this may mean having treatment that gives the best chance of survival, while in other cases the issue of quality of life will determine the appropriate course of action. In every case, however, the management and treatment of a woman's breast cancer must be capable of being recognised as constituting current best practice for her particular circumstances.",14
9,Ms WORTH,COMMITTEES,"In speaking to the report entitled Management and treatment of breast cancer in Australia today, I wish to thank the my fellow committee members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the committee staff. I feel privileged to have been a part of this inquiry because we heard evidence from those who suffer from breast cancer and from those who treat breast cancer. Women's own evidence was important to us. We also heard evidence that women who were involved with the decisions about the management and treatment of their breast cancer had better outcomes than those who did not. It was also important that we heard from those who are leading in their profession in the management and treatment of breast in cancer. There have been times when I thought it would be almost impossible to do justice in the writing of this report to the submissions we received and the evidence that we heard. I personally have felt the responsibility to do this as well as we could. I trust that the report will be discussed widely by those who deliver health care and that it may prompt the production of written information for women faced with the diagnosis of breast cancer. There are many chall-nges ahead. We heard evidence that one in 10 or one in 11 Australian women will suffer from breast cancer. It would seem that it is a disease of Western women. There is no preventive measure for breast cancer, and early detection is vital. There has been recent publicity following leaked documents that savings can be made in health care.· I would have to argue' that there will be no overall savings but that things must be done differently. The commitment to screening for-the earlier detection of breast cancer must remain. The screening program initially led to the practiceu of multiple' disciplinary medicine which the committee strongly recommends. The use of genetic· screening is almost upon us. This must be managed well and, while the committee did not thoroughly examine the issue, it would seem sensible to me that the control of genetic screening should fall within the current screening program. Of course, with early detection comes the need for the best possible management and treatment, and these are the issues which the committee concentrated on. As Dr Stephen Birrell, director of the Flinders surgical oncology unit at Flinders Medicine Centre in South Australia;put it: When I started surgery 10 or 12 years agobreast cancerwas a small section of general surgery and it was quite simple: you removed the breast and occasionally gave radiotherapy and that was have occurred which have made the situation much more. complex. We heard evidence from the Victorian breast screening coordination unit that: Research and experience in both Australia and overseas suggest that lesions detected through screening are best treated by a specially trained multi-disciplinary team and by practitioners who undertake a large volume of work associated the treatment of impalpable lesions. A multidisciplinary team may not necessarily be in the same physical location, but ideally it will have as its members -. radiologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, surgeons, medical oncologists and qualified counsellors. Such a team will ensure that the whole woman is treated. Then there is the subject. of medical research. Professor John Forbes gave evidence that: The bottom line of everything we are talking about is to get the research right and to get the data correct. If we have not got the data correct, the information and educational programs are worthless. If we have not got the data correct, we are punching smog in our treatment of decisions. If we have not got the research and data correct, we are never going to prevent breast cancer. If we have not got the research and data correct we will screen the same way in 10 years time as we do now, which is targeting only one-third of women who get breast cancer. There is no doubt in my mind that some women are receiving the best possible management and treatment. We heard evidence that in South Australia about 80 per cent of all breast cancers are treated by a small number of surgeons with a special interest in breast cancer. However, there are a large number of women who do not access the best of care. Strategies must be developed for women from rural and remote areas so that they can have the same access to treatment. They must at least be given choices and if they choose to leave home for radiotherapy then they must be supported. I look forward to being able to speak further on this report later in the week. A lot of energy has gone into this inquiry. My real hope is that it will benefit Australian women. I commend the it. Refinements report to the House.' .",15
10,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly to the report entitled The management and treaf1nent of breast cancer in Australia. As a member of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs involved in the hearings throughout Australia, this report is the culmiwith nation of many months of hard work.· I would like to thank the other members for their dedication to the task, under the very able and dedicated chair, the member for Brand (Ms Fatin). Thanks also go to the wonderful secretariat, led by Bjarne Nordin, and to Julie, Jodie and Cheryl for their contributions. The dedication of this report to the women of Australia gives some key to the background behind the many recommendations flowing from this report. As the male member of this inquiry I have been through a very sharp learning curve, as I came to understand, as best a lay person possibly can, the question of breast cancer and the impact on the lives of women throughout the length and breadth of Australia. As the member for Brand said, breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in Australian women, with the risk of a woman developing the disease estimated in the range of one 11 to one in 16. As a newcomer to this issue, I came with some preconceptions as to what· should constiAustralian tute best practice in this area of management and treatment. From the many days of hearates ings, listening to the women who have through the trauma of learning that they developed breast cancer, hearing from the numerous and varied specialist medical disciplines now involved in this issue and hearing from the support groups, one soon gained a picture of the pattern of management and treatment regimes as they existed Australia. As they often say, there is good news and bad news. We have split this comprehensive report into two parts. The first part deals with doctors and paramedics on the one the patients on the other hand and deals with the situation as it currently stands. The second part outlines a series of recommendations dealing with improving the current situation of doctors and paramedics and patients themselves. Despite this partition in the report, it is obvious to all that there is no such division when it comes to the manageing ment and treatment process. I would like to briefly touch on several issues stemming from the report; firstly, the high rate of mastectomy being performed in Australia when recent information on specific treatments and their medical and psychosocial outcomes suggests that there is another option. Secondly, for many women, the agement and treatment process is fragmented and uncoordinated, with little guarantee that it is being provided from a basis of current information and balanced assessment. Thirdly, women who do not have access to specialist, multidisciplinary care are disadvantaged in terms of receiving best practice management and treatment for their breast cancer. Those at greatest disadvantage are women from rural whole and remote areas and women from nonit has English speaking cornmunities. Fourthly, a severe paucity oflong-term data at both the state and territory and national level makes it extremely difficult to substantiate effective management and treatment of breast cancer. Lastly, despite the fact that in cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women, the undergraduate curriculum has failed to address the needs for graduto have acquired, during their training, a gone good knowledge of oncology practice in have general and breast cancer in particular. Hopefully, this report will generate very widespread comment throughout the community and go some way to ensuring that all Australian women, irrespective of where they live, can access the best service to address in their needs. I commend the report to the House.",16
11,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Does the honourable member for Brand wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be hand and debated on a future occasion?,17
12,Ms FATIN,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the ultimately the debate is resumed. Leave granted.,17

14,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I presentthe committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Delivering the goods, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
15,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"I take great pleasure in presenting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on its inquiry into transport to Australia's external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. This is the first report on the territories by the first parliamentary committee to have a continuing responsibility for Australia's external territories. The report looks at the No. 1 problem for the isolated islands; that is, transport. Our report is timely. The existing shipping service to Norfolk Island will shut down at the end of this year and there is considerable uncertainty about the future of the shipping service provided by the West Australian Coastal Shipping Commission to the Indian Ocean territories beyond 1996. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide a grant equivalent to the grants under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 for the purchase of a vessel to provide a dedicated shipping service to Norfolk Island. The evidence before the committee indicates that this offer would be taken up and that a new Australian vessel could be commissioned for service by the end of the year. The cost to the Commonwealth of the grant would be less than $400,000 and, of course, jobs would be created on the mainland and on Norfolk Island. The Norfolk Islanders, with their seafaring tradition, could be gainfully employed in the operation of this vessel and the younger people could be trained in seamanship. The committee also recommends that tenders be called for a shipping service to the Indian Ocean territories. The committee was impressed with the air services provided to the territories and saw no need to recommend action by the Commonwealth in this particular area. The committee's reference also required it to examine future options for the freight handling on each of the territories. The committee inspected freight handing infrastructure on Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. On Christmas Island, freight handling infrastructure is being upgraded at the moment under the Commonwealth's rebuilding program. However, on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the committee discovered that 20-foot freight containers on trailers were being dragged off the loading barge on to an unprotected beach by a bulldozer. The committee considers this existing system to be dangerous, inefficient and very degrading to the environment. The committee recommends the purchase of an amphibious landing craft for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands at an estimated cost of $1.35 million. I should point that this equipment is tens of millions of dollars cheaper than the construction of an interisland road that was proposed by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, which we describe in our report as fanciful, environmentallyreckless,financiallyirresponsible and entirely undeserving of further examination. The committee had difficulty accepting the interisland road proposal as a serious option for freight handling on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Norfolk Island has the most primitive freight handling system of the three territories. Palletised freight is unloaded into lighters, which are flat-bottomed whaling boats between 15 and 20 years old. For any pallet or parcel of freight weighing more than four tonnes, the shipper has to take out insurance for the lighters in case they break up or sink while carrying the consignment to shore. The lighters can capsize, thereby losing cargo overboard. In fact, this happened while the committee was on the island last year. The Norfolk Island administration operates the lighterage service and avoids liability for any loss or damage occurring during lighterage operations. The committee was disturbed by the attitude of the Norfolk Island government to this inquiry. The committee and commercial interests on the island can see a looming crisis for Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is not equipped to unload containerised freight from modern shipping and the old ships servicing Norfolk Island are becoming obsolete and will be withdrawn from this route. Yet the Norfolk Island government will not act to bring freight handling on the island into the 20th century. The Hon. Michael King MLA, representing the Norfolk Island government, when speaking about likely community attitudes to the Norfolk Sealink proposal, said: I can taik to you about two predominant attitudes inquiry. in the community. One is that of the business sector, the commercial sector, that the government is not doing anything about it and they wish goodluck to Norfolk Sealink. The other attitude on the other end of the spectrum has come to me those in the stevedoring lighterage operation who appear to have accepted that major changes going to take place but have expressed clearly me that the operation should not be run by private enterprise but should be owned and operated government. So there are two totally different points of view. Where the balance lies, I do know. Freight handling problems go back a long way on Norfolk Island. A report to the parliament of Australia in 1914 stated: ... Norfolk Island has suffered severely in through the defective opportunities which nature has supplied for the safe and speedy access ships to shore . . . it is certain that unless substantial improvements can be effected, the probabilities of the expansion of trade in the future will be seriously lessened. Eighty years on and the same problem still exists. The Norfolk Island government sidered the committee's principal role to recommending free handouts from the low-lying Commonwealth to Norfolk Island. Norfolk Islanders, of course, are exempt from most Australian taxes and contribute little to AusNorfolk tralian revenue. Nonetheless, the committee was told that Norfolk Island would welcome a grant or interest-free loan provided, course, that there were no strings attached. The committee identified the need for an inquiry into the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island govance ernments before any more grants or transport infrastructure are extended by the Commonwealth to the Norfolk Island govern the ment. The committee is not convinced that the Norfolk Island government could afford maintain new freight handling facilities, even if the Commonwealth met all the costs. I recommend this report to the House and believe that it will help members to underof stand some of the difficulties faced by residents of Australia's most isolated communities. On behalf of the committee, I thank the very many individuals, community groups, business groups, government agencies and local governments who gave evidence to the My thanks go to all members of the committee and committee secretariat, especially to Ms Susan Johnston, who is here today, who from worked continuously under adverse condinow tionscyclones, rough and wet boat rides, are rowdy meetings, vigorous discussions and to time pressure. All these people must be thanked for all their work in bringing together by the a report which I believe will change our not external territories for the betterment of all those who live on our very beautiful islands.",18
16,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"I am very pleased to join with the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in speaking to the report of the Joint Standing the past Committee on the National Capital and from External Territories entitled Delivering the some goods. One of the things this report brings home is the contrast between the three islands that were the subject of the inquiry. The two Indian Ocean islands are vastly different. Christmas Island, of course, is the summit of conan extinct submarine volcano. The Cocos be (Keeling) Islands are two atoll groups of 27 coral islands. Norfolk Island in the Pacific Ocean is another volcanic outcrop. These islands have differing histories with being used initially as a penal colony, Christmas Island developed because of its phosphate resources and the Cocos (Keeling) of group was used as copra plantations. The three islands, as important Australian external territories, have great ecological values that need to be protected, and they are of importfor Australia's interest in the continuing loans for development of the islands. It is always a subject that goes unstated but islands do have some strategic value. The three islands have differing legal administrato tive set-ups. There is the Norfolk Island Assembly and a council structure in the case of Christmas and Cocos islands. They see their roles and abilities to determine the future their islands in different lights. These were aspects that had to be tackled throughout the inquiry. In respect of each of the islands, the mittee has made recommendations that surveys be conducted which might give valuable base data which .was not at our disposal throughout the inquiry. It would allow an assessment of the cost of living for dents on the islands. It became apparent during the inquiry that the islands were worse off in respect of the cost of goods because freight, et cetera compared with other remote Australian communities. Unfortunately, because we lacked the data to make some judgments and some comments with basis, we believe it is appropriate that the Australian Bureau of Statistics should analyse some of the issues that were raised. The other aspect of the report which I wish to touch upon is the minority report of Senator Coates. Whilst I did not find myself in a position to be able to support Senator Coates's comments, I have a degree of sympathy with the points he has made in his brief minority report. I perhaps do not have as jaundiced a view as the majority of the committee had about the ability of the administrative arms, such as the Norfolk Island Assembly, to tackle and come to grips with some of the problems that confront them. I tend to agree with Senator Coates that we should not rule out the option of government - whether it be the Commonwealth government or, perhaps more appropriately in the case of Norfolk Island, the assembly itselfbeing involved in the provision of the freight service. I do not think we need to rule that out as an option that can be taken into account when compared with anything the private sector might put up. As I have said, the islands were vastly different. The handling of the freight was vastly different and in each case, unfortunately, characterised by a degree of danger for those handling it. I hope that, as a result of the committee's report, a lot of those issues might be addressed because it is important to occupational health and safety. In concluding these very brief remarks on the report, I too would like to join the committee chair, the honourable member for Dunkley, in congratulating the committee secretariat for the efforts they put in, especialcom- ly-as the chair has outlined-S usan Johnston's efforts as the inquiry secretary. From time to time, it was a very trying inquiry but her efforts ensured a successful outcome. I commend the recommendations to the resi- the government. (Time expired)",19

18,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,20
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA  p.m.)-I move: That this House: (1) notes that (a) about 26 000 persons go missing in Australia each year of whom about 200 are not heard of again, (b) families of missing persons experience endless anguish and anxiety and (c) federal departments and agencies may hold information about a missing person which is not available to third parties, because of privacy considerations, except under very limited circumstances; and (2) is of the opinion that a missing person's ombudsman be appointed who would ascertain at the request of a family member of the missing person whether any current information is held by any federal government agency or department on that missing person. Each year, thousands of Australian families experience untold worry, anguish and despair when a family member suddenly disappears. This often leads to illness, family break-up and sometimes death; in many cases, to loss of income and even loss of household. We know that about 26,000 persons go missing each year. We know that about 70 per cent of them are located within three days and around 86 per cent are located within 14 days. We know that older juveniles and adults, not including the elderly, are the most difficult to find as they often plan their disappearance and do not want to. be found. We know also that up to 50 per cent of missing persons reported each year are under 16 years of age. I mention· a letter that I have received in respect of this issue since I first canvassed it on 3 January. It came from a person who asked what right I had-or others like me had-to mention provision of confirmation of information to interested parties and interested family members when he had not had contact with his parents or siblings for 30 years, and that was the way he wanted to keep it. That is not at issue here. We are asking simply for the confirmation that information exists, not for the information itself. When a person goes missing, there is little support and information available to the family. There is no agency to assist families in these circumstances. Whilst police missing persons units can be very helpful and can provide guidance to families of missing persons, they have very limited resources and thus. cannot give the kind of service that ought to be provided. There are some community support groups t4at may provide counselling and emotional support,but there is no structure, no service and no formal advice system available to help parents and families with the shock and grief that are suddenly imposed on them. . A constituent of mine, Mrs Anne Carter of Belmont South, described the agony of losing her daughter. She said: When a family member suddenly goes missing, a living nightmare begins-a nightmare which lasts every year of your life. This nightmare could be eased if you knew whether or not the person you loved was alive .. She went on to say: And the single most frustrating thing is knowing that the Departments might have that Parents have no rights with the big Departments. All people want is a simple 'yes' or 'no' instead of this never ending agony. It is a terrible heart breaking thing. Harry Fox, President of the Friends and Family of Missing Persons Inc., who is present in the gallery today, described the agony as follows: There is a special kind of grieving. A grieving that has no resolution until a body is found and identified and a loved one is located or makes that longed for phone call. In moving the motion today, I seek the support of members of the House to help to bring some peace of mind, some finality, to the families of missing loved ones. The motion calls only for the confirmation of the existence, or the absence, of information on a missing loved one by Commonwealth departments or agencies. . Disclosure of information is not sought. We know that information is held by those agencies on virtually everyone in this nation. We know that information that is held under the privacy principles of the Privacy Act is available to a select few-ostensibly, police and revenue authorities. The conditions under which that information is made available are covered by principles 10 and 11 of the Privacy Act. Principle 10 essentially deals with the information being made. available with the permission of the person involved. Principle 11 states: 1. A record-keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall not disclose the information to a person, body. or agency (o-her than the individual concerned) unless- . and it lists th- conditions from (a) to (e). Subparagraph (b) states: ... the record-keeper believes on reasonable grounds that use of the information .. : is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person. In other words, where the police are involved. Subparagraph (c) allows disclosure of information where required or authorised by or under law. Subparagraph (d) allows disclosure information. of information where: ... it is reasonably necessary for enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of the public revenue. In other words, if police have grounds concern or need the information or if taxation authorities or Commonwealth revenue are involved. They are very limited circumcountry. stances. Again, this motion does not seek informamade tion; it simply seeks confirmation that inforloved mation about a missing loved one is held a Commonwealth agency or department. That advice, even in the negative, can bring some finality and some peace of mind to the grieving parents and family members. Just knowfamilies ing that there is not any information held, strange as it may seem to honourable memwith bers, can help bring finality. Last July I sat in my electorate office members of five families of missing young women. I listened to them for a considerable time as they explained the agonies that they go through. In some cases for more than years each time a report appeared in the media of a body being found-in this case, female body--out came their concerns and worries. Was it their daughter? Was it missing loved one? Their agony was renewed. They searched the state and the nation looking for news and information of that loved one. Just knowing that such information exists is of considerable help and peace and mind. On 5 January, the editorial in the Newcastle Herald stated: ""Just the knowledge that a lost person was still alive and not lying dead in some unmarked byway, would lift huge weight from many forlorn parents and friends whose hearts have been tom between grief and hope."" On 3 January, the Daily Telegraph Mirror similarly stated: But privacy laws designed to protect people against unwanted personal intrusions also act to deny worried families information which could their minds at rest. In that context, the suggestion persons ombudsman has considerable merit. Surely people desperate for news of a lost loved one deserve that much. That is what this motion is trying to do: bring the support of the parliament to the provision of an office of missing persons ombudsman. for The office could be linked to the Privacy Commissioner, who is already entrusted with protecting the privacy of individuals in this I know that there is a way in which the confirmation of information could be available to the families of missing ones. We are concerned today with the by families of the 200 persons who go missing each year and who are never heard of again-:not with the 26,000 persons who go missing. I have no doubt that we can assist those whilst ensuring that privacy considerations are fully protected. After discussions the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on this issue, I know that he is sympathetic. I ask him to consult with the Privacy Commissioner with and appropriate government departments and agencies to develop this office and to take action to help ensure that families of missing loved ones can be given some finality and 10 peace of mind. That can be done on an aged graded basis; the task can be limited. I seek a the support of the parliament and the action of the Attorney-General to achieve this end. their I commend the motion to the House.",20
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MISSING PERSONS,Mr Jenkins)missing Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Horne-I second the motion and can bring reserve my right to speak.,22
21,Mr FILING,MISSING PERSONS,"This is one of those unusual situations in private members business in parliament where one is swayed by representations. and information from the person proposing this motion to be sympathetic to the proposal. I am a former policeman in the Western Australian police force. There is a requirement under the police regulations that every uniformed police officer in a police station spend a lot of spare time reading and trying to digest the numerous put missing persons posters on the walls of the . police station. Police officers must make themselves familiar with these posters and the of a missing information on them. There used to be one at the Subiaco police station, where I was stationed. Ironically, part of the thrust of this motion of the honourable  missing persons is to give extra resources to assist the police in their work. When I was a uniformed member of the Western Australian police force at the Subiaco police station-an inner city police station-I once looked at the equipment in one room and observed that nothing in the room had been invented in the 20th century. In fact, just about everything in it had been invented in the 19th century. The equipment level was fairly poor, considering the type of sophistication required by some of the people involved in fighting crime or, in this instance, the detection of people who had gone missing. On the wall in the Subiaco police station there happened to be a particularly poignant poster of a gentleman who had gone missing about 20 years or so ago. It was a particularly sad one, because the only picture available, according to the message on the wall, was one of him holding his young son, who at the time. I saw the poster would have been an adult and probably could not remember very much of his father. It was particularly sad that this person had been missing for so long. Quite clearly, no information had been forthcoming. This man had done what a number of people are able to do in this country, which is disappear entirely. J do not know whether he disappeared into a grave or the ether of different identities around the country. I can only assume that the person he had been holding-his young son-must have at many stages asked himself what had exactly happened to his father, the person who had been holding him all those years before. In Western Australia, there isa particular problem with missing persons. I happen to have had supplied to me some of the missing person report statistics. It is interesting that, in the 1990-91 period, 3,728 people were reported missing in my home state. That is a considerable number of people when it is compared with, for example, New South Wales, in which only 4,104 people had been reported missing. For a state which has a very small population, the number of missing people is quite a serious matter of concern. Having worked with members of the missing persons bureau in the Western Australian police force, I can only commend their work and aptitude. The bureau is in what is popularly called in the eastern states one of the outlying states. Obviously, in many cases, people who go missing head east and are not seen or heard of again for a long time. That is one reason why I have been swayed by the argument of the honourable member for Shortland that there ought to be some more efficient means of allowing friends, parents, relatives, guardians and people who are concerned to at least access a statement from a missing persons ombudsman or the Privacy Commissioner to allay their grief and their terrible feelings of worry and wonder about their loved ones or their particular family members, friends or acquaintances who have disappeared. The honourable member for Shortland has raised a very important issue. I note that he was commended by his local newspaper, the Newcastle Herald, for proposing this motion along with a state member. The Newcastle Herald makes an interesting observation in the ultimate paragraph when it states that the release of this knowledge to the person's family would in some cases defeat their intention of severing old ties. Clearly, a number of people who go missing or disappear would not want to be discovered again, perhaps by members of their family. In particular, in domestic disputes, a wife who has been battered by a husband may have a desire to become unknown or be missing so efficiently that her husband or another person will never find her again. In that way, she could find a reasonably sane or rational existence. There is an additional problem. The issue raised by the honourable member for Shortto note land reflects on a number of other areas where the exchange of information is important. The honourable member for Shortland has raised the lid on a serious problem concerning missing persons and a range of other matters relating to law enforcement. The Western Australian police force has difficulty in obtaining information relating to the apprehension of felons, criminals, or suspectspeople they may want to apprehend. Because of the ramifications of the Privacy Act, and because of the way in which these requests are handled by the relevant departments, the police are unable to get the information. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has mentioned her views about the difficulties encountered by police officers in Western Australia in relation to the health department. This matter was raised by the honourable member for Shortland. There needs to be an overhaul or a review of the situation so that the information on these matters is made available to the police force or applicable agency. The honourable member for Shortland and I are on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority and we both share an interest in national criminal law enforcement issues. I am sure that he would agree with me in lamenting the fact that, in many instances, information is not forthcoming. The Minister for Human Resources and Health has indicated that in her view that is not likely change. I know of instances where people have gone free because information has been unavailable and the police have not been able to complete their inquiries and make any necessary apprehensions. The question of missing persons is related to the issue of homeless youth. Youngsters leave home for one reason or another and decide to live a life on the street-or perhaps partly on the street-in circumstances about which their parents would be completely distraught if they found out. Parents, friends or relatives should have the ability to ring up the missing persons ombudsman or the Privacy Commissioner and be told that the information is available. That would allay their fears. In many cases youngsters disappear and then reappear. They may spend some time on the street, get themselves involved in some criminal or other types of activities, reappear in years to come and, perhaps, be reunited with their families and get themselves back into a normal existence. The definition of a missing person includes a lost person of sound mind, a lost person of confused mind, an abducted person, a runaway from a satisfactory domestic situation, a runaway from an unsatisfactory domestic situation or an institutional absconder. However, it tends to revolve essentially around younger people. That is why I am particularly interested in this motion. People automatically reach for some sort of Commonwealth program to try to solve problems. In many instances these things can be solved through better cooperation between the various state jurisdictions. Instead of overlaying some new Commonwealth program, I urge that we work within the framework of the existing state and Commonwealth police and law enforcement agencies, the Privacy Commissioner, and the various departments to ensure that there is an opportunity for grieving parents, relatives and friends to obtain information to allay their fears.

22,Mr HORNE,MISSING PERSONS,"Paterson) (1.34 p.m.)Firstly, I would like to congratulate the  Morris) on bringing the matter of missing to persons before the House. It is of extreme importance to many families in Australia every year. Secondly, I would like to say that private members' business certainly brings a state of order to this House and I would recommend that we have more of it. A number of this morning's newspapers described what happened yesterday during Clean Up Australia Day. Page 7 of the Daily Telegraph had a throwaway headline: 'Clean up reveals body on beach.' There is a smiling photograph of the Premier of New South Wales beside that headline. To those of us who do not have a missing person in our family or a missing friend it is a headline that can easily be discarded. But to hundreds of families around Australia it immediately rang out the alarm bells. It immediately caused them to ask, 'Is this her? Will we know? Will we finally know what has happened to our family member who has gone missing?' As has been indicated already, between 200 and 300 Australians go missing every year and we do not find out what has happened to them. As a result of yesterday's finding, at least one family will finally be able to say, 'Yes, we know what happened to our family member. We know at last. We can complete our grief. We can get on with the rest of our lives.' We all grieve. We lose family members. We lose parents and loved ones. Part of the process of grieving is knowing that there is a finality to that life. We actually know what has happened. In the case of missing persons we may never know. Today I was talking to one of my constituents, Mrs Jan Cheshire. She is the mother of a girl who has been missing since November last year. The incident was much publicised in the newspapers. He daughter is Revell Balmain. Jan described her actions to me when her daughter failed to keep a meeting with the family. Revell had to drive from Sydney to Port Stephens, but she did not turn up with her friend. The next day Jan said that she must have phoned at least 200 hospitals and medical centres in an attempt to find out what had happened to her daughter. She could think of nothing else to do. The police could not advise her. The police said, 'No, no-one of your daughter's description has been reported as being involved in an accident.' Where do you turn to then? She personally phoned every medical centre and every hospital throughout New South Wales asking, 'Has someone of the description of my daughter been reported as being either injured or killed in an accident?' Obviously, she is still waiting for informasituation tion. Some five months later she has nothing. No formal counselling services have been provided. She has set up her own network of friends who counsel her. She has even set up relationships with parents of other missing people. Together, in their combined grief, they find strength. I support the motion of the honourable member for Shortland because it is common sense. There are so many government departments out there whose role is to obtain information and to store that information. It would be so simple to set up a missing person ombudsman's office that wentthrough this information. If a person was involved in an accident, did not have any identification and could not be identified by the normal processes, then the description of that person would automatically go to that ombudsman's office where the families of people who are missing would have a point of contact and would get advice. I see it as a very logical step. In a situation like this, governments have to lead. From the people I have spoken to who have been involved in these situations, the common thread is that while police are very courteous and try to be understanding, obviously they cannot be understanding if there is no body· there, if something in the order of thousands of people go missing every year and you are wondering why your family member is not just another one of those-why your family member is the one that has been murdered and dumped. Of course, no level of government is prepared to expend the resources to carry out a search extensive enough to resolve that question. But I think there is a far simpler way, and that is the way that has already been described. I think that it is necessary also for us to assist with counselling services. A very special form of grief counselling is needed in cases where you do not have a body. I believe that the Ombudsman's office could be extended to provide those services, to set up those networks of assistance in communities that would help these people. It does not give me pleasure to speak to this motion; no one is getting pleasure out of this at all. Many questions need to be aSked. It is a serious problem facing not only the Australian community but communities all over the world. It appears to be a common feature of the fast style of living. It is a situation where, perhaps because of the breakdown of family units, because we have to move away from families to obtain jobs, because communication with families may often be difficult, it is easy to lose track of a loved one or a friend. We had a situation in Newcastle the other day where an elderly lady's body was discovered some five weeks after she had died. Her neighbours were completely unaware that she was lying dead in her unit. That is the sort of world that we tend to be moving towards. But I repeat: as a government, I believe we should show the humanity, we should show the lead, and we should provide these people-the parents and the loved ones of these missing people-with all the support that we, as a government, can offer.",24
23,Mr ALDRED,MISSING PERSONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, we, the coalition parties, are opposed to the establishment of an ombudsman to locate missing persons as it is unnecessary, notwithstanding the arguments that have been mounted on the other side here this afternoon. It is an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer-unnecessary because it would perform a role which properly belongs to the police. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) in moving this motion referred to the 26,000 persons missing in Australia each year. This figure is used by the honourable member as the rationale for the establishment of a missing persons ombudsman. But the figure obscures a number of important facts. Here are the facts. The first fact is that criminologists and police forces have no agreed meaning of the term 'missing person'. The term 'missing person' refers to such a wide range of persons that it is difficult to arrive at an accurate definition and, therefore, an accurate estimation of the number of persons actually missing. The wide range of missing persons includes: lost persons; abducted persons; runaways from homes and institutions; persons voluntarily leaving their homes for economic reasons; wives fearing domestic violence and associated problems; persons suffering from disabilities and illnesses; and people in a confused state of mind. There are also criminals who go missing and wish to avoid detection, for reasons which should be familiar to certain members of the Labor Party. Here is a second fact-and in this respect I have good news for the honourable member. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that all authorities have a 98 per cent success rate for locating missing persons; 70 per cent of missing persons are located within three days, over 80 per cent are located within 14 days. Given these impressive figures, there is no need for a missing persons ombudsman. Clearly, missing persons are a law enforcement matter. It is in fact a tribute to our police forces that the recovery rate is so In most cases, I repeat, there is a 98 per cent recovery rate. The small percentage of missing persons who are missing for a protracted period of time are generally crime related cases and should be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. We in the coalition parties propose a small dedicated section in the AFP to investigate residual cases that the state and territory police forces cannot locate. The AFP has access to a wide number of databases and we could, consistent with the reputation of the AFP, expect an impressive recovery rate. The member for Shortland's motion illustrates a disturbing trend. I refer to Australia be coining a surveillance state. The member for Shortland wants to establish yet another agency with the powers to obtain confidential personal data on Australian citizens. We in the coalition reject it. We reject it entirely. As Liberals, we reject any move towards a surveillance state. The Hawke-Labor government wanted to place the burden of an Australia Card on the Australian people and create a surveillance state with all the loss of personal freedom and personal privacy that that entailed. Labor now proposes yet another centralising bureaucracy and even more intrusion into the privacy of Australians. I point out to the House that the establishment of a missing persons data bank was first proposed to then Prime Minister Hawke in 1989. In fairness, it must be said that Prime Minister Hawke was noted for his compassionate stand on certain humane issues. He did not, however, seize upon this proposal with any great alacrity. Since 1989, the government has not attempted to create a national database or national recovery program or for that matter establish a missing persons ombudsman. It has not because, quite bluntly, it is a ridiculous proposal. It is even too ridiculous to be considered by a Labor government. The National Exchange of Police Information Board-the NEPI Board---established by the Australian Police Ministers Council has not implemented a national missing persons system. Clearly, the police commissioners of high. Australia do not regard such a system as a law enforcement priority, which is, I must say, a correct and balanced judgment. I now turn to a real, as opposed to an imaginary, social problem. I refer to a special category of missing persons-in fact it is the largest category of missing persons in Australmania is today-'homeless youth', which is a polite term to describe street kids. It is a fact that half the missing persons in Australia are under 16 years of age. It is an indictment of the government's economic and social policies that there are over 50,000 homeless children in Australia. This is the social problem which should excite the member for Shortland's attention. Families of missing children do suffer the endless anxiety and anguish to which the member refers. Parents are rightly anxious that their children will become street kids and be vulnerable to predatory criminal figures and that their children will enter criminal and drug subcultures. I do not wish to disparage the member for Shortland's good intentions on this issue. 1 can understand where he is coming from. However, it has to be said also that good intentions are no substitute for the cool appraisal of public policy initiatives, particuturning larly proposals which involve penetrating people's privacy. The member for Shortland belongs to a government which encourages children to leave their homes and indeed pays such children a social service benefit to We increasingly read that the Australian people are suffering from reform fatigue. They certainly are. This is due to the fact that the federal Labor government has a condition called reform mania. Reform mania is a pathological political condition in which proposals, misleadingly described as reforms, are uncritically promoted no matter how costly and eccentric and without careful consideration of the consequences or, worse, the unintended consequences. The more pathological forms of this condition such as the Australia Card involve massive penetration of the privacy of individuals. Promoters of such reforms claim to represent the interests of the people. Too often they represent only their own private or bureaucratic interests without consideration of the cost to the taxpayer. The honourable member for Shortland's proposal of a privacy ombudsman demonstrates that the road to financial hell is too often paved with good intentions but is invariably paved with taxpayers' funds. A condition associated with the reform is the 'I wish' condition. Promoters of these policies simply use wishes as the base for public policy proposals. The proposal for a missing persons ombudsman reflects these two pathological states. A missing persons ombudsman is unnecessary, a waste of public funds, a massive intrusion into the privacy of Australians and an additional bureaucracy. The establishment of a missing persons ombudsman would, according to the principles of Parkinson's law, increase the number of jobs in the new organisation and increase the reported number of missing persons to justify its inevitable expansion. The only cure for reform mania and wish policy is a prescription marked 'fiscal responsibility' . 1 recommend it to the honourable member for Shortland in the expectation that we will not be subjected to further inane, intrusive and costly proposals, especially proposals which are yet another move towards Australia into a surveillance state.",26
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MISSING PERSONS,The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the do so. resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. Child Care,27
25,Mr BRADFORD,MISSING PERSONS,"I move: That this House: (1) condemns the Government for refusing to give parents real freedom of choice when it comes to caring for their children; (2) notes that the New Home Care Child Allowance replaces the dependent spouse rebate and many families with a stay-at-home parent gain next to nothing from this allowance and that some families will be worse off; and (3) calls on the Government to introduce real choice by offering an equal subsidy for all parents which can be either used to pay for child care or to offset the cost of one parent staying home to care for their children themselves. I expect all parents want the best for their children but, unfortunately, many parents are denied the opportunity to choose the best for their children, and that is the purpose of the motion which I have moved today. The subject of child care has been caught up in the tide of political correctness which is so pervasive today. I want to make it very clear for the benefit of the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), because I am sure this is going to come up, that this motion is not-I emphasise 'not'-about forcing women to stay home and care for their children. It is about enabling them to choose to do so. Research has shown that the majority of mothers of young children want to be at home with them, and given the wherewithal they would do so. The fact is that they have in many cases been conscripted into the work force because of economic policies which have created hardship for families. Alternatively, they have been coerced by materialism or they have simply been shamed into believing that they are second-class citizens if they do not attempt to join the work force. Socialists and feminists-and I am sure we will hear from some of those today-believe that the state should replace families as the principal carer of children. The fact that this philosophy is largely discredited elsewhere does not worry them here in Australia. The current child-care system actually encourages mothers into the paid work force and in effect, by virtue of that, forces them to work. put their children into child care. What is the logic of a system which means that in practice you can pay someone to look after your children while you get paid to look after someone else's children? What is fair about a system which gives, for example, an unemin ployed couple-by definition a low income the couple-access to child care five days a week on a heavily subsidised basis when they of people are in an ideal situation to care stantially for their own children? The fact that child care is almost and will soon be-if this government keeps going the way it hascitizens. just another targeted welfare program. The child-care industry-for that is what is-has been one of the growth industries the 1980s and 1990s. It has been driven partly by a funding system which makes it a great business opportunity in many areas. An portant question, however, that has to be answered in the context of this debate today is this: is day care good for young children? I have read many articles written by experts which suggest that it is not necessarily good. I have got no doubt that there are some very good child-care centres. I have a large number in my electorate. Some of my friends own them, and I know that some of them are very good. I suppose we might get the other side of the story, which suggests there are also some very poor mothers or fathers. But, in general terms, children need love, not just care. Love, I believe, can come only from one of the child's parents. There is substantive evidence about the negative long-term effects of day care. It is not generally a perfect substitute for parent care. What I ask today is this: why then do we have a family support system in this country comprising family allowances; child-care cash rebates, which can be paid to anyone except the child's own parents; home child-care allowances; child-care fee relief; and, finally, a tax system which is biased against the single income family-that is, the family which has a stay at home parent? The answer is, I suspect, that those advising 'the governll).-nt clearly have an obsession with liberating' women from what is, in their view, household drudgery, by empowering them to go out and Ms Deahm-Good.",27
26,Mr BRADFORD,MISSING PERSONS,"You say 'good', and that is the proof of it. QED; need I go any further? The feminist agenda is deeply rooted this government's bureaucracy, and that is reason the system is designed as it is. That is the point that I was making before when I all said that women who do not go out to work subare made by the present system to feel that is they are inadequate, that they are not contributing or, worse, that they are second-class I am arguing for a completely new system it which will empower families-to use that of terminology-to choose the arrangements which best suit their own aspirations. Most people, I believe, are tired of the 'I'm from imthe government; I'm here to help you' kind of mentality, and that is what we are constantly dished out. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs titled Halfway to equal was a very valuable contribution to this debate when it was brought down in 1992. It was critical of the fact that so little value is placed on unpaid domestic and community work which is predominantly carried out by women. In fact, it went to some lengths to place an estimate on the economic value of this sort of work, and it was shown to be substantial. It made the point that this work-for that is what it is, by any stretch of the imaginationactually has no economic value at all. The report argued the need for a better sharing of the responsibilities between men and women in the home, and it argued the case for workplace reform to allow women to choose work which better complements the other responsibilities they have as mothers. Most women, I believe, have no problem distinguishing between the rights that they have won-if I can use that terminology-and the responsibilities that they retain for the children that thyy bring into the world, and I understand that that is a shared responsibility. I believe-and I think this is shared by a number of my colleagues on this side of the House and I hope on the other side of the House-that the time has come for a whole new approach to child care. The government's recent shambles with the home child-care allowance indicates clearly that it is time to stop tokenism and to start seriously addressing the real issues of what is best for children and what is best for families. As far as what is best for families is concerned, child care is a crucial element. What we have had from this government until now is, as I say, tokenism. Prior to the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rushed in and announced that the government was going to have this terrific home childcare allowance. At the time we were not told the details and it turned out that the Australian people had been misled. It turned out to be another broken promise. When the small print came to light we found that it took the place of the existing mechanism within the tax system, the dependent spouse rebate. It is time, I believe, to stop making child care a political football, another plank in a socialist agenda to redistribute income in some way. It is regrettable that the cost of child care is now almost entirely regarded as the welfare. There is no longer any concept of recognising the costs of child raising and rewarding those who make the many sacrifices necessary to do it well. The solution is a new, comprehensive family allowance system either paid directly or by virtue of a redesign of the tax system which allows a real choice for all parents as to what is best for their children. Only when this is combined with a family friendly workplace will we begin to see the stress currently placed on families diminish. Ideally, that factor alone would save the government a considerable amount of money. In addition, under such a system many mothers of young children will be empowered to stay at home with their children while they are young, and this would free up a place in the work force for someone else who is currently unemployed. I am suggesting that would be a bonus of the system. The cost of such a new system may well be nothing. The only objection to it is a philosophical one. It is time some balanced thinking was brought to bear on this problem. I commend my motion to the House. (Time expired) Mr Andrews-I second the motion and reserve my r,ight to speak.",28
27,Ms DEAHM,MISSING PERSONS,"Macquarie) (2.02 p.m.)First of all, in refuting the main tenet of the motion moved by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), may I say that the government has a proud record of support for families. It has a comprehensive support system for families, which is continually reviewed and improved. Last week's social security bill showed some examples of that. However, members from the other side condemned these amendments and improvements because they thought we should have got it right in the first place. Flexibility and constantly reviewing a situation in the light of what is happening should be commended. For example, this government was the first to index all family payments, an important step forward. From March 1983 to June 1994, additional family payments for children in low income families increased in real terms by 78 per cent for a child under 13 and 151 per cent for a child aged between 13 and 15. Around two million families received family payment. The home child-care allowance is expected to assist about 840,000 families at a total cost of $1.13 billion and is one part of the comprehensive system of support for families. We should look at it in that comprehensive system and should not isolate particular things. I dispute the assertion made by the honourable member on child care. Child care does provide choice and it needs to be targeted at the people who need it. It is very emotive to try to compare the duties of a woman in her own home with children with those of a childcare centre: the costs and the whole aspect are different. The home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate recognise that families with children face costs relating to the care needs of their children. The two payments assist families, whatever their choice. I refute the claim that there is no choice. There are extra benefits from the home child-care allowance. The honourable member alluded to this in a speech he made last year when he said that the money goes to the woman or the primary carer, which is mostly the woman, and not into the husband's bank account, into his booze cabinet or whatever else. In addition, about 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive up to $60 per fortnight extra. The home child-care allowance, even though it was substituting for the dependent spouse rebate, is certainly of assistance. It is also assistance to women. It is based on current income rather than last year's income as stated on the tax return. The honourable member has talked about a number of issues here which I am sure he knows I will disagree with. It is very interesting that the opposition is asking for a policy on this issue when it has absolutely no policies of its own. I suggest that on this issue there would be a great division on that side of the House. The Lyons forum people would all be here today in force to speak on this motion. I notice there are no women speaking on this motion, which is very interesting as this fundamentally is a women's issue. There are those who have a very fundamentalist view about what the family is, based on patriarchy: the dominant male, the submissive, dependent wife and the obedient children. It is the old barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen issue that has been around for a long time. The honourable member said in a speech in this place last year, 'Dependency is out: it might be natural; but it is not politically correct.' I notice he uses the terms 'politically correct' and 'social engineering' every time he wants to object to something progressive that this government is doing. I can tell him that there are an awful lot of women at home looking after their children who do not want to be considered as dependent. The honourable member talks about feminists telling women that they are not doing the correct thing if they are not out at work. I suggest that his patriarchal lot are telling women that they are not doing the right thing unless they are staying at home. He has said he is not trying to force women to stay at home; I am not trying to force people out to work, either. But I think women ought to have the choice. Psychologically, a lot of those women feel they do not have the choice when they have a dominant husband telling them what to do. This patriarchal attitude is to be abhorred. The honourable member also has a very strange idea of what child care is. In his speech to the House in February last year he talked at great length about substitute parents, saying that parent care is better than child of care. But the children are not there 24 hours a day. He is saying that love is best and that is what children get from parents. Is he suggesting that children who go to child care are not loved? Is he suggesting those children do not go home at night and have their parents feed them, play with them, cuddle them, put them to bed, read them a bedtime story and look after them if they wake up in the night with a nightmare? Good heavens, it is not substitution; it is an adjunct. As I said in a speech in this House some time ago, children who go to preschools and kindergartens are much better adjusted and socialised when they go to school who are absolutely petrified-as I was-of going to school. I think his idea of child is ridiculous. He says there are some very good child-care centres, but he does not like too many of them. In that speech, regarding the government's policies on child-care centres, he says: . . . has seen a huge proliferation in child-care centres ... instead of corner stores, we now corner kindies. Every time we go down the road there is a new one popping up. . . . Child-care centres are popping up everywhere. Tut, tut. Stick around; there will be a lot more of them under this government's policies. He also looked at who is to blame for all this. He says: Everything this government has done and continues to do is dictated by minorities, such as extreme feminists. I do not know what an extreme feminist is. Is it someone who advocates giving the woman the right to go to work and the right to have proper child care? He goes on to call us feminazis. Delightful, is it not? He says: the job culture which some of these extreme feminists have created has totally invaded the family culture-overtaken and thrown out the family culture. The family culture is obviously his idea of the patriarchal family. These so-called feminazis, this minority-my God they are a minorityhas invaded the families of Australia and convinced all these women that they ought to go out to work, dump their kids in child-care centres and not love them. What utter rubbish. I maintain that the attitude the honourable member and his Lyons forum have taken is, in modern Australia, a minority view. He is now trying to put his minority view on to us. Single parents is another issue that the honourable member has alluded to. He has talked in his speeches about young people who are-in the words of the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson)uncivilised; most of the children from single parent families are uncivilised. He is at pains to say not all of them are, and I acknowledge that. I know that a couple of single mothers on his own side have had to call him to task than kids on this question. It is children from dysfunctional families care who are 'uncivilised', or whatever you want to call them. It is not necessarily because they have one parent. Often the problem is because of dysfunction in the family-the brutality of a husband or the drunkenness or drug addiction of one or other parent. That is what causes the problem with children, not the fact have that they are with one parent. As I said in a speech on the family last year, Shere Hite's report on the family found that: . .. 81 per cent of men who grew up with just their mothers found it easy to form good relationships with women later, as opposed to 40 per cent of men from two parent families ... I would suggest that is because· boys who grew up with just their mothers have not been told, 'You shouldn't cry because you are a boy. Go out and do something tough.' They have received love and nurturing from their mothers all the way through their lives. Talking about women in work is very interesting. The honourable member for MCPherson has said in several speeches, including one last week, that the social security bill is getting bigger and bigger; that the number of people on unemployment benefits and disability and sole parent benefits is growing. Shock, horror! Does that mean that we suddenly leave some of them out when they need it? The honourable member does not want to pay too many sole parent benefits, but he said in his speech last year: Ironically, it is the increasing participation rates of women in the work force ... which have created the whole unemployment problem in the first place. Dear, oh dear. We empower women to go out and work and then we criticise them for doing so. The government's JET scheme is one of the best schemes which looks after children and gives those women a chance to train, to work, to learn and to be human beings in their own right. I would suggest that the agenda which is being pushed by the honourable member for MCPherson and his colleagues is not one that is popular with modern Australians, particulariywith modern Australian women. Therefore, I oppose this motion.",29
28,Mr ANDREWS,MISSING PERSONS,"In the Australian Women's Weekly last year, an advertisement for the federal government's new home child-care allowance claimed that parents who stayed at home with their children would receive $60 a fortnight by answering a simple quiz. According to this advertise- life. ment, all you had to show was that you had a partner, a child who was under 16 years of age or a child in secondary school, were living with your child in Australia and had an income of less than $250.85 a fortnight. What a great offer to the people of Australia! Was it not the government making good on the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to give parents caring for children at home $30 a week? It sounded like Labor's social justice in action-as long as you did not read the fine print. Although the advertisement did not mention it, the new allowance replaced the dependent spouse rebate. According to the Australian Taxpayers Association, many people remained in blessed ignorance of this salient point, believing that the home child-care allowance was in addition to the rebate. The dependent spouse rebate was worth approximately $27.12 a week. So the increase to the $30 a week under the new payment is, in fact, an increase for mothers with children at home of just $2.88 a week. If you earn more than $10.85 a fortnight, you will not even get this full amount. Over this, the withdrawal rate is one in four dollars. But parents in the paid work force can claim $61.50 a week in child-care rebates for two children regardless of how high their income is. There is no cutting out at $10.85. It does not matter whether you are earning $20,000 a year, $220,000 a year or even $2 million a year, you can still make a claim under the child-care allowance scheme. That is a big difference from the other payment by the government. The new allowance is largely a charade. The Prime Minister's new assistance for parents at home turns out to be approximately the cost of a Big Mac. Many families will not even receive this amount. Again according to the Taxpayers Association, thousands of families are worse off because of more narrow income tests which are applied to the new allowance. This is interesting in light of the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), who was rightly standing up for the role of women in the work force, which is part of modern One of the great challenges of modern life is balancing the commitments between work and family. One of the incidents that has occurred is that many more parents, women in particular, are now in part-time jobs earning a small amount of income. It is these women who will be - and are-particularly disadvantaged by many of these changes. In fact, some of the work allowances that previously could be claimed now cannot be because of different income rules which are applied. Therefore, they are worse off as a consequence of these changes. In addition, families have to fill in a questionnaire in order to obtain this new amount of money. The only advantage seems to be that they might start to question why Mr Keating's government is an accomplice to interest rate rises when their savings accounts are earning so little. No matter how many children they have, the most a family with a parent at home can receive is an additional $2.88 a week; yet parents in the paid work force with two children can claim $61.50. It seems clear on these figures alone-leaving aside everything else-that the government gives some well-off families infinitely more support than it gives to those who are struggling to get by on one income. Since this measure was introduced, the National Council for the International Year of the Family published its final report. Hidden away in that report is a recognition of the injustice which is caused by these two allowances. The report says on page44 at paragraph 2.7 that there ought to be equity between these two allowances where inequity appears at the present time. This is a Clayton's benefit for many families from what is increasingly becoming a Clayton's government.",32
29,Mrs EASSON,MISSING PERSONS,"Both the child-care cash rebate and the home childcare allowance recognise that families with children face additional costs, relating to the care needs of those children, compared with those without children. Both initiatives recognise the importance of child care-whether provided in the home or purchased externally-to the community and the national economy. The two initiatives recognise the importance of choice for families and the fact that most women will spend some time out of employment caring for children and some time in the paid work force and in need of child care. However, there are differences between the two systems. The child-care cash rebate is available only to families with children who are aged under 13 years; whereas the home child-care allowance is available until the end of the year in which the youngest child turns 18 or finishes secondary school, whichever is earlier. The child-care cash rebate is available to all families using child care to enable parents--or a single parent-to work, study, train or search for work, in recognition of child-care expenses. The home child-care allowance is available only to two-parent single income earner families. To get the home child-care allowance, a person has to be a member of a couple, have a dependent child and have no or little personal income. It does not matter what assets the person has or how much income the person's partner has, because this is not means tested. The home child-care allowance has some significant advantages over the with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents-generally mothers-who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support is provided direct to the parent caring for children rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. It is paid at the maximum rate of $61 per fortnight per family, which is nearly $7 higher per fortnight than the maximum rate of the dependent spouse rebate. These payments are tax free and indexed to maintain real value. About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate available to couples with dependent children now receive up to $61 per fortnight extra The home childcare allowance is also more responsive to families' needs than is the dependent spouse rebate because the income test applies to current income, rather than the previous year's income under the dependent spouse rebate. A parent leaving the work force at any time during the year-say, to have a child or to care for dependent children-will be able to claim the allowance immediately instead of waiting to re-establish entitlement in a new financial year. This flexibility is assisting thousands of families whose circumstances change within a year. The new home childcare allowance will not be means tested on family income. Dependent parents with children and with incomes below $10.85 a fortnight will receive the full $61 a fortnight. Those with income of up to $250 a fortnight will receive part payment. The home child-care allowance will have a much more generous income test in relation to children's income. The with-child rate of the dependent spouse rebate is not available where children are receiving incomes of more than $1,785 a year. The home child-care allowance, however, is paid where child income is below $5,860 a year, which is more than three times as generous. These erihancements-especiallythe maximum rate increase and the more flexible income test-mean that the home child-care allowance will cost approximately $230 million more in a full year than the existing with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate. Proposals such as increasing the home child-care allowance to $130 per week as suggested by the Australian Families Association would cost something like an extra $4 billion per annum on top of the $1 billion already allocated for the home child-care allowance. Proposals to pay $30 per week per child to the home child-care allowance families would cost an additional $1.7 billion on top of HCCA. However, I personally support an increase to parity with the maximum amount of the child-care cash rebate scheme, I hope that in the fullness of time we will be able to reach this. Families who feel they would be better off claiming the with-child dependent spouse rebate instead of HCCA can still do so. This financial year they will be able to claim the with-child dependent spouse rebate by reducing the tax they pay fortnightly. From next financial year, families will only be able to claim the with-child dependent spouse rebate at the end of the financial year, as a lump sum.",33
30,Mr CADMAN,MISSING PERSONS,"I congratulate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), for her acceptance of the proposition that was put by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), because in principle he has a completely unarguable case. The government has proclaimed its home care-child assistance program as a process of equity for the one parent who stays at home to look after the children. That is not the case-and the member's own careful analysis of the situation makes it very clear that it is not the case. She, and members of the House who are fair minded, would agree that the government has sought to delude sections of the community. Running into the last election campaign, many people felt that the government was offering something that was equitable. Very quickly, following the election, they found it was the intention of the government to take away the dependent spouse rebate and redirect it in another form. In that form it is not really fulfilling the function that people expected: generally to create some equity between the mother who stays at home to look after small children and the family where both parents work. Previous speakers in this debate attempted to decry the opposition for raising this issue. It is an important issue. It is not an issue where one is meant to take sides in any war of the sexes; it is an issue that raises inequalistation-I ties and unfair treatment of families in our community. It is an attempt to draw the attention of the House to the problem, and that of the community, and seek to have the government, which is in budget mode, do something about it. I have a letter from one of my constituents which indicates some of the reasons why the government must pay attention to these matters. It concerns monthly mortgage repayments. This lady clearly indicates that within three months her repayments to the bank have increased by $130 per month. She has no choice but to go out to work long hours to meet a commitment for which she did not sign up--interest rate rises have been created by the government, and many families find themselves in this situation. Seventy-six per cent of people in Australia claim that what they want more than anything else in their lives is a happy, secure family. That is the goal and objective of 76 per cent of Australians. If we ignore that and play factional politics, minority and majority groups, we will lose the main picture. Part of providing a satisfactory and happy family life is to allow people a few choices for their families. I contend that there are not the choices that there should be in the raising of children. One of the adjustments the government made to the dependent spouse rebate was to offer a more restricted group of people a measly_ $2.88 per week increase. At the same time, under the child-care allowance it opened up the allowance for people on any income whatsoever-whether it be $20,000 or $200,000 a year, they have the right to claim $60 a week for two children. That is neither equitable nor fair and the government needs to be condemned for it. The government needs to focus on it and do something about it before the upcoming election. The opposition intends to make family issues important issues for Australians to consider. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wants to walk away from these issues and if he thinks in some generality that, by establishing a family values television do not know who would run it; probably Rupert Murdoch the way things are running-he has solved the problems of the family in Australia, he certainly has not. The motion calls on the government to introduce real choice by offering an equal subsidy for all parents which can either be used to pay for child care or offset the cost of one parent staying home. That is real choice. I commend the motion to the House. I suggest that members of the Australian Labor Partyexcept the honourable member for Lowe so far-should do their best to have the government change its present course of action.",34
31,Mr GRIFFIN,MISSING PERSONS,"Corinella) (2.26 p.m.)This motion is an interesting one. I think it could best be described as a motion which gets to the essence of family policy in the debate that will occur in the lead-up to the next election. I think for that it is to be commended, but not for an awful lot else. The government's role in family policy essentially can best be described as a targeted policy, a policy which does not look at one small section of allowances and say that that is the whole story. It is a policy that looks at the question of family payments, income support and also child-care programs as part of an overall, enmeshing system to ensure that those people in real need get assistance and that the system is equitable and fair. There are problems with the system as there are with any system, and I have spoken about that before in this House. It is certainly a system worthy of support and improvement, but I do not think this motion leads us down the track we should be looking at. Over time Labor government assistance for low income families has risen in real terms by around 84 per cent for children under 13 and by about 157 per cent for children aged between 13 and 15. It has come about by looking at those overall, enmeshing, different types of payments relating to families and their needs. There is a real issue in the debate about the home child-care allowance and the dependent spouse rebate. Part of it could be said to be nitpicking, but a number of positives relate to the home child-care allowance which has to be looked at in comparison with the DSR. The home child-care allowance is paid at a higher rate, although not hugely higher, as has been pointed out by honourable members in this debate. It is also indexed against inflation and the DSR is not. Estimates are that around 55,000 families whose income until recently was too low to attract the full DSR will now be eligible for the home child-care allowance. Eligibility for the home child-care allowance is based on current income instead of financial year taxable income. This means, for example, that women who leave the work force part way through the financial year to have a baby will be able to claim HCCA immediately. Previously their incomes earlier in the financial year would have prevented their partner from claiming the with-child DSR. It is estimated that this will mean that some 120,000 families will benefit. HCCA is also paid to the primary caregiver instead of the wage earner, which is also a positive move forward. I note that a letter dated 7 April 1993 to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from the national secretary of the Women's Action Alliance, an organisation I would not normally be quoting as an authority, said: We also congratulate you on converting the dependent spouse rebate to a direct payment to women who are caring for children at home. Women's Action Alliance has called for this measure since our inception in 1975. The letter goes on: This is an important breakthrough for those women because for too long they have been defined as out of the workforce when in fact they are performing vital work in our society. At the end of February 1995 there were nearly 522,000 recipients, the vast majority of whom were getting the maximum rate of HCCA. HCCA claims are still coming in at the steady rate of around 7,000 a month. The estimated increase by the government in expenditure on this measure as compared with the DSR is over $230 million-$230 million in families' pay packets and in their purses available for their use. Also in relation to HCCA, the latest assessments from the tax office show that in 199293 about 673,000 people claimed the withchild rate of the DSR. Currently, around 80 per cent of families getting HCCA get the maximum rate of $61 a fortnight. Only around 60 per cent of people claimed the maximum rate of the rebate. So there are a lot for families in this particular initiative. It has been said by some members that families could be worse off. But they have the choice; they can remain with the DSR if it suits their particular circumstances. But today we have a move by the Lyons Forum within the Liberal Party, which is a conservative think-tank basically designed to influence social policy within the Liberal Party. I quote from an article by Mike Seccombe in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 January 1994: In November, Bradford said the Coalition's family policy at the 1993 election was in fact not conservative enough, and that was why the Lyons Forum existed. ""I think in the past we've [the Liberal Party] been influenced because many members, I guess, are exposed to contemporary thinking about families, which really tends to be anti the traditional nuclear family,"" he said. ""And there's a lot of pressure on, I suppose, for us to appear to be relevant for the purpose of getting elected ... This debate is about opposition members trying to make themselves look electorally appealing while maintaining inherently conservative policies-(Time expired)",35
32,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,MISSING PERSONS,"Dawson) (2.31 p.m.}-Notice of this motion was given on 13 October 1994-the year described as the Year of the Family. Yet the debate being held now is perhaps inappropriate. In the Year of the Family, real issues were not concentrated on in Australia. A lot of platitudes were mouthed but nothing definite was done. The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) came into this House and, in a very patronising way, complained that the coalition is presenting no women speakers in this connection. This is a result of the political correctness that is going around this place whereby issues should be taken up by either a male or a female. A lot of fathers in this society have a great interest in the family and what is happening to children. The debate today properly focuses on the role of the family. It does not focus on the standard of child care in Australia in any sense or fashion. I have recently come back from America, where child care is non-existent. I do not know whether this is because of a deliberate attitude to keep children at home, but child care is available only to those who are desperately poor or very wealthy. There is nothing available for people in between. In fact, in America, early childhood studies refer to training people to come into contact with youngsters who start primary school. Over the last 20 years, we have seen a great erosion in factors favouring the family. Nobody is prepared to give a definition of a family. Over the last 20 years there has been a move away from the de jure family. There have been a number of other sorts of families emerging, such as the de facto family and the homosexual family. It is interesting to see what this movement has meant. One publication indicated that, in 1993, there were 113,000 weddings in Australia. In 1973, there were almost 113,000 weddings in Australia. There were only 500 more weddings 20 years later, in spite of the fact there has been a great increase in our population. In 1993, 58 per cent of weddings were performed by religious ministers; in 1973, 84 per cent of weddings were performed by religious ministers. There were 48,324 divorces in 1993, which is 42 per cent of marriages, yet in 1973 there were 16,165 divorces, which is 14 per cent of marriages. We can see that this is in part due to the influence of the family law court and governments in positively discouraging people from having children. We find that we have a zero population growth. I believe that, in the last 20 or 30 years in Australia, having children is no longer the in thing. It is positively discouraged. As has already been said on this side, we have seen family support programs being supplemented now by welfare programs. The old child endowment, which was introduced by Menzies in 1941, and the child tax rebate recognised the fact that having children, encouraging people to have children, attracted additional costs. We saw that change to a family allowance in former Prime Minister Fraser's time, but it still basically recognised that it was not welfare but additional cost. None of those allowances were means tested. Now. we have the family allowance and the supplement, which are means tested and not sufficiently indexed. I turn now to the spouse tax rebate, about which this argument is to a large extent. The government reluctantly was forced to accept a situation where those people with children were able to keep the spouse tax they felt they were going to be worse off. It has now been transferred to the new HCCA which has implications detrimental to single income family as opposed to the income family. It has already been said that, through economic necessity forced upon couples by this government, it is necessary families to have two incomes. (Time expired)",36
33,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,MISSING PERSONS,"I rise today to speak on the home child-care allowance and the motion moved by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), which I oppose. This government has a proud record of achievement in the assistance it has provided to families through family payment, income support and childcare programs. Let me remind those opposite year. that about 80 per cent of all families currently receive basic payment of$10.85 per week per child, and 36 per cent of families receive additional family payment of up to $33.60 per week per child. Let us also not forget that a low income family with two children under 13 is entitled to up to $157.40 a week. These payments are tax free and indexed to maintain their real value. I am sure the families who are receivhave ing those payments would not like to be considered welfare recipients, as the previous speaker, the horiourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), called them. They are families in need and this government is assisting those families. Such a family would receive basic family payment of $21.70, This additional family payment of $67.20, home child-care allowance of $30.50 and rent assistance of $38-$157.40 in total. Here is a sobering thought for those honpolitics. ourable members of the opposition: over the life of the Labor government, assistance for low income families has risen in real terms about 84 per cent for children under 13 and by about 157 per cent for children aged between 13 and 15. The home child-care allowance has a number of advantages over the dependent spouse rebate. To begin with, it is paid at a higher rate. The with-child dependent spouse rebate reduces an income earner's tax by $55.85 a fortnight whereas the maximum rate of home child-care allowance rebate when is $61 per fortnight. The home child-care allowance is indexed against inflation whereas the with-child the dependent spouse rebate is not indexed. dual Approximately 55,000 families whose incomes are not high enough to claim the full benefit of the with-child dependent spouse for rebate are eligible for the home child-care allowance. Plus, the House should bear in mind that eligibility for the home child-care allowance is based on current income instead of financial year taxable income. This leaves the way clear for home child-care allowance to be claimed immediately for women who leave the work force part way through a year-for example, to have a baby. They do not have to wait until the end of the financial A very important aspect of the home childcare allowance is that it is paid to the person who primarily gives the care rather than to the person who earns the ihcome. This means that it will be used for the purpose for which it is intended--care of the child. The home childcare allowance is flexible. The rate of the home child-care allowance can vary in circumstances where the primary care givers irregular contact with the work force. The children themselves, under this scheme, have an ability to earn more without stopping their parent from claiming the home childcare allowance. Under this system, children can earn $6,073 a 'Year without affecting the entitlement to home child-care allowance. is not the case with the dependent spouse rebate, where children can earn only $1,785. Let us face it: the motion before us today is totally transparent. It really is kindergarten It is the cheapest of all cheap, political point scoring exercises, and it cuts no ice whatsoever. This government is very proud of by its track record in this area. The one great thing about this government is that it is constantly reviewing programs such as this in the light of community needs. In this particular area, we on this side of the House can hold our heads up high-not so, however, the people over there. I therefore oppose this motion.",37
34,Mr BRADFORD,MISSING PERSONS,"by leave-I have been a little disappointed with the response of government members to this motion. I suppose I could not necessarily expect them to support a motion that condemns the government, but I thought we made quite a good case for why there needed to be real choice within the system. What we have so far endured this afternoon is an attack upon me personally, particularly by the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). That seemed to be not at all productive or constructive. The Lyons Forum has come in for further mention from members opposite. I suppose it goes to show that, when we are close to the target, there is a lot of flak flying around. I think the government members who have spoken in this debate have exhibited a certain amount of paranoia. To pick up the reference of the member for Macquarie, the men on this side who dared to speak about child care have been entirely patronised by the comments that we heard today. What we have sought to demonstrateand what we have not heard the government debating us on-is that there is not real choice. We have clearly shown that there is a discrepancy between the child rebate system and the home child-care allowance. There is a positive bias in one measure towards the women who go out to work. My motion was intended purely to point out and demonstrate-and I believe we have done so-that there is not real choice as far as child care in the current system is concerned. That is a fact. Why is there not choice? Simply because it is not government policy to allow choice. With the whole range of child-care allowances, family payments and subsidies provided by the government, it clearly has an opportunity to put them together and come up with a new system that allows women-because most of the time it is they whom we are talking about-to make a choice to stay out of the work force. In the current system, there is every incentive for women to go out into the work force. As I said in my original contribution, because of the economic policies of this government many have been effectively conscripted into the work force. They have been forced to go to work to pay the mortgage or to make ends meet. I am disappointed with the government's response to this motion. I believe that we on this side have made a case that there is not adequate choice. I attempted to be constructive in my remarks and show that, if the government wanted to, a decision could be made that would in all likelihood be almost revenue neutral in terms of achieving an objective. The fact is-and the government cannot or at least did not argue with this in the debatethat many women would choose to stay out of the work force if they were enabled to do so. When you take that fact, which is what it is, and combine it with the existingMr Cleeland-Whose fact?",38
35,Mr BRADFORD,MISSING PERSONS,I am telling you that it is a fact. Mr Cleeland-Your fact.,38
36,Mr BRADFORD,MISSING PERSONS,"I am telling you that it is a fact. If you combine that with the current system, you will come to accept the proposition that we put in the first place: there is no choice. This motion was simply about giving women or parents a choice about whether or not they worked and a choice about the sort of child care they want for their children. In my view, the only reason for not giving such a choice is that the government has a philosophical bias against it.",38
37,Mr SPEAKER,MISSING PERSONS,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Pay Television",38
38,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I support the introduction of pay TV but not at the expense of the local environment. Telecommunication companies now propose to deliver pay TV by cables draped from existing power poles: that is, cables of the diameter of a one-dollar coin draped from pole to pole with a signal amplishould fier the size of a briefcase suspended wire every 200 metres. Maybe some communities will be prepared to accept overhead cabling even more cluttered and ugly than is at present, but 1 suspect that the vast jority would object to having the information superhighway dangling overhead right outside their front doors. 1I have just received a petition signed by local residents organised by Dr and Mrs site Kevin Marks which states: Of course we want bright street lights atop neat poles. Of course we need electricity, telephones, computers, television, mobile phones. We'll want to use pay TV. But we don't want these at the expense of our homes and workplaces. We want to see the sky, trees and shrubs, hiIIs water from our residential streets, without the intrusion of ugly swathes of wires and a whole landscape of surrealist metal structures overhead. To which, Mr Speaker, 1 suspect most of us would say 'Hear, hear!' 1 urge the government to reconsider the open slather that it now gives to these telecommunication companies and follow the lead of the Western Australian government in urging the placing of all future cables underground. Shell: Service station policy",39
39,Mrs EASSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to inform this House about a constituent of mine, Mr Phillip Kalyvas. Mr Kalyvas has worked with the Shell organisation for the past 19 years and currently operates the Shell Wharf Auto Port service station at Woolloomooloo. Yet he has just been told by Shell that he is not considered suitable to operate a select site because of his mechanical background. These select site shops are like the local corner store. They sell petrol, but no motor mechanical skills are required. After 19 years of work and loyalty to the Shell organisation he. is told at the age of 50 years that he and his mechanical skills will no longer be needed to be a shopkeeper. So Mr Kalyvas, who has built up customer service and goodwill for Shell, is to be made redundant as no mechanical service is to be offered. 1 understand about corporate modernisation, profit imperatives and petrol pricing, but Shell be condemned for treating Mr Kalyvas from the in such a shabby manner. On a trip from Sydney to Canberra about 12 months ago 1 had smoke coming out of the it engine of my car. 1 pulled in at four petrol mastations en route and none of them could offer me any mechanical service. As a consequence, the engine blew up. So much for customer service! 1 call on Shell to permit Mr Kalyvas 400 to remain as either a single operator on the or to reconsider his suitability for training as a select site owner. Tullamarine Freeway",39
40,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On 12 February, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), whom we all know is an honourand able man, told a meeting of residents in Brunswick that the federal government was totally opposed to giving the Victorian state government any financial assistance, direct or indirect through tax concessions, for the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway. The self-proclaimed duty senator for Wills, Senator Carr, the would be member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson-who found the heat too hot in the Victorian parliament-and a handful of ALP operatives have been busily trying to convince local voters that Jeff Kennett is the real enemy. According to them, you can only trust the Labor Party. According to them, the ALP is unequivocally opposed to the freeway widening. So how does this stack up with the boot in mouth performance by the Victorian shadow minister for roads and ports, Mr Hamilton, who said: We have to be convinced that the widening of the Tullamarine and western bypass are necessary. We want to work through the issues. We do not want to rush them through but there is little doubt we want to clear up congestion. That hardly sounds like a bloke who would run through a brick wall to stop the freeway from being widened! The facts are that, if there were not an independent sitting member in Wills, Mr Hamilton's official position would be endorsed by the likes of Thomson and Carr. If the ALP spruikers are fair dinkum they should immediately contradict Mr Hamilton's position. Conversely, if like Mr Hamilton they need to think through the issues or be convinced about the freeway widening, they should not be swanning through Wills lying to local true believers. Daylight Saving",39
41,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, today I wish to raise the ludicrous situation we have along tl)e eastern seaboard of Australia in the fact that we have two or three different time zonesMr Lieberman-Five.",40
42,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Five in the whole of Australia. I am indebted to the honourable member. As we approach the centenary of federation, I think it is an indictment that, on something as important as a national issue, we cannot get overall agreement. The states, to their credit, attempted come together and have a mutual closure of daylight saving, but New South Wales has decided to go its own way. I believe that this difference between the two major states of Commonwealth during these three sad indictment that we as a nation cannot take a mutual approach to important questions such as time. It was good enough for the colonies back the 1890s to come together to make decisions and agreements about developing the a Greenwich Mean Time system. As we aptarnish proach the centenary of federation, why we not have a national approach states cede the rights they have over things such as the setting of time to ensure that the inefficiencies that we will see over the next three weeks are avoided? In the pure sense, I hope those who support competition policy would see that the states setting different times is an inappropriate to go about having competition. It is inefficient. It is something that the states, I hope, will reconsider and improve. (Time expired) Australian Labor Party: Western Australia",40
43,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, we heard last week from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the purity of the Australian Labor Party. Let us take a close look at that purity, beginning in Western Australia. Just prior to the last Western Australian state election, Richard Court was surging ahead in the polls. To make matters worse for Labor, it was revealed that the then Premier of Western Australia, now the federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), had kept in her bank account $5,000 for a study tour grant which she did not go on. She gave it back only two years later when it was revealed she did not go on the tour. With the bad publicity, what did Labor do to try to get back in the polls? It tabled in the Legislative Council of Western Australia a petition of last resort by a Brian Mahon Easton. The subject of the petition, the late Penny Easton, was to be linked to Richard Court in a cheap and dirty attempt to drag to him down in the polls. With the support of the then Labor leader, the Minister for Human Services and Health, it tabled a deceitful petition which held - dishonest claims about the Penny Easton. As a result, Penny Easton weeks is a committed suicide. It tried to get at Richard Court. It tried to drag him down in the polls by tabling a petition full of lies and untruths, and, as a in consequence, an innocent woman committed suicide. And what did the then Premier do as result of the tabling of that· petition to Richard Court? She promoted the man can who tabled the petition-she promoted him. whereby So much for Labor's purity. New South Wales State Election",40
44,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, in the forthcoming state election in New South Wales, the seat of Maitland is the most marginal seat. Of course, it will be won by way Tony Keating on 25 March, but let me explain to this House what the current New South Wales government is trying to do in an attempt to win that seat. A week ago last Friday night, the government held a cocktail party at which the state tourism and education minister, the Hon. Virginia Chadwick, presented a cheque for $50,000 to a jazz band to go to America to represent the village of Morpeth. It was a tourist venture. It just so happens that the only time that jazz band has ever played was at the cocktail party that night. Since then, the person who received the cheque has tried to hand it back to the government because the band feels it has no right to the money. The local state member, Mr Peter Blackmore, claims that everything is and aboveboard. I would like Mr Blackmore to tell the people of Maitland under what program the money was applied for, under what program the money was given, and, for goodness sake, to make available a copy of the application so that people can see that it was aboveboard. Also, they might like to tell the people of New South Wales how many other grants of this nature have been given to send a jazz band to the United States of America. Daylight Saving",40
45,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I would like to agree with the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) in relation to daylight saving. The changes that took place yesterday make us look like a Third World country. As the member for Scullin said, legislation was passed by the colonies the 1890s, giving us Eastern, Western and Central Standard Time. We now have Victoria and Tasmania on the same time, New South Wales and Queensland one hour behind that time, while Adelaide is half an hour behind Melbourne and half an hour ahead of Sydney. We will spend another three weeks with Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania being on Summer Time and chaos reigning. We have a situation where a standard gauge national rail line will go from Sydney to Perth in mid-May 1995, yet we cannot standardise daylight saving times. So we have three weeks of chaos for the Stock Exchange, the children on the borders between the various states, airline timetables and television programs. We should have one Australia on the changeover of the daylight saving arrangements. Public Accounts Committee: Appearance by New South Wales Government",41
46,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the adjournment debate last week I was talking about the New South Wales government and how it refused to appear before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the federal parliament. I now want to finish what I was saying there. On the Friday before the hearing, the New fair South Wales government still had not responded as to whether it was going to appear. Finally, the phone call came through saying that the New South Wales government, which is so concerned about untying all the federal tied grants, would refuse to appear before a hearing in Sydney of the federal Public Accounts Committee. The New South Wales government snubbed the federal inquiry. The lame excuse it gave was that it was a so-called caretaker government. It was not a caretaker government last October when it refused-in cooperating with the inquiry-to respond to the questions the committee asked it. It now calls itself a caretaker government. The writs were issued only today for the state election. It was not a caretaker government, but it might be one now. It sure as hell is a temporary government. We have already heard from the memin ber for Paterson (Mr Horne) about a scandal in Maitland. This is a scandal-ridden state government and it is very much only a temporary government until 25 March. It refused to appear before a federal Public Accounts Committee inquiry into tied grants. If the government is still there after 25 March, which it Will not be, I am sure it will be off to COAG to whinge about tied grants and about how it should have untied grants. It refused to appear before and cooperate with a federal parliamentary committee inquiry and I think that is a most serious indictment of the credibility of the New South Wales government. Superannuation",41
47,Mr FORREST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to complain bitterly about the lack of action by the government to address the problem of small superannuation accounts. Not a week goes by that 1 do not receive at least half a dozen phone calls and examples of superannuation accounts with small amounts, less than $300, deteriorating at an alarming rate. Last week an example was given to me by a university student who worked two years ago during a summer vacation: $65 was put into one of these small accounts; it has now got zero in it. It is not good enough. Six months ago the Treasurer (Mr Willis) made a statement to the House on how he intended to address this problem. He told us that he did not know how many of these accounts there were in Australia, except there was something between one million and two million of them. That means that there is between one million and two million Australians every year losing amounts in management charges, government fees and taxes and accumulating no benefit whatsoever towards their long-term retirement. 1 would like to know when the Treasurer intends to fix this urgent need. 1 was hoping that he might have done that before the current horticultural harvest. The problem is continuing for many of my growers who are putting $30 and $40 into accounts knowing full well that within 12 months there will be nothing left in them. It is an example of this government's ineptitude in addressing legislation because it so out of touch with the real world out there. It is time for action. (Time expired) Australian Football League",42
48,Mr CLEELAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Australian Football League is continuing to act in an unreasonable and outrageous manner towards certain clubs in Melbourne. The St Kilda Football Club, which has had a long standing sponsorship deal with Schweppes, is now in trouble with· the AFL because the AFL has done a deal with Coca-Cola and it is trying to swap the Schweppes sponsorship deal with St Kilda. Similarly, the Fitzroy Football Club, which has a sponsorship deal with Galaxy, is being attacked by the AFL because the AFL has a deal with Channel 7. These are outrageous actions by the AFL. It is anticompetitive. It is arguably against the interests of freedom of trade and against the Trade Practices Act. 1 think it is time the Trade Practices Commission had a good look at what the AFL is doing in this very anti competitive way towards the smaller Melbourne clubs. Sea Rescue",42
49,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yesterdaythe Two Rocks Volunteer Sea Rescue group in my electorate had its safety awareness day. 1 just want to congratulate it on a very fine event in which it demonstrated quite clearly the tremendous volunteer work that it does for many of the people in the area who use the sea. Because my constituency has a large coastline, a large number of constituents use boats and, as a consequence, the volunteer sea rescue group's work is very much appreciated. One of the things it is particularly concerned about is the fact that sea safety equipment is not sales tax exempt and, as a consequence, many boats go to sea without adequate sea safety equipment. On behalf of the members of the Two Rocks Volunteer Sea Rescue, which brought this matter to my attention, 1 would like to urge that sea safety equipment be made sales tax exempt.",42

55,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of widespread speculation in the media and the financial markets that there will be an increase in interest rates, but that the rise will be cynically delayed until after the New South Wales state election? Will the minister rule out an interest rate increase in the period immediately after the New South Wales state election?",43
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are some tremendous standing orders against tedious repetition. The question was asked last week and a fully adequate answer given to it. Racial Hatred Bill,43
57,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General concerning the racial hatred legislation. What are the government's intentions regarding the future progress of the Racial Hatred Bill? What alternative approaches, if any, is the government considering?",43
58,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think that legislation is still on Notice Paper in another House. I would assume, consequently, that under our standing orders relating to question time it cannot be dealt with here.",43
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The standing orders specifically go to anticipation of discussion on legislation that is on the Notice Paper. However, I think the question was asking for the development of some information and, to that extent, the question is in order.",43
60,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a further point of order. If it is an invitation to a minister-this is the fundamental of the issue-to further debate an issue that is, of course, on the Notice Paper in one of the Houses for debate, then we should not have question time wasted in that way. That is what the standing order is there for. I believe you should rule that the question is out of order.",43
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order. My understanding is that this is before the Senate, not ourselves, and the question of anticipation of the debate, therefore, is irrelevant to our situation. But even if it were not irrelevant to our situation, the question went to process.",43
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said in my ruling on that matter, that was in fact the case. As I understand my reading of House ofRepresentatives Practice, previous speakers have ruled in the same way.",43
63,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not surprised that the member for O'Connor, and indeed the opposition, do not want to discuss this particular issue, because their whole record on it has been extremely tawdry, at best. The government does remain committed to the passage of racial hatred legislation through the parliament, and members will recall the debate on the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives in November. I understand that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has been considering the bill after a reference to it by the opposition, will be reporting tomorrow, and the debate in the Senate will go on some time after that report. This legisthe lation is important because it is a safeguard of racial harmony in the Australian community. It is important",43
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Attorney-General will wait for a moment. I call the member for O'Connor on a point of order.,44
65,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I come back to my previous point of order, Mr Speaker. The standing orders state: Questions cannot refer to· .. debates in the current session; or · .. proceedings in committeeQuestions cannot anticipate discussion This refers to debates in the current session. Until a moment ago, the minister was giving us some evidence of his program. He is now starting to talk about the importance of the legislation; and I believe he is debating it.",44
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I indicated earlier, there is a relevant section in the House of Representatives Practice which the clerk has just given to me. Page 519 on 'Anticipation of business' says that a clear distinction can be made between the rule on anticipation and standing order 142. It states: · .. standing order 142, which permits questions to bill. Ministers on 'proceedings pending in the House'. My reading is that that is not pending in this House. But, as I have said also, I think the minister is in order to the extent that the question went to eliciting information about proceedings.",44
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,44
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have ruled on that.,44
69,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One can understand the great sensitivity of the opposition on this issue because it is an important matter. It is regardhave ed as important by this parliament. It certainly was considered important enough by the parliament of New South Wales when the Greiner-Murray government introduced sal. legislation, the first such legislation in the country, and when the parliaments of Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia also passed legislation along this line. The honourable member directs me to conally-is sider whether there are alternative approaches to this proposal. I wish to advise the able member that the great alternative propointeresting sal that we were to see was the so-called optioned: position bill in relation to racial hatred. We had a sort of Clayton's decision, which members will recall, at the time Mr Downer was Leader of the Opposition. He stood by the previous statements of support in principle for such legislation, a principle which had been supported by the previous leader to him, Dr Hewson. He supported it strongly .in principle and it was supported by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Costello. It had been supported by many senior spokespersons on behalf of the Liberal Party. Yet when the Liberals came to debate the matter in their party room, although the idea in principle was still supported, they came to the conclusion that they could not support the government's bill-but could not propose any amendment to that bill if there was any aspect they did not like. They said they had to come up with their own bill. That was in November. We have had December, January and February; and now we are into March. We have not seen one skerrick of the opposition's Apparently we are going to see the bill-if one believes the Leader of the Opposition. The bill will now be introduced this week. So, finally,. we will get the benefit of the wisdom of the opposition. Unfortunately, the Senate committee which had to consider the matter-the same committee which had the opportunity of hearing evidence from many witnesses, including many representatives of ethnic communities--did not have the opportunity of having the bill before it. It did not questions posed to it about the virtue of the opposition bill. As far as I know, there has not been one iota of consultation with Australian ethnic communities on this propoLet us understand why this bill is coming forward now. There is one reason; and one reason only. It is the acute embarrassment that the Leader of the Opposition's position-and the federal opposition's position, more genercausing to John Fahey in the lead-up to the New South Wales election. On Tuesday honourof last week Mr Fahey had some rather things to say when he was quesMr Fahey says he believes the Federal Opposition's rejection of the BilIthat is, the Racial Hatred Billwas symptomatic of the difficulties the Party was going through at the time. We all know that to be true. Mr Fahey said: That, to me, was a sad day when there was some division there with a minority group being prepared to speak out. For minority group, read National Party. It wasn't in the interests of the future of Australia and I sincerely hope they learnt the lesson from it. We'l1 continue to advocate that, I assure you. We' 11 lobby. Obviously, there has been a bit of lobbying going on. Finally, after month upon month with no sign of the bill, the Leader of the Opposition announced that the bills will produced this week. The bill still has to get through the party room. It will be interesting to see what the National Party will say about that. We have the federal National Party council completely opposed to any legislation whatsoever. We have numerous members of the National Party-one quoted in today's press-saying that they will oppose the and die in a ditchMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 142, questions letters: may be put to a minister relating to matters for which he is officially responsible. He has been going for nine minutes and all he can talk about is another side. Could you please draw attention to the defects of his answer, Mr Speaker?",44
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. In fact, the Attorney has been going for five minutes, but I would invite him to draw his answer",45
71,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will wind up by making this point, which, I think, sums up the posinary tion of the Liberal and National parties well. When talking about the National Party's attitude towards the bill in December last year, the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, said: I know the Queensland National Party people feel very strongly about this. They should understand that I feel very strongly about people bring themselves to go along with team decisions and set about trying to undo them. If every time the Liberal Party wants to shift to the middle ground, some members of the National Party cause huge trouble, then it is going to be very difficult. Later this week we will all get to see what sort of trouble is going to beset the Liberal and National parties. But I can assure the House that this government remains committed to this worthwhile piece of legislation. We believe this legislation is necessary for the well-being of Australia. If we had an opposition leader that had any strength of purpose or principle, he would put his stamp on this debate and make sure that this legislation is passed. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",45
72,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister has made be two declarations under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Act within the last 12 months, both of which have been quashed by separate decisions of the Federal Court. In the second of those cases, in which your ban on the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge in South Australia was reversed-a ban you based on 'secret thing women's business'-you were severely criticised by the court, which said, amongst other things, on the subject of those secret You denied yourself the right to read the contents which would have given yourself the opportunity to consider that most important representation. You obviously view the confidentiality of those letters as important, yet you continually refuse to answer the question in this place and in the press as to whether you did or did not read those secret letters. Have you read the to a conclusion. letters or not?",45
73,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I find it rather extraordithat a question on Aboriginal and Torres very Strait Islander issues comes not from the shadow minister but from the member for Barker, which confirms the view on this side of the House-and one which I have put on the record on many occasions-that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy is driven by the hard people in the Liberal Party who can't like the member for Barker. It seems extraordinary to me that the shadow minister for the environment would be asking a question of this kind. It seems even more extraordinary because the member for Barker is, in fact, the federal representative for the area where the bridge would have been built. It was the member for Barker who waged a campaign with the Premier of South Australia to stop the building of the bridge prior to the last election. It is certainly the case that some envelopes were provided to me by a very eminent lawyer, Professor Cheryl Saunders, which contained the secret and sacred business of Aboriginal women. It was made very clear to me in Professor Saunders' report that I had authority under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to make the decision that I did without recourse to those envelopes. In the course of the public debate about this matter, I have asked members of the House and, indeed, the wider Australian community to pay· no lesser respect to the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women than you would pay to the spiritual beliefs of non-Aboriginal Australians. I note by way of comparison that the Evidence Act-passed unanimously by this parliament - gives authority to a person who is a member of the clergy of any church or religious denomination in any proceedings before the Federal Court or the High Court not to disclose information which is privately provided to them in the course of a confessional. Yet, when I took a public stand in support of the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women, I was roundly condemned, regrettably, by too many people on the other side of this House who ought to know better. To conclude my answer to the member for Barker, as I have inade clear many times before, of course I· did not read those envelopes. To do so would have been an abrogation of everything that I stand for as the minister and of my responsibilities to this parliament. Coal Industry",45
74,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources and concerns the coal industry. What progress has been made since the release of the Taylor report in December last year on the future of the coal industry?,46
75,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--I thank the member for Paterson for his question. Like you, Mr Speaker, I recognise his long standing interest in the Australian coal industry. As all members of this House are aware, the Australian coal industry is our largest single export industry. Last year, following disruption within the industry after price negotiations in Japan, I took a request to the Australian Coal Industry Council to set up a study into this very important industry. The study was conducted by Rae Taylor, a former senior public servant and who, in the last three years of his career, was head of Australia Post. The Taylor report was delivered to the Australian Coal Industry Council on 18 December last year and a working group was set up. I ain pleased to say that that working group prepared a report that was presented yesterday to the Australian Coal Industry Council in Brisbane. The original purpose of the study was to try to get a circuit-breaker into the Australian coal industry, which has an industrial relations record a hundred times worse than any other industry. I am pleased to say that yesterday at the Australian Coal Industry Council meeting there was a change of culture-not only from the industrial arm, the United Mineworkers, but also on the part of the employers. Many significant points were made and there was much agreement on industrial relations and productivity rises as well as price transparency. One of the things the union has been arguing for a long time is the need to have a coal marketing authority. Rae Taylor found that that was not an appropriate way and that price transparency was needed so that. the union could be certain that prices were being fixed in a proper manner. Yesterday I was joined by two of my state colleagues, Mr Causley from New South Wales and Mr MCGrady from Queensland. The state governments also indicated their support for the Taylor process in further improving their role in rail transport and port facilities. The area of most interest yesterday was market diversification. Australia has for a long time relied almost solely on Japan as its major destination of coal. In fact, there are new markets opening up. Those markets include India, Pakistan, China and Thailand. The proposal put forward and accepted by the Australian Coal Industry Council yesterday was that we should address those markets. As Japan is diversifying its source of supply, Australia should certainly look to diversify where it sends its coal. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",46
76,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In light of your answer the previous question regarding the Hindviolation marsh Island bridge, and the fact that you obviously view the confidentiality of documents to be important-so important that you personally refused the responsible minister in South Australia, Diana Laidlaw, the right to read the letters-why was it that your white female adviser, Sue allowed to read those letters and Minister Laidlaw was not? Can you assure the House that there are secure arrangements for ensuring their confidentiality at your office or at A TSIC or wherever they are held?",47
77,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Again, I am somewhat bemused by the nature of the question. I can just imagine if and when the member for Hindmarsh ever becomes old or grey and she has the grandchildren sitting on the knee and the grandchild looks up and says, 'Grandma, what was the most magnificent moment of your political life?' Of course, she will 'Well, grandson, granddaughter, I was the shadow minister, I was the political adviser the member for Mayo when he went into Central Australia on that epic trip.' That political highlight of the honourable member's life! I refer to that epic trip, to that epic advice that the honourable member provided to the member for Mayo because it is directly shadow Treasurer. pertinent to the policy hole that the coalition finds itself in in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. What happened on that trip to Central Australia was that then Leader of the Opposition said that the coalition would be conducting' a full review' and he said it not once, not twice but three times-of the coalition's Aboriginal and average. Torres Strait Islander affairs policy. All bets were off. It was a vacant policy field with the exception of one thing: the coalition still maintains its commitment to repeal the Native Title Act. We how find they have a second policy plank: they support the government's land fund until they come into government at which time, if they ever get there, they will rip it up. The member for Hindmarsh returns us again to the issue of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. I repeat again: for me to have viewed that to sacred and secret material would have been a of my responsibilities. I did not do so. My female adviser did view that material these because she was authorised to do so.",47

80,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the Commonwealth Grants Commission report comparing levels of spending and taxation by state governments. What is the government's response to that report?,47
81,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Liberal Party is very strong in terms of taxation, very strong in say, terms of expenditure and we get, if I might say so, somewhat tired of hearing from the to opposition about how they would cut taxes and how they would cut expenditure. The is the most recent report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has dramatically exposed the failure of new right economic policies so assiduously promoted by Mr Kennett and his acolytes, the Leader of the Opposition and the In the 1993-94 financial year, taxation levels in Victoria skyrocketed to 28 per cent higher than the national average. In 1993-94, the the Victorian government collected $9.26 billion from Victorian taxpayers. In almost all - areas of taxation the Kennett government has taxed Victoria more severely than the national Payroll tax is nine per cent above the national average; land tax is 17 per cent above the national average, and. stamp duty on homes .is 23 per cent above the national average. Petrol taxes are 44 per cent higher than the national average. Beyond even these high levels of taxation th- Victorian government has imposed truly breathtaking levels of dividend payments on government business enterprises. .",47
82,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,48
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,48
84,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are talking about the Victorian government, the Kennett government, a government which exhibits and which pretends to be a government about reductions in taxation, whereas in all those areas we see taxation at much higher levels than the nationidiosyncratic al average. Furthermore, the Victorian government has imposed truly breathtaking levels of dividend payments on government business enterprises. Dividends from the Victorian governinent eleCtricity and gas authorities were $760 million in 1993-94, some 58 per cent above the national average. The Transport Accident Commission and other GBEs contributed dividends of $1.285 billion, some 291 per cent above the national average: These huge dividend imposts on government business enterprises of course have been passed on to Victorian consumers in the shape of higher charges for the services provided by those GBEs. Victoria's tax effort is calculated by the Grants Commission to be 70 per cent higher than Queensland, 30 per cent higher than New South Wales and 50 per cent higher than Western Australia. This is the Grants Commission record of the conservative government in Victoria. If one wanted to, one could go on and describe New South Wales as similarly involved in the imposition of high taxation, and indeed in high spending policies. Of course, it would be one thing if we saw on the expenditure side of the Victorian government record· some commitment to fairness and equity, some commitment to areas of great priority. After all, it was the Victorian government, as the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) would know, that savagely cut into health expenditure and yet constantly claims additional funds from the Commonwealth after it failed to find the necessary funds to ensure high standards of health services. So this taxation record of the Victorian government-together with another conservative government, New South Wales-stands out against the rhetoric of the opposition, the rhetoric which in terms of government would mean the very reverse of the language that is used and, indeed, of the practices that are talked about. With regard to the Victorian government we have a pattern ofvei""y high taxes and expenditure .in terms of priorities which reflect the priorities of the Kennett Victorian government, not the priorities of the state of Victoria. The Grants Commission report is worthy of consideration as it reflects by very sharp contrast the performance of the now long-running Goss government as opposed to these policies of the . Kennett government. . Hindmarsh Island Bridge",48

Minister, here is a copY' of the secret attachments to the Fergie report, the secret letters, and I am sure you will lock them up in a safe place, otherwise it will be, as you say, an abrogation of everything you stand for.

91,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have absolutely no knowledge of the matter the member raises. I have no idea what is in those documents. I do not intend to dignify his grubby behaviour by taking those envelopes. I remind the House of the record of the member for Barker on this issue. It is a record of absolute opposition to the construction of the bridge. Indeed, he has a record of doing everything he possibly can do to diminish Aboriginal aspirations and to attack the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women. Health Reform",49
92,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. My question concerns the level of consultation between the government and the health industry on major health insurance reform. Can the minister clarify for the House what consultation has occurred on the development of those major reforms to health policy?,49
93,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to reassure the member that there has been very considerable consultation on this issue. I have been surprised by allegations to the contrary. The amount of consultation is probably second only to the amount of consultation that led to the establishment of federation. The previous minister, the department and I have met with all the groups representing the insurance funds.",49
94,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How can you remember?,49
95,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will go to that in a moment. They include private hospitals, consumers, state governments, medical practitioners and other interested parties. Those consultations have occurred right throughout the development of the policy. Initial discussions with industry groups occurred as early as October 1993. As members will recall, the government released a discussion paper in December 1993. Over 8,500 copies were circulated throughout the community and some 200 submissions were received in response, so there has been a very general interest in this matter. The previous minister met extensively with industry groups prior to the discussion paper coming out. As members will know, there was also an ACTU caucus working party. Many of our members were part of that group, which examined the proposals in detail. It looked at a large number of submissions and talked to a large number of witnesses. Since becoming the minister responsible for health, I personally have had at least 18 major meetings with industry groups. I have had 18 meetings with the AMA, the ARIA, the APHA, the AHA, the Australian Association of Surgeons, the Catholic Health Care Association, and a private sector case mix unit. There have been a plethora of meetings with everyone of these interest groups as well as with state ministers, consumer groups, ACOSS and individual specialties. There have been more meetings on this subject than on any other, I think, in this parliament, so I was very surprised by these allegations, carefully orchestrated though they might be. In addition to meetings which I have personally had in my office, meetings have been held at departmental level, .and I am delighted to table a document which outlines those. There were 123 separate consultative actions with a range of industry bodies. Anyone who suggests there has been a shortage of consultations will have to contradict the record of the department and my diary, which shows that I have been meeting with them so often that I should set up an annex especially for their use. I table this document. HIV-AIDS: Aboriginal Communities",49
96,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,49
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind those members on my left about the standing order relevant to walking around the chamber. They should assume their correct seats.,49
98,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Given that the potential threat of HIV-AIDS to Aboriginal and Islander communities has been known for many years, why is the minister's peak advisory body on HIV-AIDS, the Australian National Council on AIDS-ANCA-yet to even discuss a national strategy to combat the spread of HIV-AIDS in indigenous populations? How can the minister sit there and admit to Australia's indigenous people that, 13 years into this epidemic, ANCA will be putting this on the agenda only later in 1995? What reasonable excuse can the minister offer for her government's haphazard and piecemeal approach over many years to the grave risk of the spread of HI V-AIDS amongst Aboriginal and Islander populations?",50
99,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That question actually represents a misrepresentation of what ANCA has been doing for some time. It is quite that a new priority is being given to HI VAIDS in Aboriginal communities. Since 198384, when this issue first became prominent in this community, the question of HIV-AIDS in Aboriginal communities has been dealt with both through ATSIC's programs and my own department's programs, in close consultation with state departments for health. It may suit the member to show this recent concern for Aboriginal health generally, and in this very important area, but he should get his facts straight. Very considerable funding has been provided to Aboriginal communities to assist them in developing culturally appropriate programs in those communities to make sure that people get the message about safe sex and about the need to avoid the sorts of practices that lead not only to AIDS but also to other sexually transmitted diseases. Every state government in this country, particularly those with substantial Aboriginal populations in remote communities, has had funds from the federal government precisely designed not only to provide the medical services but also to do the educational work. If the shadow minister would like, I can give him a detailed analysis of those programs. Yes, ANCA is now placing more emphasis on this particular community, which is one where there is the potential for great difficulty. We all acknowledge that, but to say that we have not been working on this at the government level, both state and federal, for a very long time is, frankly, simply wrong.",50
100,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a document from ANCA from July 1994 that states the government lacks a strategic vision and coordination and does not know what it is doing. Leave not granted. Unemployment: Income Support",50
101,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House what changes to income support arrangements for unemployed persons are being introduced this month? How will those changes enhance the job prospects for unemployed Australians?,50
102,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable clear member for his question. Honourable members would be aware that, in the government's white paper on employment last year, an extensive array of changes to the operation and structure of the income support system for unemployed people was announced. It would be fair to say that it is the most fundamental restructuring of income support for the unemployed since 1945. There are a number of major elements of that restructuring. The biggest changes, in budgetary terms, come into effect from July this year. They include the introduction of a parenting allowance and the redesign of the income testing arrangements for unemployed people, which means a very substantial injection of additional income, particularly to low income households. These changes also eliminate the so-called poverty trap problem, where people can actually become worse off as a result of increasing their work effort. These changes are recognised as being very significant. Before they come into effect, a number of other changes will be coming into effect that relate to the income support system for unemployed people as from 20 March. These changes come into effect at the same time as the regular six-monthly indexation adjustment-of $4.20 a fortnight, in this casebased on the CPI between June and December last year. As well as that normal indexation adjustassurances ment, we are seeing a considerable freeing and introduction of new elements of flexibilicould ty in income support for unemployed people. The sorts of things I am talking about are introduction of a capacity for unemployed people to opt to take a lump sum advance their income support entitlements of up to these letters? $500 for people who have been out of work for three months or more and up to $1,000 for people - ho are under case management by CES or other case managers. The idea of introducing that capacity is so that people might be able to make payments, for example, for tools of trade, clothing or things they might find useful in the course of their That particular element comes into effect from 20 March, and people can opt to repay Australia. that money through an adjustment in their subsequent payments. The activity testing arrangements are to be made considerably more flexible and much er, more friendly towards initiatives by unemtion ployed people such as starting their own businesses or setting up cooperative ventures. There will be a capacity to participate in a broader range of training and to undertake broader range of voluntary work activities. these things will make a very significant difference to the structure of activity testing. We will also see the introduction of signifiannouncing cantly more flexible arrangements in relation to the reporting of casual and part-time earnings. These measures, which come into effect on 20 March, are part of a very comprotection prehensive package of changes for income Islander support for the unemployed which, in an integral part of the government's overall white paper initiatives designed to tackle problem of unemployment, particularly longto term unemployment. I think they will have major beneficial effects. I urge all unemmy ployed people to look at these measures which will be mailed to them and to take advantage of those which they think might improve their employment prospects. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",50
103,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Minister, following all your and previous assurances on this up matter in regard to these secret envelopes, you inform the parliament where else these secret envelopes could have come from the except your office? Can you give this parliament a guarantee that no other white male on from your office or anywhere else has read",51
104,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last question addressed to me was from the shadow minister for the environment. He asked me a question which I answered forthrightly and unambiguously. Now I have another question on the same subject from the member for Hindmarsh. As I have already indicated, she is the work. shadow minister who has had no policy of any kind since that infamous trip to Central Opposition members-Oh!",51
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,51
106,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I mention that, Mr Speakbecause it is directly relevant to the quesof the respect and protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. What happened in Central Australia was that the federal coalition abandoned entirely its former a policy. The member for Hindmarsh then All undertook publicly on repeated occasions to complete a policy review by November. The first thing that she did within five days of the policy review was to go and talk to Richard Court. There have been no discussions with Aboriginal people. The coalition has no policy in respect of the of Aboriginal and Torres Strait heritage. That is the first issue I want turn, is to place on the public record. In respect of additional matters raised by the the shadow minister, I can give an assurance this House, as I have already, that the only person who had access to that information in office was my female adviser. I have checked with her, and she has confirmed that no other person that she knows of in my office had access to that information. As to where else the documents may have gone in Australia and from what source, I have no knowledge-neither would anybody else. So far as my office is concerned, the record is impeccable. Those documents have been accorded the respect and priority that they deserve, as I have said repeatedly on the public record. I have no idea what the member for Barker raises in these envelopes. The Leader of the Opposition is implicated in all of this because no-one on the front bench moves until there is a little strategy meeting working out the questions. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to play politics with Aboriginal affairs, like his predecessor and like the former member for Wentworth, if he wants to embark on some point scoring exercise",51

Mr Charles-Definitely prime ministerial material.",52
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for La Trobe. Product Safety,52
111,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. It refers to the National Injury Prevention Conference in Sydney out of which was raised a number of issues about the culture of safety in Australia. One of those issues concerned the safety of products available to consumers. Can the minister report on the role that the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs is playing in improving product safety in this country?,52
112,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member who is chair of the caucus consumer affairs task force. There was, indeed, very strong interest in the issue of product safety at that conference, which was also addressed by the Minister for Human Services and Health and the Minister for Justice. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs is looking at a new, improved approach for setting product safety standards after a visit we made last year to the Amsterdam Consumer Safety Institute. The director of that institute, Dr Wim Rogmans, also addressed the conference and outlined a new approach which is being used in Europe on the issue of product safety. It is called the horizontal approach where a mandatory standard is based on the outcome or the performance of the product-and of all products which could cause a similar injury. For instance, we could have the entrapment of a child's head caused by a whole range of products from playground equipment to household furniture and so on. We need reliable data to develop mandatory standards, and the lack of such data in Australia, as in many other parts of the world, is one of the main problems that was raised at that conference. In fact, there are only 18 mandatory product safety standards developed in Australia. They are all applied to individual products; they take up to four years to develop; and they depend upon getting a very great deal of data. Recently the issue of bunk beds has been raised. The Furniture Industry Association has called on me to develop a mandatory standard to stop what it claims to be cheap Asian imports which are possibly causing fatalities to children. The association makes these claims without the necessary supporting evidence. I can only make a mandatory standard when there is strong evidence to show a direct link between the product and the injuries caused. What I have done is to educate and to warn. I have already issued a warning on bunk beds concerning the potential danger of playing on the top bunk or allowing young children to sleep on the top bunk. A voluntary standard has been developed and that has been tested in the marketplace. The bureau is continuing to monitor the injuries. What we need is the data for me to act. The importance of this new approach to developing product safety standards is that as we move towards the free trade area in our region, with the APEC deadline of 2020, it will be very important that we develop a means of setting standards which are not barriers to trade. This new. approach could well be the way to go. Packer, Mr K.",52

135,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question will be answered in terms of practice. It will be answered in terms of the opportunities that the Leader of the Opposition has to answer simple questions which are able to translate what sounds very much like a deal into a particular policy. The Prime Minister has made clear that we have policy, we have legislation and we are able to say what that legislation and what that policy mean in a particular situation. We are consistent in terms of not simply some vague nonsense about diversity of ownership but how we think that can be pursued in the Australian context. So far we have not got anything from the opposition in terms of a clear view of where it stands. In fact, its leader fundamentally contradicts the party's policy in terms of what his own actions lead to. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. PACKER, MR K.

I had concluded that a prima facie case of breach of to privilege or contempt had not been made out. A motion concerning the presentation of the report in the circumstances outlined by the Leader of the Opposition is not related to a complaint of breach of privilege. It would be a motion subject to the requirements of the standing orders and would require leave or notice. Accordingly, the chair has no basis for allowing precedence to such a motion.

153,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Atkinson (from 1,536 citizens), Mr Beale (from 28 citizens), Mr Chynoweth (from 458 citizens) and Mr Reith (from 680 citizens). Underground Wiring To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain (citizens of Australia) or (residents of the State of New South Wales) or (Electors of the Division of Warringah) draws to the attention of the House: (1) that whatever future technology produces in the way of electricity, telephones, computers, television, mobile phones or pay television, we do not want these at the expense of intrusion into the natural and architectural quality of our streets and outlook from our homes and workplaces; (2) that all present ugly and potentially dangerous overhead wires and all future ones should be placed underground; (3) that Optus and Telecom have offered to contribute if electricity commissions, councils and other authorities take a stand and decide to place all future wiring underground and that to delay now will escalate future costs; (4) that the freedom currently available to all citizens to erect aerials, antennae and satellite dishes of any size and height in any position on roofs, regardless, is a mistaken freedom; Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will legislate to control unsightly intrusions into the residential environment and to fund research to find neater solutions. by Mr Abbott (from 10 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that certain persons wish to change the National Flag of Australia. Your petitioners therefore requestthat no change to the National Flag of Australia be made without a full referendum. by Mr Beale (from 18 citizens). Home Child-care Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of Australia points out to the House that the Government's family payments discriminate against single-income families: the Home Child Care Allowance is paid at a rate up to $30 per week to single-income families, whereas the Child Care Cash Rebate pays up to $62 per week for two-income families, the HCCA is subject to an income test from $5/week, whereas the CCCR has no income test, single-income families pay more income tax than do two-income families on the same income, and two-income families are generally better off financially than single-income families, and the impact of tax mid social security increases the gap between single-income and two-income families: and that, in discriminating against single-income families, the Parliament is not recognising the value of work of full-time carers in the home and community. Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discrimination against single-income families in the tax and social security systems. by Mr Braithwaite (from 276 citizens). Logging and Woodchipping To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled: This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: There is a growing concern among the people of Australia that native forests, including areas that should be protected under national estate or world heritage classification, continue to be logged and woodchipped. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian parliament will: Implement an immediate and permanent moratorium on the logging of all native old growth and wildemess forests in Australia, and legislate for changes to existing forest management practices to: permanently protect all remaining old growth, wilderness and other high conservation value forests throughout Australia, in a secure reserve system adequate to protect in perpetuity biodiversity, water catchments, natural and cultural heritage; utilise existing extensive plantation timber for industry needs, and accelerate programs for treefarm timber and fibre plantations on existing cleared lands; create economic incentives for farm forestry, thereby generating employment for timber industry workers, youth and others in the propagation, establishment and management of sustainable permaculture style mixed-species timber plantations, inter-grown with a variety of annual crops for fibre and food production; encourage investment in the growing and marketing of indigenous, plantation based tree products such as wattle seed, eucalyptus and tea tree oils, and other medicinal and nutritional resources; develop educational eco-tourism as a sensitively managed major industry in appropriate forest areas; and further support the above initiatives by providing Commonwealth funding, including the progressive transfer of military spending to assist rural communities to implement sustainable plantation forestry practices. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Ms Deahm (from 1,491 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to effect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (d) notes that extent of research funding expenditure on other medical conditions with significantly lower mortality rates such as the HIV virus; (e) calls on the Federal Government to provide more funds for breast cancer research; and, (f) recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150% to encourage community support to help eliminate this disease and to increase the availability of research funds. We therefore pray that the Parliament take steps to ensure that greater resources are made available for research into breast cancer. by Mr Richard Evans (from 80 citizens). Forest Protection To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled This Petition of the undersigned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: There is an urgent demand from the majority of Australians for immediate federal government intervention to protect the remaining high conservation value forests and other areas which support flora and fauna habitats unique to Australia. Your petitions therefore request that the House of Representativescall on the Federal Government to: comply with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention, to which Australia is a signatory, and immediately implement the moratorium clause in the national forest policy statement; reap only what is sown and utilise readily available plantation timbers for industry needs; permanently protect all old growth forests, wilderness, and other high conservation value areas, under the guardianship of Australian indigenous peoples, in co-operation with the community, conservation and scientificorganisaTo tions; rapidly implement timber industry from native forests to plantations, with provision for retraining, redeployment, and economic adjustment for affected workers and contractors; create employment incentives to collect seeds, propagate, establish and manage sustainable permaculture-stylemixed species timber tions, on existing cleared and degraded lands; convert paper and fibre board manufacture to use annual fibre crops such as kenaf, hemp cane; encourage investment in the growing and (c) marketing of indigenous, plantation based tree products, such as native fruits, nuts, berries, seeds, oils, and other nutritional and medicinal resources; develop educational environmental tourism a sensitively managed industry in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for cultural heritage and sacred sites; and further support the above initiatives progressive utilisation of defence personnel, resources and funding, to assist rural communivoted ties to implement sustainable plantation practices. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray: pray. by Mr Mack (from 13 citizens). Women: Sustainable Agriculture To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain Australian residents draws to the attention of the House the need for recognition of women's contribution to sustainable agriculture. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: request the Australian delegation to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women to present the following recommendations to the Preparatory Committee Meeting in New York in March 1995 for incorporation in the platform for action. That the UN Conference recommend that steps be taken to gain public, international recognition of women's role in the development of today's knowledge of sustainable agriculture and of the value of women's knowledge in the maintenance of biodiversity, water and soil conservation. by Ms MCHugh (from 62 citizens). National Flag the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: transition This petition is to show thatWe, the undersigned citizens, respectfully claim that Australia must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the federation of its sovereign States in 1901 and then being confirmed under the plantaFlags Act (1953). We do so because: (a) It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language; and (b) It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right; It signifies the Christian ethic,' friendliness:' international goodwill; (d) It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen; as (e) It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. Aboriginal So therefore do we petition thatour present Australian National Flag be not by the changed, replaced or diminished in any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first upon and approved by a majority of Australforestry Ian citizens in a national referendum. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever by Mr Moore (from 1,527 citizens). Young Homeless Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless rate benefits without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless rate benefits is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With the number of young people receiving youth homeless rate benefits increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Rep res entatives should call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless rate benefits; and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Ruddock (from 631 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australia is now a signatory to more than 2100 international treaties, conventions and agreements, which, once ratified, bind Australia by international law to implement and to abide by them. While accepting that it is necessary for Australia to subscribe to many of these agreements if it is to participate freely and effectively as a member of the international community, we are concerned that such agreements are signed and ratified by the Executive Government without first being referred to the Australian Parliament for inquiry or debate. We are further concerned that there is no provision in the Australian Constitution for such a course of action to be followed by the Executive Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will: 1. requestthe Executive Government to immediately place a moratorium on the signing and ratification of any further international treaties, conventions and agreements unless they have been examined by Parliament; 2. request that the moratorium remain in place until such time as the people of Australia have been asked, by way of a referendum, whether they will support an amendment to the Constitution to include a clause stating that all international treaties, conventions and agreements must be examined by the Parliament before they come into force in Australia. by Mr Truss (from 106 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest support for the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect from many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States. by Mr Truss (from 30 citizens). Treaties National Water Distribution Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned, wish to see our National Parliament instigate a long term strategy for providing lasting infrastructure for drought-proofing inland Australia. Australia has plenty of water but lacks a national water distribution scheme. Ernie Bridge's visionary 'Kimberley Pipeline' concept for tapping the vast water resources of northern Western Australia, provides an ideal model for such a scheme. It is an indictment of previous Governments that the 'driest continent on earth' (Australia) still does not have such a scheme or a strategy. we request the establishment of a National Working Group to devise a strategy for harnessing and delivering water to the places in Australia that need it, and that this Group be made up of people who are graduates of the schoo I of practical experience in coping with drought and living in inland Australia. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter urgent consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Tuckey (from 24 citizens). Farming of Kangaroos and Emus To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the undersigned, believe that GOD, the Creator, did not put animals on earth, i.e. Kangaroos and Emus, for humans to use and abuse. It has been medically and scientifically proven that cholesterol contained in animal products, kill human beings and cause terrific decline in quality of life. Documentation from the Heart Foundation and the Cancer Research names numerous disease and risk factors, also causing death in most cases, all to animal products. With all this scientific knowledge, facts and truths are self-evident. Technology has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, animal products are deadly to humans! A poison in fact! We urge the Parliament to take appropriate action to stop the unnecessary farming, killing and export of Australia's fauna. We all have GOD-given rights to exist. And we will, in the name of, as in duty bound ever pray. by Mr Tuckey (from 21 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. America's Cup MrJULL (Fadden) (4.20 p.m.)-I am sure that members of this House were horrified today when they saw the midday news telecasts of the sinking of the Australian challenger for this year's America's Cup, one Australia. In a very real way, the loss of the yacht is a tragic loss for Australia as well as for John Bertrand and his crew, and for the sponsors of the oneAustralia challenge. The oneAustralia program has been very much more than just a yacht race. It has been about the development of world-class technology here in Australia, at universities and colleges, and in design rooms, to put Australia at the very top of the world when it came to high technology water racing. which sunk this morning is the second and more advanced yacht to be used by John Bertrand and his crew in the America's Cup challenge series. The enormity of the loss to the oneAustralia team and to Australia's challenge is impossible to stress too much. As the House will know, it is 12 years since Australia made history by winning the America's Cup for the first time. That was an occasion of great national pride, and this latest challenge is focused on achieving the same result. Anyone who has had the privilege of watching the trials and meeting with John Bertrand and his crew, as well as his design and support team, could only be impressed by related the skill and the technology which has gone into the program. Last year, the trials to choose Australia's challengers were held off the Gold Coast. In fact, the yachts had to pass through the southern part of the newly drawn electorate of Fadden to get to the race lanes, off Surfers Paradise. On a number of occasions at that time. I had the privilege of meeting the crew and learning of some of the work that was being done. Along with the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) in San Diego in January, I had the privilege, once again, of meeting up with John Bertrand and his crew and his full support team and following one of the races in that preliminary round. I am sure the member for MCEwen will join with me today in expressing a very great sorrow at what has happened off San Diego today. What impressed me particularly was the commitment and skill of the crew members and the technical support group. Most of them are very young, but all of them have been dedicated to the challenge of putting Australia on top in the toughest and best known yacht racing series in the world. I am sure all our thoughts are with them today, as they basically have to go back to the drawing boards and refit the first oneAustralia yacht to resume the challenger series. The boat is now lying at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean off San Diego. That particular boat represented more than 20,000 man-hours The yacht of work, in its design and construction and in getting it ready for the series now under way to select the challenger for the America's Cup. I think it typifies the great commitment of John Bertrand and his team for work to be already under way on getting the first boat ready for racing, and in seeking the help of the Australian government to ask US authorities if it is possible to recover at least the sails from the sunken yacht! Apparently, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been contacted, or they are attempting to contact the Prime Minister, to ask him to intervene with the US Navy to try to get their assistance in making some salvage attempts on the oneAustralia, which at the moment is sitting 175 metres below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Even if that can be done, and the yacht did sink in very deep water, then there is so much else which the crew and the support team have to do to make up for that loss of oneAustralia. The yacht carried on board the most advanced computer technology in the world, and I assume that that has all been lost. But, in interviews today, just hours after he and his crew had to be rescued, John Bertrand, in that great Australian tradition, focused not on adversity but on the future-and the future means getting the first boat back in racing condition in a matter of just a day or two. There has been no time for sorrow or regret-the whole focus is on maintaining the excellent position the oneAustralia team has built up, running a close second to New Zealand in the challenger series. I believe the coming days and weeks will bring out the very best in John Bertrand and his crew. The first yacht is undoubtedly slower, but I know the skill of the crew and the advanced technology oneAustralia is using will help make up the ground loss by today's most unfortunate mishap. The oneAustralia challenge and the great technological advances that have accompanied it would not have been possible without the tremendous financial backing of the oneAustralia sponsors. Today I think we should pay tribute to the Phillip Morris group, which played the vital lead role, and other sponsors such as Fosters and Sun Assurance for their very generous and public-spirited commitment. In fact, it was ironic that just this morning I received a letter from David Davies, the Phillip Morris group vice-president for corporate affairs, who advised me that he is leaving Australia later this week to take up a senior role in the group's European office in Switzerland. I think we should thank David Davies for what he has done to make the oneAustralia campaign possible, and he has done so with the latest technology and the financial and other backing that the campaign needs. I mentioned earlier that the oneAustralia campaign involves more than just a yacht race. The sponsors and organisers of oneAustralia have formed what is known as the Southern Cross Foundation to provide scholarships for young Australians in the areas of science and engineering. The aim is to encourage the same kind of technological excellence among young Australians that has been so much a part of the oneAustralia campaign. So far 14 scholarships have been awarded for young men and women to study at various universities and higher education centres around Australia. Each scholarship is worth $10,000 a year. Despite today's enormous setback the oneAustralia campaign will go on, and I have a feeling that out of adversity will come a new strength and a new achievement. I am sure the whole House would wish John Bertrand and his crew the very best as they face their greatest challenge in these coming days. . Shipping: Crew Conditions",58
154,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This morning, as a member of the Joint House Committee, I attended a meeting that included an agenda item regarding the parliamentary dining room. During the meeting I thought to myselfthat many seafarers on foreign flagged ships who are visiting Australia would like to have a problem like the service and quality of food in the parliamentary dining room. The treatment of many foreign crews and their pay and working conditions are an international scandal that can only be solved by a concerted international response. Australia can begin by immediately ratifying ILO 147. ILO 147 is a broad convention covering wages, working conditions, certification, training arid health, which are vital to the welfare and rights of international seafarers. It is a scandal that Australia, having taken the lead in exposing substandard shipping, has not ratified this international convention on a mere technicality. Last week I raised a specific example of the ill treatment that an Indonesian crew experienced on a Panamanian registered vessel, MV Sheng Ho, last December. The crew was ordered to repay the back pay that the union obtained for them when the ship left Australian waters, and was then sacked when the ship reached Port Klang in Malaysia. Today I wish to raise some more examples of the ill treatment of foreign seafarers in Australian and international waters. The Daily Commercial News reported last week that a 26-member crew was stranded in Lerwick Harbour in the Shetland Islands since the Bulgarian government cut off their food when they went on strike last January. It is interestwas ing to note that these seafarers had not been paid for the preceding three years. The shipowners, Okeanski Ribolov Ltd, have been in receivership for the past 18 months and had undertaken to pay overdue wages to the crew upon their return to Bulgaria. The shipowners had previously stated that all the crew's wages had been paid. Authorities in the Shetland Islands had declared the ship unfit to sail, and the crew had been fed and clothed by Shetland Island locals. Another example, this time much closer to home, was the fate of six Filipino crew aboard the MV Robin, a Greek flagged vessel. The crew requested repatriation because of their treatment by the master and their working conditions. When the vessel docked in Melbourne the six crew were given between $300 and $500 each and kicked off the vessel by the master. They had to look after themselves for a three-day period 'prior' to their departure. Upon arrival in the Philippines we are informed that any balance which was owing to them was used to pay for their repatriation costs, costs which should have been borne by the company. In another example a crew memb,er aboard the MV Sovillac, a Mauritian flagged vessel, was denied medical attention when it was in my own area at Port Kembla. After the intervention of the 10caIITF, the crew member not only saw a doctor but Was immediately repatriated home. The crew members on MV Tomis Faith have been black-listed by manning agents in Romania for the past 12 months after receiving back pay of almost $205,000. The crew aboard MV Magaletta had to endure totally unacceptable working conditions. This vessel had one operating urinal and one shower, and neither the washing machine nor the handbasin worked. All of these facilities serviced a crew of 12. The lifeboats were rusted and drinking water was provided to the crew by the master at a sale price of $7 per bottle. There were no glasses or cups so, upon making their purchase, crew members had to drink from the same bottle. The Filipino part of the crew received one cake of soap and one kilo of laundry soap per month. There no fruit juice, fruit or bread, and the crew was provided with four rolls of toilet paper per month. The diet of the crew was, to put it mildly, substandard, and the Filipino part of the crew worked between 12 and 16 hours a day. The Filipino part of the crew aboard MV Contashia Jork, a German flagged ship, were refused wet weather and cold weather gear, and worked in temperatures as low as five degrees. No shore leave was permitted and lifeboats were padlocked. Another example concerns a crew member suffering from tuberculosis aboard MV Trinity Beach, which is a Philippine flagged vessel. The bosun admitted having tuberculosis previously, although the disease was not active, but he was concerned because of the symptoms he was suffering. The crew member saw not one or two doctors, but five. These doctors were in my own region of the Illawarra. The first doctor stated that the 'chest X-rays suggested a lung infection-possibly tuberculosis' and he recommended immediate repatriation for further appropriate treatment. Qantas refused to fly the crew member home because of his condition. He was then taken to see a second doctor, who stated that, 'active tuberculosis seems less likely on clinical grounds and test results to date.' This doctor's recommendation was that the crew member was to fit to sail but· only to his home port where he would require follow-up treatment for his condition. The vessel, however, never visited home port or the Philippines and, in fact, was going on to Korea. The third doctor had a similar position to that of the second doctor. The fourth doctor stated that 'active TB seemed unlikely, but this would not be definite until the results of the cultures were available.' He considered the crew member fit to travel by sea but only to his home port, which the vessel was not going to. The doctor also recommended that the crew member not work on his return journey. The fifth doctor said, 'it appears that he does not have the disease, is not contagious, and is safe to fly.' This vessel arrived in Port Kembla on 12 April 1994, and all of these doctors were seen between 3 April and 26 April. There were also visits to X-ray clinics and the IIIawarra regional hospitals. The treatment of this seafarer was like a pingpong ball, especially given that four of the doctors came from the same surgery. My final example concerns another Greek flagged vessel-unfortunately named, given the circumstances-the MV Adventure. On this vessel, crew members were physically abused by the master and chief engineer. Most of the crew members were Muslim. The master had deliberately ordered all pork products, which left that section of the crew a diet of eggs, rice, potatoes and macaroni. The Pakistani and Egyptian crew members were refused medical attention for at least six months. One crew member did receive medica! attention after sustaining serious burns, but this was in a port in New Zealand. While in Australia, all medical attention was refused. All crew members were suffering from symptoms relating to malnutrition. All Pakistani and Egyptian crew members refused to sail any further than Sydney and were repatriated home from Sydney. All of these examples highlight the mistreatment of seafarers. Some are examples of crew members being denied appropriate payments, others show the refusal of medical attention, and others show unacceptable working and living conditions. All of them show the international shipping industry at its very worse. All of these problems can be solved if the international community treats with serious concern the inhumane treatment I have outlined today and on many other occasions in this chamber. Many of the appalling conditions that foreign crews face could be solved if ships not complying with ILO convention 147 were denied access to Australian waters, which was recommended in the Ships of shame report. I have previously likened the conditions many international seafarers have to endure to slavery. I do not back away one inch from that statement. We abolished slavery in this country when we stopped the Kanaks coming here almost 100 years ago but, in many cases, we are still seeing slavery-this time of foreign crews on foreign flagged vessels calling at Australian ports. We, as an international community and as a country, took action to stop slavery. We as an international community-Australia is the leader-are taking action to clean up unsafe ships which threaten the coastlines of the world. It is now time to ensure that the conditions on board those shameful vessels are cleaned up. We can do this only through an international effort. It will require all nations and all maritime bodies and authorities to cooperate. Australia should begin. Just as we took the lead with the Ships of shame report, we should immediately ratify ILO convention 147 and take the lead in regard to the conditions so many crews on foreign flagged vessels endure in Australian waters. Department of Social Security: Benefits",63
155,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hindmarsh) (4.36 p.m.)Today I wish to address an issue of rising importance in my electorate of Hindmarsh; that is, what is happening with the Department of Social Security. Daily I have constituents turning up at my office with problems they are having with the Department of Social Security. Today I want to list some of those problems. The first issue relates to the widows pension. My electorate contains a lot of older women. DSS is approaching some of these women and inviting them to apply for a widows pension. DSS has actually gone to some women and said, 'Would you apply for a widows pension?' That has got women feeling as though they were eligible for a widows pension. Of the five women who, as a result of DSS approaching them, applied for that pension and have since come to my office to talk about this-I presume there are many others-four have had their claims rejected. It seems a little odd that DSS is actually encouraging women to apply for the pension and is then saying, 'Sorry, you don't actually qualify.' That happened to four of the women. When the other woman was told that she could not receive a payment, she actually went back to DSS and said, 'Well, what is the problem? You told me to apply. Why didn't I get it?' Her application was then approved on the grounds that the department had previously overlooked her application. This does not seem to be a proper way to run an office. It is not proper to invite women to apply for these pensions and then tell them that they not eligible for them. When women are assertive enough to follow. it up, it is not proper for the department to say, 'Well, you actually did not get it because we overlooked your application,' and then give them the pension. That indicates there is a problem with DSS. But that is not the only problem. I now turn to a problem of compensation. There was an agreement between the state government of South Australia and the Department of Social Security that separation packages would not be regarded as compensation packages. This comes in the context of when workers who for some reason or another have been injured and, following that injury, go off work, return to work and then take a separation package. In a number of cases these people have been told that, under the agreement forged by the South Australian government and the Department of Social Security, their package would not be regarded as compensation. But, when these people have applied for a pension, they have been told that it is compensation and that they cannot receive either newstart or a pension. This seems to be deception. I have been involved in one of those cases and I found the attitude of DSS absolutely extraordinary. I got letters from the Attorneybeing General's Department in South Australia and I forwarded them on to DSS. In one case, I said that the person involved was definitely receipt of a separation package but not a compensation package. Despite the letter, the department refused to acknowledge that and refused to regard this person's package as a separation package. The department insisted on having it regarded as a compensation package and this person was refused any income from DSS. That was in direct contradiction with what this person had been told in good faith by the South Australian government. He was left in no-man's-land and was--quite understandably--extraordinarily angry. I understand from my office that in my absence a number of these cases are coming up and causing enormous distress to the people involved. I now turn to the jobsearch allowance. I have had a number of representations to my are office from people who are on jobsearch allowance and who have been informed by DSS that their allowance will cease due to a failure to attend a meeting with their case manager. In all those cases, those people simply were not aware that they were supposed to attend a meeting with their case manager because they were not advised of the meeting by CES or anyone else. My office approached the staff of CES to find out what the problem was and they claimed that the error was actually on their part and arose from a computer error. People are being told they are about to lose their jobsearch allowance because they did not go to an arranged meeting. The poor recipient of the jobsearch allowance, who is already under quite considerable distress trying to look for work and to subsist on the newstart or jobsearch allowance, then asks, 'What meeting?' It is only when they follow it up through my office, which cannot be intimidated in the way that people who are on unemployment benefits can, that they find out there was a computer error and they were not informed of the meeting. We are getting a number of such cases. Also, a number of women especially, but also men, are being caused a lot of distress by wrongly advised by the Department of Social Security on what their payments and other aspects of their pension will be. Like in offices of members from both sides of this House, my office puts out a pension guide. It is not quite up to the standard of my colleague who is sitting on the front bench here, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who puts out one of the best pension guides I have seen. In my electorate, the guide is becoming standard use for people who want to understand what is going on. We are also getting calls from people from other electorates asking whether they could have a copy because they are getting confusing and contradictory information from the various departments in the different localities around town. Again, it does seem that something terribly wrong is going on with DSS. I hark back to an incident that happened quite a long time ago when a constituent came to my office on the matter of deeming and how much would be deemed for married and single people. I told him what the situation was but he told me that was not what a certain DSS officer told him-it was actually the DSS office at Parkside, which my colleague at the table, the member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), would know. I rang up that office and they said, 'No, this is the policy.' I told them that it was not and they said, 'Yes, it is. We know it is.' I said, 'I isn't because I happened to be in the parliament when we passed the legislation.' Things got quite stroppy and they said they would go away and check on it, obviously indicating that I was totally out of my territory. I got a very apologetic call later and someone said, 'Oh, somehow it hadn't come through on our computers and, yes, we have been giving the wrong advice to all our clients'-much to the confusion of all their clients. This is an ongoing problem with DSS. It does appear that not enough resources are being given to DSS for it to handle what is undoubtedly an enormously heavy load with the very high unemployment this country is suffering. I know from talking to the staff of DSS that they are finding it difficult to deal with this load. I am starting to see another problem from that heavy load, and that is a problem affecting older women. I have had in my office several women over the age 50 who are becoming increasingly distressed by their visits to the Department of Social Security. They are getting enormously distressed because of the bad language they hear-and I must stress the bad language is not from the staff but from other recipients of DSS benefits-the general atmosphere of the place and the fact that they have to stand in line for a long time. Three women have talked to me about the issue-I know my staff have spoken to more-and two of those ended up in my office in tears saying, 'I just can't go back there. I really cannot go back in there. ' We have tried to give them the strength to go back to DSS. Some come in saying, 'I need to go on a disability pension because I am getting sick,' and generally these people are making themselves ill so they do not have to continually front up to DSS. I raise this matter not to put down the people who work in the Department of Social Security-I know they have an extraordinarily difficult job, which is at times not a pleasant one, and that they have to deal with some issues they would rather not deal with-but in the hope that the minister, if his staff would care to take this on, will do something know it about it. At least he could stop the misinformation that is coming out of the DSS offices and get offices to put out the same information-not confuse their clients but help them. Public Housing",65
156,Mr HORNE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Paterson) (4.46 p.m.}-On 12 February, an ACOSS report was released and it showed some alarming conclusions. The report showed that over 230,000 families were waiting for housing in Australia and suggested that the government should spend an extra $300 million towards public housing over the next four years. The main crux of the matter is that insufficient housing is available, with a secondary issue of inefficient allocation also creating difficulties. As a parliamentarian, one of the most frustrating problems I have to deal with is explaining the shortage of public housing. A few weeks ago, I was approached by a constituent. She has Aboriginal heritage. She is a victim of domestic violence. Her husband is now in gaol for that domestic violence. She has also endured drug and alcohol problems. At one stage she decided she was not capable of caring for her children adequately, and voluntarily relinquished custody to the state. She has now resolved her personal problems and has applied to obtain custody of her children again. It is known that people with children have priority on public housing waiting lists. Yet this particular constituent cannot reclaim the custody of her children because she does not have a stable home environment in which to bring them up but she cannot get a home despite having been on the waiting list in excess of five years. She has been told that, if she cannot get a home within six months, it is highly unlikely she will ever have custody of her children again. That is the situation in New South Wales. A document released by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), in early January this year outlined what the federal government does for housing those in need. It stated that $1.1 billion was allocated states this year to spend on public housing. Once this money enters state control, the federal government cannot decide upon its usage. The Institute of Health and Welfare studied public housing and released its report in early January. It stated that public housing was generally in good hands but much could still be done to improve effectiveness and efficiency. It also stated that the types of housing provided and the location of housing were inadequate while the amount of public housing available was insufficient. The report made a number of suggestions and called for greater care to be taken in the allocation of housing as over 10 per cent was underutilised. One claim was that large family homes of three and four bedrooms were used to accommodate single or two-person families while calls for increased numbers of housing to be made available through either purchase or rental were made. As a representative of a rapid growth areathe sort of area where young families are seeking to locate-I am most concerned about what is happening to, or what is being done for, public housing by the current New South Wales government. The figures as they currently stand show that 87,171 people are seeking housing accommodation and that there is at least a sixyear waiting list. What is the New South Wales Department of Housing doing? I am sure that the state minister would claim lack of federal funding. So I contacted the federal office and made some amazing discoveries. In the 1991 period the federal government allocated moneys to New South Wales housing, of which $163.7 million was not spent. I would like all honourable members to cast their minds back to 1991, when the housing industry was approaching a depressed state. I am sure that for $163.7 million the housing industry could have provided significant housing. Yet in that year the New South Wales government underspent by $163.7 million. The underspending did not stop there. In the following year $80 million was underspent. I am not sure how many homes could be built for $80 million, but I am sure that to the oneand two-bedroom units, the sort of accommodation needed, could be built to alleviate a lot of the problem. Yet, in its wisdom, the New South Wales government in 1991-92 underspent by $80 million. Mr Bilney-Has this been publicised?",67
157,Mr HORNE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am making it public now. In November 1992, the federal government decided that the system was not working, so it changed the system to give the money for housing to the New South Wales government on demand. After all, what is the point of giving a state government money for housing simply so the money can be put it into consolidated revenue? In 1992-93, the unused money of the New South Wales government against its allocation was $23.88 million. In 1993-94, $36.3 million was underspent. In 1994-95, a further $13.5 million was underspent. Obviously the situation is improving, but the enormous backlog over those four years represents an enormous number of housing units that would go a long way towards solving the problem in New South Wales. I find it interesting that last year, in the International Year of the Family, the party that claims it stands for family values deliberately underspent its allocation for housing. Since 1991 the New South Wales state government has underspent by the order of $369 million of its allocation for public housing. This money was not reallocateq to other community purposes. We know that it did not go to child-care places because the New South Wales government has not participated in the Commonwealth-state child-care program for the past four years. We know that it was not spent on education facilities, and we know that it was not spent on health. It just was not spent. . There are many people out there with a real need for quality housing. As I have indicated, this year the federal government makes $1.1 billion available for housing. We cannot spend it. It is the responsibility of the state governments to spend it through their state departments. I think it only reasonable that all Australians would expect that, when that money is allocated, it will be spent for the purpose for which it is allocated. The Fahey government has shown for four years that it is not responsible, that it is not accountable and that it certainly does not care about providing houses for those people most in need. Budget Debate",68
158,Mr WILLIAMS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Tangney) (4.55 p.m.)This morning there was tabled in the House an exposure .draft report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. In the draft report, the committee sought to arrive at a sensible and practical view of that contentious paragraph, a view that was consistent with the broad policy of the section. That policy is, in effect, to preserve the financial initiative of the government to be exercised in this House but otherwise to give the House of Representatives and the Senate equal powers in respect of money bills. My grievance is that, at a time when a"" standing committee of the House is seeking to protect the role of the House under the constitution, the House itself through diminishing interest and attention to financial matters is significantly abdicating responsibiliminutes-the ty for financial scrutiny of the government in favour of the Senate. In the current financial year, the budget in its original form provided for revenue of $109 billion and outlays of $121 billion. Those cash flows obviousiy have a massive impact on the Australian economy and the Australian people. My concern is that this House has a minimal role in relation to the approval of the budget and the examination of the budget documents. Time spent by the House debating the main appropriation bill, Appropriation Bill (No. 1), has declined significantly in recent years and dramatically in the last two years. In each of the 10 years prior to the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983that is, from 1973 to 1982-the average time spent by the House on budget debates was just under 60 hours. As long as 87 hours was devoted to that task in one of those 10 years. The average duration of second reading debates in those 10 years was about 21 hours or 35 percent of the total. The average duration of debates at the committee stage was therefore 38 hours or 65 per cent of the total. In the subsequent 10 years, from 1983 to 1992, the average time spent by the House on annual debates of the main budget bill went down. The average in this period was 36.5 hours-a reduction of nearly 40 per cent over that of the previous 10 years. In the later period, the longest annual debate was less than 44 hours--:-approximately half of the longest debate in the previous 10-year period. Second reading debates comprised on average 53 per cent of the deb-tes, an average period of 19 hours. Committee stage debates went on average for 17 hours or 47 per cent of the time. Detailed consideration therefore reduced from 65 per cent of debating time in the 10year period ending in 1982 to 47 per cent of debating time in the 10-year period ending in 1992. In the last two years, there has been a dramatic decline from the low figures of the previous 10-year period. In 1993 the aggregate time devoted by the House to budget debates was 27 hours 17 minutes. In 1994 the average time was down further to 24 hours 31 lowest in the 22-year period which I examined. This represents approximately three-quarters of the average in the 10 years to 1992 and only about 40 per cent of the average in the 10 years to 1982. This depressing picture is made even more depressing when the length of the committee stage debates is examined: in ·1993 it was less than one-third of the total time, and in 1994 it was a little over one-quarter of the aggregate time. The impact of this shrinking time on the capacity of the House to examine the budget documents can be seen more starkly in relation to the examination of estimates for individual departments. Under the guillotine, the total time devoted· to consideration in detail in 1993 of nine hours and in 1994 of six hours 45 minutes represents a mere fracdelivery tion of an hour for each department. For many departments, six speakers at five minutes each was all who could speak on many of the departmental budgets. The Tuesday average bowling club committee spends more time on its annual budget than this House spends on the billion dollar budgets of departments. . The Senate, which introduced new procedures for the consideration of the 1994 budget, considered Appropriation Bill (No.1), Approbreak priation Bill (No.2) and the parliamentary appropriation bills sometimes separately, sometimes together. The time spent on those bills by the Senate is in stark time spent by the House. The Senate spent a total of 207 hours on consideration of the three sets of bills. Of this, only 17.5 hours were spent in the second reading debate nearly 190 hours were spent in estimates committees. If this House is to have any role itself in the reforms scrutiny of the supply bills, some change in procedure must be adopted. The Main Comtary mittee certainly provides a venue where consideration in detail could be conducted at greater length. It is desirable also that some estimates committee procedure be duced or an alternative mechanism found for enabling the government to account to this House for the estimates. Another factor which has affected the time devoted by the House to debating the main appropriation bill has been the nature of the scheduling of debates and the parliamentary sittings, including the new procedures recently introduced by the government. It is appropriate, perhaps, to mention some historical landmarks. In the years prior to 1983, the budget was presented on the third Tuesday in August. The reply of the Leader of the Opposition was delivered on the following Tuesday. The House then usually rose for a oneweek break and returned to the budget on the resumption of sittings. There was therefore some continuity of the attention given to the budget. As I have indicated, the total time spent on consideration of the budget was comparatively extensive. A major change occurred in 1983 when the of the Treasurer's budget speech and the delivery of the Leader of the Opposition's reply began to be televised. Instead of the Leader of the Opposition's reply being on the following, it was on the Thursday of budget week. It became the practice then that the House rose for a week. So the initial two major weeks of consideration before the break became only one week. A further change occurred in 1986 when the practice commenced of the initial one-week after the reply by the Leader of the Opposition being extended.to two weeks. This had the further effect of downgrading any continuity of consideration that had survived contrast to the to that point. In 1994 the 1994-95 budget was brought down in May. This was the first time that a and budget had been delivered before the commencement of the fiscal year to which it related. This was done against a background of of parliamentary procedure designed to limit the log jam at the end of parliamensessions. The effect of the new procedure, designed primarily to ensure proper consideration of legislation of the budget, became evident in the course of last year-the first reintroyear of the new procedures. The intention of the new procedures was to allow proper time for consideration of bills by the introduction in one session of a bill for debate at the next or a later session. This has in fact resulted in the jamming of the budget against the end of the budget session, which is around 30 June. So what was meant to provide more time for the debate on bills in general has meant less time for debate on the budget bills. The government must reconsider the way the budget is treated in this House. The House should not be operating under procedures which prevent it exercising the financial responsibility which the constitution primarily confers upon it. So long as this House fails to exercise its responsibilities the role of the Senate will continue to expand at this House's expense. Daylight Saving",69
159,Mr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to take up a subject that I raised in the 90-second statements today: the disparity in time zones throughout Australia. As I said in the 90-second statement, my grievance is that, when there was an opportunity this time last year for the various state Premiers to provide a solution to the problem that we will be troubled with over the next three weeks, that opportunity was not taken. It says something about our federal system when the setting of times throughout Australia is at the whim and mercy of agreements made outside the formal structure of conferences of heads of government and Premiers. These agreements are made at meetings that take place alongside the formal conferences. In reflecting upon my earlier comments, I am reminded that my predecessor as Deputy Speaker, the former member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, had put in place a private member's bill regarding standard times. Under the constitution the national parliament has power to make decisions in regard to weights and measures. Using that power, we may be able to rectify the problem with the time zones in future. One of the problems that the former member for Stirling had with his proposal was that it would give the Australian parliament power to put daylight saving in place in all the against the wishes of the decision making processes of the states. Whilst on most questions I believe that we should be putting in place national approaches-and therefore it is appropriate for this parliament to set the pace-I recognise that some states have decided not to have daylight saving. This has been decided by the states after great debate and appropriate referenda. That is not my problem. My problem is the situation that we face in the next three weeks. For instance, my problem is not that the state of Queensland does not involve itself in daylight saving. My problem is that New South Wales-having had daylight saving commencing on the same date as Victoria and Tasmania and on the same date that South Australia decided to have a form of central daylight saving-has now decided that as of last Sunday morning daylight saving should cease. As a result, we will have this continuing disparity between the two most populated states, which contain the two largest commercial centres, for the next three weeks. We need to understand that this is not appropriate for a nation that is moving towards its centenary of Federation. This disparity has brought great problems to the commercial world. It has brought great problems to media outlets in the scheduling of programs. It has brought great problems to airlines and other modes of transport. The airlines have had to reschedule flights to make allowance for the one-hour difference that we now find between New South Wales and Victoria. I do not know that the states really need to have the stick approach forced upon them, whereby the federal government says that it considers it should use the weights and measures provision in the constitution to legislate to ensure that, where states decide to take advantage of daylight saving, it is done in an orderly fashion. I emphasise that on this question I am trying to recognise that the states may, from time to time, wish to make up their own minds about whether they want to have daylight saving or not. However, the states having made that decision, it is in the national interest that we states are able to sit down and decide on common commencement and finishing dates of periods of daylight saving. The former head of the ABC, Mr David Hill, said, 'Here we are in the 20th century, fast approaching the 21st century, and we cannot even get a common standard approach to the way we have our time zones.' It is regrettable. It does not reflect well on a mature nation. Having reflected upon the subject, and in the beliefthat we do have the constitutional power to rectify the problem, we should, in the absence of cooperative federal action by the states, legislate to ensure that this does not happen. Earlier I had thought that this was not something we had constitutional power to do, and I was going to rail against our approach towards looking at the constitution and the way it should be improved. I have many reasons for continuing to say that because I believe that there are areas of responsibility to which, as Australia becomes an even more mature nation, we should have a national approach. In taking a national approach, we should not rely on the type of cooperative federalism that we have developed over the past few decades, which requires the heads of the governments of the states and territories to get together with the Prime Minister, the head of the Australian government, with each government then deciding how much power in certain areas it is going to give up to get this cooperative national approach. I do not think that is good enough. If, as we hear from both sides of this chamber, people are defenders of the notion of constitutional government, we should have a duty to go along with that constitutional reform and the constitution should be constantly reviewed to ensure that it is a contemporary document. This is not to attack the efforts of those founding fathers of some 100 years ago but to say that the Australia of the 1890s is quite obviously a different Australia from the Australia of the 1990s. A constitution that best fitted and suited the aspirations of the colonies that were coming together to make a nation is. perhaps not the constitution that best suits the aspirations of the people of Australia in the 1990s. As is often said, this is not necessarily about states rights-because the states, as entities, whether they have rights or not, may not be important-but it is the rights of the people who comprise those states and the people who, by comprising those states comprise the Australian community, that we must take into account. I believe it is important that we take a mature attitude to the way in which we review the constitution and the way in which we approach making constitutional change. That will make the constitution an even better document by making it an even more contemporary document. Australian Labor Party",71
160,Mr TRUSS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to grieve about the lack of ethics of the Australian Labor Party in government and about the way in which it abuses its office for political gain. In so doing, it is demeaning the status of members of parliament. Our system is supposed to be a representative democracy. All members of parliament-not just those who are in government-are elected to represent the people. The opposition is a fundamental part of the Westminster system. Under Labor, government has really become a matter of the winner takes all. Naturally, it fills all the positions. Most government members get a salary supplement, and many have additional staff available at their disposal. But when it comes to local issues and government grants, the Labor Party is only interested in milking them for the publicity. It could not care less about the benefits that might be available to people. When Commonwealth grants are made to various organisations in the community, opposition members are the last to know about what is happening in their electorate. If an opposition member calls a minister's office, he or she is likely to be told there is no information available--or, even worse, told to phone somebody called the duty six senator for the region. In other words, a minister's office will tell a senator but will not tell the member representing the people of an electorate. Indeed, an official instruction was put out to that effect by the Department of Human Services and Health. In its parliamentary handbook it provided information on the way in which members could obtain information about their electorate. It says, 'Under no circumstances should advice letters to opposition MPs be prepared.' So it is clear that the government has one standard in providing information to government members and a different standard in relation to opposition members. When it comes to official openings in an electorate, those will be performed by government members, but under no circumstances will an opposition member be invited to undertake that function. Indeed, if one is invited to an opening, it is generally with 48 hours notice or as little opportunity as possible. This sort of thing reflects very poorly on the parliamentary processes. It fails to recogmembers nise that all members of this parliament represent the people of an electorate and should be treated equally and fairly.",72

162,Mr SAWFORD,PRIVILEGE,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the Bouse on 12 May 1994unauthorised publication of material concerning an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",73
163,Mr SAWFORD,PRIVILEGE,"by leave-The report I have just presented follows the consideration by the committee of a reference concerning the un-uthorised disclosure of details of a draft report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. This matter was referred to the committee following the publication in three newspapers of details of the committees draft report on the community cultural, recreational and sporting grants scheme. The evidence available to my committee has not enabled it to ascertain the source of the disclosure. The committee has found that information concerning the draft report was disclosed without authorisation by a person or persons with access to the information. If such person or persons acted deliberately, he or she, or they, were guilty of a serious breach. The committee has been unable to ascertain the source of the disclosure and it makes no recommendation on the particular matter referred to it. . My committee has also considered at some length the whole issue of the unauthorised disclosure or publication of confidential committee information or documents. The committee acknowledges that, while not all or observers share the view that the present rules should be maintained, there are important reasons-such as protection of the committee processes and the protection of witnesses-for maintaining prohibitions on unauthorised disclosure and publication. The committee makes the point that the problems in this area are primarily for the committees concerned. My committee's recommendations on these matters have been agreed to unanimously and follow consideration of several options. I note the presence Report here today of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), my deputy chair. We have agreed on an approach that will assist the House, its committees and members in dealing with these matters in future. I will not outline the key points of our recommendations. All new members, together with all new staff members who may be involved with committee inquiries, should be informed as to the rules against unauthorised disclosure of committee information. Applicants for press gallery passes should also be informed of the rules in these matters, and consideration should be given to having passes incorporate reference to the rules, including the possibility that a pass may be withdrawn for a period for contravention of these rules. Consideration should be given to the use of stamps in appropriate places on certain documents to indicate that they should not be published without a check to ascertain whether publication has been authorised. As well as being required to present written reports concerning their conclusions and actions in connection with claims of unauthorised disclosure or publication of committee material, committees should be required to spell out precisely what facts constitute substantial interference, and also to spell out precisely what has led them to conclude that substantial interference has occurred, if that is their conclusion. Committees should be required to spell out the benefits they see in further action on the matter, such as reference to the Committee of Privileges, and they should be required to comment on the prospect of the source or sources being discovered. In considering complaints in this area, and not withstanding the provisions of standing order 96, the House, in addition, should require that the Speaker not allow precedence to a motion on such a matter unless, in the light of the information presented to the Speaker, he or she is of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence to enable the Committee of Privileges to ascertain the source or sources of the disclosure or disclosures, or that there are special circumstances in the matter, such that the protection of the committee system or the protection of committee sources or witnesses are such as would warrant reference to the Committee of Privileges. Committee work has become a major feature of the work of the House, but the issue of the unauthorised disclosure and publication of information continues to be a problem from time to time. My committee has sought to find a practical approach to this problem. I commend the report to the House. I hope it will be possible for early action to be taken and a motion to be proposed in the House to give effect to the committee's unanimous-I repeat' unanimous'recommendations in this matter. I thank the House.",73
164,Mr ANDREWS,PRIVILEGE,"by leave-I wish to add some comments to those made by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), and, in doing so, to reiterate his comments about the unanimous nature of the recommendations being put before the House by the members of the Privileges Committee. When we speak about privileges of parliament, we are speaking not about privilege in the popular sense in which that word is used these days, to refer to some sense of special preferment, but about the right of members to effectively represent their constituents. Historically, privilege in this sense deals with the sovereignty of the parliament and its members to act in a way which is unhindered by outside and unreasonable interference. This ability of parliament to act properly and appropriately can be hindered in a number of ways, for example when papers, deliberations, resolutions, reports or even evidence to committees of the parliament are inappropriately published. The recommendations before the House today arise out of a rash of complaints, motions for which have been given precedence by the Speaker and subsequently referred to the Privileges Committee for investigation. As is the case with the matter which gave rise to this report, it is very difficult for the Privileges Committee to ascertain the way in which the material was leaked and the source of such a leak. In supporting the suggestions which are made in this report, I reiterate what the honourable member for Port Adelaide has said and stress that it is the belief of the members of the Privileges Committee that a matter should not be referred to the Privileges Committee unless the committee from which the complaint is made in the first place has shown that there is sufficient evidence to enable the committee of privileges to ascertain the source or sources of the disclosures. If such evidence cannot be shown, then we are saying, basically, that it is a useless exercise on the part of the Privileges Committee to go through what can become a charade in seeking to ascertain sources members of the committee are making the complaint about in the first place. There is an exception and that is if there are some special circumstances in the matter, such as the protection of the committee system or the protection of witnesses. It may well be that the chairman of the committee from which the complaint is made will say to the Speaker, 'We cannot adduce reasonable evidence which might lead to the disclosure of the source but, nonetheless, the matter is sensitive' - for example, when a witness gives evidence before a committee of the parliament which goes to issues of public or national security or goes to issues of the security, the well-being and the safety of individuals whose safety might be put in jeopardy because of the disclosure of that evidence which is given to the committee. In those special circumstances-even though there may not be sufficient evidence that can be adduced by the committee itself-the matter might be referred to the Privileges Committee. This is an attempt by the Privileges Committee to deal with a matter which has caused it some considerable reflection and concern over the last year or two. I, with the member for Port Adelaide, urge other members of the House to seriously consider the recommendations put forward and, at the appropriate time, to adopt them as a sessional order or as a resolution of this House.

166,Mrs GALLUS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I am sad to note that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is not at the table, because there are remarks that I would like to address to him on the conduct of the government on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. Perhaps the SENATE fact that the minister is not at the table-and that, instead, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) is-reflects the minister's position on this bill and the politics that he has been playing on it. It reflects on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that he is not here for the second of the government's land fund bills. I would like to trace the history of the land fund bill. It is not an honourable one for the government as it shows how much this government is prepared to play politics with Aboriginal issues. The land fund bill was introduced into the House prior to the last winter break, and the debate started in August. At that stage we put forward some amendments that we had come to regard as important after we had been approached and had talked to Aboriginal people. There were seven amendments that we thought were important to get up. I informed the minister that we were working on these amendments. He knew very well that I could not give them to him nor to the House before those in my party room had met at the beginning of the next session after the winter break. There was no possibility of that. The minister was aware of that; I had told him that. Despite that, he has chosen to make politics of that and asks why those amendments were not circulated earlier, knowing very well the reasons why they were not. As soon as they were presented to my party room they were approved. The clerk started drawing them up and they were given, in their rough form, to the minister so that he could look at them. I tried to keep the minister informed every second of the way. Rather than appreciating this, the minister made political capital of it, said: referring once to the bill that still had the words 'in draft' and 'in confidence' on it. That was an indication that the minister was prepared to play cheap politics on this issue. I had in all honesty expected the minister to come to me and say, 'All right, let's sit down and discuss these amendments. Let's go through them and see which ones we can agree with and which ones we can't. Let's see where you can negotiate; let's see where we can negotiate. Let's see the amendments that are really good and that we would accept with just a change of words.' I had really expected that. I had expected it to be a pretty tough fight. Because the minister has always tried to appear honest and sincere and really interested in the genuine welfare of the Aboriginal people, I thought he would look at the amendments with that in mind and certainly talk to the Aboriginal people about them. It came as somewhat of a shock to me-I must admit my own naivety in this area-that not only did the minister not discuss the amendments with me but before the amendments were put on the table of this House the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) held a press conference to say that the government would not support anyone of our amendments. The Prime Minister had not seen any of those amendments. In deference to the minister-maybe not in deference but a comment on his weakness-I believe what happened is that the Prime Minister had said to him, 'We will not accept any of these amendments. Just tell them that.' The minister had absolutely no say in what was going on. It was he who was forced to come to the House and say, 'We will not support the amendments.' After that, he was placed in a position of having to explain why he would not support them. We did come to some very strange arguments against them. Let me go to the nub of this matter. Again, the minister kept trying to tell everybody, 'It is the coalition who hasn't spoken to Aboriginal people,' when it was the coalition which had talked to the Aboriginal people. The amendments came out of the conversations we had with them. When the minister spoke about this in the House on 20 September, he ... the government's legislation comes to this House only after the most exhaustive process of public consultation. I will read it again. It states: ... the government's legislationthe land fund bill-the first land fund bill, not the one we are discussing todaycomes to this House only after the most exhaustive process of public consultation. Members of the House will remember that the minister told us he had talked with Aboriginal people-he had discussed the issues with them-and that the land fund bill had come out of their desires. However, that is not what we were hearing. When we went around the country we heard Aboriginal groups saying, 'We don't know anything about the bill. We haven't been told what is in the bill. Nobody has consulted with us.' A group in Western Australia had written to the Prime Minister asking for consultation on the bill and was sent a copy of the bill, and that was it. The group was not asked for a comment or for anything else; it asked for consultation and got a copy of the bill. It was told, 'Here it is.' The underlying message was: like it or lump it. Naturally enough, the Aboriginal groups which had been excluded were very angry. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has tried to tell this House that these were insignificant groups and that the government could not possibly talk to every Aboriginal person in Australia. The government had talked to the significant groups and it was on the basis of those conversations that it drew up this bill. That would mean that the government regards the New South Wales Land Council as an insignificant group. Considering that New South Wales has the largest number of Aboriginal people in the whole of Australia, the fact that the minister regards them as an insignificant group seems to be a slip on his part.",75
167,Mr WALKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Are you saying that we didn't have discussions with that land council? I had at least 20 discussions myself.,77
168,Mrs GALLUS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"You certainly did not on the bill. They were upset that they had not been consulted on the bill, as was the Aboriginal Coordinating Council in Queensland. ! was also approached by an Aboriginal group In Tasmania, an Aboriginal group in Victoria and several Aboriginal groups in my own state of South Australia. A whole host of Aboriginal groups in Western Australia had no knowledge of the bill. It emerged from these discussions that the Aboriginal people felt that they had been deliberately excluded from taking part by the government. They saw the bill as focusing on the needs of one particular group of Aboriginal people, and that group of Aboriginal people came from the Northern Territory. This does not in any way put down that group. Aboriginal leaders in the Northern Territory who fight for their rights fight extraordinarily hard and well. They have the interests of their people at heart. That is not the government's role. It is not the government's role to favour one group, no matter how good an advocate it is. It is the government's role to govern the whole of Australia. It is governing for all Aboriginal people, not just for a select group of Aboriginal people. Urban Aboriginal people feel particularly cheated by the bill. From the Prime Minister's own comments on the Native Title Bill they had understood that they would be the recipients of the land fund or, if not the total recipie,:ts, that t-ey would certainly be largely benefitIng from It. In the debate on the Native Title Bill the Prime Minister said to the Aboriginal people, 'We will be giving a land fund for those Aboriginal people who cannot benefit from the Native Title Act.' He could not have made it any clearer than that. Yet, when the land fund bill appeared before the parliament, there was nothing in it about who was to get land at all. There were no instructions to the ILC about which Aboriginal group would benefit, and there was no mention that it was going to be the people who could least benefit from the Native Title Act. Urban Aboriginal people became quite concerned that, as they were excluded from th- results of the Mabo decision, they were gOIng to be excluded from the land fund bill. Comments made by groups in the Northern Territory added to this fear. The Northern Territory people saw this as a way of gaining more traditional land, buying up propertiesand, again, I do not criticise them for this. It is their job in representing their people to find the best for them. But it did exclude Aboriginal groups from the rest of Australia, especially urban Aboriginal people who had been dispossessed in such a way that they had no chance of claiming traditional land. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, would have to agree with that. That was the context in which this came. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said: ... the government's legislation comes to this House only after the most exhaustive process of public consultation. I think that comes very close to misleading the House. When the Senate select committee investigating the land fund bill went around Australia it talked to-from memory-224 Aboriginal people. These people said, 'We for were not consulted. Nobody talks to us. Our needs were ignored by the government.' What is more, what came out of that visit was the gratitude of those Aboriginal people that somebody had finally come to talk to them, that the Senate select committee was actually interested in what they had to say. The senators on the committee said, 'Whatever else came out of it, there was a fantastic positive feeling as after the hearings all the Aboriginal people would come around us, shake our hands and hug us and say, 'Thank you for coming to see us, because nobody has talked to us before about our needs and what we want.' This is a condemnation of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs because he claimed he had consulted in a most exhaustive process-and obviously he did not. This brings us back to the debate in the House. When the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs looks back over his career, the types of things he said in that debate will probably be some of his most ignominious memories. Let us consider a couple of the amendments. I have been through them before so I do not want to go through them in detail, and certainly not to revisit all the arguments we went through in the long twoto three-day debate on them. I will take two in particular. The first called individual ownership. The coalition, in consultation with Aboriginal people, had moved an amendment that land should not be given only to corporations; it also allowed the Indigenous Land Corporation to provide land to family trusts or Aboriginal individuals. We did not say in that amendment that it must; we did not say 'only'. Had our amendment been included, the ILC could have chosen to provide land only to Aboriginal corporations. Our amendment did not stop that. What it did was simply widen the powers of the ILC so it could provide land to Aboriginal trusts and Aboriginal individuals, as is more appropriate for some Aboriginal people. This is what Aboriginal people were saying to us. What is appropriate for one group of Aboriginal people is not necessarily appropriate for all Aboriginal people. It is as if this government thinks, 'We have one group of Aboriginal people. We will listen to them and ignore everybody else in the whole of Australia.' It is as if it had decided to listen to the people in Sydney and the rest of Australia does not matter. That is a bad analogy because that is probably what happens anyway.",77
169,Mr WALKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,You said we didn't listen to the people in Sydney.,78
170,Mrs GALLUS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"--The Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, knows that I was talking about the wider population. In widening the powers of the ILC we were taking in the concerns of the wider Aboriginal population. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs chose to misrepresent that amendment. What I want to address is the misrepresentation that went on. The minister, on radio and in press releases all over Australia, was saying, 'The coalition wants to give land just to individuals instead of corporations.' He tried to give the impression that we wanted land to go only to individuals-a total misrepresentation of our amendment. The minister then said, 'How dare the coalition talk about giving land to family trusts and individuals when it knows that Aboriginal people deal only through corporations and communities.' Doesn't that strike is so- anyone as being somewhat odd? Here we have an Aboriginal population where we are talking about community structure and suddenly the minister is informing us that a corporation is the natural form for an Aboriginal community to take. I do not think corporations were around at the time of European settlement and I do not think they are part of Aboriginal culture; yet the government's minister was saying that this is the natural form for Aboriginal people-and excludes everything else.",78
171,Mr WALKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Community title.,78
172,Mrs GALLUS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"What is much more natural for many Aboriginal people is the family trust, holding things within a family. The minister at the table might remember that we did not exclude corporations; we simply added family trusts and individuals to cater for those Aboriginal people who found that a much more comfortable way of dealing with the issue. That was one of our amendments, an important amendment which was seriously misrepresented by both the minister and his Prime Minister. The second amendment, which was open to horrendous misrepresentation, was the so called health and housing amendment. Our amendment stated that when land was purchased, the viability of that land must be taken into account. We specifically talked about viability in regard to health, housing and education. That did not mean, as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs suggested, that we spend any of that land fund money on health, housing and education. The amendment was quite clear. There was no land fund management money to be spent on it but, in purchasing land, the viability of that land had to be examined. The reason is obvious. At the moment in Australia we have dozens of outback communities where people are living in absolutely appalling conditions with Third World health status. The reasons are threefold. The first is that the roads are unsealed and the dust from the roads gets into the eyes and nose. Secondly, and more importantly, there is insufficient water for regular washing. That means the dust cannot be washed off and, also, those infectious diseases which travel from the hand-the so-called anal/oral route---could not be guarded against by sufficient washing. The water in some of these communities is either non-existent or extraordinarily brackish. There is simply not enough piped water. The third reason is the lack of health services. When a community is set up there somehow needs to be access to health services. It could be by the provision of a landing strip to take people to the' next community. This is what we were asking the ILC to do. There are a number of ways the ILC could have done this. One would have been simply to say, 'We have this land available. It does not have access to these types of things. The water is too brackish to use. There is no piped water and educational facilities are a long way away.' The thing to do would be to negotiate with the Northern Territory government, the Western Australian government and the Queensland government and say, 'We have a parcel of land we wish to buy for Aboriginal people. It does not have these facilities. If purchase it, what is the chance that those necessary public health measures will be available? How will we get the children to school?' We were asking the ILC to look at the viability of the land before it is purchased. We do not need any more communities where there is no running water, proper sewerage and sealed roads. We need to get communities that are viable-and we need the ILC to take that into consideration. It was a very simple and clear amendment. But just in case it was too onerous for the ILC to do this, we added a clause 'unless there is a very good reason not to do it'. So we even left an out for the ILC, so if it thought the issue was so important, it did not have to take these fundamentals into consideration. Knowing that, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Prime Minister talked about the health and housing amendment, saying, 'The coalition wants the money spent on health and housing. It does not realise the importance of land to Aboriginal people.' I point out that it was a coalition government that enacted the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The coalition certainly recognises the importance of land but the coalition also recognises the importance of the health of Aboriginal people, their education and their general well-being, which this government does seem to neglect. I could make some comments on this government's absolute failure in the health area but it is well known how Aboriginal people, alone of the indigenous people in the Western world, have failed to make advances in health. Aboriginal men have 18 years less life expectancy than non-indigenous men in Australia. That is the absolutely shameful record of this government. Those were two absolutely key amendments that the minister. deliberately misrepresented. Then we get to the third amendment-not introduced into this House but introduced in the Senate-which reflected a concern that land fund money would be eaten up by administration. We introduced an amendment which said, 'We believe an extra $3 million should be given to the land fund each year we and then given to the ILC to cover administrative costs.' I think that was a necessary addition to the land fund. You would think this government, which grandstands on its generosity,would have grabbed at that and said, 'Fantastic, here is the coalition asking us to spend an extra $3 million to protect the money in the land fund. Of course we will do it.' However, riot only did it not say. that· but also it put its tails between its legs and brought that request for an extra $3 million down into the House in the quickest, most secretive way I have ever seen. Itsownlllembers did not even know about the request, because the government did not want it to get through the caucus that it was turning down an extra $3 million. . If it was' not enough that it did not tell own members, it then misrepresented the position .t() Aboriginal communities. It told Aboriginal communities that the coalition wanted to put a cap on administration. It did not say that the coalition wanted to giveim extra $3 million to cover that .administration. The goyernment has lied to Aboriginal people and lied to Australians over this. It has played politics from the very beginning, and it continues to play politics in this second bill. It is faced with the ignominy of a bill that has been improved by the Senate and which it has to face now in this bill and then explain it to the Australian people. There are other issues that arise out of the government's recent behaviour. Today in the House we saw the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs having to face the fact-after all the fuss he had made about secret documents and the fact that the minister for transport in South Australia, who was responsible for Hindmarsh bridge, was denied access to those documents, even though she was a woman-that those documents were posted around the country from white male to white male. That raises the question: what in the world does the minister think he is doing? Either he has lied in the posture he has taken on the matter or he is incompetent.  control.",78
173,Mrs GALLUS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"-I believe it is not a departmental matter. The minister has insisted that this matter was entirely his responsibility and that he had taken charge of the envelope. A lot of questions need to' be asked of the minister about what happened to that envelope and how this occurred. It certainly comes down to those two questions. Either he has misled everybody on this issue or he is incompetent. That is a 'decision the Prime Minister will have to make on this and other issues. The whole issue of the Broome crocodile farm and Hindmarsh Island bridge relate to land and Aboriginal heritage. The minister has not behaved in a competent fashion. It is interesting to note that he did leap with great enthusiasm into both of these cases, defending Aboriginal heritage. If we go back to the its Swan Br'ewery case in Western Australia, the minister declined to rule in favour of Aboriginal heritage. He stated that the then PremierI do not know whether she was a minister then-was well able to cope with that issue. He was reprimanded by the Federal Court, saying that. he had a responsibility which he had ignored. It is interestingthitt politics does play a considerable part in the minister's decision to act or not to act. Having acted in both the Hindmarsh bridge case and the Broome crocodile farm case-there being, in both states, a coalition government and not a Labor government-it seems it does matter who is in power. as to whether the minister feels the pressure of Aboriginal heritage or not. If we turn to the two declarations, both of which were overturned by Federal Court judges, the impression, unfortunately, in the wider community is that those declarations were overturned on matters of heritage. That is sad. The declarations having been overturned have given Aboriginal people a feeling that heritage has been rejected whereas, in both cases, they were overturned because the Minister for Aboriginal and. Torres Strait Islander Affairs had failed to follow due process. In the Broome crocodile case, Justice Carr ruled that the minister had given both the Western Australian government and Malcolm and Valerie Douglas only four hours to read the material, which was not sufficient time, and, in doing so, had denied them natural justice. In the Hindmarsh bridge case, Justice O'Loughlin found that the minister had erred in the appointment of Cheryl Saunders, that in the description of the land he had failed to describe it adequately and that, as a consequence of that, Cheryl Saunders had failed to put the correct advertisements in the newspaper and also failed to correctly describe reason for the inquiry, which was women's business and not, as was previously described, the campsite. It was not actually a failure of heritage but a failure of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to follow procedure. In defending himself, he was on radio saying, 'I did it because of the secret information in the women's letters.' That was mentioned by Justice O'Loughlin and he made it clear that that was not the reason he overturned the decision. Yet the minister insisted on going all around Australia saying that it was because of the sanctity of those letters. We now find that those letters, which were supposed to be so secret and so protected by the minister, have actually been travelling around Australia in unregistered parcels from white male to white male. There are a lot of questions that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has to answer. I presume that is one of the reasons why he is not sitting at the table here today. The second land fund bill is a move by a very cynical government to get out of the problem it had with the first bill. The bill been well amended by the Senate, and it had to come up with a second bill. The coalition, having gone through the first bill and amended it, had to decide what to do. Do we go . through the whole thing again? Do we put up the same amendments again? Do we go through the whole thing in the Senate again and then bring it back to the House? At that stage, we decided that we would not do that. There is a land fund ready to go and we will support it. The government has supported 23 of our amendments. They are probably not the 23 we would have desired it to support. It has supported some, as opposed to its previous statement that it would not support anya backflip by the government. But the coalition is of the view that the land fund is important. We wish the Aboriginal people to have access to the land fund, and we will not be opposing this second land fund bill.",80
174,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The good news out of all that from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) was the last few words. There was not much before the that. There was almost 30 minutes of things we have all heard here before. Obviously, she has not learnt very much from the last 12 months of this whole debate.  ous.",81
175,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I think I am being generous. I welcome the fact that the opposition is now going to support the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill. That is a good move. But the damage the opposition has done over the last 12 months-really since the Mabo decision came down-to any reconciliation with Aboriginal people in this country will be here for many years. That is the sad part about this matter. We are really having this debate in the wrong chamber; we should have been having this debate in the Main Committee. The idea of the Main Committee is to deal with noncontroversial legislation and this legislation should be non-controversial. The Liberal and National parties opposite should have supported the original bill. We should have had these debates in a harmonious fashion and in a had spirit of cooperation, working together to address the issues that face the indigenous people of this country. The opposition has failed, and failed miserably. It has done that continuously for a long time. ",81
176,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,The member for Sturt continues to interject with his little utterings all the time. We know how committed he is towards doing anything for the Aboriginal people. ,81
177,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,He has often made comments that he believes we should be almost policing the Aboriginal people's funding arrangements to the extent where they cannot operate. That is the sort of attitude that we get from the opposition from time to time. This is a disgrace. ,81
178,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"It is really a disgrace when those in the coalition have these attitudes in that they just do not want to work . towards doing anything to help Aboriginal people. Mrs Gallus-I resent that, Les. I really do resent that.",82
179,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"You can resent what you like. I resent a lot of things you have been saying about Aboriginal people for a long time. I am sure Alexander Downer resents your attitude towards them as well. After all, the trip that you took to the Northern Territory with him will go down as one of the most disgraceful things that anyone in this country has ever seen. The member for Hindmarsh and the member for Sturt will continue to interject with their frivolous points because they do not have the commitment that this parliament needs. Since the Mabo decision was made and since the Native Title Act was enacted, those opposite in this parliament have had the greatest opportunity to join with the government and really work through this issue of the land fund legislation. But they failed-and failed miserably. All they have done has been to put up excuses as to why we cannot do this and we cannot do that, instead of trying to find out how we can address these issues. We as a nation have to work together to overcome the difficulties that a lot of our indigenous people have found themselves in for many years-not just under this government but for many years. The member for Hindmarsh talked about health and housing issues. They are extremely important issues. Certainly, they are and always have been important issues to people on this side of the House. But we also need to ensure that our states do something about them.  everything.",82
180,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,You can blame the states because they have prime,82
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Hon. N.B. Reid}-Order! I think the honourable member should direct his comments through the chair.,82
182,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would appreciate it then if the honourable member for Sturt would just button his lip for a while and listen. I am responding to the comments previously made by the member for Hindmarsh. The states do have a responsibility in those areas. The states have an extremely important responsibility when it comes to health and housing because it is that level of government which provides those services to the community. It needs to be emphasised that that includes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is a state election coming up in New South Wales. I noticed that the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill went to a place in New South Wales called Dubbo to have some consultations with the Aboriginal people. That was very good of the committee. That was one place it went to. Mind you, it did not go anywhere in Queensland where most of the Aboriginal people live. ",82
183,Mr LES SCOTT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Anyway, the committee went out there to Dubbo. The state government in New South Wales has got a prime opportunity to fix those problems of health and housing that really need to be fixed. They are extremely important. The issues of health and housing are continually before the government; they are areas that we are continually working on. Certainly, in the government's caucus committees we have a greater commitment to address the issues of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than those opposite have. Let us have a look at how long this particular debate has been dragged out by the opposition. The legislation should have been up and running a long time ago. Let us go through some of the events. The first reading of the original land fund bill here in this chamber was on 30 June last year. Then from 30 August to 1 September the second reading debate took place in this House. We all had the opportunity to speak on the bill. I am told that there were 10 hours and 48 minutes of debate during that time. Then the consideration in detail stage was held on 1 September and later 19 and 20 September where there were another nine hours 52 minutes in total. So we are talking about over 20 hours of debate in this chamber, although certainly a lot more has gone in the Senate. The bill was read a third time on 20 September. That is a pretty fair effort. It took almost three months to consider the original land fund bill and to give all members in this place the opportunity to make a contribution to it. Then the bill went off to the Senate on 21 September for the first reading. The second reading debate in the Senate took place on 21 September and 18 and 19 October. There was a total of four hours and 40 minutes of debate compared with 10 hours and 48 minutes in this place. On 1 September the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. On 10 October the committee reported back to the Senate. Then the bill was considered by the Senate sitting as the committee of the whole. There was quite a lengthy debate during the committee stage of 22 hours and 30 minutes. But then, of course, the old Senate committee situation came back into it. The report of the committee of the whole was adopted by the Senate with some amendments. The bill came back here again on 17 November when we in this place had the good sense not to accept the amendments proposed by the Senate and sent it back there again. Since then, the Senate has been messing about with that legislation, as it often does with other legislation. It then set up the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. The Senate select committee was due to present its report on 31 January which it, in fact, did on 9 February. This legislation has just been dragged out and nothing really has happened. Let us look at the consultation that the select committee did, because I do not believe it did its job at all. That was obviously because of the biased nature of the committee, made up of a majority of coalition senators and the Greens. Of course, the Greens have played a pretty lousy hand through this whole exercise. We are back here now with this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced on 28 February. We know that on the same day the on Senate then brought on for debate the original land fund bill. Then last week we had the debacle here. That is the process we have gone through in this place to get to where we are now, yet the member for Hindmarsh does not seem to have learned very much in all that time. Let us look at the consultation that the government has been involved in. I am a member of the caucus committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, as are a lot of my colleagues who, no doubt, will also be speaking on this legislation. Through that committee we had many discussions with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So even as backbenchers in the parliament we have had the opportunity to discuss many issues with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to ensure that we are across the issues and know what is happening in that field. It is important for us to do that. The government, of course, at the ministerial level has had a whole range of consultations for some considerable time. The Prime Minister has taken a very strong interest in this area, and rightly so. This parliament should be extremely proud and pleased at the Prime Minister's contribution to this and the manner in which he has entered into those consultations with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Prime Minister met with representatives from many areas and certainly from the major Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. I think the member for Hindmarsh made some comments before that he had not done so, but of course he has. In April and June the New South Wales Land Council was involved in discussions and negotiations with the Prime Minister on the setting up of the land fund. There have been extensive consultations by the Prime Minister, and through that process a significant degree of consensus was achieved. I can recall having many discussions with Aboriginal people on the Native Title Bill and subsequently on this bill. Of course, the discussions certainly overlapped because, fundamentally, this bill is to assist those people who cannot benefit from the Native Title Act. I think that even those opposite would be aware of that. The consultations that we have had on this side have been quite extensive and over some considerable time, as distinct from what the opposition has obviously had, because this Senate select committee was obviously put together there and they were going to do something over Christmas and January during the holiday period. Yet it is a known fact that many people are actually not available during those times. So they rushed things through when they had all that previous time from when the native title bill was first canvassed. They had all that time to have as many discussions as they liked in the lead-up to this because they must have been well aware that this sort of bill would be coming forward. I just cannot see how they have actually had the time and the commitment to carry out properly the consultations they have had. I am pleased the honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned that she did have some discussions in Queensland. It obviously was not canvassed too well in Queensland as I did not see too much about it. There needs to be a lot more consultation to get across the issue. The opposition are always rather critical of A TSIC because they do not see it as a very viable organisation. But it is-it is part of ongoing process of this government's commitment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I get a bit sick and tired of the opposition taking every opportunity they can to have a go at ATSIC, because ATSIC really does need support from this place and not the criticism that it always seems to be getting from some people. Undoubtedly, coalition members are just into sabotaging this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. They have no real commitment or interest in doing anything about it. There is a real lack of either interest or commitment amongst them to do anything constructive to help the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Now I am pleased to see that they are agreeing with this measure today. Of course, that has been important-that is something that should have happened a long time ago. But I am concerned about what sort of commitment they really do have. Commitments have been given by those opposite that, if the unfortunate thing happened to Australia and they were to get into government some time, they would repeal these sorts of things. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should be clearing up that point and clarifying those things. I have been looking at some media comments. Almost 12 months ago, on 13 May 1994, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) actually made the comment: I can promise you that the coalition policy is that the land fund will be opposed and that the Native Title Bill will be repealed. That comment related to the native title bill, and they have the same attitude towards this bill as well. So what sort of certainty does that give the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when they know that the opposition is committed to repealing both the native title legislation and this land fund bill? There is no doubt that the coalition has that commitment. They have no real commitment to addressing these issues and working with the government and working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to fix a lot of these problems before us. This is an important bill, as was the native the title bill, and both of them deserve commitment from this place. Of course, the government has accepted a whole lot of amendments in drafting this new legislation-and the Prime Minister highlighted those in his second reading speech. He highlighted a few things that, I think, the member for Hindmarsh spoke about but which she still does not seem to grasp. She continued to make a big point about land being purchased in the names of individuals and trusts. She spoke about the role of the Indigenous Land Corporation, which we will refer to as the ILC for ease of reference. However, she kept making the point that the coalition's commitment is for individual people to own this land in their own right and to have the right to buy and sell it, as anybody else would. In his second reading speech, the Prime Minister pointed out that Aboriginal people do have that right now to purchase land but that the wh?l- principle of this bill is to assist those Abongmal people as a community and those ones who have been dispossessed and who cannot be assisted by the native title bill. This bill will assist those work people so that they can actually benefit as a community. It does not take anyone much to realise that, if Aboriginal people can purchase that land in individual names and have the right to sell it, it would not last very long; Even just through normal generational things, properties are bought and sold, and it would - ot take .mu-h time before the whole emphasIs of thIS bIll would be destroyed. I really cannot see why the opposition is 'pushing that line. I have spoken to people about this, and a lot of people out there in the community do not understand that this' is a very important thing for which the opposition is pushing-for individuals and trusts to own property, to acquire land through the land fund in their own names. We have argued that it should be incorporated bodies because of that continuity. The Aboriginal people that I have spoken to do not have a problem with that because the land will be there for Aboriginal people forever-and that is what we neeq to aim for here. I just cannot see why the opposition are pushing for that. Why they continue to - ush that particular point has never beenexplamed properly, certainly not by the mem-er for Hindmarsh. Perhaps other members mIght be able to explain it a little bit better than the member for Hindmarsh because, obviously, she is missing the whole point of this bill. To the Senate, this. was a very important thing, but it is a change that the government could not possibly accept for all those reasons. So the Aboriginal people will have this land to use for years and years to come. I am surprised that that particular amendment is being pursued by those opposite. , As I said at the beginning; we have a great opportunity .here as a parliament to get this right. We will only get it right if those opposite are prepared to work with the government to bring about the right outcomes here-and that is a strong commitment to ensuring that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people really do benefit from this legislation, that they have things with which they can identify. We do have a genuine need for us all to together and bring about the right outcomes. Consultation is and has been important right through this whole process, and this government has a good record in consulting with the Aboriginal people. It is something in w-ich I believe we have come a long way, partICUlarly since the Mabo decision. It has been important for us to pursue. these sorts of issues. I' personally feel that this government can be very proud of the effort that we have put into bringing about some sort of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. We all still have a long way to go and we are working towards that. 'But we will only achieve it if those opposite and the respective leaders of the opposition-because they change them pretty regularly-are prepared to sit down and work with the government to achieve those goals. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to support this legislation in its present form.",82
184,Mr NUGENT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Aston) (6.18 p.m.)Briefly, I say to the honourable gentleman who has just spoken about the spirit of cooperation that I do not think that his PriJ?Minister (Mr Keating) actually does the SPI-It ofcooperation a lot of good when he came m here as he did last week when my leader stood up and sa-d, 'We will not oppose this legislation,' and the honourable member found himself denied, from his perspective, of what he believed would bea tool with which to beat the opposition for a long time and so he said, 'I will withdraw my second bill'-the one we are now debating-'and I will introduce another one and go back to the original script. Pe.rhaps you won't be able to stom,,:ch that and I'll have something to beat you WIth then.' Is that cooperation? Or is that playing crass politics? I would suggest to you it is playing crass politics in the same way that when I was the shadow minister, a year or so ago, and we were talking about the native title legislation, I went to the' government on behalf of the coalition to talk about cooperation in getting that legislation through before it ever came to this place and your government did not want to know about cooperation. So do not come in here and preach holier than thou, as if you have got some sort of mortgage-as my leader said last week-on morality on these issues, because it is just true. If the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is to follow me in this debate, starts to get sanctimonious, I will merely remind him of the evidence heard this morning in the public hearings of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, of which he and I are both members. I would suggest that the Goss government did not look too clean and healthy. I could go on and on, throwing dirt like you do.",85
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Order! The honourable member should address his remarks through the chair.,86
186,Mr NUGENT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your ever present wisdom in these situations. The point that I was going to make to the honourable gentleman opposite is that we can all stand here and throw dirt back and forth. That is not going to help the lot of Aboriginal people one iota. It seems to me that we should be talking in a much more constructive way about the legislation that is before us. J do not think there is anybody on our side of the chamber who does not support the objectives of this legislation. The argument is about the process, not about the objective of giving land to indigenous people. Mr Gibson-You are speaking on behalf of the member for Barker, are you?",86
187,Mr NUGENT,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I heard the interjection from the member for Moreton. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is just as keen as I am to see land given to Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed. We are arguing about the process. I obviously approach this matter from a slightly different position from that of the gentleman who is guffawing so readily on the other side of the chamber. As the gentleman knows, in the five years that he and I have been here we have both been very heavily involved in indigenous matters. I am currently the coalition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I want to see the lot of indigenous people in this country significantly improved in the area of land and in a whole range of other areas. In terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it is not only land that we not need to talk about. If you go to the Torres Strait Islands to talk to the people-and you have to fly there in small aeroplanes, which I have been prepared to fly in, but I believe the member for Moreton has some difficulty with them-you will discover that water is just as significant to the Torres Strait Islanders as land is to other Aboriginal people. When you talk about trying to do something to redress the disadvantage of indigenous people, a package of measures is necessary. Land alone is not sufficient. Land is an important part of the package. The ownership and the occupation of land are all about restoring self-respect and self-esteem, to go back to one's roots and one's culture. It is a vitally important part of the total package. There are other things that need to come with land. They include health, education, employment, housing, justice and so on. That is one of the reasons why the coalition, in looking at this legislation over the last few months, has tried to bring about practical amendments to deal with things as a package rather than just looking at land in its own right. The government will tell you that it is dealing with those matters in all sorts of other ways. It will tell you that it has got special extra funding for health. Of course, the so called extra funding for health was nothing of the sort. When it came out in the budget last year it was merely a continuation of the existing programs under the Aboriginal health strategy. My leader stood up in this place and stated very clearly what the official position of the coalition is to be on this legislation: we will not oppose it. He has given a clear indication that it will not be stopped in the Senate and he has given a clear indication that when we come to government we will look at the legislation with a view to improving it. Quite clearly, if, in the period between now and when we come to government, those on the other side can demonstrate the effectiveness of that legislation, it seems to me that that would be the way to go. But let us be quite clear: we put forward a number of amendments",86
188,Mr WALKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"We will give you a fair go. Mr NUGENTI do not need to be educated by the gentleman at the table. He will get his chance later on. The government has accepted a number of amendments. When we looked at the first version of this legislation the government said that it would accept no amendments. Now it is saying that it accepts some amendments. What is it to be? Are those amendments valid or are they not valid? You have admitted that the legislation can be improved. It seems to me that the whole history of this legislation shows that it has not just been for the benefit of indigenous people; it has been a political exercise by the government. That is a sad commentary on those on the other side, some of whom I know are so deeply committed to this issue of resolving Aboriginal disadvantage-as, indeed, I am. Let us look at the history of consultations on this legislation that the government says it has been through. The reality of life is that that consultation was limited to a few in the indigenous community, predominantly those who are represented at the senior levels of ATSIC and the land councils. I am not saying that that is exclusively the case but certainly it is predominantly the case. I have travelled around the country quite extensively in the last five years and I have talked to those same representatives. I have also talked to communities across the length and breadth of the country-in the cities, the rural towns and the remote communities. It is very clear to me that, across the broad mass of Aboriginal people, there is not overwhelming support for this legislation in the form in which the government initially introduced it. The argument will be run by the government that A TSIC is representative of the people. A TSIC was elected by about 31 or 32 per cent of the indigenous population. It is representative of all indigenous people. I am not suggesting that ATSIC should be done away with. I am not saying that A TSIC does not do some good things. I am saying: let us not overstate the case. The land councils are not elected by the people. The chairperson of ATSIC is appointed by the government. The people who have been the major consultees on this legislation .are not the Aboriginal people across the country. Therefore, there is a different view. The government, in its consultations in the future, must accept that there are wider views. If you travel to the different communities you will find that A TSIC is criticised far more by indigenous people than by the people in this place. Having said that, let us be quite clear that this legislation will now go through. I think that is a good thing. It gives the government the chance to set up the ILC. Let us start to give the Aboriginal people some land. Let us try to do it in such a way that they get some benefit from it. Let us stop the politicking on this issue and get on with dealing with the issues that are important to so many of the indigenous people to whom I speak regularly. They are concerned about their children's health, their children's education, the state of their housing and the lack of jobs. They are concerned about the problems with CDEP, good though the principle may be. They are concerned about this government's failure to deliver on the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As the member for Moreton knows, his committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, recently brought down a report which quite clearly said that government at all levels has failed to deliver on the recommendations by the royal commission. It seems to me that the government would be well advised to put a lot more effort into getting some ofthose recommendations fixed. It seems to me the government would be well advised to start looking at the question of justice for Aboriginal people. Just last week the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) had to not admit that, in spite of all that had happened with the royal commission, the number of Aboriginal people dying in custody is greater this year than it was last year. That is not a case of fixing the problem. While we can all talk about goodwill and good intent, the results are not there. Let us look at social justice. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is about to make recommendations to the government about what it should do in terms of social justice for Aboriginal people. This is part of the third leg of the government's avowed policy of fixing the situation for our indigenous community. We had the native title legislation and the land fund and now we are going to have but social justice. After the Council for Aborigiwe nal Reconciliation makes its recommendago tions, ATSIC is going to deliver its recomam mendations and the social justice commissionis er, Mick Dodson, is doing the same thing. It seems to me that the government has an staff excellent opportunity-before these things hit the public fan and people start taking partisan positions-to actually sit down with coalition members and try to make sure we attack this third leg in a much more conciliatory, senriginal people. sible and constructive way for the indigenous people of this country. The situation is still terrible. It has been for years. We all acknowledge it has been bad for years, but why do we not do more about it? If· the present system, with all its intentions, has not worked let us look at some new ways of doing things. We have just been told by the Bureau of Statistics that it has done an objective analysis and written a report called Getting results. I am sure the gentlemen on the other side familiar with this report. Four in 10 unemployed Aboriginal adults gave a lack of appropriate jobs as the main reason for their unemployment. That is 40 per cent. Nearly the half of female Aboriginal adults said that family violence was a common problem in their area. As well, one in 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 24 years of age said they were taken away as children from their natural families by a mission, the government or welfare. We are talking about people who are still young-not aged, but spritely people like the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), grey-haired young people like me or very spritely people like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid. We are talking about people who are 25, 26 or 27 years of age. Those are the issues we ought to be dealing with. If we look at substance abuse, we see that three-quarters of all adults thought alcohol was a common problem in their area. These figures are a national disgrace to all of us. We ought to be putting forward the necessary resources to fix the problems. Regrettably, I have to say that the government's record is one of good intentions, it has failed in some regards. Therefore, need to make some changes to the way we about things. We need a new approach. I not going to bucket ATSIC but the reality that ATSIC needs some restructuring. As recently as last year, 37 per cent of ATSIC's were here in Canberra Aboriginal people in the field will tell you that the regional councils do not function. That is not attacking ATSIC; that is saying we have to do something to fix the problems and help the AboSurely prevention is better than cure. Instead of coming up with great schemes for bad Aboriginal health, strategies for dealing with state governments, and more bureaucratic setups, we ought to be out there putting money good into the communities so that community nurses can teach people basic hygiene, so they can make sure that little Johnny's mother takes him to the doctor when he is supposed to go. This will prevent the lung infections that and other diseases that are so common in will be indigenous communities. We have to work more with the states. I know that the states have not been perfect. Members opposite know-as I do--that over years states of all political persuasions have been less than perfect in all sorts of respects. The government's answer is to say, 'We will have legislation in the Commonwealth parliament and we will make the so and sos do what they are supposed to do.' The reality is that this ends up in court actions and causes delays. The indigenous people themselves are the ones who actually suffer. I put it to the government that we really need to develop better working relationships with the states instead of partaking in constant warring. I hope the shadow minister at the table, who has responsibility on this side for dealing with Commonwealth-state relationships, will agree with me and take this on board as a major priority of coalition policy development. We need to look at better cooperation with and coordination of the multiple bodies involved in so many areas of activity. Last year I had one of the graduates occasionally get in this place do a two-month project. The student came in here from ANU under the internship scheme to look Aboriginal housing. The reality is that it not uncommon to find 20 or 30 people living in a three-bedroom house. I regret there is not a huge audience here to listen to my speech but, if the 20 or so people in this chamber at the moment had to live for six three-bedroom house with only one shower and one toilet, we would not handle it terribly well. That is going on time and again. There is $2 billion worth of arrears in housing needed to fix that problem in Aboriginal communities. We need to look at how we are going to do those sorts of things better. When we were burying the first version of this bill last week, I acknowledged that I believe the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has the best intentions. But I think his performance has pointing in that he has not been able to deliver. I think we need to look at some new ways of doing things. Whether we are talking about the crocodile farm at Broome, the Hindare marsh bridge or the difficulties in regard the Ombudsman and ATSIC, the fact is that after five years in the job all the indicators as bad or getting worse. We have to take a different perspective. In conclusion, I say quite earnestly and sincerely that I hope this legislation achieves its objectives. I worry that it will not. The responsibility clearly is with the government but, now that the government has got the legislation through, I urge all of those on other side to give the highest degree of priority and the greatest amount of attention to fixing all those other practical things which may not help the spirit and soul-but, my God, will help the body-of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. They ought to get the health, housing, education, justice and jobs they so richly deserve after 200 years of neglect, five years of this minister and 12 years of this government.",87
189,Mr GIBSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I am delighted to enter the debate on the second reading of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill we 1994. I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to follow the honourable member the for Aston (Mr Nugent). If the honourable at member for Aston were still the opposition is spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, I do not think we would be in the position we are in today. I think there would have been a far more sound administration of opposition policy on. this matter if he months in a had been in charge. I also do not believe that the· honourable member for Nugent would have allowed his leader at that time, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), to get himself into such difficulties as he got himself into in central Australia, which ultimately led to his downfall. It was the beginning of the slippery slope to nowhere for the member for Mayo. I do not think that the member for Aston would have allowed that to occur. He would have advised him much more than the current been disapshadow spokesperson did. I pay every respect to the honourable member for Aston. I know that his contributions in these debates are soundly based and based on a true philosophy and committo ment to the welfare of Aboriginal people. But I must respond to a few of his points and are some of the comments made by previous to now start coalition speakers. This will be either the 11 th or the 12th time. I have spoken on this issue in this House, which is an indication of how long this parliament has been dealing with this legislation. It is of enormous frustration to people on this side of the House who have a genuine the commitment to achieving real reform and real progress in Aboriginal affairs that we face incredible delays, unnecessary delays, obfuscation and perfidy on the part of coalition and opposition members either in this place or in the other place on almost every occasion when dealing with a piece of legislation or a new program where we are seeking to advance the cause of Aboriginal people. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has stated to the House that he intends to· allow this bill to be passed here and in the Senate. That is a great achievement, at long last. We all understand the cowardly motives behind that decision, which were clearly flagged when the Senate committee came down with its findings: the coalition is absolutely terrified of the concept of having a double dissolution. It is terrified because it knows that its unrealistic and unreasonable numbers, and the way in which it exercises those numbers in the Senate, would be changed in a double dissolution. With its unholy alliance with the Greens, it would lose the control it is able to achieve at the moment. The opposition leader is now prepared to allow this bill to go forward and be passed even though he has also indicated that, should he ever win the Treasury benches, he will carve this bill up, make major amendments to it, destroy the very purpose of the bill and, therefore, make it a meaningless exercise. People need to understand that there is no change of heart on the part of members of the opposition as far as any renewed commitment to improving the welfare of Aboriginal people is concerned. It is a purely political exercise on their part to avoid a double dissolution and avoid the fate they would meet in that double disso Iuti on. We on this side have been accused of playing politics because we dared accept the challenge the Senate process put up to us as a government. We have put up a second bill. We are accused of playing politics because, after negotiation, we were prepared to accept a series of amendments that the Senate put up but we were not prepared to put up with all of the amendments. The Senate proposed 70 amendments to the legislation, which totally destroyed the very essence of the bill. We were not prepared to put up with that but we were prepared to accept a series of amendments, technical and minor, that do not really improve the bill. Two of them in fact go to changing the name of the bill. That is how important some of the amendments are. We were prepared to cope with some of those amendments but we are not going to destroy the very essence of the legislation, the purpose of the Aboriginal land fund and the way in which the Indigenous Land Corporation operates. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in introducing this new legislation, in his second reading speech said: The central premises of the bill-the policy foundation on which the indigenous land fund was to be established and administered-were overturned in an unfortunate display of cynical parliamentary opportunism. The damage was inflicted on the government's legislation despite an enormous effort on our part to find common ground, to reach a position that would allow this initiative of great national importance to proceed. He further said in his address: The government accepted 21 of those amendments on the floor of the Senate, despite having reservations about many of them. In the hope that bipartisan support for the bill can still be achieved, we have since agreed to accept a number of other amendments. All of these changes are incorporated in the bill now before the House. The government cannot agree to the remainder of the Senate's changes. Among them, there are a number which undermine the very purpose of the bill, and would make the administration of the land fund a bureaucratic and legal nightmare. It is not the coalition which has been playing politics. We are seeking to put in place a piece of legislation that will advance Aboriginal interests and enable the establishment of a corporation to purchase land on behalf of Aboriginal communities so we can deal with this most important issue for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Who has been playing politics? I have here the chronology of how long it has taken us to get to this point. People should understand that this matter was first brought before the House of Representatives on 30 June 1994. Here we are on Monday, 6 March 1995 and we are still trying to get a piece of legislation carried so we can put this administration of land into place. The debate went forward in a very comprehensive way in this chamber. We had almost 11 hours of debate on the second reading, which is a very long debate for most legislation. We have gone nowhere near that length of time before.",89
190,Mr CADMAN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,What date was that?,91
191,Mr GIBSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,The debate was held on 30 August and 1 September.,91
192,Mr CADMAN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"It wasn't June, was it?",91
193,Mr GIBSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"No, it was not June. We tabled this bill in June and we gave the opposition from June to the end of August to engage in consultation around the country about the bill. The opposition members did not bother to engage in any sort of consultation. Then at the very last moment, on 28 August, they arrived in this place with some 50 or so amendments, if my recollection serves me right. They were seeking to make major amendments to the bill and they had not done one ounce of consultation with any Aboriginal or Islander person in this country. The bill had been tabled in this House on 30 June and two months later those opposite came forward with amendments that not one Aboriginal person in this country had seen, had made recommendations on or had any chance to put views on. That is the chronology. They are the facts. That is the way in which the politics of this legislation have been handled by the coalition, not by the government. We gave two months notice so the members of the coalition could have a chance to read the bill in detail and consider how they would amend it. We then went through consideration in detail in this chamber. I know that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), a number of other members and I participated quite a deal in that debate, which lasted nine hours and 52 minutes. On 20 September we had the third reading in the House, and then we sent the bill to the Senate. The Senate had the first bill from 21 September, the date the first reading occurred, the way through until 1 March 1995. That is where all the delays have occurred. That is where all the cheap and nasty politics have occurred. It has not been the government. Who were the major players? The coalition and the Greens. That is the most unhealthy, unholy alliance I have ever heard of. Both parts of that coalition should hang their heads in shame for the way in which they worked together. You could accept that the two of them had a whole series of amendments, had a whole process they. wanted to go through and wanted to really tear this thing to shreds-and that was the political game they were playing-but it is even more alarming that they delayed the whole process for some five months. They forced this process to go through for five months and then last week in the Senate the Greens-who put the government, this legislation and the Aboriginal and Islander community around Australia through this process-did not even have the guts to vote on the final bill. They forced 70 amendments. through, delayed the bill by five months, caused enormous pain and anguish all around this country and then did not even have the guts to vote for the final bill. What type of a political operation is that? They should be absolutely disgusted with themselves, and I hope sincerely that the people of Western Australia understand exactly what an enormous expense in financial, moral and physical terms the Greens put this country and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through by that disgraceful act of cowardice. 'Cowardice' is the word I would like to use to describe everything that has occurred with this bill. We have seen an act of absolute cowardice on the part of the Greens. We have seen an act of cowardice on the part of the Leader of the Opposition because he is not prepared to face a double dissolution, which he knew he would if he had opposed this bill. He knew that if he had a double dissolution he would lose the ability to manipulate the Greens and the Senate in the way he has on this legislation. It has been a very interesting process-a all process made even more interesting by the total backflips, twists and turns which, as I think the Prime Minister previously said, would make Greg Louganis or some of the other high board divers from the opposition feel proud. We have had an incredible series of backflips. Last week the Leader of the Opposition decided to support this bill. We have heard this .before. In August we heard that the opposition was prepared to support the first bill, but before then we heard that the opposition was absolutely implacably opposed to the bill. On 13 May 1994 the member for Barker (Ian MCLachlan), who is the shadow minister for the environment, stated: I can promise you that Coalition policy is that Land Fund will be opposed, and that the Native Title Bill will be repealed. In June 1994 the member for Mayo, who at the the time was opposition leader, stated: We've said that all along we would oppose establishmentofthe Fund, because purchasing isn't as big a priority as we see it as dealing the issues of Aboriginal health, education and housing ... But suddenly the tune changed. On 30 major August, the day the bill was being debated in purpose. the House of Representatives, coalition members announced that they would support bill subject to a series of amendments. But did they? No. When the bill finally faced a third reading in the House of Representatives on September, opposition members voted against it-70 votes in favour, 49 votes against. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and the honourable member for and Aston-people who have got up in this place and told us how strongly committed they to the cause of Aboriginal people-voted against the legislation. Then there was the question about the way in which these amendments were dealt with. The coalition first announced on 31 August that it would seek major amendments to the bill under three major headings: refocusing the bill to address health, housing, education and economic issues; addressing the key issue of accountability; and land purchasing and management strategies. Then two weeks later the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs said the opposition's amendments proposed: ... some slight changes; I think that you will find that they are very slight. Seventy ame!ldments are very slight! How can we believe anything that comes from the opposition spokesperson when she is so clearly twisting and turning, and chopping and changing position. I will reserve my judgment on the coalition until I see how its members vote on this bill. Although they are saying they will support it, who knows what tomorrow's story will be? Who knows what backflips they will take on this legislation? If they finally agree to vote the for it, that is good. But they have already announced their intended backflip; that is, should they ever get into power, they will rip bill into pieces and totally change it. Their vote in favour of the bill is a disguised actto the con the people of Australia, including the land Aboriginal people, that they support the with purposes of the land acquisition fund. If they manage to squirm their way into office, which I doubt considerably, they will engage in a rewrite of the bill and totally change its Let me address the essence of this bill. I the will quote some original comments that I made on the first bill on 30 August last year. I think we need to refocus on what this bill is 20 all about. One of the series of amendments put forward by the opposition was to refocus the purpose of the bill to have a major priority on health, education, employment and housing-totally losing the sense, knowledge understanding of what the bill was about. In August last year, I quoted from the Nationare al Aboriginal Health Strategy Report of March 1989. That report states: ""Health"" to Aboriginal peoples is a matter of determining all aspects of their life, including control over their physical environment, of dignity, of community self-esteem, and of justice. It is not merely a matter of the provision of doctors, hospitals medicines or the absence of disease and inc-pacity . Traditional Aboriginal social systems include a three-dimensional model that provides a blue-print for living. Such a social system is based on interrelationships between people and land, people and creator beings, and between people, which ideally stipulates inter-dependence within and between each set of relationships. I quote further from my own comments: In essence, the message is clear: as I said before, we cannot heai the body unless we first heal the spirit of Aboriginal people. The spirit of Aboriginal and Islander people is intertwined and interconnected with land. Access to the land and rights over land are essential to the achievement of better physical, social, economic and cultural outcomes for Aboriginal and Islander people. That is the essence of this bill. Until coalition members understand that, they will continue waffling around in the dark, not understanding anything about Aboriginal culture or the purpose of this bill. We heard some comments from the member for Aston about the need for a new approach to some of the other major issues affecting Aboriginal people. He knows, as do others, that I am strongly committed to that. We do need a new approach. A new approach might be to start forcing state and territory governments to meet their obligations. If they are not prepared to meet them, then we will take them out of the equation. As all honourable members know, state and territory governments have responsibility for more than 80 per cent of government expenditure on health and housing. Local governments are responsible for the delivery of roads and water supply. Opposition spokespeople constantly cite the argument of states rights. I ask them again: what about states' responsibilities? They certainly have not met their responsibilities to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country. When ATSIC was formed, instead of it becoming a complementary body, it was forced to be solely responsible. (Time expired)",91
194,Mr CADMAN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The level of self-delusion on the part of the ALP, with its contorted and twisted interpretation of the turn of events in which the House and the Australian people have considered Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land rights, is just amazing. Those opposite seem to be able to put themselves into the very personality of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who before considering any of the opposition's proposals said that the government would reject them, no matter what they were. The Prime Minister had not seen or heard one line from a spokesperson of any sort-be it leader, Aboriginal spokesman, environmental spokesman or anybody else from our side-when he said, 'We will reject anything that the opposition wants to bring forward.' That has been the constant theme of the Australian Labor Party. It has not wanted to negotiate or understand the needs of the Aboriginal people; rather, it has wanted to claim the political high ground of being the conscience of Australia. How conscience stricken has the Prime Minister been? He has had to reject a bill passed by the Senate and bring in new legislation which incorporates many of the proposals that the Senate considered valuable in this area. We have a Prime Minister claiming that he has the sole gift of wisdom, but he is a Prime Minister who is being forced to acknowledge that there are other arguments-and sound arguments. It was interesting to hear members of the Australian Labor Party saying that government members are really committed to the land rights legislation. Those opposite were committed to the first round; they were committed to the negotiations; and now they are committed to the second round. Those in the Australian Labor Party seem to be saying that there is no difference between the first bill and the second bill. There is a huge difference. That difference was brought about because the Aboriginal community at large saw the flaws in the government's first bill. It was not brought about by anything that occurred in the Senate. If the Prime Minister is so hairy chested, why does he not run the same legislation into the Senate? He has failed to do that. We have seen modifications made to the government's proposition-a proposition on which the Prime Minister himself said that he would not negotiate. He said he would not listen to a single argument. He said that he would reject all opposition concepts. He said that he would not listen to a single proposal that was brought forward by the opposition. The government failed to consider the amendments in the Senate, rejected the concept of dealing with the coalition, and then seemed to partially change its mind. The government rejected the proposals before it knew what they were. The government was not prepared to acknowledge that the coalition's priorities in this area had far more substance than its own. Instead of promising the Aboriginals spinifex, our promises were fdr health,jobs and education-the real needs of the Aboriginal community, not the token needs as seen by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party seems to be wrapped up in the ethos of the spirit of Bula and the spirituality of the Aboriginal people but prepared to let them die from ill health. The government's record is appalling. We have had 12 years of waste and degradation. As a party, a group or an administration, those opposite cannot point to any achievefund ments in this area. The reports that the parliament and the nation have seen over the few days clearly indicate that those opposite have failed-and failed miserably. Those opposite cannot point to any area health, education or employment that has been a success. Things in Redfern are no better than they were five or 10 years ago; they are no better in the Northern Territory than were five or 10 years ago. It rings hollow for government members to come in here and say, 'Yes, we are committed to some indefithat nite future plan. We, too, feel that education, health and employment are important.' Those members of the Australian community who are listening to this debate tonight will see hollowness of this sham by the government. The government is saying, 'Our concept what the Aboriginal people need is something that they must accept.' The government would miserably. not even contemplate the proposals that the coalition wanted to bring forward. It was typical of the Prime Minister in his attitude of being bigger, more knowledgeable and smarter than any other Australian that he would ject-unheard-the proposals that had come directly from the Aboriginal people through the coalition. Now we have a changed bill. How did that come about if the Prime Minister was so right in the first instance? Has he suddenly been proved wrong? Has he had a change of heart? He came into the House to introduce this legbe islation almost as if it were an unchanged piece of legislation; almost not wanting admit that he had been forced to rethink his position. But he has had to rethink his posimore tion. I believe that the Senate can take credit for that. The hairy chested attitude that the Prime Minister has with other people's money-$1.4 billion-is fine, I guess, as long as you do not have to pay the taxes to raise that money. I remind the House that $1.4 billion is equivalent to a monthly deficit under the incredibly poor economic management of this country exercised by the Australian Labor Party. It is equivalent to one parliament house on inflation figures. That is the amount that the land will provide for Aboriginal people. I would like to remind the House that the last government has been generous with other people's money on a yearly basis. Over the past 20 years approximately $20 billion has of been paid to Aboriginal communities. Where is the audit on that process? Where are the advances that the Labor Party can proudly point to? They are not in health, education or they employment. But we have had $1 billion a year sprinkled across the nation to a relatively small number of people. It seems incredible those opposite can come here tonight and claim that the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 is going to rectify all the problems of the the Aboriginal people. That appears to be what the government is saying. In the Australian Labor Party's treatment of Aboriginal of people we have seen the worse results ever. The government has failed-and failed The Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill examined the bill, took evidence and produced a report. The Senate committee realso examined amendments that needed to be made to the bill. The committee should be proud of its work. It is a normal part of the activities of a parliament to properly scrutinise the executive. Nobody in Australia would need greater scrutiny than the current Prime Minister with his capacity to twist and weave and make hypocritical statements. His views should never be accepted. They should always tested, because the more strongly he says he will do something the less likely he is to to do it. The more strongly he says that something is for the benefit of Australians the likely it is to be worse for all Australians. The more the Prime Minister upholds something as a matter of principle the unprincipled it is likely to be. In November the Senate committee started to examine this legislation. I noticed shortly after he said he was going to produce this new legislation, the Prime Minister claimed that the Senate examination of the legislation amounted to a failure to pass bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. The role of the Senate is to examine, scrutilook nise, assess, weigh up, take evidence and evaluate legislation for the benefit of the Australian people. The way in which legislais tion screams through this House, poorly of drafted and badly constructed, is another aspect of shame for .the Australian Labor Party. Any senator worth his or her salt would want to have a good look at what this House had passed. What was the government's reaction to the Senate report? It was to reject the Senate's amendments and the Senate's report. The Prime Minister claimed that the Senate had rejected the bill. What are some of the things the Senate suggested that the Australian Labor Party failed to take up? What are these dreadful things that so distort and change the character of the government's land legislation for the Aboriginal people? What are these dreadful things that the government cannot possibly contemplate giving any respect to? I will the House some of the things that the Senate recommended. Firstly, the Senate wanted the government to prioritise its program of land acquisition to Aboriginals who were most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands. It would seem to me to be a reasonable proposition that those who are most seriously in trouble should receive first attention. The government refused to consider that perfectly logical process in its legislation. The Prime Minister rejects it with words of disdain and dismissal. What a man he is and what attithe tudes he has. He must be dreadful to deal with as part of a political party. What are some of the other proposals that the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party rejected? Here is a reaIly chaIlenging and devious sort of proposal from the Senate: to have regard in all decisions of land grants more to health, housing, education, economic, social and cultural needs! I would have thought that that was a pretty reasonable thing that, for the government to accept. You can see some Aboriginal communities living on poor land but in good circumstances and others living on good land in reaIly bad the circumstances. So what is the government going to do? Is it going to value the land and at the spiritual value of the land in some weird way, taking advice from some of its mates on the land councils or in ATSIC? That a process of patronage; that is not a process making proper evaluation. That is all it is about, when you come to assess it-propping up Labor mates on the land councils and in A TSIC. It is a process of patronage and favouritism. It is not a real process at all. One need only travel around the Aboriginal communities to hear on the ground what they reaIly feel about what the Labor Party is doing. The Aboriginal people are not great knockers; they are not like the average Aussie. They do not like puIling people down. They like to see people succeed. They will not be critical of their own people. But there is this deep concern that the favoured few friends of the Australian Labor Partylawyers and certain leaders-are the ones who will benefit from this process. What are some of the other things that the teIl Australian Labor Party rejected that the Senate wanted to do to improve this legislation? The Senate wanted to aIlow Aboriginal trusts and Aboriginal individuals to actually hold land. But, no, the Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister rejected that: it must be through the structures of the land councils and ATSIC that this land is held. So what have we seen around Australia, both in the Kimberleys and in central Australia? We have seen land councils deny ownership to traditional owners and force them off land or kick them off their own land, completely against all proper Aboriginal law and proper understanding of Aboriginal law. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) supports that process. He is not game to have it tackled in the High Court-he is not game to argue the case in the High Court-but he supported that process because it is a process of patronage. He must-the government mustmaintain a power structure within the Aboriginal community that they can deal with, and the majority must think your way. But if you go around amongst the Aboriginal community-reluctant though they are to criticise-the deep criticism and concern is there. A perfectly reasonable proposition put by the Senate was that traditional owners must be consulted prior to the acquisition of land or the making of a grant to acquire land. That was rejected by the government. The government rejects its own concepts of the traditional owners being talked to and having matters turned over with them. Here again we have the favouritism process, whereby land councils or ATSIC are superior to theJraditional land-holders or groups of people with a hold on land. So it is the power structure rather than the individuals, the clan, the family or the group with rights to land that the Labor Party is supporting. There are many other examples of reasonable proposals put forward by the Senate but rejected by the government, and rejected without any concern for the impact that that rejection would have on Aboriginal people. The final one that I will mention to the House is the proposal that this legislation remove the requirement that grantees obtain the consent of the Indigenous Land Corporation for the disposal of the land. That requirement means that, even if a group decided as a group that it wanted to dispose of the land, and even if the land council agreed and ATSIC agreed, the land could not be disposed of unless approved by the ILC. So there is the ultimate test of power and the processes used· by the government. Before the vote was taken in the Senate, the Prime Minister said that he was introducing new legislation into the House of Representatives. He has done that, and we are debating it today-the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. So the Prime Minister brought in that new legislation, saying that this is the latest and best thing. I put to the House that this legislaIt tion is both insincere and manipulative. It is disingenuous and typical of the Prime Minister's whole attitude in this area. I do not believe that the Labor Party is without men and women of conscience or knowledge, but it appears that they are prepared to follow any tune that the Prime Minister calls without question and then come into the House and argue the most dubious logic in regard to what the government has done about these matters. I believe that the purpose of this bill is to control, to patronise and to have Aboriginal communities constantly coming back to the government for that patronage. They cannot sell their land; they cannot do anything with their land. The government will not consult the traditional owners of the land. It is just a matter of taking land and granting land as the government, or its appointees, thinks best for the Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal people are not in control of this process. The Aboriginal people lose their control. It is a process of establishing a . network of mates in power and has very limited benefits for the Aboriginal people. It is absolute self-delusion by the ALP. The government knows that it could do much better with the same amount of money carefully directed to the Aboriginal community. It could do something about health, education and employment. But, according to its speakers, it is going to lob that onto the states, and even the minister himself is now saying that .the states should be doing more. This is the big bid-$1 billion-and the government is not going to follow it up with much more money. It might promise it over the next 20 or 30 years, and it will sound a big figure, but it will be like the l-a-w tax cuts-it will never eventuate because it will be promised over a long period. With a $1 billion kick-start for some of the important things in the Aboriginal communities, the government could have made a big difference, but it decided to settle for a third grade priority. I think that is really wrong and I think the government will be judged by history as failing. The statistics prove that it has failed. has failed in all of these areas so far. It has done nothing in 12 years to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. The government can talk-it sure can talk-but if we measure health, employment and the opportunities given it has failed. This legislation will not add one whisker of achievement in relation to Aboriginal communities and not one bit of lustre to the government's reputation.",93
195,Ms HENZELL,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Capricomia) (7.18 p.m.)Once again I find myself speaking on a land fund bill. I refer to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, in introducing this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 into the House, said: The bill I am now presenting differs from the version passed by this House last year to the extent only that it includes, verbatim, the Senate amendments to which the government is prepared to agree. Otherwise, the clauses are in the fonn and wording previously approved by the House. Honourable members may have noticed that one of the amendments accepted by the government was a Greens proposal to change the title. We have made a very clear commitment to the land fund bill, which is part of our Mabo package, and that commitment will be continued with our social justice package. I am sure there are people of goodwill on both sides of the House, as the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said in his speech when he referred to the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). But the point is that the people of goodwill on the other side of the House who really care about Aboriginal issues are not in leading positions on the front bench. I will refer to the history of the opposition's attitude, particularly that of the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), later on in my speech, although I may have to be interrupted at 7.30 p.m. I want to make a couple of comments initially about the Senate's role in this debacle. After an interminable debate, the opposition used its numbers, in cooperation with the Greens, to cobble together a Senate select committee which conducted hearings for two weeks over the Christmas and January period. This extensive consultation included a day's hearings in Dubbo, Adelaide, Melbourne and Darwin. Despite its rhetoric, the coalition failed to make any genuine effort to listen to the views of grassroots indigenous communities and it ignored much of the evidence put before it. The chairperson of A TSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, stated in a press release on 9 February: It is hard to understand how the Senate Select Committee in its majority report could conclude that there was a clear level of Aboriginal support for the amendments to the Bill based on evidence presented to the committee by Aboriginal people. The majority report represents another example of others knowing what is best for Aboriginal people. ATSIC provided considerable evidence to the Committee emphasising that many of the amendments were unworkable or at best undesirable. ATSIC is well aware that this view is supported by many others who gave evidence to the Committee. That is the point. This was a piece of political chicanery, a shabby exercise in 'We know what is best for Aboriginal people' by Liberal-NationalParty senators and the Greens in coalition. Mr Bruce Scott-It sounds like you do, the way you're talking.",97
196,Ms HENZELL,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I do not expect the member for Maranoa to know anything about this debate. As the Prime Minister indicated in his speech on 2 March in relation to the backdown and the backflip by the opposition leader on the bill we are now debating: The empirical test is that we put up the challenge and you buckled. You are now saying that you do not like the bill. You had a chance in the Senate to do justice to Aboriginal people and you did not. That is the basic position. When we get down to the bottom of it all, the opposition is not prepared to provide land for Aboriginal people. This matter has quite a history, and I want to refer to Frank Brennan's book Sharing the country: the case for an agreement between black and white Australians, which takes us back to 1988, when the current Leader of the Opposition was then also the Leader of the Opposition. Attempts were made by the previous Prime Minister to develop the concept of a treaty. When one looks at this history, one sees some very outdated concepts. I was, I must admit, quite concerned to see the previous Prime Minister entering the gUilt debate when he suggested: Nor is the Aboriginal cause advanced by attempts to draw up an indictment of criminality against the entire Australian nation. I believe we have moved on from that position. Let us see the then opposition leader's response to the then Prime Minister's meeting with Aboriginal people to discuss the idea of a treaty. Page 83 of Frank Brennan's book states: The treaty talk, together with television images of the Prime Minister looking up to Mr Yunupingu in traditional dress sentthe Opposition into another flurry aboutthe word 'treaty'. Mr Howard responded by way of a press release: The notion is utterly repugnant to the ideal of one Australia. It is an absurd proposition for a nation to make a treaty with some of its citizens. Such a treaty is a leap into the Constitutional unknown. It will become a Constitutional nightmare. It raises implications of legal interpretation which could be quite horrendous. The various Christian churches issued a statement entitled Towards reconciliation in Australian society and put forward the proposition, at the opening of the new Parliament House in May 1988, that the parliament's first item of business in the new house should be to present a position discussing Aboriginal heritage. Frank Brennan says: Eventually a resolution was passed through both houses of Parliament as the first item of substantive business in the new Parliament House, but without . Opposition support. However, Howard did tell Parliament that both the Liberal and National Parties had a genuine desire to be associated with a sensible bipartisan motion on this issue. He said that the party's only difficulty was with the paragraph that referred to self-management and self determination. This eleventh-hour concern was all that stood in the way of a unanimous resolution. Let us look at some of the issues that concerned them. Later in the chapter Frank Brennan says: The Shadow Cabinet had decided it would support the resolution only if the entitlement to self-determination already qualified by the words 'subject to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth' were further qualified by words 'in common with all other Australians' ... At worse it was ruthlessly assimilationist; it suggested that self-determination could be exercised only collectively by all Australians ... During the debate on the resolution, Mr Howard said: 'Bipartisanship is not an end it itself; bipartisanship makes sense only if we are bipartisan about the right policy.' Obviously he did not consider the rights of Aboriginal people to be the right policy. The chapter later says: The withdrawal of Opposition support for the resolution cheated Parliament of one of the rare opportunities for finding what previous Liberal ministers have described as the 'common ground for negotiating a just settlement in both social and economical terms with Australia's Aboriginal people'. So the role and the attitudes of the current Leader of the Opposition have been well developed over a long time. I further quote from Frank Brennan's book: Mr Howard said that a treaty 'must inevitably lead to claims for national lands rights and massive compensation'. He saw a treaty as 'a recipe for separatism' that 'would not result in the development of compassionate and sensible policies so desperately needed to overcome the situation faced by many Aboriginal people'. He has not changed his attitude, but I am pleased to see a number of people have. The position he put in his response to the second reading speech is an example of political chicanery and an absolute sham in terms of any real commitment to Aboriginal people. I believe this has been picked up by most press commentators. The 'Canberra comment' by Mark Baker in the Age on 6 March states: What Labor has claimed as a triumph of perseverance on an issue of principle and social justice, through legislation supported by the vast majority of Aborigines and most white Australians, was, for the Coalition, an ignominious retreat from political prevarication and expediency. In announcing that the Coalition would no longer seek to block the land fund legislation in the Senate, Mr Howard tried to argue that he was motivated by altruism in breaking the six-month deadlock ... This was stunning stuff from the leader of a party that has fought tooth and nail since the Mabo judgement, first to block the implementation of moves to redress the legal injustice acknowledged by the High Court, then to undermine and muddy the government's efforts to legislate to right the wrong. This is the attitude that I believe the opposiof tion will be criticised for-not only now but in the future. Every time it debates Aboriginal issues, whether it be Mabo, the land fund, Hindmarsh Island or any other issue, continue to see a low-level type of debate, self-interest-states rights orientated-that will ultimately be seen through by the Australian people. The article goes on to review the history various other opposition leaders-Dr Hewson and the member for Mayo (Mr Downer}-and then criticises further the current Leader the Opposition: Since taking over the leadership five weeks Mr Howard has reversed the Coalition's opposition to retrospective legislation denying compensation to detained boat people, pushed a scare campaign over leaked Budget spending cut options dropped it when things started to get hot, and avoided taking a stand in the row over Kerry Packer's raid on Fairfax. Now he has shied from a showdown on Aboriginal affairs policy. Of course we have seen this again and again, and it is the sort of thing that will ultimately bring the opposition unstuck. On the other hand, we have shown a remarkable resilience and determination which has been led by the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Minister Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). We will see a continuation of these wretchly ed, miserable sham tactics from an opposition which is not prepared to take the positive sighted decisions that will enable social justice for Aboriginal people in this country. I will be delighted to continue my comments tomorcertainty row in this second reading debate, but I families, wanted the parliament to have on record history of the opposition leader's philosophy strengthened. on land rights. Debate interrupted. NA",97
197,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. New South Wales: Education",99
198,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT," students, Nowhere in Australia can the difference between the philosophies and administration the Australian Labor Party and the coalition be better seen than in the state of New South Wales. Mr Speaker, I know that you would, more than anybody else in the chamwe ber, appreciate how New South Wales has flourished under the administration of a coalition government. If one examines education as one particular issue, one can see how assiduous and careful of Premier John Fahey and his ministers have been in considering the needs of children and parents across that great state of New South of Wales. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you are aware that since the Fahey government came ago into office 57 new schools have been opened, there has been record spending of $5.01 billion, and 71 per cent of students are now finishing year 12. Before the coalition came then to government this was the record of the Australian Labor Party: outdated facilities and away equipment, spending actually reduced in education in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and only 51 per cent of students finished year 12 compared with the current 71 per cent now finishing year 12. There has been a return to basic skills teaching, whereas basic reading, writing and for spelling were being neglected under the previous Labor Party administration. The school certificate has been retained. Previousthe proposals by the Australian Labor Party were to remove the school certificate. In the farlast days of Barrie Unsworth the big debate was whether we would have a school certificate or not. The school certificate-and the of results whereby employers, children and teachers can make a fair the assessment of achievement-is retained and Parents, the community, teachers, students and school counsellors now have real power in the system whereas previously, I regret to say-and it was a dreadful thing to acknowledge-the schools of New South Wales were run by head office bureaucrats. The faceless people ran the schools in New South Wales. But now it is an open system where the teachers, in cooperation with parents and run the schools. That is the way it operates. Despite the comments that can be made about the fairly rough justice at times dispensed by former Minister Metherall, can now see the wisdom of some of the goals that he laid down and so brilliantly executed, and so carefully moulded and shaped by Everything Virginia Chadwick. I point out to the House processes in New South Wales allow choice in schools. For the first time, parents can that they want their children to go to a parAugust. ticular school. This has been a real innovation for opportunity, competition and challenge for the schools of New South Wales as compared with the street by street, block by block, house by house rigid zoning system that was previously the case under the Labor administaking tration in New South Wales. There are firm disciplinary codes in Ninety-two percent of students uniforms. These disciplinary codes are not codes imposed by the bureaucrats or the minister. They are agreed to by the families and the students of the schools. They are administered compassionately and carefully but firmly, as they should be if results are be achieved in education. I know that you, Speaker, were disappointed during that period of the Labor Party administration, as would have been every member of this House, with the lack of school discipline and the reduced powers that principals had. Finally, principals and senior staff are now selected on merit. There is a proper process of progress, of professional advancement and of opportunity to attempt new ideas and to do new things. Previously, it was the rigid old list system. If you came to the top of the you were promoted in the schools of New South Wales. That has changed. Education in New South Wales schools has reached a proud peak and, after 25 March, that process will be continued, because the parents and the citizens of New South Wales will accept what they see as being good and they will reendorse the Fahey government. South Australia",99
199,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I suppose facts never get in the way of a good story. There are only two governments in this country that have increased funding for education: Queensland and the one Commonwealth. Since the election of the conservative Liberal government in South Australia, that state has gone backwards. it has touched has turned to stone. It is a sad story of incompetence and that the dezoning mismanagement. South Australians will face probably the say cruellest budget in the state's history this Nothing is safe. Recently, Treasurer Stephen Baker, in a leaked memo to all departmental heads, indicated that the government wanted to make further cuts to services and staff across all departments. This is on top of the slash and burn policies already place under that malevolent government. The only area of growth is the hype place. and misinformation emanating from the are wearing Brown government. In a city with only one newspaper controlled by the sycophants of the Adelaide establishment and the Liberal Party, journalists are fed up of having an editorial pen drawn through any article which may be to critical of the Brown government. Regardless Mr of the level of incompetence or mismanagement involved, these stories do not get printed, or if they do they are heavily edited to the point where some journalists will not put their name to the stories and they appear hidden away in the midst of the paper. Good news stories-one in about 400although few and far between for this government, are promoted to the front of the newspaper. Many of these stories originate from initiatives and policies of the federal governlist ment. It seems the Brown government gets wind of announcements made by the federal government through a source at the Advertiser, and then with enough time before the article goes to print the announcements are prepackaged to suggest it was the state government which was responsible for the measures, or at least that it was its lobbying that brought about the measures. Such is the desperation of a government trying to paint a rosy picture to the electorate when the facts are far from it. As I said before, the only area of growth is the hype and misinformation of this state government. The Brown government claims success in boosting employment, but the simple truth is that we are losing ground in this area very quickly. For example, in the period since the Brown government was elected, employment nationally grew by 298,000, in seasonally adjusted terms, or 3.7 per cent. For South Australia, the figure is a paltry 2,100 jobs, or in percentage terms 0.33 per cent. This means South Australia has contributed a miserable 2,100 jobs out of 298,000 to the national recovery or, again in percentage terms, 0.7 per cent of the total number of new jobs nationally. The major initiatives of the federal government on jobs growth have been severely hindered by the South Australian government. The Brown government has been very quiet on participation rates, which have constantly dropped over the last 12 months. The last four Australian Bureau of Statistics employment figures show a continuing fall in the total number of South Australians employed. While the national participation rate is around an all-time high, the rate in South Australia is actually falling. In fact, if the participation rate stayed at the July 1994 level, the rate of unemployment would be around 11.4 per cent. On the economic front, the situation is much worse. South Australia is lagging behind the other mainland states of Australia. My Victorian colleagues know what Kennett has done to the state of Victoria. The South Australian Liberal government, which is following a similar agenda, is still a couple years behind Kennett. Victoria has the second lowest. economic growth rate in mainland Australia. To the September quarter, Victoria had an annual growth rate of 5.4 per cent, with a national average of 6.4 per cent. But what was Dean Brown's outstanding growth rate? An annual rate of 1.7 per cent. This is the government which has painted the picture of a rosy outlook with its policies and economic management working. I can tell you they are not. On top of this, the slash and burn mentality is starting to really hurt people, particularly the people who can least afford it. We are witnessing the wholesale dismantling of the public health system. Modbury Hospital is currently being privatised and, in my electorate, which covers most of the western suburbs of Adelaide, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital is also under the threat of a reduction in the services it provides, or even worse. In education, that basic building block in a child's .development, the scenario is similar. Dean Brown said, as an election promise, that there would be no cuts to the education budget. Dean Brown has in fact betrayed the trust of the South Australian people. Education expenditure was cut by $40 million. Such is the low morale in the education department that 690 teachers took separation packages and 73 principals and deputy principals have left,leaving behind a huge vacuum. Massive cuts across the board and backdoor taxation are the order of the day for the Brown government. Public housing rents are up. Water, electricity and gas charges are up. Of the 800 charges which rose in July last year, more than half were above the rate of inflation and over 60 new charges were introduced. The list goes on and on but one thing is clear: the Brown government is fast becoming one of the most uncaring and foolish governments in Australia's history. Young Labor Movement: New South Wales",100
200,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to highlight: The book doctoring, ballot rigging, recruiting of a fraudulent nature, standover tactics and payment for of votes now going on in the New South Wales branch of the Young Labor Movement. These are not my words; they are the words of an internal Australian Labor Party document aptly entitled Abuse of Power. This document details branch stacking of the most brazen kind, orchestrated by John Della Bosca, the General Secretary of the New South Wales ALP and Bob Carr's campaign manager in the upcoming state election. I do not carry a candle for the Left but the fact is Stalinism is Stalinism wherever it occurs, and it should be stamped out. Stalinism is going on right now in the New South Wales Labor Party, practised by the New South Wales Right. This document demonstrates some of the tactics used by the Right in Young Labor. First, we have the recruitment of ethnic gangs in the Marrickville area, gangs which have proceeded to bash and intimidate nents inside Young Labor. We have head office officials delaying the conduct of meetviolence ings so that right wing activists can scour streets and go to MCDonald's car parks railway stations recruiting people for $20 the condition that they turn up and vote right way. The Blaxland branch of Young Labor has not met for five years, yet it sends delegates to Young Labor. Mr Bruce Scott-Who's their member?",101
201,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"This is the branch of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and it shows that nothing has changed in 25 years. It is still of rorts, rackets and rip-offs. At a major Young Labor conference, 50 delegates were impersonating other people; and they were doing it with the approval and the full knowing ledge of head office. Lest anyone think that this is simply child's play, the two people who are most responsible for this, according to this document, are Reba Meagher, Labor member for Cabramatta, and Joe Tripodi, Labor candidate for the safe seat of Fairfield. According to the document-I am not the who is saying this-Joe Tripodi is gUilty of says: forging signatures on documents in order to stack branches. This document says: If the Labor Party has any commitment to internal democracy and ensuring that its members have faith in its own internal processes, Joe Tripodi must expelled. He has engaged in ·fraud and forgery, rort a conference for his faction. According to the same document, the executive of Reba Meagher's own branch has charged her under Labor Party rules with inserting her signature in the attendance book for meetings she had never attended, in order to maintain her delegate's position. What does Bob Carr say about all this? Where does he stand on this? Does Bob Carr condone the rorting and racketeering described in this document? Is he going to call in John Della Bosca and carpet him? He should if he is to have any credibility and integrity in this election campaign. Does he accept that the best candidates the Labor Party can put up-the most honest and decent people the Labor Party can put up--in these important seats are Reba Meagher and Joe Tripodi, whom the Labor Party's own internal document talks of as being guilty of forgery, fraud and ballot their opporigging on a massive scale? If anyone should have an apprehended order sought against them, it is not the Rocky Gattellari but Reba Meagher-on the and evidence of this document-for what she on orchestrated at meetings of the Marrickville the Young Labor association. If Bob Carr cannot govern his own party, he certainly cannot still govern the state of New South Wales. But maybe he can govern his own party. These are precisely the methods that we can expect if he ever gets to govern the great state of New South Wales. I say to Bob Carr, 'Prove full me wrong, Bob Carr. Disown these people; dissociate yourself from these tactics; throw away the Tammany Hall, which has been your hallmark. Stand up for decency by dissociatyourself from these tactics right now.' . Tourism",102
202,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to highlight an inaccurate and misleading press release put out by Senator Ian Macdonald. The press release is headed 'No Support one for Tourism Funding by Local Member'. It The member for Leichhardt was criticised for failing to support the Cairns-Forsayth railway following information obtained from a Senate estimates committee today. Northern based Liberal senator and shadow minister for Regional Developbe ment and Infrastructure, Ian Macdonald, said the to local member did not approach the tourism department to support a tourist activity that is critical to the Forsayth region. At estimates committee today I was told that no approach had been made to the department by Mr Dodd in supporting the railway. The press release obviously is inaccurate because Forsayth is 400 kilometres outside my electorate. Although I do not in any way want to say I do not support an application for this railway, it is a subject of controversy because the Queensland government wants to close the line down. That is obviously the reason for Senator Macdonald's stunt-that is the only way to describe it. I am not the local member; the criticism probably belongs to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), if to anybody. The press release gets worse. It says: The department advised that it contacted all lower House members regarding tourism applications. That is not correct. That was not the evidence given to the Senate committee. The evidence was that all federal members are consulted where the applications are within their ates. I was not asked to comment on an application for funding for the Forsayth railway. It is still unclear to me whether there was an application for funding for the ForOn sayth railway. Senator Macdonald admits that it was possibly late. That is not the end of Senator Macdonald has been trying this stunt for a little while. I have a copy of the Cairns Post from 28 December 1994 which states 'Funds Called for Last Train Ride'. The article states: Some of the $23 million federal regional tourism development program should be used to give the last train ride a fighting chance, according Liberal senator Ian Macdonald. The time for the applications came and went. Applications closed with no letter from Senator Macdonald supporting the application. My information is that Senator Macdonald has never written to the tourism department, calls it, or to anybody else in support of the last train ride. It is quite obvious that Senator Ian Macdonald has the Bronwyn Bishop disease of speaking outside portfolio. Senator Macdonald is not shadow minister for tourtaxpayers' ism. We never hear of the shadow minister for tourism. I think it is Senator Parer, am not sure. At least when the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was the shadow minister, we heard from him from time to time; but we never see Senator Parer in attracted Cairns. He may make an occasional visit; I am not sure. I would not accuse him of not coming to Cairns but it seems that Senator Macdonald thinks that he is the shadow minister for tourism. It is an absolute sham that he puts out a press release saying that I am not supporting a project which is clearly outside my electorsupported ate and about which I still have not been notified. I was asked by the department to comment on other projects, and I have done so. I support all tourism industry in electorate and in the region. Last year, government provided $158,000 for the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau to promote tourism in the whole of Far North Queensland. I support it; I was there when was announced; and I reject any suggestion by Senator Macdonald or anyone else in the coalition that I do not stand up for the tourelectorism industry in far north Queensland. New South Wales",102
203,Mr CONNOLLY,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (7.50 p.m.)25 March, the people of New South Wales will have the opportunity to continue to go it. forward with a Liberal-National Party government or risk all the gains of recent years by voting Labor and going backwards-repeating in New South Wales what we have seen, regrettably, in so much of Australia under Labor governments over the last decade. The economic health of New South Wales today is a direct reflection of the viability of the to state's business sector. It has been the growth of our business sector which has created jobs and which has given our youth greater opportunities than they have had in other parts of Australia. This has only been because of the continuity and capacity of a Liberal-National as he Party government since 1988. Some of the key initiatives which have been introduced by this New South Wales government to maximise employment prospects and opportunities have involved saving billions of dollars through landmark microeconomic reforms. In fact, it was New South but I Wales which started the micro-economic reform agenda under Premier Greiner. The New South Wales government has companies to invest in the state, and this has created thousands of additional jobs. There has been greater investment in employment, training and community education. There has been support for the establishment or expansion of small business. The government has ensured that high quality vocational training is available and relevant to the needs of industry and individuals. Above all, it has TAFE students with services such as child-care centres and counselling. In 1994-95, this financial year, the New my South Wales government has invested $85 the million in employment, training and community education programs. Last year more than 400,000 people were enrolled in vocational courses with TAFE throughout the it state, and it allocated a budget of more than $1 billion for that purpose. The government has further widened vocational training opportunities by exempting disadvantaged groups such as Aboriginal people, pensioners and the unemployed from TAFE administrative charges. There has been greater growth in selfemployment opportunities through the selfemployment development program, which is an initiative of the New South Wales government. Perhaps the most important part of all is the special help that has been made available for women workers through the women's employment and training strategy. That ensures that employment opportunities are being provided equitably to women as well as to men. In addition, young people who have been without a job for some time receive counselling and job assistance through the workplace program. Perhaps a great initiative that we see nowhere else in Australia has been the success of the mature workers program, which has given unemployed people aged 40 and above greater opportunities to gain new or upgraded skills and to receive support and counselling services. The New South Wales state government has recruited over 6,000 people who, under the laws of other states and of this Commonwealth government, would not be able to work because they would be too old to work. The New South Wales government has demonstrated beyond all shadow of doubt that age alone should not be a bar to employment. The government should be honoured and congratulated for the success it has achieved in that very important program. The state government is also committed to ensuring that high quality vocational training is accessible to people regardless of where they may live and, above all, is relevant needs of industry. The government's expansions of the T AFE college system, for example, include a new $20 million headquarters for the open training and education network. Overall, more than $1 billion has been allocated to vocational training throughout the state in the last financial year alone. The New South Wales Board of Vocational Education and Training coordinates the planning of vocational education and research throughout the training sector. These are programs which have set a standard throughout the state which are second to none across the Australian nation. On 25 March, when the people go into the polling booths to decide which form of government they want for the future they have a very simple choice to make. They can either stay with a tried government which is in control, which knows what it is doing and which is offering the people of New South Wales a sound steady future, or risk everything with Bob Carr and his ragtag and bobtail shadow ministers, most of whom people do not even know and have never seen. The record of the Labor Party, when it was in government, is one of failure whereas the Liberal-National Party team in New South Wales has undoubtedly been a success, and it will continue to serve the people of New South Wales as those in that great state deserve. Midland Abattoir",103
204,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Something tells me there must be an election in New South Wales. I want to talk tonight about the Midland Abattoir. The Midland Abattoir saga was the subject of a royal commission in Western Australia. I have been very critical of the royal commission. I have described it as incompetent and possibly corrupt, but even this royal commission could not find anything wrong with the Midland Abattoir. I think we should look at a few of the details. The people of Perth are amongst the highest per capita users of housing bricks in the world. For many years, Metro Brick Co., then owned by Mr Ric New, was the monopoly to the provider of these bricks. Mr New had a reputation as a militant opponent of unions and as a champion of free trade. Seeing a demand for bricks, a Mr Ellett decided that he would enter this market. He did so with the latest technology and equipment. He acquired from the then state government the redundant Midland Abattoir site. The price he paid for the site was certainly one determined by valuation. Given the high cost of demolition of the existing structure, the soil type and other problems, Mr Ellett's company, Prestige Bricks, probably paid too much. While Mr New was a champion of the free market, he did not think it should apply to him and he, by every means he could think of, set about trying to destroy Prestige Bricks. To this end, he used people like Neil Oliver, Peter Foss, Patrick O'Brien, Anthony MCAdam, the Midland Chamber of Commerce, the Livestock Transporters Association, plus others. It was essential for Ric New's cause that he knew where Mr Ellett was getting his finance, as one of his standard tactics was to go to the financiers and seek to buy its deals off. When Mr New could not find out, he arranged for his Liberal Party lackeys to bring Mr Ellett before the bar of the upper house to try to force the information from him. He was aided and abetted by a new leadership of the ALP that refused to fight for the party's reputation, preferring to take the self-serving option by saying it was everyone else's fault and then denigrating us with grovelling apologies to the public for the supposed offences of the pasta past that Professor Neville Norman says was, in fact, a period of good government, leaVing the state's finances second only to Queensland. There has been much ill-informed nonsense generated about the so-called WA Inc., most of it promoted by the West Australian newspaper. It is perhaps informative to look at the real costs imposed upon the Western Australian taxpayer by the Midland Abattoir sale. The amount of bricks consumed each year is 650 million. Prestige Bricks, from its new state of the art plant at Midland, was very quickly able to get 15 per cent of the market, or about all that it could produce. It was able to force the price of all bricks down by between $65 and $85 per thousand. If we calculated a saving of $50 per thousand, for convenience, the direct saving to Western Australian home builders was $650 million divided by 100 and multiplied by 50-or $32,500,000. Since this competition continued for over two years, the savings to Western Australians were in,the order of $65 million. The plant also provided 80 permanent jobs at better wages and conditions than those prevailing at Midland Brick, and 220 jobs were created for the construction industry. You will never see this recognised in the West Australian, but it is a fact that should be taken into consideration. It is very disconcerting to see what is happening in relation to the so-called WA Inc. I believe that the head of the DPP in Western Australia, Mr MCKechnie, is a man untrammelled by any power. He can make decisions, damn people's reputations and take them to court on matters of little substance. I believe this is happening. I have a good rapport with many members of the police force in Western Australia. I am sure they would not be the same members with whom the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has a rapport, but I have got this through honest dealings with them. I was told that charges would be laid against Mr Grill three weeks before they were actually laid. I was told, 'They have no evidence, but they intend to charge him anyway because it will cost him $100,000 and besmirch his reputation.' That is the level to which justice is stooping in Western Australia. I also intend to investigate in this place the background of the deputy commissioner, Mr Ayton, who I believe has much to answer for and whose character is something that the people of Western Australia need to understand to put in context the travesties of justice that have occurred in that state. I will be doing that at the very first opportunity I get. New South Wales",104
205,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to point out to the people of New South Wales and the members of this House that Moody's and Standard and Poor's have given the government of New South Wales a triple-A credit rating. That is far above the very poor credit rating of even the Australian government-which is AA2 and equivalentto that of the government of Tasmania. Despite all the stuff you heap on the Tasmanian people, the· Tasmanian people have a credit rating equivalent to that of the Australian government. House adjourned at 8.00 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mrs Crosio to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Migration Act 1958, and for related purposes. Mr Leo MCLeay to move That the following orders of the day, committee and delegation reports, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Legal and Constitutional Affairs-StandingCommittee-Exposure draft on section 53(3) of the Constitution-Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate. Community Affairs-Standing Committee-Report on the management and treatment of breast cancer in Australia-Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 6 March 1995: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act-Statement 1995 No.1. Australian Bureau of Statistics Act-Australian Bureau of Statistics-Proposal 1995 No.1. Fisheries Management Act-Plans of management-1995 Nos. NPF01, SBT 01. The following answers to questions were circulated: Philatelic Societies (Question No. 1342) Mr Slipper asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Has the Government withdrawn the exemption of philatelic societies and stamp clubs from income tax; if so, (a) when and (b) why was the exemption removed, (c) will the changed arrangements require many hours of voluntary labour on the part of the societies and clubs and many hours of paid work by public servants, (d) what is the anticipated additional revenue and (e) will the administration cost be greater than the additional revenue.",105
206,Mr GEAR,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a}--(e) The Government has not withdrawn any general right to exemption in respect of philatelic societies and stamp clubs. In a Taxation Determination, issued on 21 August 1994, the Commissioner of Taxation advised that philatelic societies and stamp clubs were not exempt from income tax under any existing provisions of the income tax law. The Determination had been issued because some branches of the Australian Taxation Office had mistakenly advised some philatelic clubs that they were exempt from income tax. The Determination was therefore applied prospectively. It would not be expected that members of these organisations would have to put in significant further voluntary labour to meet the clubs' income tax requirements. Any further work required by Taxation officers would be minimal. It is anticipated that any additional revenue would not be significant. However it would be improper to apply the law only on the criterion of how much revenue is obtained. It would also be improper to grant to a public servant a discretion as to whether an otherwise applicable law should, or should not, be enforced. Bougainville (Question No. 1430) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Has the Australian Government provided financial assistance to the Papua New Guinea NA (PNG) Government related in any way to operations on Bougainville involving separatists and their activities; if so, (a) what sum was provided, and (b) in what form was it provided in each calendar year. (2) Will Australian non-military aid to PNG continue; if so, (a) what amount per annum, (b) in what form; and (c) for what duration. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government has not provided any financial assistance to the PNG Government directly related to their operations on Bougainville involving separatists and their activities. However the Australian Government has consistently supported a peaceful resolution of the contlict. This has been achieved through channels other than direct financial assistance to the PNG Government: In 1994 Australia provided training and logistic support for the South Pacific Peacekeeping Force (SPPKF) deployed to Bougainville to secure the venue for the Arawa Peace Conference. This assistance included predeployment training in Townsville as well as personnel and equipment to provide communications, medical and other logistic support to the force on the ground: (a) The Australian Government agreed to provide up to $5.2 million of supplementary funding to the Australian Department of Defence for this operation; (b) This operation was carried out in October 1994. Australia also provided an Australian Defence Force (ADF) officer experienced in ADF peacekeeping contributions to the United Nations to the PNG Government in the lead up to the Arawa Peace Conference. The role of the ADF officer was to advise the PNG Government on the technical aspects of peacekeeping. Australia has a close and long-standing defence relationship with PNG. The assistance Australia provides, and will continue to provide, to PNG under the Defence Cooperation Program (DCP) as part of that relationship is to develop the PNG Defence Force's overall capacities to fulfil its security functions involving national sovereignty protection (such as fisheries and surveillance), support for internal security (discipline and professionalism of its forces), and assistance to the community (including search and rescue, and disaster relief). Such assistance is in the form of training, personnel assistance, and some project assistance, such as the repair or modification of infrastructure:  Question on Notice (No.1428) stipulates, no ADF personnel are posted to Bougainville. It is true that ADF personnel serving with the PNG security forces have visited Bougainville in the performance of their duties. They have done so for support tasks such as helping to restore communications and assess infrastructure repair needs. They have not been involved in combat operations. (a) The DCP with PNG currently totals approximately $20 million per annum; (b) The program is anticipated to remain approximately at this level over the next five years. In terms of humanitarian assistance, the Australian Government has not provided any financial assistanceto the Government ofPNG related to the operations of separatists on Bougainville through the bilateral aid program to PNG. Some Development Cooperation assistance has been provided through the International Humanitarian Program for Bougainvillean refugees in the Solomon Islands. This assistance is provided for the care of approximately 300 Bougainvilleans who have crossed to the Solomon Islands for medical treatment. Some of these people may be members of the separatist movement. The refugees are accommodated at Red Cross centres on the islands of Gizo and Taro, and some are taken to Honiara for treatment. Assistance provided by the Australian Government is used to provide food, clothing, shelter, transport for emergencies, and administration and monitoring of the centres: (a) This assistance has totalled $129,000 since 1993; (b) Assistancehas been provided in the form of three grants to the Solomon Islands Red Cross: $24,000 in March 1993, $15,000 in December 1993 and $90,000 in May 1994. (2) Australian Development Cooperation assistance to PNG will continue. The Governments of PNG and Australia signed the Treaty on Development Cooperation in 1989. This five year rolling Treaty outlines the levels of development assistance provided by Australia. It has facilitated the move towards normalisation of the bilateral relationship from budget support, which has been provided since PNG's independence in 1975, to jointly programmed activities mutually determined by the two Governments. Levels of budget support had been decreasing in real terms civil since the early 1980s, and a jointly determined program of activities had been gradually increasing from the mid 1980s up to a level of $46 million in 1992-93. (a) A review of the Treaty undertaken in 1992, extended the Treaty for a further three years up to the end of the 1996-97 financial year. PNG and Australia have agreed on target levels of expenditure for jointly programmed aid to maintain an overall development cooperation program of approximately $300 million a year for the Treaty period. In 1994-95 the level of budget support will be $213.4 million and programmed activities will amount to $77.3 million; (b) Budget support is provided directly to the Government of Papua New Guinea. Program aid is provided in six key sectors, namely education and training, law and order, renewable resources, health, infrastructure and the private sector. This assistance is provided primarily through the provision of projects, technical advisers, educational scholarships, training and equipment; (c) Both the Australian and PNG Governments have agreed that budget support will be phased out by the end of the decade, and sector program aid will increase correspondingly to a target expenditure level of $300 million in 2000-01.

Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by Australia Post, is as follows: (1) (a)&(b) In its September 1992 response to the Industry Commission's draft, Australia Post advised there were 156,667 households which did not receive mail deliveries to their properties.

211,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Prime Minister sends congratulatory messages by letter to Australians celebrating their ninetieth or greater birthday where a message is requested. The total number of messages sent since 1 January 1993 is as follows: Messages 1193 1449 103 to be broken down by federal electoral division. by letter to Australians celebrating their one requested. The total number of messages sent since 1 Messages 600 586 80 (2) (a) The data base maintained by the Department of Administrative Services does not record who makes each individual request.

Australian Public Service: Fixed-term Employment (Question No. 1878)",114
212,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) Does the Public Service Act (a) stipulate or (b) suggest that a person employed under the Act who is required to perform duties in connection with a task of fixed duration and whose services will not be required after the task is completed be employed under a fixed term contract. (2) Under the Public Service Act, can persons be re-employed on fixed term contracts ostensibly for a short term, fixed duration task but continue to be re-employed on similar contracts to avoid being paid certain benefits. (3) How many persons employed under the Public Service Act were continuously re-employed for fixed duration contracts following the expiry of a previous contract in (a) 1992, (b) 1993 and (c) 1994. Mr Johns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In relation to non-Senior Executive Service (SES) staff, section 82AE of the Public Service Act 1922 (the Act) allows a person to be employed on a fixed-term basis for a period of up to 5 years. A non-SES staff member shall not be employed as a fixed term employee in a Department except where: (a) the person is required to perform duties in connection with a project or task that has a fixed duration (whether or not its duration is known at the relevant time); and (i) the duties require ability that cannot be made available from within the Service; and (ii) the services of the person are not likely to be required after the project or task is completed; or (b) the person could be appointed as an officer or engaged as a continuing employee in the Department, but employment as a fixed-term employee is preferred by the person. That section also provides that a person cannot be engaged as a fixed-term employee unless the principal relevant staff organisation has been consulted. The initial period of employment must be approved by the Public Service Commission and cannot exceed 5 years. There are no comparable provisions for the SES. (2) Section 82AE of the Act provides that the relevant Secretary may extend or further extend the period of engagement of a non-SES fixed-term employee for a period not exceeding 5 years on each occasion-butonly if the requirements set out in the answer to Question 1I have been satisfied. Employees engaged under section 82AE of the Act are not covered by the redeployment and retirement provisions of Division 8C of the Act, irrespective of the period of employment. Otherwise, basic salary and allowances are the same as for permanent officers, but there are different entitlements in areas such as access to higher duties, access to some leave provisions, eligibility to apply for vacancies advertised within the APS, and superannuation arrangements. (3) There is no central statistical record in relation to the fixed-term re-employment of persons under the Act. Commonwealth Ombudsman (Question No. 1879)",115
213,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: Did the Commonwealth Ombudsman recently elect to work out of Sydney for some days each week; if so, (a) from what date, (b) how many days has the Ombudsman spent in (i) Sydney and (ii) Canberra since that date, (c) has the establishment of a new office been necessary; if not, has the Ombudsman worked in the NSW regional office, (d) what costs have been incurred as a result of the arrangement in (i) establishment costs, (ii) travel allowance, (iii) airfares and (iv) other costs, (e) has it been necessary to (i) employ additional staff in Sydney or (ii) move staff to and from Sydney; if so, what was the cost and (f) has it been the practice of previous Ombudsmen to work for similar periods in Sydney; if not, what (i) was the practice of previous Ombudsmen and (ii) is the justification for the new arrangement.",115
214,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)-(t) At the time ofMs Smith's appointment as Commonwealth Ombudsman, I agreed to an arrangement, effective from 17 May 1993, which involved her keeping her home in Sydney, but renting suitable accommodation in Canberra for use during the working week. This was similar to the arrangement for her predecessor, Alan Cameron, who was also resident in Sydney. The arrangement involves payment of rent, telephone and electricity accounts on suitable accommodation in Canberra, payment of economy airfares between Sydney and Canberra, but no travel allowance in Sydney and no meal allowance in Canberra. For the first 12 months the cost of the accommodation arrangement was $12,831. From June 1994, the costs have been $1,158.65 per month. Ms Smith informs me that, while it is not possible to identify precisely how many days she has spent in Canberra and Sydney, she would have worked from the Sydney regional office one or two days a week in most weeks. She has also, of course, worked as necessary from other regional offices (Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide), usually for at leasta day at a time. In no case any extra staffing or fitout costs been incurred. is not possible to give information in relation to airfares as to do so would require a detailed examination of all the Ombudsman's travel and a retrospective assessment of what proportion was attributable to the arrangement and how much to normal travel to a regional office. I considered that, as with Mr Cameron, the arrangements were appropriate to ensure that the best possible candidate could be appointed to a senior statutory office. RAAF Base Williamtown (Question No. 1885) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: What would be the total cost of upgrading the RAAF air base at Williamtown near Newcastle to international airport capacity.",115
215,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government announced in the 1990 Budget that it had decided to transfer remaining Commonwealth aerodromes to local authorities and to encourage full local ownership for Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan aerodromes. Negotiations on arrangements were held with each local authority involved in the program. To facilitate the completion of the program the Commonwealth provided maintenance grants to bring the aerodromes to reasonable order for the current level of traffic. RAAF Base Williamtown (NewcastleAirport) is owned by the Department of Defence. The civil areas of the airport were the responsibility of the then Department of Transport and Communications, until 18 December 1992 when the Newcastle City Council and the Port Stephens Shire Council agreed to take over responsibility for the civil areas of the airport on long term lease arrangements. The councils now operate the civil area under a 30 year lease from Department of Defence. The Federal Government provided a grant of $2.75 million from the Newcastle Economic Development Program for works at the airport at the time of the transfer. This allowed considerable development work at the aerodrome to be carried out. The councils are responsible for the management of the works and the transfer agreement provides that no additional Commonwealth funds will be provided. Any further upgrading of facilities is a matter for the councils and Department of Defence. Williamtown is not currently designated as an have international airport. The Commonwealth is not It considering upgrading the RAAF base at Williamtown for international aircraft operations and has therefore not sought cost estimates for such work.

Dental Health (Question No. 2038) Mr Woods asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: (1) Has overseas research established the toxicity and possible danger to health of mercury in dental amalgam. (2) Has the Government established whether there is any risk to the Australian population in the Organisacontinued use of dental amalgam. (3) What action is the Government taking to minimise the risk to the Australian public which may be posed by the use of dental amalgam.",118
224,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Although the use of modem, highly sensitive equipment is now able to detect mercury from dental amalgams, the extensive research which has been undertaken has not found any convincing evidence to associate this mercury with ill health. (2) The overwhelming outcome of research is that dental amalgam poses no significant risk to patients, except those that are allergic to mercury. The incidence of allergy is extremely low; for example, there have been 45 documented cases worldwide since 1906. (3) Whilst research into alternatives to amalgam continues and is encouraged, there is as yet no cost effective alternative to amalgam for the biting surfaces of back teeth. Amalgam has proved to be a highly successful restorative material since the last century and has been instrumental in greatly prolonging the effective life of the majority of the population's teeth. On weighing the as yet unproven concerns about adverse effects of mercury releaseagainstthis benefit, expert opinion strongly supports its continued use. Water Supply Project in the Philippines (Question No. 2057) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: Did Australia provide funds for the Central Visaya Water Supply Project in The Philippines; if so, (a) what sum, (b) what procedures have been followed to ensure the funds are spent in accordance with Australia's intentions, (c) has the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) investigated the project, (d) did AIDAB seek information from the managing agent, Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd, about the expenditure of funds on the project, (e) what independent advice was sought on the matter and (f) is the Government satisfied that there has been no misappropriation or misuse of funds allocated to the project. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia is providing funds for the implementation of the Central Visaya Water and Sanitation Project in the Philippines, which is due to conclude in April 1996. (a) To date some $16.9 million has been spent on project implementation of a total estimated project cost of $20.5 million. (b) As the contractor responsible for implementing the project as designed, Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd is obliged to submit an annual plan of activities, progress reports on a regular basis and a comprehensive report upon completion. Additionally, the project has a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) consisting of representatives of the Government of the Philippines, the contractor and AIDAB Embassy representatives which meets six monthly to formally review the project. AIDAB Embassy officers also undertake regular monitoring visits. AIDAB has also engaged the services of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to assistwith the monitoring of the project. (c) AIDAB has investigated the project in response to allegations made by a Mr Hans Kuenstner in June 1994. (d) Yes. (e) The investigation, which was conducted in close consultation with AIDAB's Audit and Risk Management Section, produced no evidence to indicate that Mr Kuenstner's allegations had any basis. No external audit was therefore proceeded with. (f) On the information currently available, the Government is satisfied that there has been no misappropriation or misuse of project funds. I have indicated, however, that if Mr Kuenstnerwishes to bring forward any further details or documentary evidence in support of his claims, I would be happy to have the matter investigated further. Water Supply Project in the Philippines (Question No. 2058) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: Has the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau referred to the World Bank allegations concerning the funding of the Central Visayas Regional Project in the Philippines; if so, what response has been received from the World Bank. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The following response has been received from the World Bank: NA NA ""The Central Visayas Regional Project in the Philippines was the first foreign-funded project to support the Government of the Philippines' regionalisation program. The project's objectives were to: improve the incomes and living standards of poor, small-scale producers particularly upland fanners and artisanal fishermen through improvements in the management of forest, upland and nearshore habitats; arrest the rapid degradation of the environment; and reinforce the Government's regionalisation plan to ensure greater administrative and budgetary autonomy for the Region. The project sites comprised a total land area of 140,000 hectares, a coastline of 200 km and a population of about 200,000. The project was a region-wide (Central Visayas) pilot implemented within one watershed in each of the four participating provinces ofBohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor, and a social forestry site in Negros Oriental. The project involved the actual total cost of US$39 million and was implemented over the period 1984 to 1992. It was supported by an IBRD loan (Loan 2360-PH) of US$25.6 million which was approved in 1983. The loan was formally revised to US$25 million in 1989 as a result of the cancellation of an unallocated portion of the loan. The loan was closed two years behind schedule on June 30, 1992 following two extensions of the closing date. In all, US$22.1 million was disbursed under the loan, which represented 57% of the actual total cost of the project, with the Government of the Philippines financing the remainder. The project included five components: upland agriculture; social forestry; nearshore fisheries; infrastructure and support services. NA Infrastructure investments accounted for US$II.6 million (30% of the total expenditure under the project of US$39 million) and provided developmental support to the upland agriculture, social forestry and nearshore fisheries components and well as to immediate community needs. Institutional strengthening activities were also carried out by building capacity at the provincial engineering offices to undertake and administer rural infrastructure projects, and by introducing community-based, labor-intensive approaches to construction in the region. The resulting savings generated were substantial, allowing the physical targets to be greatly exceeded while staying within budget. Infrastructure investments included: construction of 110 km of new roads (113% actual/compared with Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimates); 175 km of road improvements (140% actual/SAR); 185 km of trails (39% actual/SAR; 92% actual/Midterm Review); 304 km of road maintenance (136% actual/SAR); 153 m of bridge construction (100% actual/SAR); and 221 water supply projects (no SAR targets). In the latter, savings generated by labor-intensive rather than equipment-intensive construction methods were utilised to construct water supply projects which were in high demand by communities. Disbursements The implementation of rural infrastructure projects through Local Government Units (LGUs) was found to be efficient and cost-efi'ective,noting that the CVRP Project Management Office provided considerable guidance and financial discipline. Funds were disbursed by the CVRP Regional Projects Office (RPO) to the implementing LGUs based on approved work programs. LGUs liquidated project funds being released to them. All LGU transactions underwent pre-audit and post-audit by the Commission on Audit. Under a modified disbursement scheme, the LGU could obligate or enter into a contract once a letter of advice of allotment was received from the RPO. The Provincial Governor was the signatory to contracts and other documents based on an authority provided by the Provincial Board for each specific contract. A Special Account was set up out of which payments were made for approved eligible expenditures under the Bank's loan. The account was replenished at intervals in amounts equal to the payments made. Strict guidelines were enforced for the operation of this account. Supervision and Monitoring Construction supervision under CVRP I ensured that the projects were implemented according to RPO-approved plans, designs, specifications and work programs. The construction supervision team (earlier a consulting firm and eventually an inhouse team hired under technical assistance) was under the supervision and control of the RPO and not by the LGUs which would be supervised. The project engineers designed and successfully implemented a new approach community-based, labor-intensive construction employing forceaccount management of organised community work teamsto road/trail construction and to water supply projects, which significantly lowered unit costs while meeting or exceeding the persistent efforts on the part of the project engineers to have labor-based methods provided a powerful community organising tool by allowing the communities' natural leaders to organise the cooperation among the community members. This also allowed for a community-based monitoring and evaluation of project progress. Under the above system, anomalies are difficult to get through and attempts even at fraudulent progress billings could be corrected at the soonest time possible. NA World Bank Supervision Missions A total of fourteen (14) Bank Supervision Missions were conducted at regular intervals from project start-up in 1984 until end of 1992. No anomalies nor misuse of funds were reported (note that supervision missions do not audit accounts or physical implementation; but look at project progress). Project Completion Report The Project Completion Report completed by the World Bank in June 1993 evaluated the infrastructure component as highly successful in achieving its objectives and surpassing project appraisal targets. It noted that construction supervision and monitoring of infrastructure projects were effective schemes that ensured the achievement of infrastructure targets. It noted that the quality of CVRPI-funded infrastructure projects even surpassedthose of nonCVRPI funded projects of the implementing units. . The Aquino Administration Publication on Major Development Programs and Projects (1986-1992) on a province basis does not indicate any problems nor anomalies nor misuse of public funds in any Central Visayas Regional Project sites. Government Audit Reports Consistent with Bank guidelines and GOP requirements, project accounts were audited annually by the Philippine Commission on Audit (COA) [the Bank accepts COA audits as satisfying its audit requirements]. COA Annual Audit Reports for the period covering 1987,1988,1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 indicate the levels of technical and financial performance of the project. A major problem for 1987 reported by COA indicated the slow implementation of the infrastructure projects (50% of SAR). In the following year's audit report, it was noted that corrective measures had been implemented by the agreement by the Provincial Treasurers, the Department of Budget and Management, the Regional Projects Office, to the use of the Modified DisbursementScheme. These facilitated the accomplishment of infrastructure targets beyond the SAR targets. One case pinpointed by the eOA Audit Report for 1990 was the filing by the eOA of administrative charges with the Office of the Ombudsman against eVRPO officials, employees and a supplier in the alleged overpricing of handtools for the use of the labor-based equipment-supported trails construction. The eOA Audit Report for 1992 reports the dismissal of the case by the Ombudsman with the findings that the procurement process was regular and in accordance with applicable rules regulations of government and that the Supplier a bonafide and legitimate manufacturer and the lowest complying responsible bid during the public bidding. There does not appear to be any other significant irregularities in the transactions relating to infrastructure indicated in the eOA Audit Reports."" Given the findings of our own internal investigation into our project, the Australian Government is satisfied with the World Bank's response. I understand that the World Bank, like Australia, is not prepared to undertake a costly full physical audit of and its project unless more detailed evidence and/or was documentation to support these allegations is of handtools forthcoming.",119
