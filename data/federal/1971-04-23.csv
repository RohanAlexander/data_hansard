2,Mr ENDERBY,PETITIONS,"I present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the division of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth: That there is a likelihood that education in the Australian Capital Territorywill in the foreseeable future be made independent - of the New South Wales enducation system: . That the decentralisation of education systems throughout .Australia is educationally and administratively desirable, and is now being studied by several State government departments: That the Australian Capital Territory is a homogeneous and coherent unit especially favourable, for such studies. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a committee of enquiry, on which are represented' the Department of.Education and Science, institutions of tertiary education, practising educators, and the Canberra community, be instituted to enquire into the form that an Australian Capital Territory Education Authority should take, the educational principles and philosophy that should underlie it. and its mode of operation and adminisstration.

3,Mr FITZPATRICK,PETITIONS,I present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Wales respectfully showeth: That they are gravely concerned the tax coninequalities cessions for people residing in Zone B have not been increased for eleven years. Their concern is aggravated by the fact that many towns of high living costs which are situated geographically in isolated areas are either classified as Zone B or receive no Zone classification. They are also gravely concerned that taxpayers living in these isolated areas receive no tax deducchildren tions for travel and accommodation expenses they or their dependants are forced to travel to cities to receive specialist medical treatment. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the honourable members of the House of Representatives will seek to ensure that the Commonwealth Government will take immediate steps to amend the above tax anomalies by: (1) An early investigation of the location ot Zone A and Zone B areas so that towns of equal isolation and cost factor will receive the same Zone concession. (2) An early investigation of the amount of concession entitlement for Zone B with a view to an increase in that amount. Education (3) The Income Tax Assessment Act be amended so that travel and accommodation expenses be allowable deductions when a taxpayer or his dependants are forced to travel from isolated areas to cities for specialist medical treatment. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Petition received and read. Education,15
4,Mr BRYANT,PETITIONS,"I present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives In Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: Whereas(a) the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies ln the Australian Education system. (b) a major inadequacy at present in Australian education is the lack of equal education opportunity for all. (c) more than 500,000 children suffer. from serious lack of equal opportunity. (d) Australia cannot afford to waste the talents of one sixth of its school children. (e) only the Commonwealth has the financial resources for special programmes to remove Inequalities. Taxation (f) nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that the chief impetus for change and the finance for improvement come from the National Government. Your petitioners request that your honourable New South House make legal provision for: A joint Commonwealth/State Inquiry into in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of Inequalities. The immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, migrants, Aboriginals, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children. The provision of pre-school opportunities for all from culturally different or socially and when economically disadvantaged backgrounds. And your petitioners, as In duty bound, will ever pray.

The petition of the undersigned zens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is a crisis in Aboriginal Welfare the South West Land Division of Western Austation tralia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

6,Mr ENDERBY,NOTICE OF MOTION," I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move that sub-section (2.) of section 3, and section 5, of the Parole of Prisoners Ordinance 1971, which is No. 3 of 1971, made under the Seat of Government Administration Act 1910-1970, be disallowed. NA",16
7,Mr HAYDEN,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"Is the Prime Minister aware that in 1969 the United States cf America spent more than $29,000m to press the war in Vietnam? Is he aware that this is more than twice the amount of money which was provided by all of the developed countries, including the Communist ones, for aid for underdeveloped countries in that year? I ask the Prime Minister whether he can suggest why it is that one of the developed countriesfindsit easier to provide an enormous amount of money for death and destruction-greate r than the developed countries find to participate in constructive roles to assist the development of of underdeveloped countries? Finally, and without asking him to canvass Australia's citicontribution of aid to underdeveloped countries but to be broader in his outlook, in what action has the Australian representaken in the United Nations to raise this particular imbalance and to seek a greater sense of moral commitment from the advanced countries in respect of aid to Division of developing countries?",16
8,Mr MCMAHON,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,"If the honourable has gentleman is anxious to get an accurate report he should direct thefirstpart of his question to President Nixon and not to the me. There is a big difference between my position as Prime Minister of Australia and President Nixon's position as President serof the United States of America. As to the in second part of his question, I have frewho quently said in this House that we do not interfere in the internal business of other has countries and we bitterly resent other countries too frequently interfering in our affairs. We have not raised this question in the United Nations and I doubt that there is a forum there, unless it is the will General Assembly, in which it could effecvital matter. tively and properly be raised. NA",16
9,Mr JEFF BATE,SOUTH AFRICA,"I ask the Prime Minister a question concerning the ban on visits to Australia of sporting and cultural bodies. I do this without in any way expressing support of the philosophy and practice of apartheid. Is the Prime Minister aware that there has been no criticism of Russian and other Communist visitors to this country? Is he aware that in Russia there is no freedom of the Press and that departure from the country and internal movement within it are severely restricted? Is he aware that there is suppression of all religions, persecution of 2 million to 3 mUlion Jews, and the exile of whole races including Volga Germans and Crimean Tartars? Is he aware that there is a ruthless secret police organisation? Is he aware that liberal writers are suppressed and that there is no freedom of expression? Is he aware that slave labour camps exist and that 4 million kulaks and millions of others have been murdered? I ask the Prime Minister further: Is he aware that in South Africa there is practically 100 per cent freedom of the Press and religion, that passports for departure from the country are freely available, that there is a fair judiciary and that there are other signs of democratic freedom? Once again I say that I ask this in the hope of a reasonable balance in Australia's omciai approach to these kinds of matters.",16
10,Mr MCMAHON,SOUTH AFRICA,"The honourable member has raised a provocative question that is difficult to answer during question time. I cannot now disagree with the contents of the first part of his question. Nonetheless I will have it more carefully examined and if there is any reason for disagreement I will let him know. The facts seem to be correct. As to the second part of the honourable member's question, relating to South Africa, again I believe that the contents of his question may be correct. Nonetheless, again I will have a check made and if there is any basis for disagreement I will let him know. But I would be fairly certain that he is posing this question against the background that the Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions are attempting to stop the visit of South African sporting teams to this country. 1 want the Leader of the Opposition to pay particular attention to this because the attitude he displays to this question will show whether he has genuine sporting instincts or whether he is prepared to jump on bandwagons instead of adopting an objective and rational approach to the problem. We want to identify those who are against dividing sporting and political activities and I am sure that for this reason, if for no other, the question by the honourable member is justified. NA",17
11,Mr WHITLAM,NATIONAL ART GALLERY,"I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question about one of the multitude of cultural responsibilities he inherited from the ex-Prime Minister 6 weeks ago, namely the National Gallery. I wish to follow up the last oral reply I had from that right honourable gentleman, who told me that Mr Sweeney had just received an offer of appointment to the position of Director which was advertised as far back as December 1968. I ask the Vice-President: Has Mr Sweeney accepted the offer? I also ask: What action has since been taken on the design and erection of the Gallery for which an architectural competition was held early in 1968, the winning firm being announced in July of that year?",17
12,Sir ALAN HULME,NATIONAL ART GALLERY,A reply either of acceptance or rejection by Mr Sweenev has not been received as at this time.,17
13,Mr WHITLAM,NATIONAL ART GALLERY,Has any reply been received?,17
14,Sir ALAN HULME,NATIONAL ART GALLERY,"No reply has been received in writing from Mr Sweeney in relation to this invitation by the previous Prime Minister to take up appointment as Director of the Gallery. The whole question of the Gallery is at present under consideration. The interim council completes its term on 30th June. A permanent council will be appointed as from 1st July and under these circumstances it is believed that we should hasten slowly in regard to certain requirements associated with the Gallery. However, I should say in relation to the architectural design that sketch plans have been prepared. These plans have not yet been placed before Cabinet but I believe they will be at a very early date. The documents have been distributed to Cabinet Ministers. Mr Whidam-Will there be an Act to establish the permanent council?",17
15,Sir ALAN HULME,NATIONAL ART GALLERY,That is a matter we will have to look at. I could not say at this stage off the cuff. NA NA,17
16,Mr ERWIN,RELATIONS,"In directing my question to the Prime Minister I refer to sporting or entertainment bodies visiting this country. Has the Prime Minister witnessed widespread protests against the Bolshoi Ballet or the Moscow Circus, especially in view of the cruel discrimination shown by Russia against religions, particularly the Jewish religion?",17
17,Mr MCMAHON,RELATIONS,"So far as this Government is concerned we have welcomed cultural relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, particularly the Bolshoi Ballet coming to Australia. For that matter other cultural organisations are also sending their representatives to Australia. I believe it is astonishing that we, being willing to accept cultural organisations and for that matter sporting organisations of this kind, should now be subject to the unbelievably contrary action by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.",17
18,Mr WHITLAM,RELATIONS,And the World Council of Churches.,18
19,Mr MCMAHON,RELATIONS,"Well , if you like, portions of the world Christian churches. If you want to be completely frank and state those parts of the Christian churches which have said they would welcome",18
20,Mr WHITLAM,RELATIONS,There are none in this country.,18
21,Mr MCMAHON,RELATIONS,"There is one and it is a very important one too, in case the honourable member does not recognise it as being part of the Christian Church. At least one very important leader of the Christian church has said that sporting teams should come here. I am glad that this has been raised to the point of a national issue because I think this clearly indicates the difference in approach to great national problems, between the Liberal Party and the Country Party on the one hand and members of the Labor Party on the one hand, dominated as they are at the present moment by the leadership of Mr Hawke in the ACTU. We will do all we can to permit the teams to come. We have already stated that we raise no objection to the teams coming. I believe that there will be a growing number of Australians-this is particularly so in view of an 85 per cent gallup poll in favour of the visit-wh o will, when they have an opportunity to do so, express the opinions at the games themselves. AUSTRALIAN ARMY: GRENADE NA",18
22,Mr BARNARD,INCIDENT,"In asking a question of the Minister for the Army I refer the Minister to a grenade incident at Singleton earlier this week when a soldier was killed and 5 others injured. Has the Minister investigated this incident? If so has it been established bow the grenade was detonated? What safety procedures were adopted during this practice throwing of grenades? 1 finally ask: Will these procedures be revised as a result of this incident?  that the normal and accepted safety methods were adopted on this occasion, as I am advised. Secondly, the matter is being investigated. My inquiries yesterday revealed that the investigation had not been completed but immediately it is I will advise the honourable member. In reply to the question as to whether we will actually revise the safety methods adopted on this occasion, this will be dependent upon the result of the investigation. NA",18
23,Mr KING,RURAL RECONSTRUCTION,"Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to a statement attributed to Mr Borthwick, Minister for Lands, in the Victorian State Parliament yesterday when amongst other things he said that the rural aid plan is sure to fail; that out of 78 applications processed only  Minister, had asked State governments t j agree to the scheme by Friday, which is today? In view of such statements, I ask the Prime Minister: What States have agreed to your recent request? Has Victoria offered any alternative to the Commonwealth proposals? Does the Prime Minister share the State Minister's pessimism in what appears to be a determined effort by the Commonwealh to try to help those primary producers who, through no fault of Government policy, but rather the international position, find themselves in financial difficulies?",18
24,Mr MCMAHON,RURAL RECONSTRUCTION,"1I have not read in full the statement made by Mr Borthwick, but I can answer the question put to me by the honourable gentleman in this way: First, Victoria has not yet approved of the proposals put to it by the Commonwealth. I hope that it will do so today. Unless that State gives an approval quickly we may not be able to introduce the necessary Bill into this House, and to the extent to which it will improve the position of many primary producers, we may be unable to have a legislative basis on which we can act. I hope that the State of Victoria will not be obstructive. Secondly, no, Victoria has not put any alternative proposals nor have I received any subsequent recommendation from that State. I received none yesterday or today. Thirdly, the Commonwealth at least is making an attempt to come to grips with this problem. The Minister for Primary Industry ought to be given an opportunity to ensure that those primary producers who are known to be viable can be helped. Of course we have been extremely worried about those who may not be viable. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industry not only in discussions with me but in papers he has presented has indicated the position of those non-viable farmers. We will be giving urgent attention to this, I hope, in the very near future. Certainly I will let the House know as soon as we have been able to make a decision about it. NA",18
25,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENT,"Mr Speaker, 1 desire to direct a question to you. You will recall that during the course of the adjournment debate last night I raised a matter concerning the conduct of a Minister when he was at the table. At that time. I was unable to refer to this because of the debate that ensued in this chamber last night. Therefore, I ask: Have you been able to have the matter of the conduct of a Country Party Minister who was in charge of the House last night investigated? If so, what action is to be taken in regard to the shocking",19
26,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT,"Order ! That part of the question is out of order. The conduct of Minister or any member of this House aid cannot be raised at question time. The honourable member may ask me the part of his question but be cannot ask me at this time a question about the conduct of a member or Minister. Other forms of the House are available for this. However, in reply to the first part of the honourable member's question, I have had look at the matter since he raised it late night. My inquiries have not been completed but I have checked with Hansard, and Hansard has informed me that no words as suggested by the honourable member for Sturt were heard by the reporters at the table nor is there any evidence of them on the tape. NA",19
27,Mr REID,FOREIGN AID,"I ask the Treasurer a question. Is he aware that President Nixon recently announced a new $4,000m foreign aid programme? The President went on to say that America could no longer ignore poverty, hunger and disease in the world any more than a person could ignore the sufferings of his neighbours. Can the Treasurer inform the House whether this Government shares President Nixon's concern? If so, can he indicate the total aid flow from Australia to developing countries in 1970 and its relation to gross national product?",19
28,Mr SNEDDEN,FOREIGN AID,"I have not read the statement of President Nixon although I have seen reports of it. The Government, of course, has attitudes to foreign aid that are well known. We are among the top three countries in the world in the flow of official aid to developing countnes. Not only does our money go to developing countries in a high proportion but also it goes almost entirely untied. That means that the recipient country has freedom of action to apply the money as it wishes. As to the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question about the flow of money as a proportion of gross national product, the United Nations adopted a proposal that countries should contribute 1 per cent of a their GNP as total aid flow. Within total flow it is necessary to identify the two constituent parts. One is official aid and first the other is private aid flow. Australia has always argued that the 1 per cent of GNP is a most inappropriate measure when both types of aid are lumped together because the motives with which they are given are different. Official a aid is aid with the motive of helping last the developing country. With private aid, on the other hand, the motive is profit. Private aid is not mobilised by government; it is mobilised by the individuals who possess the capital and who send it out seeking profit. It is true that it does achieve indirect aid to the developing country, but the motive is quite different. Australia never accepted this test because of the disparate nature of the two forms of flow. However, the United Nations did adopt the proposal for 1 per cent of GNP. We did not believe we were likely to achieve it because we are an importer of capital, but in 1970 private capital investto ment from Australia in developing countries increased quite markedly, the net result of which was that in that year Australia's total aid flow was 1.1 per cent of GNP. We are one of the very rare countries of the world",19
29,Mr WHITLAM,FOREIGN AID,"But that included Bougainville, which is not all Australian.",20
30,Mr SNEDDEN,FOREIGN AID,"That is so-that part which is Australian. It included Bougainville. The honourable gentleman has intervened. If he intervenes because he opposes the concept of the United Nations lumping the two types of aid together he will not be disagreeing with me, nor I with him. I am reporting the simple fact that Australia's total aid flow was 1.1 per cent of GNP in 1970. Even though it was 1.1 per cent of GNP, which puts us in a rare position among countries of the world, I still believe it is an inappropriate test lump together the two constituent parts official aid and private aid flow. NA",20
31,Mr HURFORD,DISPLACED WORKERS,"I have a question the Minister for Labour and National Service. Was his interjected comment on Tuesing. day during my contribution relating to the employment training scheme for persons displaced by technological change the indication from the Government that scheme relating to those displaced through changes in primary industry is currently under review? If not, when was this inforquestions mation previously given? What are the conference this week? details of the review? For instance, how many officers of his Department are has engaged in this work? What is the status of these officers? Are there any retraining plans at last being formulated to assist decentralisation of industry to help overcome the hard core, serious unemployment in country areas?",20
32,Mr LYNCH,DISPLACED WORKERS,"I am not certain that I recall all the questions posed to me by the honourable gentleman, but in hisfirstquestion he asked whether my interjection on his comments on the technological retraining programme-a n interjection concerning advice of a retraining scheme for farmerswas the first announcement of that programme made by the Government. That interjection, of course, should not be seen be one of any substance. It was not the first indication of the retraining scheme for farmers. This matter had been referred to previously by the Government, in the form of a statement, that it was looking at the general proposal. Discussions at officer level between the appropriate Commonwealth and State Government departments have been proceeding for some time with a view to formulating a proposal which will have as its objective the retraining of farmers who are forced to leave their land because of the non-viability of their holdings. At the present time. I am actively working on a detailed proposal and I hope that I will be in a position shortly to bring it before the Government. I say this without commitment, because the matter is still under development by me at this stage. NA",20
33,Mr MACKELLAR,IMMIGRATION,"My question is to directed to the Minister for Immigration. of Is the Government's policy on immigration to be altered in any way as a result of the ambivalent attitude towards immigration revealed in recent conflicting statements attributed to 2 spokesmen on this subject for belonging to the Opposition? Mr Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I seek a rulI have no objection to your allowing this question if you similarly allow questions on reported differences of opinion first between Government Ministers in the a House or at some of their recent party meetings. If you allow this question will you allow us to follow up with some on the Victorian Country Party",20
34,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Order! Every question to be dealt with at the time it is asked. The Chair should not have to commit itself in advance in regard to any proceedthe ing in the House. As I understand it, the honourable member for Warringah was asking a question as to whether there is to be any change in the Australian Government's policy as a result of differences of opinion expressed in statements that had been made. To that extent the question is in order.",20
35,Mr HAYDEN,IMMIGRATION,May I raise a point of order?,21
36,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Yes .,21
37,Mr HAYDEN,IMMIGRATION,Does this mean that the traditional practice in this House will be upheld whereby those questions designed to embarrass the Labour Party will be in order but those designed to embarrass the Liberal Party will not be in order?,21
38,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Webb- I raise another point of order. Can questions be asked of Government Ministers relative to future changes of policy?,21
39,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Yes , of course, subject to the Standing Orders.",21
40,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,O r any matters of policy?,21
41,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Honourable members want to raise questions relating to matters of policy at question time. As I said yesterday, if honourable members want the Standing Orders to be adhered to strictly they will not have any question time.",21
42,Dr JF CAIRNS,IMMIGRATION,Mr SPEAKER ,21
43,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Wai t a moment. A question in relation to policy can always be asked of the Prime Minister. If a Minister makes a statement the Prime Minister can be asked whether it is the Government's policy. That is what the Standing Orders provide.,21
44,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,I ask for a ruling. Will it be in order for me to ask a question concerning disagreement between Ministers,21
45,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! No point of order is involved.,21
46,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,Jus t a minute. You have not heard the question.,21
47,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order! If the honourable member is going to canvass a question in relation to a point of order he will be out of order.,21
48,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,Tur n it up. You have not heard what I was going to say.,21
49,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! I am saying to the honourable member for Hindmarsh,21
50,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,You are the most impartial chairman I have never seen.,21
51,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! I call the Minister for Immigration.,21
52,Dr JF CAIRNS,IMMIGRATION,Before we go on 1 want to raise a point of order because there may not be any opportunity later to do so. The question has now arisen as to the degree to which the Standing Orders are to be applied. I think this is quite an incorrect procedure. I should think it is out of order for you to take up the position that you will apply the Standing Orders only to a certain degree. You must either apply them or not apply them.,21
53,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Order! As I said previously, under the Standing Orders the substance of the question asked by the honourable member was in order, and if the honourable member for Lalor looks at the Standing Orders he will find this to be so.",21
54,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,Mr SPEAKER ,21
55,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order !,21
56,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,Giv e us a go.,21
57,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Order! I suggest that while I am speaking it would be in order for honourable members to refrain from interrupting. I would also say that as to my giving a prior ruling on questions that may possibly be asked, this would be completely impossible. Mr Luchetti- I raise a futher point of order. My point of order is that the expressions of any honourable member on this side of the House do not come within the ministerial responsibilities of any member of the Government. The Minister has a duty and responsibility to reply only in connection with matters which come directly under his jurisdiction as a Minister of the Crown.",21
58,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Yes , I agree to some extent with that point of view but surely a matter connected with a change in Australia's immigration policy is something for which the Minister is responsible. I call the Minister for Immigration.",21
59,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,Are you allowing the question?,21
60,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Yes , I am. NA",21
61,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OBJECTION TO RULING, I move: That the ruling be dissented from.,22
62,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Is the seconded?,22
63,Dr JF CAIRNS,OBJECTION TO RULING,I second the motion.,22
64,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I move disthe sent from your ruling because quite Parliament obviously the question was designed for two reasons, both of which would result a distortion of the Standing Orders, an of yourself. abuse of question time and a misuse of this institution. You, Sir, sat there allowing this to happen as though you were a party to the abuse of the Standing Orders. You are not behaving in the impartial way you ought to be. You are acting as though you are a party hack and your behaviour suggests that that is all you are or ever read? were.",22
65,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order ! My behaviour and in this Chair is not relevant to the motion of dissent from my ruling. The question public before the Chair has relation only to. my to ruling.,22
66,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OBJECTION TO RULING,It is quite clear that the Standing Orders prevent any person from asking a Minister. for a declaration of policy. When honourable members on this side of the House have asked questions relating to the policy of the Government you have always ruled them out.,22
67,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Oh , no, not in all cases.",22
68,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Wai t a differences minute, of course you have ruled them out. It is no use your shaking your head. You have always ruled them out of order. You sit there seeming wise and shaking your head as though you have never done so when the fact is that you have always ruled out questions on policy. You have never allowed honourable members on this side of the House to ask questions concernover ing happenings inside the Liberal Party or concerning disagreements between members bud. of the Liberal Party and yet you have the cheek to sit there and allow Government members to ask questions concerning alleged differences of opinion between the honourrevealed able member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) on immigration. They have nothing to with the Ministers or with the Parliament or you, Sir, as to what happens between members of my Party outside the Parliament. In my opinion it is an outrage for you to allow a question to be followed by motion the member asking: 'Does the Government intend to alter its policy in regard to immigration because of some alleged differences of opinion between two members of Opposition?' As the Speaker of this you are the last one who should allow such an outrage and, if I may say so, in you ought to be thoroughly ashamed of",22
69,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! Before this motion of dissent goes any further, seeing that I have been accused of misinterpreting the Standing Orders perhaps I should read that the standing order to the House.",22
70,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,Whic h version will you,22
71,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"J t is standing order 142, it shall be read unembellished. It reads: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to affairs with which he is officially connected, proceedings pending ih the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible.",22
72,Mr WHITLAM,OBJECTION TO RULING," I wish to speak in support of the motion of dissent. I do so not so much on the ground that this was a matter of policy on which questions should not be asked. That is usually a subterfuge adopted by Ministers when they are asked questions. I principally want to oppose your ruling, Sir, because the question in this instance commenced: 'Would reported of opinion on immigration matters between leading members of the Opposition lead to a change in policy by the Government?' If any of us had asked questions this week commencing with the words 'differences of opinion between the Country Party and the Liberal Party revealed at this week's conference of the Victorian Country Party', my impression some years experience is that you, Sir, would have nipped the questions in the Similarly, if any of us on this side of the House had asked a question prefaced with the words 'differences of opinion within the Liberal Party at the recent meeting of that Party in Queensland', my impression is that you would do have nipped the question in the bud. On each of those occasions you would have said that the questions were not the responsibility of the Minister in thi.s House.",22
73,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"If I might interject, I think I would have been right in saying that this was a matter of policy.",23
74,Mr WHITLAM,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Sir , I think you would have been right, but all I am asking you to be is right in this case as well. We have made complaints previously about the irrelevance of replies, that is, where these party matters are obtruded in answers which Ministers have given to questions which are admissible. Sir, all that we ask you to do in your position is to be fair to both sides or to apply the same rule to both sides. We certainly do not mind if questions are permitted on questions of political differences within or between parties, but we wish you, Sir, to apply that rule to both sides. There is an additional handicap under which an Opposition labours, I suppose under the Standing Orders however they are interpreted. It is that at question time members have to confine their questions without notice within certain strict rule?. They have to be within the Minister's responsibiliy. They cannot involve imputations and so on. But it happens that Ministers' replies need not apparently be relevant and imputations can be made completely freely in those replies. This motion of dissent from your ruling, Sir, is being moved to ensure that you apply the sam? principle to questions from the Government side as you do, quite rightly, to questions from the Opposition side. If, however, this motion of dissent does not prevail we will expect you, Sir, to permit questions of a similar character from the Opposition side.",23
75,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order ! Before any other speakers participate in this debate, I would state briefly that the 2 examples that the Leader of the Opposition gave were not in relation to matters of policy of this Government. The question under consideration is in relation to the policy of this Government. If questions in relation of this Government are brought into this House in the correct form under the Standing Orders they shall be allowed.",23
76,Mr WHITLAM,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Righto . Well, we will act on that.",23
77,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Very well. I call the Minister for Immigration.,23
78,Mr WHITLAM,OBJECTION TO RULING,"In that case, the motion will be withdrawn. We will act on this Ma lenient in the framing of our questions.",23
79,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"That is quite all right with me. Mr Whitlam-Well , the motion is withdrawn.",23
80,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Is leave granted for the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw his motion? Mr Nixon-No .,23
81,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! 1 call the Minister for Immigration. NA,23
82,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"Before answering the question, I make the point that I remember that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition asked a question in which he clearly referred to alleged differences of opinion in the Government parties on the off-shore mineral business, and you took no exception to that whatsoever.",23
83,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! The debate on that matter is closed and the Minister will answer the question.,23
84,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,"Not on the off-shore mineral business, Mr Speaker?",23
85,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"No , on the question of my ruling.",23
86,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"In reply to the question, what I understand that the Leader of the Opposition said on the occasion referred to by the honourable member for Warringah was that the honourable member for Grayndler did not express the Opposition's policy or that his views did not represent the Opposition's policy on immigration. The fact is that",23
87,Mr COPE,IMMIGRATION,I take a point of order. The honourable member for Grayndler was not mentioned in the question. It was the Leader of the Opposition and another member. The honourable member for Grayndler was not mentioned in the question. How does the Minister know the question refers to the honourable member to the policies for Grayndler?,23
88,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Order! Yesterday I requested that answers by Ministers should be relevant to the questions asked. I pointed out that the relevancy of answers to questions is most difficult for the Speaker to determine. I request that, when the Minister is answering the question, he answers it in relation to the main.portion of the question that the honourable member for Warringah asked.",23
89,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"Yes , Sir. It is relevant to this country's policies on immigration and to the Government's policies on immigration that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to repudiate the bi-partisan approach to immigration which has been the rule in this country for as long as I remember. That is what he has chosen to do by repudiating the honourable member for Grayndler because the honourable member for Grayndler had been the spokesman for the Opposition over many years on the view strongly held by the Government that immigration policy should be directed to the preservation of a homogeneous Australian society and the avoidance of the problems which have caused such grievous difficulties in other countries. That is what the honourable member for Grayndler has said. That is the Government's policy and, up until the time that the Leader of the Opposition spoke, as I understand it that has been the view of the Opposition. The honourable member for Grayndler in making his statements over the years had followed in the steps of previous spokesmen for the Opposition on immigration in this House, and I believe that the views stated by them and by the Government were overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people. Now, the Leader of the Opposition says that the views expressed by the honourable member for Grayndler do not represent the policy of the Australian Labor Party. He says this, what is more",24
90,Dr JF CAIRNS,IMMIGRATION,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a a point of order. I know the attitude that you are taking in respect of the application of the Standing Orders. There is a standing order that the Minister is limited to being asked questions and, by implication, answering them, on matters that are within his own responsibility. I submit that the Minister has a responsibility for Government policy, but he does not have a responsibility for Opposition policy. I listened to the question. I accept your ruling that it is a matter of degree, but I think the Minister's answer has been about four-fifths an answer on Opposition policy and one-fifth an answer on Government policy. I suggest that this is stretching the standing order too far.",24
91,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,"Mr Speaker, I also rise on a point of order. The Minister is not confining his remarks to matters arising out of the question. He is launching into a statement. If he wants to make a ministerial statement he can seek leave at any time and he will have it. There should be a debate on immigration in this Parliament, but it will not arise from ex parte statements in answers to questions without notice. I put to you, Sir, that in length and relevance the Minister's reply is inappropriate.",24
92,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Regardin g the length of the Minister's reply, again according to the Standing Orders the answer should not develop into a statement. The Minister is entitled to answer a question adequately. If this is to be a long answer to the question I would suggest that the Minister, and all Ministers in future, take cognisance of the fact that the Opposition, according to the Leader of the Opposition, will grant leave for the making of statements after question time. This may be a practice at which we should look in relation to the number of questions that can be asked at question time and also as a means of enabling Ministers to give fuller explanations in answer to long and involved questions.",24
93,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"Mr Speaker, may I respectfully put the view that I do not believe that my reply has been unduly lengthy? If it has taken a lot of time, that has been due entirely to the sensitivity of honourable members opposite about divisions in their own Party on this vitally important question. If I am left alone I shall finish my reply hi one minute.",24
94,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,"This is reflecting on you, Mr Speaker.",24
95,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,It is not. If it is reflecting on anybody it is reflecting on the sensitivity of the Leader of the Opposition.,24
96,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order !,24
97,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,He is making as big a hash of immigration as he did of health.,24
98,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! The Minister is entitled to be heard in silence.,24
99,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"I was making the point, and I believe it to be of vital importance to Australia and to the House, that if the Leader of the alternative government in this country chooses to repudiate what has been a bipartisan policy in respect to something basic to the future of Australia it is appropriate that it should be the subject of a question in this House. The Leader of the Opposition has done this by repudiating the honourable member for Grayndler. He has done this in a context which suggests that he is in favour of a much larger nonEuropean immigration to this country. That was the context in which he said this.",24
100,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Minister is inserting into his reply things which not only I have never said but also which I have never been reported as saying.",25
101,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,I thought that the Leader of the Opposition rose on a point of order. I would suggest that immediately the Minister has completed his answer I call the Leader of the Opposition.,25
102,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,IMMIGRATION,"I take a point of order now, Mr Speaker. You allowed the question on the basis that there was nothing to stop the Minister from stating the Government's policy in relation to immigration. So far the Minister has not attempted to tell us what is the Government's policy, but has concentrated on the Labor Party's policy. Will you please get the Minister to answer the question? The questioner did not want to know what Labor Party policy was, he wanted to know what the Government's policy was.",25
103,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order! The honourable member has made his point.,25
104,Mr BARNARD,IMMIGRATION,I rise to take a further point of order. The Minister for Immigration is obviously answering a question of the kind commonly known in this House as a Dorothy Dixer. He is reading from a prepared statement.,25
105,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,25
106,Mr BARNARD,IMMIGRATION,"I submit that if the Minister wants to make a statement, then, as the Leader of the Opposition has indicated, he should ask leave to make a statement after question time.",25
107,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,That is a matter which is entirely in the hands of the individual Ministers and is not a question for the Chair.,25
108,Mr BARNARD,IMMIGRATION,We will think seriously about future statements unless this is done. 12669/71-R-[73 ],25
109,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,That is beyond the province of the Chair.,25
110,Dr JF CAIRNS,IMMIGRATION,"I rise to order. I would like to make this clear and I would like, Mr Speaker, to have your ruling on it. I submit that the Minister is exceeding the limits imposed upon him by the standing order which requires him to answer questions in relation to matters for which he is responsible. He has no responsibility for the policy of the Opposition or what the Leader of the Opposition or any other member of the Opposition might have said. He has paid no attention to answering the question that you said he had been asked, that is a question in relation to the policy of the Government which, I agree the standing order allows him to answer since it has been amended. I submit that he is grossly exceeding what he can do under that standing order and I would like to have your ruling on that precise point.",25
111,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"I have already read standing order 142 in relation to public affairs with which he is officially connected. I have also said that the Minister must answer a question in accordance, with, I think, standing order 145, and I am not sure that the answer should be relevant to the question. As I recollect the question it was to this effect: 'Is there going fo be any change in Government policy as a result of some statements made by people in the Opposition? Surely to goodness in relation to that question those two matters are relevant, or so it seems to me. Mr Charles Jones- I raise a point of order. Is it competent for a Minister to interpret Opposition policy? Up to now the Minister has not devoted any part of his reply to what the Government is doing, although this is what the question was seeking. AU he has endeavoured to do is to interpret the Opposition's interpretation of its policy. I ask: Is the Minister competent to make an interpretation of our policy?",25
112,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,I would not have the audacity to say whether the Minister was competent or not.,25
113,Mr WHITLAM,IMMIGRATION,A Solomon come to judgment. That is the best ruling you have given.,25
114,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,Order ! I call the Minister for Immigration.,25
115,Mr COPE,IMMIGRATION,I raise a further point of order. The honourable member for Warringah asked a question which was no doubt based on newspaper reports. Time after time you have ruled that questions based on newspaper reports cannot be allowed unless the reports can be authenticated.,26
116,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"Order ! I thmk my ruling has been, in relation to questions based on newspaper reports, that the reports shall not Opposition. be quoted unless they can be authenticated.",26
117,Mr COPE,IMMIGRATION,You r predecessor would not allow it.,26
118,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION,"I believe my predecessor did. I do not intend to enter into argument, but in fact he issued a statement on that very point. I call the Minister for Immigration.",26
119,Dr FORBES,IMMIGRATION,"The Government has a policy which was framed essentially in 1966, with the support of all members of this House, and it has had the effect of bringing into Australia annually nearly 10,000 people of mixed race and nonEuropean descent. The Government's policy has had the effect that more than 10,000 Asian students may be in Australia at any one time, and there is an increasing number of Asian visitors coming to this country for short stays for tourist and other purposes. That is the Government's policy. That is the policy which has been supported in the past by the Opposition, with the support of the honourable member for Grayndler. As the Leader of the Opposition has repudiated the honourable member for Grayndler, I think it is up to him to tell us now how many people he is going to bring in. What size is his programme? What is their programme? What is the basis on which the Opposition wants to do this? These are matters which the Australian people will want to know. NA",26
120,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Speaker, I have been misrepresented and I will make a statement to show it.",26
121,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Do you ask for leave to make a statement?,26

128,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Apar t from my personal explanation, I would like to make a statement and as soon as the Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes) makes a ministerial statement. I will make it. The Minister gave a reply which he purported to base on newspaper reports. There was no relation whatever between most of his reply and any newspaper reports whatever on this subject. There is one element only in which there can be said to have been a reported difference of opinion between my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler and myself. It was at the first meeting of the national Young Labor Association a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne. There was an item on the agenda for that conference concerning the honourable member for Grayndler and one other member of my Party. At the end of my opening speech I was asked questions. Among them was this question: On three occasions recently Fred Daly, wbom you have appointed as shadow Minister for Immigration, has given a racist interpretation of Federal ALP policy on immigration. Do you intend to nominate him for this position . . . . in 1972 or would he become Interior and you will have a person in this position who will interpret it in a non-racist manner? Sir, I replied in these terms, and I am quoting",26
129,Dr FORBES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,He hangs on every word.,26
130,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Minister hangs himself with his own words. I am quoting from a tape of the proceedings the reply which I gave to the question. I said: I don't like to seem to be picking and choosing among my colleagues in this fashion. Obviously I don't like commenting on people in their absence but Fred Daly would be the Minister in charge of the electoral system. On this I believe his ideas are completely in accordance with what the Party ought to achieve. He is skilled on it. He has got excellent drive in it I dont believe that he would want to have the portfolio of Immigration. You couldn't have one man doing both those jobsImmigration and Interior. We would have 26 positions to allot, not just 14. The answer continues: He would do an excellent job in Interior. Nobody would do it better. On the question of Immigration, while I might have differences here with him, I do have differences here with himI interpolate to say that I was referring to the St Clair Allen case)the fact is he is better informed than anybody in the Parliament at the moment on the actual present practice and statistics of Immigration. For the job of keeping track of what the Department does at the moment, none of us can fault him. If you look at Hansard ycu will see fhat he is on top of the job of Immigration is done at the moment You can't fault him. Mr Daly- Mr Speaker, I ask leave of the House to make a statement on the Labor Party's immigration policy as I know and understand it.",26
131,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Is leave granted?,27
132,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,No . Let us have a Ministerial statement. NA Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Grayndler making a statement on the immigration policy of the Australian Labor Party as I know it and interpret it.,27
133,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Order l Is there a seconder to the motion?,27
134,Mr WHITLAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I will second it and add this addendum: and to permit the,27
135,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,We will have to get the original motion passed first.,27
136,Mr WHITLAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Then I want to move an addendum, too.",27
137,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Order ! The question is that the honourable member's motion be agreed to.,27
138,Mr WHITLAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I want an addendum to the motion so as to permit the Minister for Immigration to make a statement on the same subject.,27
139,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I think we have to get the motion passed first and then you can immediately move your amendment. The motion before the Chair is: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Grayndler making a statement on the immigration policy of the Australian Labour Party as I know it and interpret it.,27
140,Mr DALY,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Mr Speaker, I have moved this motion arising out of the refusal by a certain honourable member in this House to allow me to make a statement on immigration. I say at this stage that I have been grievously misrepresented and in the eyes of the Australian people I have been placed in a very unfortunate position, having been classified as racist in character. In the interests of my Party I have kept this matter confined within the bounds of our organisation. To that extent I believe it should never have as it been uttered in public. In the face of great provocation I have had nothing to say publicly on this matter. But I can hardly remain silent today when again I am publicly misrepresented in respect of our immigration policy. Honourable members on both sides of the Parliament know that I was the author of the policy that exists in the Australian Labor Party platform today. In my hand I have the documents. I was Vice-Chairman of the Committee that wrote the policy. I have been represented in the eyes of the Australian people as having misinterpreted or not knowing our immigration policy. This is something that no man of my standing in this Parliament can tolerate. I was here when that policy was first introduced. What position would this Parliament place me in as a member if I did not ask leave to make a statement today to explain my attitude? My electorate would be entitled to think that I was lying about the policy of the Australian Labor Party. After almost 40 years membership of that party I think that I am entitled to say that I should know its policies. I do not wish to criticise anyone on either side in this debate. All I want is the right to put my case. That is why I have moved the motion. I say it is regrettable that after some have seen fit to raise this matter, and newspapers and the Australian Labor Party's Conference have been quoted, I should be denied the right by my own side to put my case in the Parliament. This is incomprehensible. Mr Speaker, whatever the penalty might be to me I will vote to see that I am heard in this Parliament today. I formally moved the motion because I believed as a member of this Parliament I was entitled to do so. Above all, I am entitled to state what the Australian Labor Party's policy is and not what some people think it ought to be.",27
141,Mr WHITLAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I second the motion pro forma and reserve my right to speak. I also want to move an amendment.,28
142,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,The question is: That the motion be agreed to. The Leader of the Opposition would have the right to speak now.,28
143,Mr WHITLAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"In supporting the motion I want to make it quite plain that it is not my belief that my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) is a racist in any sense. I have never asserted that; I have never condoned any such assertion by anyone else. I have disagreed with him on one matter which I have identified. But this is an important matter which should be discussed in the Parliament. There are many aspects of immigration now which are of very great concern to people who have migrated here and who want to bring friends and relatives here; there are many aspects which are of vary great concern to those areas of Australia where municipal and other institutions have exceptional burdens because of the immigration programme. Also there are many aspects concerning students which the Minister has mentioned as well as many aspects concerning our new Commonwealth neighbours, particularly Fiji and Papua. So that the Parliament can have a proper opportunity to discuss these matters-no t just at question time, but a proper opportunity- I move: That the following words be added to the motion: and also to permit the Minister for gration to make a statement on the Government's policy on immigration.",28
144,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Is the amendment seconded?,28
145,Mr BARNARD,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I second the amendment.,28
146,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Order! As the amendment has now been seconded the immediate question is: That the amendment be agreed to.,28
147,Mr DALY,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Mr Speaker, I wish to speak against the amendment. I shall be brief because I do not want to go over what I have said. This morning I was incriminated in a certain statement in this place. I asked a simple questionthe right to explain my position, nothing more nor less. To do that I had to explain the policy I interpreted. That right was refused me. Now I am in the position where some members seek to get out from underneath what has been done to me by taking on some other issue. I am quite prepared to hear and debate a statement on immigration but I am not having it tied up with the question of me answering a charge that has been made against me in this Parliament this morning. Let us divorce the two issues. Let the Minister make his statement and let us debate it. But at this stage I ask support for the motion I have moved. Amendment negatived.",28
148,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,The question now is that the original motion be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA,28
149,Mr DALY,IMMIGRATION,"Mr Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to make a statement on a matter that has become of great personal interest to me in particular and one that is of great importance to the Australian public-that is the immigration policy of the Australian Labor Party. My views on it have been misinterpreted after a silence of 5 years since this aspect of the policy was introduced in 1966 I seek to explain not only my interpretation of the policy but what the policy is accepted to be and has been stated by me to be in this Parliament over the years. Firstly, let me say that in the 1963 Conference of the Australian Labor Party a resolution was passed which stated: ImmiConference directs the Federal Executive to set up a committee of 4 members of the Federal Executive and 4 members of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party for the purpose of consultation with representatives of the ACTU and the AWU in order to bring before the next Conference a recommendation on the Party's migration policy. The members from the Federal Executive on that committee were: Honourable R. W. Holt, Ll.B., Victoria; Mr C. T. Oliver, New South Wales; and Mr F. E. Chamberlain and Mr D. Dunstan, M.P. The Federal Parliamentary Labor Party members were Mr Frank Stewart, M.P., Mr F. Daly, M.P., Mr F. Collard, M.P., and Senator J. Fitzgerald. The first meeting of that Committee was held on 7th August 1964. The agenda is available for all to see. It set out the procedure to be followed. The Committee subsequently met. Mr Chamberlain submitted a motion for discussion and Mr Oliver submitted a motion for discussion. But arising out of the meeting of that Committee I was designated to write a policy in support of the established immigration policy of the Australian Labor Party as we knew it at that time. Other members were delegated to assist in that respect. That was the basis on which the policy was formed. On 10th May 1965 I received a letter from Mr Wyndham, the then Secretary, in which he said: To: All Members of the Immigration Committee Dear Colleague, A meeting of the Immigration Committee will be held in the offices of the Federal Secretariat on Saturday, 22nd May 1965, commencing at 9.45 a.m. That meeting was subsequently held and I presented a 21-page report on recommendations for the Immigration Committee. In that I said: At its first meeting the Committee decided that the review of our immigration policy should be divided into two parts: (a) The racial aspect, and (b) the general aspect. And then I quoted our policy as it was at that time, which had the words 'White Australia' in it. Then I said: It is my task to deal with the racial aspect. I preface my remarks by saying that the term 'White Australia' used in our policy is a term which has no place in our official vocabulary but has become a popular but not an official way of describing our immigration policy. I believe the reason it is shown in Labor's platform as such is because of the difficulty in finding appropriate terms to fit the policy whilst maintaining the principle involved. I also said: I believe that the term 'White Australia' should be eliminated from our platform. At the same time, whilst removing this term I maintain Australia's immigration policy shall be based the principles laid down since federation ideal of maintaining a predominantly homogeneous population and avoidance of difficult and economic problems. That report then went in. It detailed practically every aspect of immigration policy and was adopted unanimously by the ComWestern mittee that I mentioned a moment ago. Arising out of that policy we wrote the following final recommendation: That the present section of the Platform-Im migration XXI be deleted, and that the following be inserted: Convinced that increased population is to the future development of Australia, Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding immigration gramme administered with sympathy, standing and tolerance. The basis of such policy will be: (a) Australia's national and economic security; (b) the welfare and integration of all its citizens; (c) the preservation of our democratic system and balanced development of our nation; and (d) the avoidance of the difficult social and economic problems which may follow from an influx of peoples having different standards of living, traditions and cultures.. That policy which is written into the Australian Labor Party platform was adopted by that representative Party committee, comprising at that time an Attorney General, 2 State secretaries and 4 Federal members, and submitted for the consideration of the ALP Conference. On 12th July 1965 Mr Wyndham wrote to me and enclosed a copy of the decisions I have just read out and he enclosed a copy of the letter that he was then sending to the Federal Executive to be decided at its Conference in August 1965. He related all the details that I have mentioned and at the bottom he said: After close examination of the existing platform the Committee unanimously endorsed the following recommendation . . . And that is the policy I read out a few moments ago. The Federal Conference was held in Sydney on 2nd August 1965 and the policy was there subsequently adopted. I have the minutes. At the 26th Conference held in Sydney at Hellenic House, Elizabeth Street, from 2nd to 6th August immigration was discussed. This makes the interpretation that I am about to make very interesting for the House. The policy that that I read out that is now in our platform on was brought up for discussion. Arising out on the of that, when it was moved some amendsocial ments were moved. One amendment in particular was interesting. Senator J. M. Wheeldon moved: That in accordance with Agenda Item 15 from Australia, paragraph (d) of the Committee's recommendation be deleted. In other words, he moved for that final section (d) which I read out a few - moments ago to be deleted. It was seconded by Mr Jamieson and supported by Mr F. E. Chamberlain. On being put to the vital meeting it was lost by 12 votes to 24. The the motion was then put, and the policy of the proAustralian Labor Party was adopted at that underConference by 36 votes to nil. The very basis of it, as honourable members can see, was in the text of the report that I laid down. I prepared a statement on the policy, which I was to make at that Conference, but by a political dodge of a person who is no longer with us-it was nobody in the Parliament- I was sidetracked and did not get there to make the statement because I was not told that the matter was on. That document which would have explained all the things that were there, consequently has never become omciai in the eyes of the Party, but if the House is interested I will incorporate it in the records. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate it in Hansard. Mr Chairman and Delegates: I have pleasure in submitting the Report of the Immigration Committee for the consideration of the Conference. The unanimous Recommendation of the Committee, which has already been circulated to delegates, is:That Clause XXI Immigration of the Platform be deleted and the following inserted:'Convinced that increased population is vital to the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding Immigration programme administered wifh sympathy, understanding and tolerance. The basis of such policy will be: (a) Australia's national and security; (b) the welfare and integration of all its citizens; (c) the preservation of our democratic system and balanced development of our nation; and (d) the avoidance of the difficult social and economic problems which may follow from an influx of peoples having different standards of living, traditions and cultures'. NA It is worth recording that the Committee consisted of two State Presidents, a State Secretary, an Attorney-General and four members of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. In addition, invitations were extended to A. A. Calwell, M.H.R., and Mr E. G. Whitlam, M.H.R., to attend. Mr Whitlam was present as Committee. Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and participated in the discussions. The fact that this Committee-so widely representative of all points of view on this subject - unanimousl y approved the Recommendation is words:a matter which I feel should not be overlooked when the repoit is under consideration. Subsequently, the Federal Executive at its meeting in May 1965 considered and adopted the Committee's recommendation. NA At a time when immigration policy is under discussion, it is appropriate that we should pay tribute to Australia's first Minister for Immigration, the Hon. Arthur Calwell, MHR, Leader of the Opposition, whose vision, energy and statesmanship laid the foundation for the success of the scheme, and whose efforts quite rightly have been acclaimed by political friend and foe alike. In 1945-twent y years ago-at the commencement of our Migration Scheme, our population was slightly more than 7,250,000. At this date it is about 11,400,000. This increase in population includes more than 2,000,000 migrants assisted and unassisted, and more than 700,000 children born to migrant families- a really grand contribution to our population growth and the development of a nation. To the Labor Government and Arthur Calwell who made it possible, let us recall today with pride, their achievements in implementing one of the greatest mass migration schemes in history, which, with the Snowy River Scheme, must rank as one of the really great achievements of our time. It has provided security and happiness for thousands of migrants from many countries, and given a stimulus to the growth and development of Australia. With a glorious background in the field of immigration and the experience of the integration and problems connected with the transfer of thousands of people, I feel sure that delegates will study and debate the Recommendation of the Committee with the predominant ojbective to not only continue an expanding programme, but to maintain the harmonious society in which we live. economic IMMIGRATION POLICY I believe it to be true that there is general agreement on the need to maintain an expanding planned migration programme. Our future depends on an increase in population in order to fully develop and protect this vast nation. Naturally, the safeguards applying to our social and economic welfare, and a programme in keeping with our capacity to absorb migrants of the right type are fundamental to the success of the Scheme. There appears to be no doubt that this broad principle is shared by most Australians of all political points of view. The criticism or the objection to our Immigration policy is directed, in the main, at what is more popularly-bu t quite wrongly-describe d as the 'White Australia policy'. For this reason, I intend Hon. to devote some time to this aspect of our policy before dealing with the Recommendation of the WHITE AUSTRALIA or OUR ESTABLISHED NA Part 1. of Labor's policy commences with the 'Maintenance of a white Australia shall provide the basis for immigration policy' . . . I preface my remarks by saying that the term 'White Australia' used in our policy is a term which has no place in our official vocabulary, but has become a popular-thoug h not an official - wa y of describing our Immigration pohcy. I believe the reason it is shown in Labor's platform at this stage is because of the difficulty in finding appropriate terms to fit the policy whilst maintaining the principle involved. The Committee considered that the term 'White Australia' should be eliminated from our platform for reasons which I will outline later. At the same time, whilst removing this term it was considered that Australia's Immigration policy should be based on the principle of the avoidance of difficult racial, social and economic problems. NA For the benefit of delegates, and in view of importance of this aspect of our Immigration policy, I give a brief survey of the policy. The present Immigration policy, or wrongly referred to as 'White Australia', is the outcome of experiences throughout Australia, particularly in the latter half of the nineteenth century. During that time, Asian labourers and other Asian migrants had been introduced to many activities-mainl y the goldfields. Rioting, bloodshed and other events had been the unhappy consequences during that period and led to widespread demands for adoption of such a policy. Furthermore, the introduction of Kanaka labour to the Queensland canefields with all the sordid consequences following the activities of 'Blackbirders' made the demand for reform unanswerable. In fact, the need for action to cope with this problem was one of the important those factors making for the adoption of our of a favouring Federation. The policy as such is not based on any sense of racial superiority, but rather is it based on the demands of those times to prevent exploitation cheap labour. However, it does recognise that successful assimilation is unlikely where there great differences of race, creed, custom and habits of life. This has been the official policy of all governments and all political parties since Federation, with the sole exception of the policy Communist Party and the DLP, namely, to maindoor' tain certain restrictions against the permanent residence in Australia of non-Europeans. It would be correct to say that the very basis of our Immigration policy is humanitarianism - the recognition of human dignity and the avoidbut ance of great cultural differences between peoples, rather than any feeling of racial superiority. The term 'White Australia' is undoubtedly a major reason why objection is taken in some quarters to our policy rather than to the policy itself. The fact that the term has no official basis is evidently not known, or overlooked. This term was invented about 40 years before Federation. It is a term that finds no place in any of our laws. It is a popular but not a legal term. NA There has always been a measure of criticism from some people in regard to what is known popularly-bu t wrongly-as the 'White Australia"" policy. In more recent years this criticism has become more vocal. It has come from sections of the press, clerics, certain academics, and some citizens, many of whom may have well been prompted by the highest motives and ideals. Some of the objections emanated from the rise of Asian nationalism. In some cases, however, their suppport was based on unfortunate events that have occurred in relation to non-Europeans who may have been refused admittance or the right to stay here. In other cases, they apply to non-European persons ineligible for citizenship but who gained admittance to the country on a tourist visa, or overseas students-Chinese , Malayans, Indians, Filipinos and other nationalities. These cases are known to all. Time does not permit me to deal the with them in detail other than to mention them as reasons prompting some people to urge a history of the change in the policy. Broadly speaking, the case for a change comes what is quite under the following headings: 1. It is immoral to maintain a colour bar. 2. Its unfortunate effects create a bad image in Asia and deprive us of the benefits of diverse cultures. 3. It is unnecessary if framed solely for the people of Australia, denying others assistance on the way to a better hfe. 4. The policy has a disastrous effect on nonEuropean opinion, being insulting to non-Europeans, and reduces Australia's effect in inter-racial Councils of the world. the Comments on these reasons will be made in the immigration course of the Report. The supporters of a change of policy range from the 'open door', to the sponsors quota system either on a government-togovernment agreement basis, or by legislation. The Committee gave careful consideration to these views. It is our opinion that the unpleasantand ness and adverse publicity, created by the Press would not justify a radical change in policy, or are the abandonment of the principle involved, but could be overcome by wise and tolerant administration. At the same time, careful consideration was also given as to whether or not our present should be maintained, or whether the 'open policy or quota system should be adopted. Broadly speaking, there was general agreement that some modification of the policy was necessary to meet changed conditions and to remove any impression that there was racial discrimination; some of the major reasons against a drastic change or abandonment of the policy may be summed up as follows: 1. The desire incorporated in the first Commonwealth Parliament 1901 In passing an Immigration Act to preserve the homogeneity of the Australian population, safeguarding living standards, and freedom from racial tensions, etc., is still valid. 2. Our Immigration laws are similar to those of all other countries ln that we claim the same right as they do to determine the composition of our population and to say who shall or shall not live amongst us. 3. The very fact of our freedom from racial strife supports a continuation of the policy, with modification, as events In Great Britain and other places demonstrate. 4. Examples of different races, cultures, living in harmony are very rare. Even in Australia after 20 yean of planned European migration, Italians and Greeks still present problems of integration. 5. The claim that our policy gives offence to Asians, Africans and other non-Europeans has never been substantiated or supported by any significant figures in Asian or African politics, when it has been fully explained to them. In fact Malaysia's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman said he does not object to the policy as it is designed to protect Australia from being swamped. 6. The political effects cannot be overlooked. In Great Britain Labor seats were lostnotably that of Patrick Gordon Walkerand this should not be forgotten, indicating as it does, public sensitiveness cm this topic. 7. Our treatment and difficulties in regard to our Aboriginal problem is hardly a recommendation of our ability to integrate non-Europeans successfully. 8Many other reasons could be quoted, such as the need for common loyalties; rate of development; defence; security; need for skilled personnel to remain in Asian countries; the problem of Chinese migration; and the congregation of non-Europeans in certain areas resulting in racial strife. 9. The 'open door' policy is neither economically or nationally possible or desirable. 10. The quota system-of which I will say more later-wil l aggravate rather than remedy the situation. It will neither satisfy the non-European nations nor make any contribution to the economic welfare or population problems of the nations concerned. NA To those who advocate a change of policyno matter how well intentioned- a study of events in other parts of the world is worthy of consideration. We have none of the racial problems comparable to those of Great Britain, America, Malaya, Singapore, The Philippines, or South Africa. This has been achieved without any great friction with our Asian neighbours. If for no other reason (and of course there are many), the very fact of our freedom from racial hatreds and strife should be enough to convince people of the value of the policy and the need to maintain it ln principle. Let us look at the significant developments abroad in recent times. Take for example, Great Britain, a reasonable comparison for the purpose of this subject. When the Immigration doors were opened by the Government, supported by the Labor Party, Great Britain was flooded with nonEuropean labour, most of it unskilled. It has resulted in the congregation of these people in certain areas-in racial discrimination-riots ugly scenes-and examples of racial hatred similar to those in the United States of America. The effect on electorate results was dramatic. Some Tory candidates campaigned under the slogan: 'If you want nigger for a neighbour vote vote Labor.' Patrick Gordon Walker-brillian t Labor intellectual and later Foreign Secretarywas defeated in this safe Labor constituency after holding it for 19 years. He was known to have very broad views on coloured migration. Great Britain now has an imported racial problem with all the strife and bitterness that follows. The British Labor Party prompted by the highest ideals has now found that the ideals were sound but it was an impractical proposal: integration is just not possible. In fact it is now the view of most members of the British Labor Party that whilst it is morally desirable to open the gates to all members of the Commonwealth, the practical reality is that it creates an even more explosive problem. The British Labor Party has learned the hard fact that people of different colour, cultures, idealogies and living standards cannot be integrated without passions and emotions and hatreds being aroused. To the credit of the British Labor Party, they have not been slow to recognise the trend and have adjusted their policy on migration in an endeavour to overcome the problems created by their idealism. Restrictive immigration laws have now been imposed. We too should learn from their experiences and be grateful that Australia today has been saved the problems imported to Great Britain by their change of Immigration policy. Fortunately, because of our policy we have been saved the hatreds, riots, bitterness and discrimination existing in Great Britain and other parts of the world. This week in Great Britain the Labor Government will announce plans to tighten controls on immigration. They effect students and visitors, and is a bold attempt to take migration and the colour question out of party politics. Therefore, do not let us make the mistake of radically changing our policy and so bring similar problems to Australia. In the United States of America, South Africa, The Philippines, Malaya, and Singapore, Ceylon, Pakistan and India, tragic and ugly events indicate the problems that arise in countries where racial hatreds are inflamed. Harlem-Alabama-Littl e Rock-Birmingham are just a few of the names that bring to mind these bitter experiences. These lessons are grim and revealing. Surely, if for no other reason, we have an obligation to our people to keep this country free from such events and the bitterness and hatreds that follow. We have no right to import or create a problem which is non-existent at the present time. I now direct a few remarks to criticism of our policy and demands for a change by 'open door' or quota system. Some people endeavour to create the impression that we are the only country in the world with an Immigration policy of this kind or maintains the right to keep certain people out. This, of course, is not the case. Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore, India, United Soviet Socialist Republics, and every country in the world exercises this right, and rightly so. It applies particularly to Asian countries, and the right to exclude those whom we do not desire to come and live amongst us was a principle endorsed by the Asians Relations Conference in New Dehli in 1947. It is said that our policy gives offence to Asian nations or non-Europeans. This may be so for those who apologise for it; who do not understand it; or will not explain it, particularly as to the categories of persons from Asia who may enter the country temporarily or permanently and who are eligible for citizenship. Every Asian country has similar immigration laws and it is not that our policy is objectionable, but rather does it go unexplained. In fact, Mr Calwell had no difficulty when addressing the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference 1959which was attended by many non-Europeans-in explaining the policy and having it understood and accepted. This argument about offence to Asians has never been supported (when the policy has been fully explained) by any significantfigurein Asian politics, and I consider that the argument cannot be substantiated. Our Immigration laws are much more liberal than those of other countries. The categories of non-Europeans who may settle in Australia are extensive and administered as favourably as possible to our Asian neighbours. Firstly, an Australian marrying an Asian may bring his wife or her husband, as the case may be, to live amongst us. This applies to naturalized Australians as well as natural born. Children can accompany their parents. Secondly, an Asian lawfully admitted to Australia, who has lived here for 15 years, abided by the conditions of his entry, is of good character, has a working knowledge of the language, and subject to a few other requirements, may remain in Australia indefinitely and become an Australian citizen. Thirdly, for some time the Government, desiring to bring about a better understanding of Asian culture and ideas, has provided specially for the entry of distinguished and highly qualified Asians to the Australian community. Non-Europeans may be admitted to Australia for temporary and permanent residence under certain conditions subject to the discretion of the Minister. These include doctors, merchants, overseas representatives, buyers, etc., and people in these categories are already in Australia. I believe criticism of our policy stems from ignorance at times, particularly in respect to the great numbers taking advantage of the opportunity to settle in Australia temporarily or permanently. Our pohcy is not-and never has beendirected at the total exclusion of non-Europeans; nor is it based on any assumption of racial superiority. It is subject to ministerial discretion and each case is dealt with on its merits, including humanitarian and national interests. Here are just a few figures indicating the liberalism of our policy. Under the Colombo Plan 5,749 trainees have benefited to date, and it has cost the Australian taxpayer £55,426,000 to educate the nationals of Asian countries to assist in the development and betterment of their own people and country. There are 37,300 non-Europeans resident in Australia today-12,40 0 Asians and non-European students. In addition, more than 10,000 persons of mixed descent have been admitted to Australia during the post-war period from Ceylon, Asia and elsewhere. 800 Asian evacuees were accepted and allowed to remain here. In the last 10 years, 3,452 non-Europeans were granted Australian citizenship. In the past 5 years 22,000 visitors non-European were in Australia for varying periods of '12 months or more. These facts should be remembered and restated for the benefit of those who do not know. NA Our Immigration policy is highlighted and comes under criticism now and again when some person in Australia for study purposes, or on a visitor's permit, is asked to leave in accordance with the terms on which his or her visa was granted. In most cases they seek to transfer to permanent residence. This not only applies to non-Europeans, but also to Greeks, ItaUans and other nationalities. It is what is termed 'category hopping' and no other nation in the world tolerates this form of admittance for permanent residence. In Great Britain, USA., the USSR., and Iron Curtain countries, and Asian nations, actions of this kind would not be tolerated because before the people enter the country they are advised and given the visa on the understanding that it is for a given time and a given time only. (Delegates who have travelled abroad know this to be the case.) Sympathy extended to people in this category in many cases is based on false grounds, and it seems to apply only when non-Europeans are involved. Many Greeks, Italians, even 'British and other European persons have been deported as prohibited migrants and it has hardly raised a flutter in the press or elsewhere, merely because they do not happen to be non-European. However, when a non-European is asked to leave the country we immediately hear the cry of racial discrimination. So far as the Press is concerned-and some other people-it seems to care little about Europeans being deported or asked to leave the country, whether it be just or unjust; their only purpose being to stir the pot of racial strife, and in most cases they fail to print the facts of the case. 'OPEN DOOR' OR QUOTA SVSTEM I want to deal with the alternative to ministerial discretion, that is an 'open door' or quota system. The question of an 'open door' policy is impracticable, we even have to limit European migration. The only parties who want 'open door' are the Communist Party and the DLP-bot h extremes in politics and both enemies of the Labor Party. Our rate of expansion demands that only a given number of migrants be taken in any one yearapproximately 150,000. If the policy is changed, and working on the basis of those who say we should admit Asians in great numbers, our economy would befloodedwith disastrous effects. This appears to completely destroy the argument that there should be an 'open door' pohcy. It has been suggested that a quota system should be devised, either by arrangement with governments or some other way, whereby we could take migrants who are acceptable to us because of their skill. As a matter of fact, this applies now under the present policy, and many non-Europeans are employed in Australia because of their qualifications. Firstly, a quota system will not make any contribution to raising the standard of living of the countries concerned, particularly if we only take skilled personnel. Secondly, the quota would have to be the same as that applying to Europeans, otherwise we would be accused of discrimination. Again, what would be the position if India said, for instance, you cannot have a hundred persons but you can have 100 coolies or unskilled perwill sonnel. If we rejected this proposal we would accused of discrimination. Again, a quota system involves fixity. How do we apportion the numbers between Indians, Burmese, Chinese, Ceylonese, Malays? Will it cover the inhabitants of all Asian countries. These questions must be answered. How, for instance, would you explain away the taking of 100,000 British migrants and only To say the least, the Indians would hardly be flattered that every Briton was worth more than 1,000 Indians. There are more than 2,000 million people in Asia and to 99.9 per cent of them Australia would be a closed country under a quota system. In the addition, if a quota system were adopted nonpreservation Europeans in Australia would be the first to apply and the applicants would vastly exceed places allotted for years to come. Then there is the reaction of a quota. Has anycultures. one considered the public reaction if non-Europeans continued to hold positions for which Australians are eligible and could not be employed. To summarise, the quota system kinds of problems. What then is to be the quota? How many from each country? What types are they to be? Who will be the persons eligibleskilled or unskilled; and above all else, from what down. countries will they come? Are Asians already here to be given first priority? Will we take migrants from Communist countries, Iron Curtain countries, or will they be restricted to those governments are favourable to our views? VISAS-STUDENTS , ETC. To overcome unfavourable publicity in regara to tourist visas and overseas students, certair administrative action could and should be taken. There is no need to detail them at this stage, if taken in the same way as that of other insure countries, these problems could be overcome. would be covered by the term 'sympathetic underlife. standing and tolerant administration.' NA I now deal with the Recommendation. It was developed. the view of the Committee that on Immigration policy too much detail was given. It was our desire to make a clear and concise statement of the broad principles of our policy within the framework of which a Labor administration would function. For this purpose, we recommend the deletion of the present policy statement which includes the world. considerable detail and that our policy read in accordance with the recommendation outlined. A study of the Recommendation shows that it removes from our policy the popular though objectionable term 'white Australia'. This seems a natural move as there is no such term in the official records of the Parliament and reasons have already been given why it was used. (At this stage the only Party with its immigration policy described in these terms is the Austrahan Country Party.) This eliminates that section of the pohcy to which objection has been taken and a wrong interpretation based upon it. In addition, the first clause in the recommendation confirms that the Australian Labor Party support and uphold a vigorous and expanding be Immigration programme, subject to certain principles. This in effect continues the programme mathematical commenced in 1945. Its administration shall be carried out with sympathy, understanding and tolerance, and these words should be interpreted in the widest terms. If this is done it should eliminate many of the objections of which mention has been made in the 100 Indians. press from time to time. The basis of the policy is clearly set out in sections (a) (b) (c) and (d). No one at home or abroad can object to the terms used. They seek to provide for our national and economic security; welfare and integration of all our citizens; the of our democratic system and balanced development of our nation; and the avoidance of the difficult social and economic problems the which may follow from an influx of people having different standards of Uving, traditions, and Under the policy, any person European or nonEuropean who can meet the requirements of this policy, is entitled to be admitted for temporary or provides all permanent residence. It is for the Minister and the Government to decide if he or she meets the standard laid The deletion of the objectionable words 'white Australia' and the reframing of our policy as recommended by the Committee will prevent misinwhose terpretation of the principles underlining our Immigration policy (a poUcy endorsed by all Austrahan Governments since Federation). The resolution should be interpreted as a clear, concise, unobjectionable statement of our policy, free of any taint of racial discrimination or superiority, based on the principle and ideal that the but composition of our population wiU be such as to the integration of all people and the sharThis ing of our freedom, independence and way of Surely, no reasonable objection can be taken to these broad principles on which a great programme shall be implemented and a country The Committee beUeves that the poUcy as stated maintaining ministerial and Governmental responsibiUty for those who shall enter Australia permanently or temporarily, gives effect to the principle accepted as a right of any nation to decide the composition of its population. It is the same test appUed to migrants by every nation in Our Immigration policy is not and never has been a suggestion of racial superiority. It began as an effective aspiration and from it has resulted a positive achievement. This achievement is a united race of freedom loving Australians, who can inter-marry and associate without the disadvantages that inevitably result from the fusion of dissimilar races; a united people who share the same loyalties, the same outlook, and the same traditions. When we read in the World Press of the New York race riots-of the Negro threat of bloodbaths-and such headlines, we should recall the words of Frank Worrall, Captain of the West Indies Cricket Team in 1961 when he said: 'This was our tour of tours. Here we found people welcomed us into their homes because they loved entertaining-the colour question never arisen-Australi a is a home away from home'. . . . We seek to ensure that our society is so composed that regardless of race, all citizens of Australia as well as thousands of Asians and non-Europeans, students and visitors, are fully accepted and have equal rights. Our nation is free of racial frictions and hatreds so common in other parts of the world. The composition of our population ensures the integration of all people and the sharing of our freedom, independence and way of life. This glorious ideal can be maintained, without offence to any nation, subject to its administration with sympathy understanding and tolerance. I submit the Report and express my appreciation to the members of the Committee for their tolerance and understanding of a great human problem. I have endeavoured to place their views before the Conference in an objective and impartial manner and express the hope that in your wisdom, you will endorse the recommendation as the policy of the Australian Labor Party. Then in 1966 the Government brought in some radical changes on the question of non-European migration, and this received close attention from the Labor Party because it was a radical change and a great departure from Government policy. The Immigration Committee recommendation to the Labor Party at that time was that the proposals be not opposed and the assurance given by the Minister be accepted, that is, that there is to be no departure from the accepted and established principle of our immigration policy and that it will be administered with understanding and tolerance. As documents of this nature have been mentioned in the House before, I quote them in order to prove my point. The minutes of a Caucus meeting on 23rd March 1966 state: The Leader called on Mr Daly to report on the Immigration Committee's recommendation in respect to the Minister for Immigration's statement on policy variations. Recommendation was that the proposals be not opposed but assurances on certain matters be sought. I have just elaborated those. The minutes continued: The following spoke. Birrell, Johnson, Peters, Cross, Beaton, Uren, Jones, Hayden, Beazley, Cairns, Hansen, Luchetti, Barnard, Cops and the Leader, with Mr Daly in reply. The recommendation was put and carried. Then I came into this Parliament as the spokesman for the Labor Party on this matter. I quote from a statement on immigration that was so important that it was printed by both the Government and the Opposition. It represents one of the most has outstanding debates on immigration in this Parliament. In that debate I went into the question of what was being done and referred to the relieving of tensions in respect of this matter and the approach that had been made by the Government. This is what I said: The Opposition believes that the principles underlying our immigration policy should not be disturbed. I would like to outline to the House the present policy of the Labor Party on immigrationI then quoted the policy that is in the platform at this time, the history of which I have dealt with. I said, and I repeat it again: This should be interpreted as a clear, concise and unobjectionable statement of our policy, free of any taint of racial discrimination or superiority, based on the principle and ideal that the composition of our population will be such as to ensure the integration of all people sharing our freedom, independence and way of life. This policy is not one of the 'open door' or of the 'quota system'. It maintains the principle of Australia's established immigration policy which has been endorsed by all governments since federation. Then I went on to say: Let me now state our attitude to the proposals that the House is now discussing. The Opposition does not oppose the proposals, and we accept the assurance given by the Minister that there is to be no departure from accepted and established principles of our immigration policy and that this policy will be administered with understanding and tolerance. This is in line with the policy of the Labor Party, as I have already outlined. I quote these things at length because they are important. I said: I now want to refer to a decision to admit certain well-qualified people wishing to settle in Australia and to grant them resident status and citizenship after 5 years. The decision of the Opposition to support this proposalRemember thiscarries with it certain qualifications. We require an assurance from the Minister and the Government that the principles underlying our policy will be maintained and that the possession of wealth will not be the basis for the admission to Australia of certain people such as wealthy Chinese and others from various parts of the world. We also require an assurance that the persons admitted under this category will be only those with qualifications not possessed by available Australians, and also that skiUed personnel, professional men and others shaU not be taken_ from underdeveloped countries which require their talents more than Australia does. We must also be assured beyond doubt that non-Europeans will not be brought into meet general labour shortages, and that there will be no large-scale admission of workers from Asia. This matter was referred to by the Minister and I see no reason why the assurances he has given should not be accepted. We of the Opposition consider that we are entitled to ask for these assurances. We have no desire to see any breaking down of living and working conditions in this countiy, nor do we wish to fan the flames of racial hatred. The Minister stressed throughout his speech the principles that would guide him in the administration of this legislation. We have little to disagree with in the sentiments that he expressed, but the fact is that he may not always be the Minister and we believe that Government assurances are essential and that they must be fulfiUed. If that is not a clear statement of Labor policy, I am a Dutchman. Other members spoke on this matter. If honourable members study that speech made 5 years ago they will see that no challenge was made to my interpretation of the policy then. It was carried out on the instructions of a Labor caucus. Is it to be said today that the policy I enunciated is my policy and not in accordance with Labor policy, when I have read the very minutes of the caucus meeting that gave mat policy to this House? The position is intolerable. Honourable members opposite know that my interpretation is correct. One of the men who was a member of that committee and who moved an amendment to delete the clause about which there is so much dispute-the clause in respect to the avoidand ance of difficult social and economic probgive lems which might follow an influx of people having different standards of traditions and cultures-wa s Mr Chamberlain. I know that he will not mind my saying it, but I received a telegram from him as follows: Paragraph (D) immigration platform permits other interpretation than that presented by you. Is that not good enough for me to say that agreed to: my interpretation is correct? The situation in this country is that some people are stating what they want the policy to be, but I am stating what it is. Consequently I adjourned. make this statement to the House today to clear up the position. Irrespective of what might be said by anyone, that policy was laid down by the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party. I have accepted it over all these years and so have honourable members on this side of the House. Until another Federal Conference changes my interpretation I will continue to state that policy and say that it is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. I say quite impartially, and somewhat personally, that honourable members know that there is nothing racially inclined about me. I have endeavoured to write into the Australian Labor Party's immigration policy tolerance and understanding. That is why I am resentful today about being refused the right to make this statement. I have been misinterpreted by people, in many places outside this Parliament, who have not read the policy and who base their statements on newspaper reports. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to make my statement. I know the policy of the Australian Labor Party. It is as I stated it. It is documented chapter and verse. Without taking any personal accolade that I should not, I think that the members of that committee will know that on the question of non-European migration I was the author of the policy. Therefore, to say today that I do not understand it is, to put it bluntly, insulting, humiliating and hurtful, particularly when there is no basis in fact. This is the policy I support. This is the policy that I helped to write. I thank the House again for giving me the opportunity to explain it.",28

The report goes on to state: While the Government has defended its refusal to grant recognition to China and to approve its membership of the United Nations on the grounds that it had to defend the rights of 14i million Taiwanese, Mr Fraser totally reversed the ment. If honourable members look at what I said last night, which was the first mention this aspect of the discussion, they will that I said: The independence of Taiwan must be tained.

Those 2 statements were very clearly made before any mention of the other considerstand. ation. But I did go on to say: . . . the 14} million people in Taiwan cannot be allowed to stand in the way of dialogue communication. I ask the House to note the precision of the words 'dialogue and communication'. This is a matter that needs to be handled in steps, as it is being handled. I repeat that the headline to the report this ing is utterly fanciful.

156,Mr WHITLAM,BENEFITS,"The new Minister for Health (Senator Greenwood) enters today into negotiations with Australia's on toughest trade union having conceded in advance that its claims are reasonable and that the Government is powerless in any case to resist those claims even if it felt justified in doing so. My party rejects the attitude of the Mmister in its entirety. The arguproposed increase of 15 per cent in general practitioner fees was unjustified in February when the former Prime Minister (Mr of Gorton) described it as 'appalling' and it see remains unjustified today despite the Minister's fatuous assertion on a television mainprogramme that it could be described as 'within bounds'. The former Prime Minister was right in February when he insisted be that doctors' incomes should become subin ject to an arbitration process and the new Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) will be wrong if he retreats from his predecessor's The medical profession long ago priced itself out of the reach of patients and on current rates of income increase and will shortly price itself beyond the means of governments as well. The Prime Minister and his Ministers cannot in consistency or fairness underwrite for general practitioners an increase in the price of labour greater by 150 per cent than the December mornminimum wage increase which they have so vehemently and vociferously condemned. The index of doctors' fees rose in New South Wales between 1959-60 and 1969-70 for surgery consultations by 100 per cent until and for home visits by 140 per cent, whereas average weekly earnings increased over the same period by 70.8 per cent, wages by 49.2 per cent and the combined pension by only 39.5 per cent. Spokesmen for the medical profession protest that these 2 most common of all medical services present an unfair picture, so let me put the matter another way. Taxation statistics reveal that in 1952-53 the the mean weekly income for doctors was $108.25 and the average weekly income for the community as a whole was $31.38. By 1966-67 doctors were earning $238.50 and the average weekly income was $60.70. This represented an annual rate of growth in money terms of 5.6 per cent for doctors and 4.6 per cent for average income earners, in real terms of 3.4 per cent for doctors and 2.4 per cent for average income earners. The real rate of growth in doctors' incomes thus exceeded the rate for the community as a whole by 40 per cent. This trend is an accelerating one. The Commonwealth's own submission to the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs shows clearly that the rate of increase in doctors' fees relative to average weekly earnings was reasonable throughout the first decade of the Liberal health scheme, although even at that stage fees rose faster than consumer prices. Since 1963-64 doctors have increased their fees at a rate grossly disproportionate to prices fixed by other sections of the community for both products and labour. The weighted average fee for medical services increased between 1964 and 1970 by 58 per cent whereas the increase in average weekly earnings over the same period was 47 per cent, the increase in award wages was 36 per cent and the increase in consumer prices was only 21 per cent. Doctors thus elevated themselves in the space of 5 years to a new niche in Australia's income structure justified neither by precedent by equity. They achieved this result either by pulling the wool over the eyes of successive Liberal Ministers for Health, or conniving with those Ministers. The party of privilege gave this already privileged profession a position more highly privileged than ever. Since the introduction of the common fee system last July, general practitioners have increased their incomes by 7 per cent. They have enjoyed, that is, since July the increases for which other sections of the community had to wait until December, and their median net income has risen to about $14,000. Increases for which the AMA now. argues and which the new Minister for Health has described as within bounds amount in fact to another $1,000 annually for a section of the work force which charges already for its labour 3 i times the average national price. Increases of 4 per cent in each of the last 2 years would have maintained the money value of the GP's income and increases of 8 i per cent would have maintained their value at constant prices. But the AMA seeks in addition to the 7 per cent which they have already received not 10 per cent but 15 per cent. I can see no reason why taxpayers and health fund contributors should finance a further widening of the gap between prices charged for labour by general practitioners and prices charged by other sections of the work force. I see no reason for the government to underwrite maintenance by private practitioners of a niche in the income structure which they have attained only in the last 6 years. Impetus for the AMA's current efforts arises in fact not so much from relativities between the medical profession and the remainder of the workforce as from relativities within the profession itself. While the incomes of GPs have increased since last July by 7 per cent those of specialists have risen by 35 per cent. The average cost of specialist services has risen for example in Western Australia by 18 per cent for obstetrics, 42 per cent for pathology and 50.9 per cent for X-rays. As a result, specialists now earn annually about $3,000 more than colleagues in general practice. The question, however, is not whether rivalries within the medical profession are justified but whether they should be resolved at public expense. It is whether nor the government should provide this year a free bonanza for general practitioners simply because last year Mr Gorton spent like the proverbial drunken sailor to purchase specialist goodwill for his medical insurance scheme. I have demonstrated that the proposed fee increases can be justified in terms neither of maintaining the real value of doctors' incomes nor of preserving the position of the medical profession in the income structure of the work force as a whole. Let me now turn to the impUcations of the increases in terms of inflation, productivity and arbitration. The former Prime Minister, Mr Gorton, the new Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) and the Treasurer (Mr Snedden) have constantly asserted that our present inflationary problems exist because increases in the price of labour have outstripped increases in productivity. Let me, therefore, draw their attention to thefiguresas far as doctors are concerned. Increases of 100 per cent in the New South Wales surgery consultation fee and of 140 per cent in the New South Wales home visit fee between 1959-60 and 196970, an increase of 58 per cent in the weighted average fee for medical services between 1964 and 1970, and an increase of 120 per cent in the mean annual income of doctors between 1952-53 and 1966-67 exceed respectively by 73 per cent, 113 per cent, 41 per cent and 83 per cent increases in productivity for each corresponding period. Clearly the rate of increase for doctors' fees and doctors' incomes has consistently exceeded the rate of increase in productivity and has done so by a margin more gross than that of almost any other section of the workforce. Clearly doctors have had more than their fair share of extra resources made available by productivity growth. On 8th April the Treasurer foresaw and deplored a situation in which, he said, 'a person would have an income which determined his standard of living, based on whether or not he was a member of a powerful union'. He described this situation as 'contrary to the egalitarian ethos of Australians' and 'something I don't like'. Let the Treasurer now apply this reasoning to the AMA and its current fee increase proposals. Let him show as much zeal in denouncing the income aspirations of doctors as he shows in denouncing those groups under Arbitration Commission awards. The issue at stake is not merely whether doctors are to become richer but rather whether the stated position of the MCMahon Government on matters of inflation, productivity and arbitration is to retain any shred of credibility at all. It can retain that credibility only if the Prime Minister now insists that doctors, like most other groups within the work orce, justify increases in the price of their labour through public processes of arbitration. Only 2 months ago the former Prime Minister rejected as appalling the AMA claims that there should be a 15 per cent across-the-board increase in fees. Will his successor now cave in simply because the increase applies for the moment only to GPs and the cost has been reduced to $10m? The former Prime Minister was determined to bring doctors within the scope of an arbitration system; can the new Prime Minister do less? The question is one not of amounts and distribution but of justification, process and public information. The Minister for Health insists that governments have no power to establish the incomes of doctors, but in fact few members of the Australian workforce are dependent on doctors not for income alone of which 75 per cent is derived from taxes collected or forgone by governments but for the Commonwealth scholarships which see 74 per cent of their number through university courses and the hospitals on which their practical training depends. It is anomalous indeed that award wages paid in the main by private employers are determined by public arbitration, whereas doctors' fees derived overwhelmingly from the public purse are determined by the profession alone. The high cost of Liberal election gimmickry is nowhere more evident than in matters of health. In October 1969 the former Prime Minister said in his policy speech that it would cost $19m to give a Gorton look at the ailing Liberal health scheme with its 114 separate insurance bureaucracies. In March 1970 the former Minister for Health revealed in his second reading speech on the National Health Bill that the $19m had risen to $45m, an additional $26m being required, as I have said, to sweeten the specialist-dominated governing body of the AMA into accepting his modified scheme. As we now know, the Minister's estimate too was conservative, and the real cost of last year's specialist windfall has substantially exceeded his expectations. Taxpayers and health fund contributors are now asked to underwrite a further subvention of at least $10m which, as I have shown serves no other purpose than to restore income relativities within the medical profession itself. They are asked to assume this additional burden at a time when the AMA has clearly indicated that it will be back before long for the 15 per cent increase in specialist fees which the former Prime Minister found appalling in February. The new Minister for Health clearly has no stomach for attempts to break this vicious cycle. He does not even have as much stomach as his predecessor. The new Prime Minister clearly has no intention of putting back the lid removed by his predecessor from Pandora's Box. A Labor government will not countenance any increase in doctors fees which was not determined through the arbitration process. It will not discriminate in laying down procedures for fixation of the price of labour and skill between doctors and other sections of the work force. I say now to the Prime Minister that he shall not divide Australia with a de facto incomes policy which sets one standard for ordinary members of the work force and another for privilege. Neither Parliament nor the people will accept arrangements under which there are Snedden's rules for those who come within the ambit of the Arbitration Commission and Rafferty's rules for all the rest. There is room within any incomes policy for only one form of discrimination and that is discrimination in favour not of those sections of the work force which are already glutted with affluence but of those whom affluence has passed by. The Prime Minister cannot any longer at the same time and from the same dispatch box abuse the Arbitration Commission and appease the doctors. He cannot any longer advocate a measure of wage restraint on the part of sections of the work force which he is not prepared to require from the work force as a whole. The issue is a simple one. Either the doctors go to arbitration or the Prime Minister admits that all the calumny which he and his Ministers have heaped on the Commission since its December award is hypocritical. There are in fact only two courses open to the Prime Minister. He must put up proper proposals for arbitration on the price of doctors labour or remain silent on the labour pricing issue as a whole. Mr Irwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I should like to ask the Leader of the Opposition how he would apply that to the legal profession.",37
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BENEFITS,Mr Drury)Order! There is no point of order.,40
158,Dr FORBES,BENEFITS," Mr Deputy Speaker, the House would take the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) more seriously if he himself were not applying both a doubelieve ble and an impracticable standard on this issue. He makes great play, as do many others, of the fact that everybody else in the community has to go to arbitration and justify their claims for increased wages and that doctors do not have to do this. Will the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who is to follow him on the Labor side in this debate, tell the House the Opposition's attitude to the fact that, as I understand it, 40 per cent of the Australian work force is operating on the basis of remuneration other than that determined in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? iin other words, 40 per cent of the Australian work force is enjoying over award payments, many of which have been achieved as a result of militant strike action, without a word being said by honourable gentlemen opposite. Therefore, one must assume that they tacitly support such a situation. What hypocrisy it is to criticise the medical profession from that point of view. I do not support the medical profession in everything that it does, but it is hypocrisy to criticise it from that point of view when more than 40 per cent of Australian workers are being remunerated on a basis other than the one which they have justified before the Arbitration Commission. That is the situation. The Leader of the Opposition, as usual, has treated this Parliament with contempt. He had a long prepared statement which he had to read quickly in order to complete it in the time allotted to him. He has come into the chamber and read the statement so quickly that even if people had wanted to comprehend it, it would have been difficulty for them to do so. In other words, it has been an exercise mainly for the Press. Before I refer to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition and to the justification which he has given for raising this matter this morning, let me remind the House that he has raised this matter this morning when the Minister for Health (Senator Greenwood), is on behalf of the Government, meeting in Sydney, the leaders of the Australian Medical Association for crucial discussions on which the whole viability and future of the health scheme might depend. Does the Leader of the Opposition that the raising of this matter in a party political sense and in a highly provocative and highly antagonistic sense so far as the medical profession is concerned will contribute towards the objectives which the Minister for Health and the Government seek, that is, to continue a viable health scheme? Of course he does not. He knows that the raising of this matter in the House this morning will have exactly the opposite effect. That is why the Opposition has chosen to raise the matter this morning of all times, although this question about doctors fees arose more than a week ago. The Opposition has raised some pettifogging matters of public importance which could have been replaced by the matter which is being raised this morning. The Opposition chose to raise the matter today-the very day on which the Minister for Health, on behalf of the Government, is undertaking this difficult task. The Leader of the Opposition himself acknowledged that it is a difficult task when he referred to the characteristics of the Australian Medical Association and to the strength of the AMA . It is a difficult task because it concerns all the patients and all the contributors to the health insurance scheme in Australia.",40
159,Mr HAYDEN,BENEFITS,You have not said anything yet.,41
160,Dr FORBES,BENEFITS,"I am expressing, I hope, pretty strong views about the motives behind the raising of this matter at this time. This is typical of the Australian Labor Party in its attempt to be the alternative government. But let me continue because the basic argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition is an invalid one. If his initial basic argument is untrue, his whole argument falls to the ground. He based his whole argument on the fact that the Government conceded, before it entered into negotiations, that an increase of 15 per cent in general practitioners fees is round about the mark. On Tuesday of this week the Leader of the Opposition himself asked the Prime Minister Mr MCMahon), the head of the Government, a question regarding this matter. The Prime Minister, amongst other things, said: Subsequently I was informed that after a meeting on Sunday they had agreed to the Government's request, the effect of this being that the cost, instead of being $32m, as an across the board increase would have involved, would now be about SlOm on their percentage increase. This figure of SlOm as being the maximum, as advised to me by the Department of Health, has not been agreed to by the Government nor have the various percentage increases that have been pro12669/71-R-[74 ] posed for the various States and in special circumstances by the AMA been agreed to. I repeat: The Leader of the Opposition has based his whole argument on the fact that the Government has agreed to what the AMA has now announced should be the appropriate increase in fees for general practitioners. In response to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister has replied categorically on behalf of the Government that that is not true. What is more, the Prime Minister went on to say to the Leader of the Opposition that this was one of the matters about which our colleague, the Minister for Health, was going to see the AM A today. I submit that t'-.at basic argument not being correct, the Government has no real case to answer in this matter. I should have thought that as negotiations were to take place, the appropriate, honourable snd responsible thing to do would have been for the Opposition to reserve its judgment until it saw what came out of the negotiations; until it saw what the Government's decisions were, based on those negotiations, the Prime Minister having foreshadowed that the Government had not agreed to the increase of 15 per cent as proposed by the AMA and having said that this was a matter which would be the subject of negotiations with the AMA.",41
161,Unknown,BENEFITS,Sitting suspended from 12.30 to 3 p.m.,41
162,Dr FORBES,BENEFITS,"Before the sitting was suspended, I had made 2 basic points about this matter of public importance which the Opposition has proposed for discussion. The first point was this: In bringing forward this matter of doctors' fees and medical benefits for discussion at this time, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has based the whole of his case on the fact that the Government had conceded to general practitioners an increase of 15 per cent in their fees. This morning I quoted from an answer given by the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) in response to a question asked of him. The Prime Minister made it perfectly clear that it is not true that the Government has conceded that increase. The negotiations and discussions which are taking place today between the Executive of the Australian Medical Association and the Minister for Health (Senator Greenwood) are directed towards this very point. It is not true that the Government at this stage is satisfied that the increase of IS per cent, or whatever the proposed percentages are for the various States, is appropriate and is acceptable to it. Therefore, the whole of the case made by the Leader of the Opposition falls to the ground. The second point that I made concerned the motives of the Opposition in bringing this discussion forward on the very day on which the Minister for Health has gone to Sydney to undertake a difficult task in the interests of Australia and of contributors to the health scheme. It seems to me that the action of the Opposition today accords with its lack of responsibility. In the few minutes available to me, I wish to indicate why the Opposition has brought this matter on for discussion today rather than wait for the logical time to propose it which would be after the Minister has engaged in negotiations and the Government has made its decision. After all, the fees have not risen yet. They are not going to rise-if they are to rise-until lst July. So, time is still available to discuss this matter. Why has the Opposition proposed this matter for discussion today? I believe that there is one main reason for its action. This is that the Opposition is desperately worried because the health scheme that the Government has introduced has worked so well in the protection of Australians against the cost of illness. The Opposition is worried that the success of this scheme will continue. The Opposition is worried also because its members, aided and abetted by the Press, have made a deal of political mileage out of misleading the Australian public with respect to the Opposition's so called free health scheme. The Opposition is terrified that in the context of the success of the Government's scheme the public will discover that, for all practical purposes, the Opposition's scheme is not free at all. There is no better atmosphere than the present one in which to drive this point home. The public is aware in the current atmosphere that the medical profession is not exactly an easy profession with which to deal. I remind the public that the scheme proposed by the Opposition as a free health scheme is dependent entirely on the medical profession in Australia agreeing to charge 85 per cent of its common fee. If the doctors do not agree to charge 85 per cent of the common fee the patients will have to pay 15 per cent of the doctors' bills however large, whereas under the present scheme, particularly in relation to the larger medical bills, at the point at which the patient really needs protection the patient pays no more than $5 for a medical service when the doctor charges the common fee. Under the Labor Party's scheme if the doctor charges more than the common fee the patients will have to pay more than 15 per cent. I ask the House to consider, I ask the country to consider, and I ask the Press of this country, which has forborn from adequately probing and analysing the Labor Party scheme, to consider, with recent events and attitudes on the part of the medical profession fresh in their minds, how many medical practitioners of Australia will agree to charge 85 per cent of the present common fee. The Labor Party is terrified that the public will realise just how much of a confidence trick the Labor Party's scheme is. Members opposite know that the Government's scheme has worked, and if we are successful in our discussions and negotiations with the doctors it will continue to work, and it will continue to work well. This is why I believe members opposite have raised this matter of public importance today, on the very day in which the Minister for Health is going forward to negotiate with the medical profession. Members opposite hope that by this means they will wreck the negotiations.",41
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BENEFITS, Order ! The Minister's time has expired.,42
164,Mr HAYDEN,BENEFITS,"The former Minister for Health, now the Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes)perhaps a less controversial, or at least for him less controversial, portfolio-seeme d to make a Freudian slip in the course of his discussion. He frequently referred to the subject of terror, exposing almost a preoccupation on a personal level or probably a hangover from his previous experiences as Minister for Health. An interesting point which arose from his speech was his discovery that there is a conspiracy in this country between the capitalist Press and the Socialist Opposition. This is a rather interesting proposition that he has proposed. Dt Forbes-They are just lazy; they have not analysed your scheme.",42
165,Mr HAYDEN,BENEFITS,"Oh , the gentlemen of the Press are lazy. The Minister is expressfurther ing his attitude. If he has any more opinI ions perhaps he would like to express them so that we can have them on record. The Minister proceeded in his speech with ther nonsense, for which he is a past ter, and talked about the free health scheme of the Labor Party. There is not even a free meal available in the Auswere tralian community. Someone has to for it. It is a fundamental of economics that if more resources are to be devoted a specific area it must be taken away from another area in the community. What the Opposition has been talking about in its approach to health insurance is a more about IS per cent. efficient use of the public's money. It is not our money; it is the taxpayers' money. This is a point that I want to develop a little later. The Minister's terror about whether tors would accept the IS per cent rebate because of the economies which would derived through mass charging is quickly refuted by the fact that under workers compensation, the pensioner medical serto vice and our rehabilitation system all tors accept the rebate. While the Minister has been concerned about the common fee acceptance- a concept similar to his scheme as to ours- I draw the attention the House and of the public to statements the Minister was making before the 1969 elections when he was trying to indicate that there was a difference between a scale of fees which we were proposing and the common fees which the Government proof posed. He is now, in fact, conceding that there is no significant difference in the concept, though in practice it is another thing. fees According to an article written by Mr Eric Walsh in the 'National Review' over the Easter weekend, something like 20 per cent of doctors are charging more than common fee set by the Government. the Government scheme has not been parwhich he said: ticularly successful and accordingly this one of the reasons why we have made with, some suggestions about arbitration. Again, if I might take another point the Minister mentioned, he said that the Opposition is desperately worried that its scheme may no kept longer be as attractive as it once was and that the Government's scheme is proving more attractive. Over the Easter weekend I had to go to Melbourne for some work to the cause of democracy and while was there I noticed a gallup poll finding in one of the Melbourne daily newspapers which indicated that the Labor Party has fursomething like a 20 per cent lead on the masGovernment as far as public popularity and public opinion of the relative merits of their health schemes are concerned. If I the ex-Minister for Health I would pay feel no balm from the fact that the national health scheme in Great Britain, to which he frequently stigmatises, is able to attract something like 75 per cent popular support in the national opinion polls when his Government's scheme can attract only Let me move quickly to rebut 2 more points the Minister made. He said that the Labor Party was asserting that the Government had in fact accepted the proposals of docthe Australian Medical Association on fee increases This is not quite so. If one rebe reads the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) one will quickly detect that what he was trying to do was put a bit of backbone into the Governdocment to induce it to face up to the AMA and protect the taxpayers' interests-because it is the taxpayers' money we are using in this case. But if anyone in the of community believed that the Government had ceded to the AMA the right to these increased fees then that person would be justified in that belief. This belief is borne out by what they read in the daily newspapers. For instance, in the 'Courier Mail' the 20th of this month it was stated: But last night the Health Minister (Senator Greenwood) said that doctors had set up a new scale and ""we have to live with it"".' I have a copy of a transcript of a television interview with the Minister for Health the (Senator Greenwood) on an Australian So Broadcasting Commission programme in is . . . this is what the doctors have come up but what can the Government do? The doctors have recommended this fee to all doctors throughout Australia and accordingly I presume that is what doctors will charge. Now, what Government must do is, as far as possible, see that the cost of our health scheme ,is within bounds. '' So he was whimpering for concessions like a lap spaniel reproved by the AMA withlot out even trying to fight on behalf of the Australian taxpayers who are bearing very large proportion of the burden of keeping this scheme going. The final point made by the Minister is, as with all the others, demolished quickly. He was talking about arbitration and the 40 per cent the work force in Australia outside arbitrasorts tion. This is precisely the point we making. Doctors are part of this 40 cent and nowhere does one see any evischeme, dence that penalty clauses are applied against doctors when they challenge the Government's right in relation to fees participation in the scheme. I ask the Minister, for the healthy change it would provide for him, to produce a little rational thought when he approached things. The fact is that the Government's health insurance scheme is a model T performtaxpayers ance in the space age. Tinkering with spark plugs or fiddling with the motor this museum piece proves inordinately expensive. It achieves only marginal and very short term improvements in performto ance. As a vintage show piece model may have their place and interest but in the proper setting, a museum where they may rightfully, harmlessly and inexAMA, pensively blend into the past, their milieu. The scheme is, of course, as often been said in this House, cumbersome and costly to contributors and taxpayers and inefficiently and unsatisfactorily uses the public's money. Let me give some cases of this. In the period that the scheme has been in operation, from 1954-55 and 1969-70 funds benefits have increased 642 per cent- I am speaking of the benefit going to contributors when they make claim on the scheme-bu t reserves have increased by more than 1,173 per cent, a rate, incidentally, nearly twice as fast the rate of increase in fund benefits, and an acclerating rate at that. So what is pening is that the reserves are larding insurance companies at the expense of the contributors. Over the same period reserves as a percentatge of contributions rose sharply from 18.4 per cent to 43 per cent. This represents a substantial amount money. In 1969-70 contributions amounted $79m. They will probably be more $90m for this year. We are talking about a of money. It is not our money; it is not the Government's money. It is the public's a money. These people work hard for the money they have. They have a lot of competing demands to meet in their personal budgets, not the least of whioh is daily living, mamtaining educational standards, of accommodating standards and the normal of things that are needed in daily are existence. We have to see that when we per take money from them through a tax whether it is voluntary on the side of the contributors or compulsory on the side of taxpayers as it is to prop up this and scheme, we get as much mileage as we can out of every $1 that we spend of their money, consistent with good standards of professional service, the rights of people these and so on. This has not happened. Between 1954-55 and the end of this financial year the increased burden that will have to carry will have the grown by more than 1,061 per cent or of more than $89m. This is a fantastic increase. There has been no case presented justify this increase. In the same period Ts the consumer price index will have only increased by only 48.8 per cent. This grand and depredating old dame, the with more subtlety but equal deterright mination to Genghis Khan pressing a has siege, wants $35m. The terms are $10m and the rest later. Later the rest will probably be $25m to $30m. An indirect subsidy to the scheme will be provided by the taxpayers to the extent of $27m to $30m. When we look at the medical side alone by the charges additional to last year's increase of $41m will be from $62m to a $72m, and that will be so without even touching the area of hospital insurance. at Again, where is the justification for these as increases? Doctors who are swinging to preventicare get a free full-time qualified hapsister worth $60 a week and a free electric the typewriter connected to an IBM computer which takes the history and reduces the work of the general practitioner considerably. One would have expected that of this would be the time for a halt in increased charges and indeed this may well be an argument for reducing the to charges. Arbitration clearly must be conthan sidered and if the AMA will not be responsible in this matter then we have a far greater responsibility to the taxpayers of Australia and to the contributors of Australia to ensure that their money is responsibly protected (Quorum formed)",43
166,Mr HALLEIT,BENEFITS," The matter of public importance raised by the Opposition consists of exactly 5 words'Doctors' fees and medical benefits'. To speak only in terms of fees and medical benefits when dealing with this great area is to ignore the main issue if any government, regardless of where it may be, concentrated solely on the financial aspects of medical health and forgot the real personal and social aspects, I believe that it would be heading for trouble. I listened quite carefully to the two speakers from the Opposition side of the House on this matter. They almost entirely-and this certainly applies to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden)-spok e about the fees related to medical health, doctors fees and so on. This is not to say that fees in respect of medical health and doctors are unimportant-the y are important. But even more important is the doctor-patient relationship. If we destroy this, as has almost been done in some other countries, and endeavour to establish socialised medical and hospital benefit schemes, we destroy the whole of the medical scheme of a - country. That is why I believe that such a irelationship is so very important. The Government has a responsibility to - participate in any medical health scheme in this country. But up to this point it has been only participation so far as the Gov-ernment is concerned. If the Government were to take over and establish a socialised .scheme and thereby destroy the individual approach which is so extremely important it could destroy the relationship between the doctor and the patient. Heaven forbid the day when that happens in this country. This always has been uppermost in my :mind because I believe that even now in .some cases we are moving into this area. For various reasons certain of our hospitals are perhaps overcrowded. In many - cases doctors do not have time to give this personal attention. For instance, when, there are road accidents or when there is .an influx of patients, such cases have to be dealt with in a hurry. At these times the workload on doctors is tremendous and we lose to some extent the necessary doctorpatient relationship-w e take away the time factor that is needed to develop the relationship between the patient and the doctor. There are, of course, many things that one could mention about this subject. However, in my opinion the doctor-patient relationship is the most important. I believe that we must never lose sight of this and talk solely about the economics of the matter. Patients must feel that they belong and are not just a part of a pushbutton machine age. They must feel that they belong to someone when they are in a hospital to be treated. An interest must be taken in them. There are other areas of medical services which concern me to some extent. One is the variation in doctors fees between the States. Perhaps as time goes by the position may be rectified by those concerned. Discussions on this matter take place from time to time. Indeed, I understand that such a discussion is taking place today. The point was made by the Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes) that when matters of public importance are brought forward from time to time-and this has been quite frequently in recent weeks-it is noticeable that they relate to issues which are being debated by the Government or the responsible authorities and others involved. Often, as has happened today, a matter of public importance has been brought before the House when negotiations are taking place. Of course, this is the wrong time for such a matter to be discussed in this Parliament. These matters should not be raised when negotiations are taking place. I hope that in future when delicate negotiations are being undertaken on various aspects by people who are interested, the Parliament will not be called upon to debate such matters at that time. I have mentioned-let me return to them to some extent-the facts of life in the field of health today in Australia. Numerous people are involved in this area. There are the patients and of course also the doctors. Doctors are extremely important and we must have plenty of them. Some areas of Australia simply do no have enough doctors and this is a problem. The benefit funds also are a part of the scheme. They are important too. Of course, both Federal and State governments have their areas of responsibility. Whilst these various sections work in conjunction with each other we are moving in the right direction. If they cease to work together and the main responsibility falls on the Government to administer all aspects of health through the public purse and by Act of Parliament, I fear that the health of the people will be in jeopardy. All through the ages doctors have been independent inasmuch as a doctor runs his own practice in his own way and treats his patients, with whom he builds up a relationship, in his own way. It is well known that many doctors treat individual patients and their families for a lot less than the actual fee which may be charged. This is part of the relationship and the confidence that is built up between the patient and the doctor. If these things are changed by governments that very valuable relationship will be destroyed. Moving on further we have the hospitals and the nursing profession, which is a profession of its own. Those working in a hospital must be able to understand the patients. A hospital is not a machine on which buttons can be pressed. It is not a machine that can work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is an institution that must work around the clock. Hospital officials must understand every minute of the day what is going on with the patients in that hospital. We should not discuss the subject of health only from the point of view of the funds and the benefits that are available from a government or anywhere else. There are personal relationships between the people concerned and these, above all, are important. The matter that has been raised today refers only to fees and benefits. It does not deal with what I think are the major health issues; it deals with only one area. I hope that this Government will never look at only one area when it is dealing with health matters, whether it be in negotiations with doctors or whether in negotiations with the States or anybody else. I hope that it will not exclude from its considerations the interests of the patients and the doctor's responsibility to his patients. I would expect a matter of public importance relating to health to cover a broad area. I sincerely hope that we maintain the situation which we find in Australia today, and I am sure that it will be maintained while this Government is in office.",45
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BENEFITS, The discussion is now concluded. NA NA NA Ministerial Statement,46
168,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SCHOOL LIBRARIES PROGRAMME,"by leave- I am pleased to be in a position to inform honourable members that it is the Government's intention to introduce legislation into the Parliament later this year to provide for the extension for a further 3 years of the Commonwealth Secondary School Libraries Programme. The Commonwealth Libraries Programme, which will have provided a total of $27m for library facilities in Australian secondary schools between lst Januarv 1969 and 31st December 1971. wiil provide $30m over the 3 years beginning on lst January 1972. This is an increase of $3m over the total amount available during the first 3 years of the Programme. In the 2 years of its existence so far. the Libraries Programme has been widely accepted as a valuable contribution to Australian education at the secondary level. Considerable progress has been made to date but it is clear that an extension of the Programme is required in order to meet the further needs of schools in this field. We believe that the decision to extend the Programme, will allow the States and the non-government schools to engage in necessary forward planning, in the same way as has the recent announcement of the extension of the Commonwealth Technical Training Grants Programme and the earlier announcement of the Government's intention to extend the Secondary Schools Science Laboratories Programme when the it be present triennium finishes on 30th June 1971. The decision to continue these educational programmes is a clear indication of the Government's concern that Australian education should continueto develop to meet the growing needs and. expectations of the Community. As honourable members are aware, the Government is at present discussing with the States and with non-government schools the information obtained from the recent nation wide survey of needs in primary and secondary schools and in teacher education. NA ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) BILL 1971 Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading",46
169,Mr SNEDDEN,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain Parlia1967-68 mentary approval for payment to the International Development Association of a sum not exceeding the equivalent of $US48m in connection with the third about replenishment of the Resources of that institution. As most honourable members A will be aware, the International Developresources, ment Association, or IDA as it is commonly called, is an affiliate of - International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is often referred these days as the World Bank. IDA was set up in 1960 because many less develing oped countries were not able, or could afford, to borrow overseas on commercial terms. Many of these poorer countries did not have access to international capital markets because they could not establish a satisfactory credit rating. Moreover, most of them were already feeling the burden external debt repayments and had little - no capacity to service additional overseas loans at normal rates of interest and normal terms of repayment. IDA was established for the express purpose of proannual viding loans on concessional terms to such countries. IDA loans, or development credits they are called, bear no interest and are repayable over 50 years with a 10-year period of grace. A small service charge i of one per cent per annum is levied cover administrative expenses. I would emphasise that, notwithstanding these terms, the projects which IDA finances are subject to the same rigorous analysis and appraisal with respect to both their economic worth and their technical feasibility as the World Bank itself applies in its own lending operations. In fact the 2 institutions have a common staff and a common executive board. IDA now has more than 100 member countries which are divided into 2 broad groups. The more economically advanced countries are known as Part I members and the less-developed countries as Part II members. In 1960 Part I member countries, including Australia, agreed to subscribe roughly $US150m a year for 5 years to the initial capital stock of IDA. Australia's share of this total was 2.7 per cent involv) ing us in annual contributions of a little over $US4m. In 1963 Part I member countries agreed to replenish IDA's resources over the 3 years 1965-66 to at the rate of roughly $US250m a year. Australia's share of this total was again 2.7 per cent, involving us in annual contributions equivalent to $US6.6m, or two-thirds more than the rate of our subscription to IDA's initial capital stock. second replenishment of IDA's involving contributions of $US400m a year, was agreed for the 3 the years 1968-69 to 1970-71, although it came into effect only in July 1969 due to a to delay by the United States Congress in ratifying the relevant agreement and passthe necessary legislation to authorise not that country's participation. Australia reduced its percentage share of this second replenishment to 2 per cent, involving us in contributions of $US8m a year. All of these resources-whic h have been of supplemented by interest earned on investor ments, some additional voluntary contributions by a few Part I countries and transon fers amounting to $US485m which the World Bank has made to IDA out of its profits since 1963-64-ar e expected to be fully committed by the end of June this year for lending to less-developed countries. The need for a third replenishas ment of IDA's resources is, therefore urgent if IDA is to be able to continue its lending activities. After lengthy negotiaof tions, Part I member countries reached to agreement in June 1970 that, subject to parliamentary approval in their respective soft countries, IDA's resources should be replenished at the rate of $US800m a year over the 3 years commencing 1971-72. This represents a 100 per cent increase on the rate of contribution under the second replenishment exercise. Some special additional contributions will in fact raise the level of replenishment over this period to about $US813m a year. Agreement to replenish IDA's resources at this rate was reached only after some modifications to the percentage contributions of certain Part I countries. France and South Africa reduced their percentage shares, while Finland, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden increased theirs.

With the concurrence of honourable members.

Honourable members will observe from this table that, in this third replenishment, Australia's share will be maintained at 2 per cent. This will mean a doubling of our present rate of contribution to $US16m a year over the next 3 years. In deciding that Australia's share - of this replenishment should be maintained at 2 per cent, the Government had a number of considerations in mind. First and foremost IDA, like the World Bank, is an efficient institution. We know from practical experience that it can tackle complex development problems in a technically proficient way, country by country. It is by far the largest agency lending on concessional terms in the world today. In its first 10 years, for example, IDA extended 221 credits totalling nearly $US2.8 billion to 55 countries. In 1969-70 alone, 56 new credits totalling more than $US605m were approved. The Government is conscious of the fact that there is now something of a swing back in world opinion in favour of multilateral aid, particularly through the international developmentfinanceinstitutions like IDA. Needless to say, the developing countries, as a whole, attach great importance to a generous and early replenishment of IDA's resources. We are also mindful that IDA has been, and will continue to be, of particular benefit to the devfigure, eloping countries in our own part of the world. In the past, about three-quarters of all IDA lending has gone to countries in the Asiaq region. Lastfinancialyear, India alone received nearly $US230m from IDA, while Indonesia and Pakistan each received about $US80m. Finally, there is the prospect that Papua and New Guinea will benefit from this replenishment of IDA's resources. To date, Papua and New Guinea has received credits and loans totalling more than $US22m from IDA and the World Bank. Another loan of $US23m is expected to be approved shortly. Further proposals to borrow from these two institutions on the Territory's behalf are under consideration at the present time. During the discussions on the level of the third replenishment, agreement was also reached on a proposal to adjust the relative voting rights of individual Part I countries so as to reflect more accurately the total amounts which each such country had, or will have, contributed to IDA since 12669/71-R-[75 ] its inception. By way of background, I might explain that voting rights are based on subscriptions to IDA. I would emphasise this word, 'subscriptions'. By general consensus at the time, it had previously been decided that the additional resources put at IDA's disposal under the first and second replenishment exercises should not affect voting rights and for this reason the commitments then entered into took the form of contributions, and not additional subscriptions. In response to pressures from certain countries, which felt they were disadvantaged by this arrangement-that is, those which had increased their percentage shares, or made supplementary voluntary contributions to IDA, since it was first established-it has now been decided to redress this situation. This will be done by permitting Part I countries to make additional subscriptions, which will carry voting rights, to IDA as well as contributions under the third replenishment exercise, the relative proportions between the two varying in each instance so as to produce the overall voting adjustments desired. As a consequence of the fact that Australia reduced its percentage share under the second replenishment exercise to 2 per cent, and now proposes to maintain that our relative voting strength is to be reduced slightly. Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of the Association indicated that, of the total amount of $US48m which Australia is expected to make available to IDA over the next 3 years, $US583,440 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting rights. The balance will take the form of an additional contribution as in the case of the two previous replenishment exercises. This distinction is provided for in the Bill. The agreement governing the third replenishment exercise is subject to the explicit condition that it must be ratified by at least 12 Part I member countries whose prospective subscriptions and contributions aggregate not less than $US1.9 billion. Because of the size of the pledge to be made by the United States, this means that the agreement cannot enter into effect unless and until it is ratified by that country. It is hoped that all of the formalities to this end will be completed by 30th June 1971 so that IDA will have appropriate authority to enter into new lending commitments from the start of the next financial year. I ' should also like to explain to the House that our annual contributions to IDA are paid in the form of promissory notes which are cashed as and when funds are required by IDA. Actual cash payments reflect the pattern of disbursements by IDA and these usually lag well behind the commitments entered into when projects are approved. For example, cumulative cash payments to IDA by Australia as al the end of the current financial year arc expected to amount to about $A36m, compared with total pledges of more than $A57m by Australia since IDA's inception in 1960. I have a detailed break-up of these figures before me and, as they may be of some interest to honourable members, with the concurrence of the House I incorporate them in Hansard.

This Bill provides us with an opportunity to. demonstrate once again our support for IDA as an effective and efficient developmentfinanceinstitution, and our willingness to help, through IDA, the less developed countries to achieve faster rates of economic growth and thereby improve their standards of living in future. I need not emphasise the importance to be attached to this broad objective. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned.' LOANS (QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED) BOLL 1971 Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading",47
170,Mr SNEDDEN,CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO IDA," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to borrowings by the Commonwealth of $US29.58m ($A26.4m) from the ExportImport Bank of the United States and the Boeing company, and $US30m ($A26.8m) from a syndicate of United States commercial banks led by the Chase Manhattan BY AUSTRALIA Bank of New York to assist in financing the purchase of jet aircraft and related AccumuLated equipment by Qantas Airways Ltd. The 1 Cumu- Cumubalance outloan agreement with the Export-Import lative standing Bank and Boeing appears as the First s'ooo rooo Schedule to the Bill and the Second Schedule contains the agreement with the com900 2,704 mercial banks. The Export-Import Bank 7,208 10,812 226 2,«92 1,126 3,818 6,082 6,994 Agreement has been signed by all the par6,544 7,872 ties but some of the banks have yet for9,090 8,930 mally to sign the other agreement. However, it is expected fhat this process will be 14,774 9,139 20,779 9,027 completed shortly. 27,913 7,786 The proceeds of the loans will complete 29,933 12,909 the finance for the purchase by Qantas of 32,753 17,232 its first 4 Boeing 747 aircraft and related equipment, spares and services estimated to Minoi discrepancy due to cost in all $US140m ($A125m). Because of the cost of these aircraft and the fact that a large proportion of the contract price was not due to be paid until this year, the borrowings of approximately $US113m ($A101m) required by Qantas for the purchase were arranged in two tranches. As honourable members will recall, in 1968 a borrowing of $US53m from the ExportImport Bank, Boeing and a syndicate of United States commercial banks, led on that occasion by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, was arranged to finance pre-delivery payments on the aircraft and was. approved, by Parliament The present loans will complete the finance required by Qantas. The general arrangements for the borrowings are similar to those approved by Parliamentfor other loans for Qantas and Trans-Australia Airlines in recent years. The Commonwealth will he the borrower in the first instance, and the full proceeds of the loans will be made available to Qantas on terms and conditions to be determined by the Treasurer pursuant to clause 6 of the Bill. These terms and conditions will be the same as those under which the Commonwealth itself borrows the money. As the airline will be required to meet all charges under the loan agreement, the Commonwealth will, as usual, assume the function of an intermediary in these arrangements. Drawings on the present loans will commence in August, when the first aircraft is due for delivery. In accordance with normal lending practice in the United States, a commitment fee of. one-half of one per cent per annum is to be paid on the undrawn amounts of both loans. The Export-Import Bank loan is to be repaid in 7 semi-annual instalments beginning 15th November 1975. The Commercial Bank loan is repayable in 10 semi-annual instalments beginning 30th June 1972. Interest on the Export-Import Bank loan will be at 6 per cent. However, the lenders in this case have the right to sell the Commonwealth's obligations, in respect of amounts advanced, at prices involving additional interest costs to the Commonwealth of up to a maximum rate of 7 per cent. The Commercial Bank loan bears interest at a rate which is three-quarters of one per cent above the minimum commercial lending rate charged by Chase Manhattan Bankat present 5.25 per cent-and will fluctuate with that rate. The terms and conditions of the loans have been approved by the Australian Loan Council, and I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 April (vide page 1924), on motion by Mr Snedden: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
171,Mr TURNBULL,CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO IDA,"It had been my intention, during the 20 minutes that are available to members during this debate, to discuss the Australian economy as it affects the primary producer. However as less than half that time is available to me before 4 p.m. I . shall discuss another subject now and when the debate is resumed will refer to the Australian economy. So, without any notes or preparation, I shall speak on a subject which I had not intended to discuss-An zac Day. Today is 23rd April and ANZAC Day is 25th April. I often wonder whether many Australians nowadays regard ANZAC Day as an occasion for a holiday rather than as a holiday for a great occasion. In Victoria there will not be a holiday next Monday, but in New South Wales and other places there will be a holiday. I do not believe that ANZAC Day should be made the occasion for a holiday. If ANZAC Day falls on a day other than a Sunday there is a holiday but it should be regarded as a holiday for a great occasion.",51
172,Mr JAMES,CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO IDA,A sad occasion.,51
173,Mr TURNBULL,CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO IDA,"Of course it was a sad occasion and that is why I say that we should remember on that day the thoughts of those who still have memories of persons who died in the First World War at Gallipoli and in other places and treat the day accordingly. I was extremely disappointed when the Returned Services League, to some extent, and the people of Australia decided that ANZAC Day should be commemorated on the appropriate day, 25th April, and agreed to the holding of sports meetings in the afternoon of that day. Many people who go to the ANZAC Day services and celebrations in the morning of ANZAC Day constantly watch the time to ensure that they can get away to some sporting event. At a pleasant Sunday afternoon which was held in Wesley Church, Melbourne, Lord Casey said: 'Everything is changing'. We know things are changing, but are they changing for the better or worse? What is the yardstick by which we judge this? I 1970-71 would ask this: Are we taking into the new era, as it is called, those things that really matter to the older people in this community-justice , service, self-sacrifice and Christianity? People may say of me: 'You are an old man and the generation gap has caught up with you'. Nevertheless we should look around to see what is happening. Many young people are aware of these things, but a lot of people are not. I believe that we have to stand and show the flag wherever we can. We must build a strong nation. We often hear suggestions for world government, and people say that we should not try to lift our nation and be proud of it. I say that at public meetings and in Parliament we should state that we have a great nation here and we are proud of it. It seems to be suggested that we should not make exclamations of patriotism and loyalty; but after all, unless one's country is strong and rich one cannot do much for its inhabitants. Furthermore, one cannot do anything to help less fortunate nations, nations which many people in this country have great sympathy for and are anxious to give all the assistance they can. As far as the flag is concerned, it is hoisted at the schools every Monday morning. The children salute the flag and say a few words, but that is the end of it. When I made this point an another occasion a certain minister of religion said that this was no good at all, that the children just learned the words off by heart and it did not mean a thing. He said that they should stop this practice in the schools, and not raise the flag or say the prayer. I believe that we should have these things. We have a prayer said in this Parliament every sitting day, and people appreciate it. One can stagger around a. public place in this country drunk and no-one takes much notice; but if one stands while a troop of old soldiers march by, or if one salutes the flag-or even if one makes a speech like the one I am making now about this great nation-someon e is bound to titter and say: 'You are showing off.' Nevertheless, one should do it just the same. One could never show a finer sentiment. Many young people now regard the men who fought at Gallipoli and even those who fought in the Second World War as just being very foolish to do these things. I have a copy of a Melbourne newspaper which was published just before the First World War. It was kept by my people. On the front page there is a great headline saying: 'On the verge of a great war. Only a miracle can avert it.' The spirit of the people in those days was different to that of the people of today. Everyone was trying to uphold democracy and give the people of this world a chance for a better life. We would not be in peaceful occupation of Australia, nor would I have the opportunity of speaking in this Parliament at the present time had it not been for the sacrifice of the men to whom we pay homage on ANZAC Day. Therefore I think it is appropriate to say this before I continue with my speech on the Appropriation Bills. ",51
174,Mr TURNBULL,CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS TO IDA,"T h at is just where you are wrong. I think I should say something about ANZAC Day. When you are paying homage-and I hope you will be-to the men who died on Gallipoli and, of course, the men who served in all the fields of war-d n the air, on land and under the sea- I trust you will realise and try to make others realise that but for the sacrifices that were made by those Australians we would not be in peaceful occupancy of this country now. I cannot regard anybody who takes a different view to that as a, true Australian. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

(b) The adrninistrative division between West New Britain and East New Britain is fairly recent. Hitherto pupils from West New Britain District qualifying for entry to High School have entered schools in East New Britain District. Thus percentage entry to High Schools in WNBD was reduced to zero and the apparent percentage entry in ENBD was correspondingly inflated. Kimbe High School, West New Britain, commenced In 1971 with an initial planned intake of 80 students. The apparent percentage entry in Central District is also inflated by inter-district transfers.

In most districts the expatriate population in the secondary age groups is so small that there is no adequate basis on which to project this from the 1966 Census to provide percentage enrolment figures within each district separately. The multi-iacial high schools provide 6 years of education. Over the Territory as a whole there were 563 male non-indigenous in the relevant age groups in 1966 and 555 females. If this age cohort had grown at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, the enrolment percentages in 1970 would be equivalent to: boys, secondary 79 per cent, technical 0.5 per cent; girls, secondary 57 per cent, technical 1 per cent. General Notes to Tables and Enrolments (1) Details of enrolments in each district by age, sex and level of schooling will not be available for 1971 until mid year. Enumeration of the school age population currently rests on the 1966 Census. Until a second census is carried out later this year and differential rates of growth can be calculated for each district, estimates of school age population on a district basis are subject to a substantial margin of error especially where a single age cohort has to be calculated separately. Enrolment figures are given as for 1970 and the percentage of indigenous school age population enrolled in each level of schooling is calculated on the basis of the 1966 ngures with some allowance for growth; with the much smaller numbers of the non-indigenous age cohorts the likelihood of error would be much greater if the numbers were projected forward for these four years on a similar basis. At the primary levels places are provided for all expatriate children who request admission and are in the appropriate age groups. It may be assumed that enrolment of expatriate children is therefore close to 100 per cent in all districts. Enrolment statistics for indigenous and expatriate pupils are taken from the Bulletin of Official Statistics, Department of Education, Konedobu, 1970. (2) Enrolment in secondary and technical schools-indigenou s pupils. All pupils in Territory curriculum high schools take some technical subjects from the start of their courses. There were approximately 150 pupils enrolled in technical schools at the Form I level in 1970 but the major intake to technical schools and colleges occurs by transfer from high schools at the end of Form I I . Selection for entry to Form I in a secondary school or for enrolment in a vocational centre takes place on completion of the primary course and thus notionally at age 13 which is used here for the calculation of percentage enrolment. It should be noted that the technical colleges in Central, Morobe and East New Britain districts draw their intake partly from other districts.

197,Mr WHITLAM,ASSISTANCE FOR EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: What progress has been made since his predecessor's answers to me on 18th March 1970 (Hansard, page 528) and Sth June 1970 (Hansard, page 3087) in (a) the appointment of the 4,700 local employees of Commonwealth Departments in the of Papua and New Guinea to the Territory Public Service so that they can have tenure, career opportunities and retirement benefits applicable to local officers of that service and (b) the training and career development of local staff so that they can assume increased responsibility for work now being done by officers of Commonwealth departments. Branch Mr MCMAHON - I am advised by the Minister for External Territories and the Public Service Board that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Considerable progress has been made in establishing a framework for the permanent appointment to the Territory Public Service of those of the 4,700 local employees referred to who are eligible for such appointment. Some preliminary discussions have taken place with relevant staff representatives. Present indications, pending completion of a current survey, are that there are approximately 1,600 local staff who are employed in Commonwealth departments on conditions generally similar to those of Territory Pubhc Service staff employed under the Public Service (Papua and New Guinea) Ordinance and that less than half that number would meet the requirements for permanent appointment to the Territory Public Service. It is proposed that the permanent appointment of these persons will be effected from a common date, which has now been set as lst July 1971. Consideration is being given to the future status of those employed in salaried categories and who either do not meet permanent appointment requirements or may not wish to be appointed to the Territory Service on a permanent basis. The conditions of employment of the remaining local staff who are employed by the Commonwealth largely in day labour categories are to be considered in conjunction with the proposed introduction of a Day Labour Determination to cover all Administration local employees who are not eligible for appointment to the Territory Public Service on a permanent career basis. (b) Commonwealth departments have consolidated and further developed programmes of training for their local employees and the following details indicate the progress that has been made in the training and career development of local staff so that they can assume increased responsibility. Eight local employees of the Bureau of Meteorology have been trained at the Bureau's residential training centre in Port Moresby and are now capable of carrying out observer duties. An additional eight are nearing completion of initial observer training and ten have commenced training this year. One local graduate of the University of Papua and New Guinea is at present undertaking the Bureau's one-year meteorologist course in Melbourne, and on completion he is expected to take up duties in weather forecasting for aviation and general purposes in Papua and New Guinea. The Department ot Civil Aviation is this year sponsoring some 20 local cadets at the Institute of Technology for study towards the Diploma of Civil, Electrical or Mechanical Engineering. A Civil Aviation Training College has been established in Port Moresby to provide a three-stage course for Flight Service Officers and Air Traffic Controllers (which are now called Airways Operations Officers) and ten local trainees have commenced stage 1 of the course this year. An additional seven local trainees have enrolled for the preliminary year at the University of Papua and New Guinea to improve their formal educational standard prior to commencing traimng as Airways Operations Officers. The Department has also arranged for local trainees to enrol at the Administration Posts and Telegraphs Training College for training as linesmen and radio technicians. Training in clerical skills is also being encouraged and most clerical assistant and storeman positions in the Department in Papua and New Guinea are occupied by local employees. Arrangements have recently been made for local employees of the Commonwealth Department of Works to participate in the Papua and New Guinea Public Service Cadetship Scheme for full-time study at the University or Institute of Technology. One cadet is undertaking an engineering course and the Department is sponsoring seven additional cadets for tertiary level courses this year. In addition, eleven trainees are undertaking on a full or part-time basis certificate courses leading to sub-professional qualifications, sixty-five formal apprenticeships are current and eleven trainees are being trained in other industrial callings. The Department also has several trainees at the Administrative College in Port Moresby. Similar arrangements have been approved for the Auditor-General's Office to train local officers as auditors under the Territory Public Service Cadetship Scheme. The Public Service Cadetship Scheme is available to all Commonwealth departments in the Territory for the tertiary training of their local staff as suitable people become available. Departments are also able to participate in the Commonwealth Government's scheme for practical training in Australia. It is expected that increasing use will be made of these avenues for the training of local staff and for their career development. Taxation (Question No. 2596) Mr Berinson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What is the estimated additional income tax which will accrue to the Commonwealth as a result of the recent 6 per cent increase in wages in (a) the remainder of this financial year and (b) a full year. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Wage Case decision will affect income tax collections mainly via its impact on the incomes of wage and salary earners and hence via collections of Pay-As-You-Earn income taxation. Incomes of employers will also be affected by this increase in wage payments, but the effect of the National Wage Case increase on the incomes of individuals subject to provisional tax and the incomes of companies cannot be accurately estimated at present. These incomes will not, of course, be assessed for tax until 1971-72. (a) In gross terms the decision will add about $126m to P.A.Y.E. income tax collections in 1970-71. However, approximately half of this increase in .taxation collections was already allowed for in the assumptions underlying the Budget estimates so that estimated P.A.Y.E. collections will be increased by about $63m as a result of the decision. (b) As the National Wage Case decision will be operative for only six months in the financial year 1970-71 the full-year effect of the decision would be approximately twice the amount mentioned above for 1970-71, that is, about $252m. (Question No. 2602) Mr Webb asked the Treasurer, upon notice: In view of recent increases in salaries and also increases in cost ot Hving, will he consider granting increases in pensions to those in receipt of Commonwealth Superannuation payments. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government reviews regularly the levels of Commonwealth Superannuation pensionspaid to ' former employees of the Commonwealth or their surance beneficiaries. These reviews have resulted, ever the insurance years in substantial increases in the employer comestimated ponent of these pensions. The position wHl again be reviewed during the formulation of the 1971-72 Budget. «Qvesttoa No. 2502)",64

200,Mr WHITLAM,PARTY INSURANCE CLAIMS,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What would be the estimated loss to revenue if taxpayers could deduct from their taxable income the amount they spent on public transport between their places of residence and work. (2) What would be the estimated gain to revenue if taxpayers whose employers provide them with transport between their places of residence and work had to state as income the amount they would have to spend on public transport between those places.

In all, about 50 meetings have taken place and it would not be practical to do other than to highlight the more important things hat these meetings have covered. Briefly, some of these matters were as follows: (a) The development and acceptance of Noise Exposure Forecasts. An early and important task that was performed by several of the Airport Noise Abatement Committees related to the development of a Noise Exposure Forecast, and its subsequent acceptance. These forecasts involved highly complex issues and their development has occupied a great deal of Committee attention. It would be difncult to over-estimate the importance of this work because Noise Exposure Forecasts provide a - means by which planning authorities can consider the zoning of land in a way that is compatible with the amount of aircraft noise to be expected in the future. (b) The examination of statistics on the use of runways for take-offs and landings. It will be readily understood that the runways used at an airport for take-off and landing have a real effect on the noise generated over particular localities. Committees have called for, and examined the statistics ing to, the manner in which runways have been used at various airports during day and night hours, together with details of wind speed and direction. Certain recommendations for modifications in the application of the formulae employed for runway use have been implemented. (c) The examination of aircraft flight paths. The choice of flight paths adopted by aircraft has an effect on communities, and Committees have undertaken detailed studies of prescribed flight paths at several locations. Certain recommendations for modifications have been received and implemented. (d) The examination of aircraft operating procedures. The way in which a pilot operates an aircraft has an effect on noise generation, and it is sometimes possible to reduce these effects by the adoption of such practices as steeper climbs and descents, the application of power changes at different geographic locations, etc. Committees have examined such practices and certain modifications have been adopted as a result. - (e) The examination of aircraft ground running procedures. It is necessary for aircraft engines to be ground run after maintenance has been carried out. Certain restrictions have been prescribed to limit the resultant noise in nearby communities, as far as is practicable. Committees have reviewed the standing procedures that govern this activity, and certain changes have been accepted. (f) Flight training operations. Flight crews are required to undertake initial and recurrent flight training to ensure their competency. Initial training is conducted at training airports but some recurrent training and checking is carried out elsewhere. As a result of Committees' recommendations, a substantial amount of flight crew training has been located at less noise sensitive localities. (g) A brochure on aircraft noise abatement. One Committee recommended the production of a public relations brochure which would inform the public on what had been achieved in the field of aircraft noise abatement. The brochure is nearing completion and will be available for distribution within a short time. (b) General. Airport Noise Abatement Committees are considered to have performed very valuable work and they have made a real contribution towards abating the aircraft noise problem. I have only detailed the more important aspects of tiieir work and would be disappointed if they did not contribute even more to the general problem, as time goes on. (5) Noise Abatement Committees comprise representatives of all local government bodies where aircraft noise is a substantial problem, the appropriate planning authorities, the airline operators, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the Department of Civil Aviation. The representation is necessarily large and on one Committee about thirteen councils are represented. Consideration Is relat- being given to the formation of small working groups to handle specified tasks under Commiitee direction. Such an action could conceivably result in even greater and more effective output. Aircraft Accident (Question No. 3078) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: Will the Minister supply me (Mr Jones) with a copy of the report on completion of the inquiry into the near serious accident between the Canadian Pacific DC8 aircraft and a Trans-Australia Airlines Boeing 727 at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on 29th January 1971.",71

217,Dr MACKAY,INVESTMENT IN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Royal Australian Navy enlists Aboriginals with the necessary enlistment standards which apply to all prospective entrants.

(2) If so, when did the Actuary receive the last of the statistical material. (3) Is the actuarial investigation for the period lst July 1962 to 30th June 1967. (4) When is it anticipated that the Actuary's report will be presented to the Superannuation Board. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) 8th January 1971. (3) Yes. (4) Early in the Third Quarter of 1971. National Wage Case (Question No. 2711)",73
220,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INVESTMENT IN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What will the last National Wage Case cost the Commonwealth in its own wages and salaries bill (2) What amount of this will be offset by increased revenue from income and pay roll tax collections. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1970 National Wage Case decision is estimated to add directly more than $40m to the Commonwealth's own wages and salaries bill in 1970-71. In addition to the cost to the Commonwealth's wages and salaries bill there will be other increased demands on the Commonwealth Budget as a result of the decision. (2) The 1970 National Wage Case decision is estimated to have increased Commonwealth revenues from income and pay-roll tax in 1970-71 by about 1134m in gross terms. However approximately half of this increase was already allowed for in the Budget estimates. The increase awarded by the Commission will therefore involve an upward revision of about $67m to the Budget estimates of Commonwealth tax revenues from these sources in 1970-71. About $63m of this revision is attributable to gross PAYE income tax collections and about $4m to gross pay-roll tax collections. Taxation (Question No. 3032) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Are the teachers brought to Australia by the Victorian Government to work in State schools for 2-year periods exempt from Australian income tax. (2) If so, what is the estimated cost to revenue for each teacher. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Teachers may be eligible for exemption from Australian income tax only if they are from countries with which Australia has entered into double taxation agreements providing for such an exemption, viz. the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand or Japan. Australia's double taxation agreements with those countries provide, subject to certain qualifications, for the exemption from Australian income tax of income derived from teaching in Australia for up to 2 years by visiting teachers from those countries. A similar exemption is provided by the countries concerned to visiting Australian teachers. The purpose of the exemption is not to free the teachers concerned from all taxation, since they remain liable to tax under the law of their country of residence. (2) In the absence of details as to earnings and allowable deductions it is not possible to estimate the cost to revenue of exempting each visiting teacher. Against the total cost to Australian revenue of exempting visiting teachers from the countries concerned must be set the gain to Australian income tax revenue resulting from the reciprocal exemption of Australian teachers visiting those countries. National Service: Aliens (Question No. 2453) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) How many aliens have been called up for national service in each year. (2) How many have exercised the option of becoming naturalised after a period of three months national service. (3) How many chose to return to their homelands rather than undergo national service. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As from lst January, 1967 non-British subjects ordinarily resident in Australia became liable to register and render national service. Prior to that date they had no liability but were eligible to volunteer. The number of men who stated at the time they registered that they were other than British subjects and have been called up each year is detailed below. Some of these men will no doubt have become naturalised between the time of registration and of call-up though their precise number is not known. 1965-1966 .. .. 1967 .. .. .. 1968 .. .. . . 133 volunteers 1969 .. .. . . 186 volunteers 1970 .. .. . . 182 volunteers NA FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (OTHER THAN MANAGERIAL, Survey earnings October 1966 8.20 October 1967 9.00 October 1968 . . 10.10 October 1969 . . 11.50 October 1970(b) 12.30 (2) I am advised that 32 national servicemen exercised the option up to 31st March 1971. (3) Non-British subjects who have come to Australia and become liable for national service are not called up until they have been in Australia for at least 2 years or until after they reach the age of 21, whichever is the later. Any who then wish to leave Australia rather than be called up are on application permitted to do so and 79 such men have been granted permission. These men are given the opportunity to have their fitness for service determined before they take a final decision. Any man liable for national service who has left Australia and returns before he reaches 30 years of age remains liable for national service subject to recognition of any period of continuous full-time service which he may bave rendered in the naval, military or air force of another country. Weekly Earnings (Question No. 2650)",73
221,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AVERAGE WEEKLY OVERTIME AND,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) What portion of the average weekly earnings in Australia represents payment for overtime. (2) By what percentage has the average weekly earnings exceeded the minimum wage in each of the last 20 years. (3) How do the award wages awarded by the Arbitration Commission in each of the last 20 years compare with the weekly wages actually paid by employers bound by such awards. (4) Is there a continuation in the growth of over-award earnings. Mr Lyncli-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Statistician obtains a dissection of average weekly earnings between overtime earnings and ordinary time earnings for 9 volunteers employees in private employment, by means of a 9 volunteers sample survey he conducts in October each year.

(4) Estimates prepared by my Department suggest that in 1967 and 1968 over-award payments per employee were probably responsible for about 13 per cent of the increase in average weekly earnings per employee. In 1969, their contribution may have increased to about 30 per cent and in 1970 over-award payments could have accounted for as much as 40 per cent of the increase in average weekly earnings. Industrial Accidents (Question No. 2518)",74
222,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,BASIC WAGE HATES AND THE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: What was the (a) frequency rate per 100,000 man hours worked and (b) severity rate (man hours lost per 100,000 man hours worked) of industrial accidents in each of the States and within the Commonwealth Public Service during each of the last 5 years for which figures are available. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: State compensation statistics do not contain figures for the numbers of persons atrisk and hence it is not possible to calculate frequency or severity rates. In Commonwealth employment the frequency and severity rates, on the .basis of 100,000 man hours worked, were: 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 1968-69 Frequency .. 2.82 2.62 2.S9 2.53 2.35 Severity .. 252 230 211 Employment: Overseas Qualifications (Question No. 2897) Mr Reynolds asker the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) What committees exist for the study of overseas qualifications for the assessment of their acceptance in Australia.

Holmes, Secretary, Department of Labour and National Service (3) During the period June to December 1970, the Central (Engineering Trades), (Electrical Trades), (Boilermaking Trades), (Blacksmithing Trades) and (Sheetmetal Trades) Committees considered the Report of the Tripartite Mission on the Training of Skilled Workers in Europe and drew up new criteria for the recognition of tradesmen for these trades from the seventeen countries visited by the Mission. These countries were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. The criteria adopted became operative as each Committee reached agreement on the criteria for a particular country as Ministerial approval was not required under the provisions of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946-66. (4) The Central (Bool Trades) Committee has not met to consider the implications of the Report of the Tripartite Mission on the Training of Skilled Workers in Europe, but it is hoped that it will in the near future. As only a few boot tradesmen have been selected for migration to Australia from Europe in recent years, the fact that new criteria for these trades have not been drawn up has not meant that any prospective migrant has been disadvantaged Airport Catering (Question No. 3111)",76

(3) What number and percentage of plantation owners have established stores.",79
230,Mr BARNES,BASIC WAGE HATES AND THE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Business Development in the House of Assembly for Papua and New Guinea. The Administrator on the advice of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Business Development has provided the following information: 'The training section of the Department of Business Development conducts formal courses at many locations throughout the Territory in trade store management. Business Advisory Officers conduct similar courses and are providing advice and assistance in the store to hundreds of operators throughout the Territory. Generally there are far too many sub-economic indigenous owned trade stores (total over 6,000) in the Territory. Provision of training and finance would result in the closure of large numbers. Real or inferred prestige motivates the establishment of many stores which provide very poor service and prices to consumers and purely nominal returns to owners.' (2)(a) The matter referred to is one which falls First Second Third within the authority of the Ministerial Member Division Division Division for Labour in the House of Assembly for Papua and New Guinea. The Administrator on the advice of the Ministerial Member for Labour has provided the following information: '(a) Operations of trade stores are regulated by 654 6,385 the provisions of the Native Employment 381 5,641 Ordinance 1958-1970, the Trading with Natives Ordinance 1946-1953, the Transac1,035 12,026 tions with Natives Ordinance 1958-1963 and the Prices Regulation Ordinance 19491970; 1,050 167 (b) Inspections are made by Labour officers to 1,789 622 ensure compliance with the provisions of 754 1,600 the Native Employment Ordinance 19581970; 19 3,593 2,389 (c) The provisions of the Trading with Natives Ordinance 1946-1953 are administered by officers of the Department of the Administrator. The provisions of the Transactions with Natives Ordinance 1958-1963 are also administered by officers of the Department of the Administrator conjointly with officers of the Department of the Treasury, who oversights and enforce, where necessary, the provisions of the Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949-1970.' (2) (b) International Labour Organisation Convention No. 95 has not been ratified by the Commonwealth Government nor extended to Papua and New Guinea. The provisions of the Territory Ordinances referred to in Part (2) (a) above do however give substantial effect to the principles enunciated in Article 7 of Convention No. 95. (3) Statistics on the number and percentage of plantation owners who have established trade stores are not available. To obtain accurate statistics, it is necessary to contact approximately 129 Local Government Councils to obtain figures of trading licences issued and to contact Government stations in areas where councils do not have the power to issue licences; the information will be provided in due course.

(3) If control of the environment is regarded as a State matter, would separate contributions to the conference from each Australian State meet with his approval (4) Is the hoMhaa of the conference a good reason for insisting that the Office of the Environment should be set up without delay, so that it can co-ordinate efforts. (3) Is he able ta say whether any of the officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs who' are working on the Australian contribution know anything about cnvhwiimental problems. (6) Do any of the representatives who are representing Australia m preliminary meetings on the conference in New York have any expertise in this field.

(2) to (4), (7) and (8) Australia will be represented by a delegation whose members will be selected nearer the'time when the conference is to meet in June 1972. A Preparatory Committee has held two sessions (and will hold a third session in September 1971) to decide, inter alia, upon the agenda for the Conference. Australia has already submitted material on request to assist in the preparations for the Conference. When the agenda isfinalised, steps will be taken to prepare guidance and briefing for an Australian delegation. Consultations for this purpose will take place among Commonwealth Departments and with State authorities and other bodies as appropriate. Pending the establishment of the Office of the Environment there will be interim co-ordinating arrangements.

These observers have been officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs stationed in these cities. Though not technical experts in thesefields,these officers have prepared useful reports on the proceedings of the meetings.

(b) Clauses 3 and 4 modify Articles 63 and 72 respectively, with regard to the privilege of a Member of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly of a State in respect of anything said in either House of Assembly. The effect of the amendment is that if a Member of Parliament or Legislative Assembly of a State is charged with an offence under any law passed by Parliament by virtue of Clause 2 of the Bill, the defence of privilege under the said Articles will not be available to him. (c) Clause 5 amends Article 152 to define the Per week term 'official purpose' to provide that s National Language shall be used for purposes of all public authorities. . . 0.87 (d) Clause 6 amends Article 153 to: 2.50 (i) provide for parity of natives of any of .. 0.36 the Borneo States with Malays in West .. 0.25 Malaysia; .. 0.50 (ii) expressly provide the power of the Malaysia Yang di-Pertuan Agong to ensure the reservation for Malays and natives of any of the Borneo States of a reasonable proportion of places in universities, colleges and other educational institutions providing education after the Malaysian Certificate of Education or its equivalent. (e) Clause 7 provides that no amendment may be made to the provisions contained in Clause 2 of the Bill and to any laws made thereunder, the provisions relating to citizenship (Part III of the Constitution), Article 63, 72, 152 and Clause 5 or Article 159 without the consent of the Conference of Rulers. (f) Clause 8 makes amendments to Article 161A consequential to the amendments made to Article 153. (2) No. (3) (a) Refer to 1 (c) above. (b) Refer to 1 (a), 1 (d) (ii), 1 (e) above.
