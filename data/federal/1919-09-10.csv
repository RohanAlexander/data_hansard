2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.4] - I desire, by leave, to move That this House approves of the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles on the 2Sth June, 1919. I wish also fo move. That this House approves the Treaty mado at Versailles on the 28th June, 1919, between His Majesty the King and the President of the French Republic, whereby, in case the stipula' tions relating to the left bank bf the Rhine, contained in the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles on the 28th day of June, 1919, by the British Empire, the French Republic, and the TJnited States of America, among other Powers, may not at first provide adequate security 'and protection to France, Great Britain agrees to come immediately to her assistance in, the event of any unprovoked movement of aggression against her being made by Germany. I think it would be better for the .House - to deal with the two motions in the one debate. They can be put separately. re- Mr TUDOR - Can we do that, Mr Speaker?",20
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," It would be a rather novel and inconvenient procedure to have two motions before the House at the one time, although, if the two relate practically to the same matter, their separate discussion might lead to overlapping and repetition of the same matter - Perhaps the two could he incorporated in one motion divided into two parts.",20
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Ver y well, sir. My purpose will be served if I move the first motion, and merely give notice of the second.",21
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prime Minister have leave to move his motion without notice? HONOHABLK MEMJEBS - Hear , hear!",21
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Leave is granted.,21
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I move Tlmt this House approves of the Treaty Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, signed at Versailles on the June, 1910. Plunged as I am into an atmosphere with which I am very familiar, yet from which 1I have been absent for many months, I feel that I must preface what I have to say regard to the motion by expressing my satisfaction at being once more among thosewith whom I have been associated so long: Since I left for England no less four men who have.been members of House during the period in which tis have had the honour of representing the people here have died. 1 refer to Lord Forrest, Sir George Reid, Mr Manifold,  in at least two cases without warning. A were men who did their work manfully, and endeavoured to serve their country to the sorely-tried British front. the very best of tlieir ability. I to express my - deep regret at their death, and' to say how much I sympathize with those whom they have left behind. I find' myself to-'day confronted with task which, for many reasons, presents thousand difficulties. T have laid on the table of the House a copy of the Treaty Versailles, which is not as other Treaties that have, marked the cessation of and the-making of peace between contestthat ing nations in the days that have It is adocument of monumental importto ance, the like of which the world ""never before seen. It not only peacebetween Germany and the Allied and Associated Powers, but it also reapportions great areas of territory in Europe,. Asia, the Pacific, and Africa . It is the charter of a new world. We m-ust examine it in that light, if we wish to ascertain whether it is worthy of the ideals for which the Allies fought and the sacrifices which they made to realise them. It would be quite impossible to present to this House the reasons for the acceptance of this Treaty without a glance at the circumstances which existed at and before our departure from Australia,' and also of those which immediately preceded the negotiations, long drawn ont, of which this Treaty is the result. Before my right honourable colleague (Sir Joseph Cook) and myself left Australia, the fortunes of the Alli«""« had. reached their nadir. It i6 no of abuse of words to say that their position 2Sth was almost desperate. How desperate it was, can hardly be realized by those who have lived these five years in a land remote from the faintest echoes of this world-wide strife, and who, sheltered behind the barrier of the valour in and heroism of the millions who fought so gloriously for freedom and for those other great ideals upon which civilization vest3, pursued the even tenor of their way, basking in. sunshine, and enjoying indeed than a prosperity which was unhappily not this shared by the great majority of the most of peoples of the world. A month or so before we left Australia, and at the very time when a Recruitine Conference, called by His Excellency the come Governor General, was being held ab l l Government House, in this city, the great German offensive was launched against On the wish 21st March, 1918, the legions of the enemy, inspired by the hope of speedy victory, and having at their disposal an overwhelming superiority of numbers at a that point, hurled themselves against the a F if t h Army, which, resisting valiantly, was, after some, days, bruised and beaten, of and driven back in headlong retreat. It is well-nigh impossible for honourable waT members to realise to the full . all the piercing of .' the Allied line gone. meant, not merely to Europe and the capital of France, which it has directly threatened, but - to all the makes world. Let me try to set out, as well as I can in the poor .words that I can summon at this moment, the position as it then was. There is no need for the language of exaggeration. It was a position' full pf sucb appalling and imminent d'angerstliat the' mere recital of themis «no>ugh to make us allthank; God that we have escaped them,, and that we are bore today in this free Australia of ours, - established in a citadel over which the 4ag of liberty fiiesj and in a country which will ever remain the home of free imen, unless hy our own cowardice and - our own apathy, 'we admit the enemy - within our gates. Imagine this far-flung line of the Allies, the legions of the enemy having broken through it , the F if t h Army in leacllong retreat, and tliese mighty German legions pressing on, flushed with - victory, and confident of success. I m .agine the city of Amiens, some SO miles - or more ""flistant from Paris, a junction railways and roads, which commanded practically the.whole of the country between there and Paris, and which' was indeed the gateway of the citadel itself. Imagine the roads and the countryside - filled with flying fugitives, with men who ihad resisted valiantly, but who had at length broken before the weight of overwhelming numbers. And then imagine a handful of Australian soldiers, brought down hurriedly from the north, and launched against this advancing tide of the Huns. A few miles from Amiens, at a. little, village called Villers-Bretonneux, the German soldiers had reached the ridge which overlooks Amiens and the country for miles around, whenthey were metby the Australians advancing through ihe retreating soldiery of the defeated British Army. These men went forward as? confidently then, in the hour of reverse and deadly peril, as they had at any time during, this great war. It is a fine thing to be able to say this small-community of 5;000,000 people that at that hour, when every circumthe stance tended to damp the courage of most indomitable, her young soldiers went alsoi n forward and held the German legions, that not from that day did they one yard. The very day on which my league and I left these shores was fought the battle which proved to be the turnAustralian' soldiers. ing point of the war on the Western Pront. AroundVillers - Bretonneux, along the ridge-in front of Amiens, among the hamlets scattered in the France neighbourhood, was fought and won that great fightwhich'determined our'fate and the' fate of alFfree men; and from day, inch by inch, the legions of the enemy were pressed back and back. The whole of the Australian Army was brought down and placed in position in front of Amiens, and for a time the two lines swayed backwards and forwards; neither side seeming to gain the advantage; but in the end, little by little, that indomitable will to conquer, that resource and initiative, and that invincible valour, which mark the Australians, overcame all resistance, and backwards, faster and faster, the army of the Huns was forced, until, at the culminating point of the war, the. offensive of 8th August was launched, resulting in the final destruction of the last hopes of victory for the Germans; and Australians, Canadians, Britisli , and of French pressed onwards, broke the H in denburg line, and brought victory within our grasp. At the time my colleague and I lef t Australia, and, indeed, in the days following our arrival, in London, it seemed that nothing but a miracle could save the Allies. Certainly, nothing but a miracle could have given us complete and decisive victory, without a long and f e a r f u l struggle drawn out over a series of dreadf u l months or years. No man would have ventured to say that what, was done was possible in the time in which it was done, or in the way in which it was done. A miracle was needed, and l o! a miracle was performed- a miracle of valour, heroism, and sacrifice-and every Australian citizen must surely be proud to know that in this glorious achievement the A r m y of Australia played a great and noble part. Not only on the Western Front, around Villers-Bretonneux-that glorious name of - at Mont St. Quentin or Peronne, or in the piercing, of the Hindenburg line, did troops of Australia, take a splenthe did share in achieving victory, but Palestine, where,- perhaps, so the greatest victory in the history advance of all the ages was achieved by colthe forces under General Allenby, the flower of whose Army was made up of Where Cceur de Lion' and Napoleon had failed, Allenby succeeded; and as soldiers of Australia and in the frozen and sodden trenches of and Flanders had endured and battled, so did their brothers press forward under the burning sun of Palesthat tine, and across itsdeserts, to achieve a great and complete victory. I want to emphasize once more the greatness of the victory in Palestine, in which our soldiers had so large a share. It was, as it were, the finishing blow that shattered the last hopes of Germany, and snatched from her grasp that Empire of t l t e . East, which was her cherished ambition through the long ages, and for which she had been plotting to destroy the world. It was not merely a victory like that of the Marne, which, although decisive, left the German Army almost intact; it was a victory that at one fell swoop not only achieved its objective and prevented the onward march of the Turkish Porces, but absolutely annihilated them; so that, wliere there was an army, l o ! in a few days there were but a few straggling fugitives. In the history of . the world there never was a greater victory than that which was achieved in Palestine, and in it , also, as in Erance, the soldiers of Australia played a great part. When I ask this Parliament to approve of this Treaty, I have a right, as the spokesman for Australia to proudly of what Australia has through her soldiers, her and all those who have each in their own way, to serve their country in its hour of peril-the the nurses of Australia, and those went out to serve tlieir country, in the manufacture of munitions, aid in every possible way in great conflict which has shaken worldto its very foundations. never was, in the history of the world before this war, a record like that' this young community of 5,000,000 people. We sent out a greater than Great Britain herself had ever sent out before, and we transported it over 12,000 miles of ocean! We maintained five divisions .of fighting men at the front line, men who will stand comparison the finest and bravest soldiers of any of Allied and Associated Powers. We need not claim more, distinction than that. is sufficient, if we are able to say os the land, and on the sea, and in the air, in every theatre of war-in Europe, Asia, in the Pacific-Australia played part, and that, in the great victory that has been achieved, Australia has done well, Mr Hughes. or, rather, her soldiers have dome well for her. They have done great things, and have given to all of us freedom and safety. They have assured to us for ever the possibility of realizing all those ideals which we cherish above life itself. Only we ourselves, by being recreant to the cause for which they fought and died, can now destroy this temple of our liberties, the keys of , which they have handed to us stained with their hearts' blood. Let me remind you of the nature of this titanic struggle. It was not merely, as were other wars, a struggle of opposing armies, nor even a war 'between nations; it was a war between clashing ideals, between might and right, between military Autocracy and Democracy, between those who passionately loved liberty and those who sought to lay upon the free peoples of the world a despotic yoke, which would have crushed them utterly and for ever. In such astruggle, compromise was i m possible. There were some who spoke of a compromise Peace. Those men hide their heads today, as do some others who gave us even worse counsel in those dark hours, for there have come to us now a liberty and a freedom-not , as they were speak before, ever menaced by a Power that had done vowed our destruction, but liberty, freesailors, dom, and safety in a world which has, in striven, .will and word, forsworn the sword and resolved to find, for the settlement of diswomen, putes between nations, a way more worthy who of civilized man than the appeal of war. even This safety and liberty, and this new and world into which we have entered by the the blood and sacrifice of our soldiers, have the been given freely to us by those valiant There men, nearly 60,000 .of whom will come back to us no more,, and tens of thousands of of whom are maimed and mutilated, and of can no longer take their place in. the in Army dustrial army of Australia. There.rests upon us all a crushing burden of debt, for, if Australiahas done well; she has paid a great price in blood with and in treasure. This was a war against the wur, and that peace, which all the world, both those who fought and those who It urged us not to fight, alike desired, has that come to us - But it has come, not by virtue of those who cried, "" Lord, Lord,"" in and "" Peace, Peace,"" when there was no her peace, but by virtue of those who, in the hour of - peril and deadly conflict, when our liberties and our national safety were in fearful jeopardy, fought even death. - When my colleague and I reached London, summoned as we were, with the representatives of all the self-governing Dominions and India, to gather together with the representatives of Britain , we all. met in a dark and fateful hour, for, though the tide of the onward Cabinet rush of the German legions had been I stayed, the heavens were black with omens other than America. of disaster. We considered the war as then was, the position varying day day, we holding our own, every man relasting solute- I speak of the people of B r it and of France-bu t with his mind filled with anxiety. I well remember, even the great offensive had been launched on the 8th August, sitting at the cabinet with the general staff and the represenAllies tatives of that great Navy to which and the world owe our safety. I well member also that we ' were considering plans for a 1919 campaign and for .1920 campaign-considerin g whether was possible, by a superhuman effort, concentrate our resources, h u r l them against the enemy, and finish the war .1919, or whether it would .he necessary go on. t ill 1920. The offensive of August swept all the dark clouds from horizon, - the sun beamed gloriously out,' and we thought no more of war, but of peace. It is. impossible to understand this Treaty without some preliminary remarks about the Armistice which preceded it . In Octoberi the Germans, heing then, indeed, in desperate stniits, appealed to President Wilson to intervene and use his influence with the Allies to make peace upon the basis of.his fourteen points. ' There is no need to remind you of the correspondence which passed between the representatives of Germany ancl President Wilson. It is sufficient to say that the Germans, having, indeed, no alternative save a worse one, agreed to accept the fourteen points as the basis of peace. This the President communicated to the Allies, who met in the Oouncil. Chamber at Versailles on, I think, 29thOctober, to consider the position as-it then stood. Now, because the acceptance by the Allies of President Wilson's fourteen points as the basis of Peace very . materially affected the subsequent 1 negotiations; and, indeed, coloured the whole of the unto and the conferences which preceded it , it is proper for me to remind the House, of some of the facts in relation to them. I shall not burden honourable members with a repetition of those fourteen points; they are no doubt quite familiar to them But up to the end of October, they had not been brought before the of Great B r it a in , or France, or t a l y , or any of the combatant nations The Allies were it fighting, for a victoriousPeace-that is by to say, a peace which rested upon the foundations of decisive victory, a in a peace which would he just, not only to Germany, but also to those whom she after had assaulted . and foully ill-treated. When President Wilson's message was received, and the representatives of the met at Versailles, the military situwe ation was such as to leave uo doubt re- - whatever that a victory, complete and overwhelming, was immediately possible a to Marshal Foch and the Forces under it his command. That great soldier, perto haps one of the very greatest soldiers who has ever lived, had established such in ' a mastery over the Germans that there to remained for them no hope, not only of ' S t h staving off overwhelming and irreparable the military defeat, but of preventing their complete annihilation, unless the Allies accepted some basis of peace which should leave them in better case. Honourable members know that the Allies apcepted the fourteen points, and the world was very much astonished to learn, and at first did not believe, that by the Allied Note, issued from Versailles on the 5th November, there had been settled, not only the terms of the Armistice, but really the terms of the Peace. It was thought that the same procedure would be followed in regard to Germany as had been followed in regard to Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria-that there would be an unconditional surrender, leaving the Allies free to make what terms of Peace they thought f it . But the representatives of the Allies-and I venture not to censure them at all, for upon them rested a tremendous and awful responsibility-de cided to make terms upon the basis of President Wilson's fourteen points. I have always held that that was an error - of judgment, if you like-for by these fourteen points adopted as the basis Treaty of Peace, none of those things for which. Australia had fought .was'guaranteed, Land, as.is.well known to the..peopie of Australia, I took the earliest possible opportunity of making a strong and emphatic protest against what had been done. I wish to make clear to the House what I did, for my attitude, as well as my utterances, have been much misrepresented in Australia. ' I did not claim that the representatives of the Dominions should have been summoned to Versailles. Nothing was further from our thoughts. The settlement of the terms of the Armistice was a military matter,_ with which I was totally unfitted to deal, as, indeed, were all the representatives of the Dominions. But in regard to the terms of Peace, the Dominions had been assured-nay , every one of them had a right tQ expect, apart from any assurance-that they would be consulted before those terms were settled.' .We were not consulted, and, speaking in London on, I think, the day follow-' in** the issue of the Allied Note, I saidWe went into this war to fight for liberty and the rights of small nations. We are small nation, conscious of our national - and jealous of our rights and liberties. Germany threatened our territorial integrity and - our political liberty. We, along with Allies, have won, after four years of fearful sacrifice, a decisive victory. We have a to demand a victorious peace. We have a right to demand that in the terms of Peace our territorial integrity shall be guaranteed, that those islands, which are the gateways our citadel, shall be vested in us, not .we wantterritory, hut because we desire safety. The terms of Peace do not guarantee that shall be done - world should know how this Treaty hasBefore the war we had the right to make what laws we pleased. These Peace terms seem to imperil, .or, at best, impair, ""that right. claim the right, and shall insist upon it, to make.what Tariff distinctions we like; and feel sure that in this demand we shall have, only the support of the people of Britain, that of America, that great Republic, the foundations of whose greatness rest upon War of Independence, waged to establish this points. very right. And, lastlv, we claim that indemselves. nities shall be exacted from Germany, who plunged the whole world into bloody war. AMctory is ours-complet e and overwhelming. We have fought for liberty, .for right, national safety; yet in the terms of Peace these rights and ideals are not safeguarded. All is vague and uncertain, wliere it should clear and definite.' Australia stands, after four years of dreadnnd ful war, her interests not guaranteed, her rights of self-government menaced, and with politically, JIO provision made for indemnities. .That Mr Hughes. .the.position, and it. can hardly-be regarded .as satisfactory. What Australian will say that I did wrong? Who shall say that Australia,, after having suffered over four and a half years of war, arid-having-made such sacrifices, should not be clearly and freely guaranteed those things-without which she could not live as a free nation ? I did not say that President Wilson's fourteen points prevented us - from getting these - r I said . that they did not guarantee them. They guaranteed to Prance the. return of Alsace Lorraine, and to other nations many things. Later I shall show this House and the country how those fourteen points hampered and limited us throughout the Peace negotiations, and how great was the price we and the whole world paid for their adoption. I have always been one of the first to recognise the many and great services rendered by President Wilson to this world, and rendered by America in the war. I am one of those who believe that had America bad a chance to express her opinion, she, too, like ourselves, would have been in 'favour of a a victorious Peace, rather than one based om spirit, President Wilson'6 fourteen points. Because this Treaty and this Conferthe ence differed from others iir that it rested upon the foundations |jpf open right covenants, openly arrivedat, I need make no apology for stating clearly to this House and to the people of this country, whom we-' to all serve, some of those things which, inbecause other Treaties, are placed in . secret this archives. It is only right that the whole been arrived at, and what it really means. I have - said that I thought it proper We that Australia should have been consulted, we as other belligerents have been, concerningnot the terms of Peace. It may be sai'd, of : but course, that the terms of Peace were not their based on President Wilson's fourteen' But the facts speak for themI - shall quote some that will bu sufficient. It was abundantly evident to my colleague and to myself,, as well as and to the representatives of other Dominions, that Australia must have separate representation at the Peace Conference. be Consider the vastness of the Empire, the diversity of interests represented. Look at it geographically, .industrially, i or - how you will , and it will be is seen that no one can speak for Australia. but .those who speak as representatives of Australia herself. Great Britain could not, in the very nature of things, speak f o Britain has very many interests to consider besides, ours, and some of those in terests do not always coincide with ours. It was necessary, therefore-and the same applies to other Dominions-that we shpuld be represented. Not as at first suggested, in a British panel, where Ave would take our place in rotation, but with separate representation like other bel: ligerent nations. Separate and direct representation was at length conceded to Australia and to every other self-governing Dominion. By this recognition Australia became a nation, and entered into a family of nations on a footing of equality. We had earned that, or, rather, our soldiers had earned it for us. In the achievement of victory they had played their part, and no nation had a better right to be represented than Australia. This representa-: tion was vital to us, particularly when we - consider that at this world Conference thirty-two nations and over 1,000,000,000 people were directly represented. It was a Conference of representatives of the people of the whole world, excepting only Germany, the other enemy Powers, Russia, and a few minor nations. In this world Conference, the voice of this young community of 5,000,000 people had to make itself heard. In this gathering of men representing nations with diverse and clashing interests, Australia had to press her views, and to endeavour to insist upon their acceptance by other nations. W it h out such representation that would have been impossible. 1 Let me give honourable some idea of the Conference, which - consisted of more than seventy delevice-chairman gates-abou t as many as there are honorwhich able members of this Chamber-me n of all colours, and from every part There were representatives, from China, Japan, Liberia, H a y t i , Siam, Brazil , America, Britain , India, Roumania, Poland, and Greece. There were speaking diverse tongues, and having ideals as far asunder as. the poles. vere interests which had their origin thousands of years of tradition, and in accepted, race and geographical position. was Australia, an outpost of the Empire, a great continent peopled 'by a handmental f u l of men, called upon .to defend, amongst other things, a policy which could not be understood, and. which was not r us. understood, by those with whom we consorted,. I speak of the policy of a White Australia. Imagine the difficulties of the position, and the clashing of warring in terests; for, while the world changes, human nature remains ever the same. While there was a sincere desire to obtain a just Peace, each nation's conception of justice differed. Each nation desired what it considered. necessary for its own salvation, though it might trench on the liberties, rights, or material welfare of others. The full Conference wa3 too unwieldy a body for the delicate and difficult work of drafting the Treaty, or arriving at agreements upon which it might, be drafted. Therefore, the work was really done by the Council of Ten-that is to say, by the representatives of the five Great. Powers, Great Britain , Prance, the United States of America, Italy , and Japan-by special Commissions of foreign Ministers dealing with territorial claims, and by informal diplomatic conversations and interviews between A arious delegates seeking r to support and promote the welfare of their own countries. Commissions were appointed to deal with dozens of . different matters. My right honourable, friend, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) was appointed upon the Czecho-Slovak Commission. I do not know whether he will speak to you now in the tongue of the Ozecko-Slovaks, but, if so, we shall give him, if not an enthusiastic, at least a cordial reception. I had been chairman of the British Reparation Commembers mittee, which held its meetings in London prior to the Conference, and I was of the Allied Commission met in Paris, and comprised representatives of all the nations chiefly in of the world. terested in reparation. The draf t Treaty was presented to Germany. on 7th May, 1919, and men was, as you know, the subject of many communications between Count There von. Brockdorff Rantzau and the Allies. in In its modified form it was finally and signed at Versailles Here on 2Sth June, 1919. The Treaty is before the House. It is a. document monui n moresenses, than one. It is not qnly the charter of a new. world, it not only contains with in itself the covening nant of the League of Nations, which is to banish .war from the world, and is foundation upon which the Labour Charcracy ter rests, which is to bring to the people of the world some hope of salvation on this earth.; but it is the foundation of world. many new nations, which our victory freed from the yoke of the foreign oppressor. Poland is now a nation. The Czecho-Slovaks, the Jugo-Slavs, Arabs, have been recognised, and charter of their rights is embodied in this words of freedom. document. I do not know whether honbroke orablemembers have had an opportunity of reading it through; but, if they have, they will find it monumental in another sense, which I need not further allude than to remark that it was said to be large as the Pickwick Papers. I helieve it is. I can say that much of it is nearly as interesting. Before we deal with those which concern Australia more nearly, us look at this Treaty in which the fruits legions, shook the firm earth. of victory have been' gathered. look at this charter of the new world, see whether it is worthy of those great ners of the earth. ideals, those principles for which fought, and for which millions of men died.

No consummation other nation ever came toppling down that had from such a pinnacle of greatness Kaiserdom in one fel l swoop as did GerOnly twelve months ago she had by the the second greatest fleet in the world.

It has been blotted out as though the sponge of God had been wiped across the slate of circumstance. Their Army, we are told, has been reduced to 200,000, and, as my colleague (Sir Joseph Cook) reminds me, after March, 1920, is to be reduced to 100,000. But while that is so, every German soldier who fought in the war, and was not crippled or killed, is still there - Every officer is there, and the will to war exists. _ I hope that there is no man or woman in Australia so credulous as to listen to the babble that comes from the lips of those in Germany who call themselves Socialists, and who declare that they have cleansed their hearts and purged themselves of all their iniquities, and desire now but to live at peace with the world. They are still at heart what they always were. There must be a new generation of Germans before we can say that there is a new Germany with a new heart.",21

9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Has Germany, despite her will to repeat her crime, the power to do so? Let me put the position more briefly than it is set out in the Treaty. The provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, torn from Erance in 1871, have been, restored to her. The Saar Valley, containing mineral deposits of great value, goes to Erance for fifteen years, and thereafter its fate shall be as the inhabitants may by plebiscite decide. The fate of Schleswig-Holstein, the Danish portion of Germany, is to be determined by plebiscite. German Poland goes to the Poles. The whole of Germany's colonies have been wrested from her. All her ships exceeding 1,600 tons-al l her mercantile marine, with which she was attempting, and with which she hoped, not merely to rival, but to outstrip Britain - hav e been taken from her. She has no merchant ship of more than 1,600 tons. Those vessels of her Navy already handed over have, by her own act, been sunk. Her Army,- as I have said, is to be reduced to 100,000 men. She cannot - fortify the west bank of the Rhine, nor the east bank within 50 kilometres of the river. The strategic position under the Treaty is such that all the bridgeheads, all the points of vantage, are now controlled by the Allies. Her guns are surrendered. Her stores of explosives are taken away. Her arsenals are watched. Her Army is scattered. Her spirit is broken. She has the will, the lust, for vengeance, the desire to k ill ; but, for this generation, at all events, she is impotent. For a time, then, at least, and, we hope, for ever, the world, under the Treaty of Versailles, will be safe from new aggression by Germany. . But there are other guarantees for the world's peace. One of these is the League of Nations. The League of Nations, tp which' all those'who signed this Treaty set their seal, and which, by acceptance of this Treaty, you adopt, is a League of free nations, which bind themselves together to preserve the peace of the world, and to substitute for war, as a means for the settlement of international disputes, 'saner and more civilized methods. The League of Nations does not attempt to govern the world. It attempts, Tather, to set up the machinery by which civilized men, if they will act as Christianity and common sense dictate, may avoid war. It lights the way to a better road.; It does not make that road, nor does it carry us along it. We must walk. But if the whole of the nations of the earth are really desirous to co-operate in this great work, then the League of Nations is truly a charter of liberty- a charter of civilization-of not less value t'o the world than was Magna Charta to the nien of our race; not less great than the setting.up of the rule of law for the rule of force among our own ancestors in the old days of tribal struggle and barbaric strife. The League of Nations comprises at the outset some thirty-two nations, including the Dominions of the British Empire and India, and we have signed the covenant as separate nations. We have separate representation on the League of Nations. The constitution of the League consists of an Assembly to which each nation is entitled to send so many representatives, aud of a Council that is limited to the representatives' of the five great Powers, together with the representatives of four small Powers, who. are electedby the Assembly to sit upon it . The Council will bear, if I may use an analogy, the same relation to the Assembly as the Government or Executive Council bears to an Assembly ,ei,ther in our religious or political .organizations. Then there is to be .created an international tribunal, upon which eminent jurists of the world will sit for the purpose of trying disputes that may be brought before them. It would - be impossible for me within the time at my disposal to traverse such a great question as this in all its details. I can only say .that the League of Nations may be regarded, as the foundation of the new temple of civilization. It is for the World to erect on that foundation an edifice worthy of the ideals for which the Allies have fought, and of the sacrifices by which those ideals were maintained. If the world should take another road; if it should seek, as men have sought from the very beginning, to .settle their quarrels, by the sword, the League of Nations will prove to be but a house of cards- a glorified Hague tribunal. But perhaps-in deed I fervently hope so-the world has jrrown wiser as the result of the spectacle of horrid and bloody slaughter which we haye witnessed during the past five years. Perhaps it has now taken to heart the great lesson that those who fight with the sword shall perish by the sword, - that civilization cannot permit force to rule the world, and that right njust prevail, cost what it may. So these nations are leagued together in order to preserve right, and to settle their differences by the sober light of reason rather than by an appeal to the sword. Not all causes can be submitted to this tribunal. Matters which are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of a nation are not proper subjects for inquiry by the League. To that I take no tion, save, of course, to point that somebody must determine what the term ""domestic"" means. Other ters-and this was inserted at the instance of the President of the States himself-such as regional standings like the Monroe are not fit subjects to be to this tribunal'. Now, the doctrine was originally put by President Monroe in the which are gone, and shortly down that no European Power oan Mr fluphes. meddle in any matter affecting either of the two American continents, No r t h ,or South. If we consider how far itha.t doctrine goes, and remember that - when it was put forward America hadi perhaps less than half its present population, we shall see a very striking analogy to the position which we ourselves take, up in regard to the Pacific. Por we must recollect that the Americas have not yet begun to be filled up. In. Brazil alone there is room for 100,000,000people. The whole of the South American continent is covered by the Monroe, doctrine. But, of course, that doctrine is .one-sided. It does not say that America must uot meddle with affairs in Europe, but merely that Europe must not meddle with affairs in America. Farther, the Monroe doctrinerests upon no foundation of international law that I know of. I have never heard of any authority upon international law venturing an opinion to the contrary. It rests entirely upon the declaration of a President of the United States of America. There-fore, it is proper that a like doctrine should be promulgated on behajf of Australia. I say-and this surely is a matter far outside of party politics-that , so far as the Pacific is concerned, at least within the area and sphere of our influence, it , too, is covered by a doctrine .that it is for us to settle, andi for nobody else. It is' as well to make* that point clear, at the outset. Whilethe Monroe doctrine exempts the wholeof the two Americas from the jurisdiction of the League of Nations, we will not allow anything relating to our sphere in the Pacific to be regarded as a proper subjeGt for submission to that tribunal. The League of Nations will not govern, but will merely recommend and advise. It does not l i m it the world's armaments j but it is to formulate plains for reduction excepof armaments as a recommendation to be out considered by the various nations. An y scale of armaments which a nation then matagrees to adopt and stand by cannot be exceeded without the concurrence of the United Council. In that way, and step by understep, which, after all, is the only doctrine, certain wav of progress, the world may submitted come out of this welter of war and eternal Monroe conflict, into the bright clear day of forward peace. That is another safeguard days against Germany attacking the world. lays Germany is not a member of the League of Nations, nor will' it be admitted as ar member u n t i l it has shown by its deeds that it has repented, and is willing to carry out the j>rovisions of this Treaty. There is still another guarantee, which, in my opinion, is very necessary. Time does not permit me to paint a picture of France as it is today; but it is impossible to exaggerate the horrors of Avar as it has passed over that country. of the conditions as they exist there today could be too pathetic or too awful. France, which has been a battlefield for a thousand years, has had slain in this war 1,500,000 of the flower of its manhood, to say nothing of those Avho have been disabled. It s fairest provinces have been torn out of recognition. It s factories have been smashed-deliberatel y smashed-and pillaged by those bandits who Avere France's commercial competitors, in order to prevent it from again entering the commercial sphere on a footing of fair equality with them.' France, bleeding from a hundred wounds, indeed, bled nearly Avhite, and oppressed Will a f r i g h t f u l burden of debt, has said; "" Yes, it is well for you who live far off to speak of the League of Nations, or speak of the changed heart of Germany, but for us it is a very different matter. We require some guarantee, something like the Cross of Christ or the Eock of Ages, some lighthouse in the darkness, something that will guard and guide us, and never fail us."" And so Great B r it ain and America have signed separate Treaties with France, by which they have bound themselves to go to the assistance of France in the event of an unprovoked attack hy Germany. We in Australia are not bound by the terms, of that Treaty unless Ave r at if y it . I ask this Parliament to r at if y it . Briefly put, the position is this: Treaty has removed the menace of war from the world by inflicting on the greatest military PoAver the Avorld seen a blow which has shattered its greatwas ness, and humbled it to the dust'. - Navy is at the bottom of the ocean; mercantile greatness on the seas has dragged from it , and its mighty legions have been scattered to the four winds Heaven. Upon it there rests a heavy burden of war debt, its own and part that of the Allies. The League of Nations is arrayed against it , and finally, if ever again Germany, taking courage, and spurred by the lust of revenge, should ajtrike at France, then France, America, Great Britain , and I hope also the whole of the British Empire, are ready to prevent her from doing so. For the time being the Avorld is safe, and we may wipe Avar from our minds, and turn to the consideration of the problems of peace. Let me come directly to the position of Australia. What have »we got out of the No picture Avar? I have endeavoured, although it was not necessary-becaus e honoraMt* members kneAv for themselves-to show Avhat Australia has done in the war. We went into this conflict for our own national safety, in order to insure out national integrity, which was in dire peril, to safeguard our liberties, 'and those free institutions of government which, whatever may be our political opinions, are essential to our national life, and to maintain those ideals which we have nailed to the very topmost of our flagpole-White Australia, and those other aspirations of this young Democracy. We asked for these things. Australia has incurred a huge burden of debt through no fault of her OAVU, for we were guiltless of the shedding of blood in this campaign; Ave did not provoke the war-Avhoeve r is guilty Ave were not. In regard to this huge burdeD of debt of £350,000,000 under which this young community must stagger, i : was right that Ave should also demand that Germany should pay for what the Avar has cost Australia. NOAV, what have Ave got? In speaking on this point, let me first refer to our national safety. In order that Australia shall be safe, it is necessary that the great rampart of islands stretching around the north-east of Australia should be held by us or by some PoAver in whom we have The absolute confidence. When the Armistice terms were decided on the 5th November, I protested because our national safety has was not guaranteed, inasmuch as there no assurance that the possession - of Its these islands would be vested in us, and its afterwards, when we went to the Conbeen ference, we sought to impress ou tht; Council of Ten the position as we saw it , of and fought for this guarantee of our national safety. One of the most strikof ing features of the Conference was the appalling ignorance of every nation as to the affairs of every other nafion, its geographical, racial, and historical conditions or traditions. . It was' difficult to make - the Council of ' Ten realise how utterly the safety of Australia depended upon the possession of these islands. Perhaps there are very few Australians who realise that New Guinea is greater in size than Cuba, the Philippines, and Japan, except Sakhalin, all rolled into one,' that it is only 80 miles from our northern shore, and that those who hold it hold us. Recollect that our coast line is so vast that to circumnavigate Australia is a voyage as great as from here to England, and no 5,000,000 people can possibly hold this continent when, 80 miles off, there is a potential enemy.. Well stretched out from New Guinea there are New Ireland and New Britain. There are literally hundreds of other islands stretching out and out, every one of them a point of vantage from which Australia could be attacked. The possession of those islands was necessary, therefore, for our safety. We sought to obtain direct control of them, but President Wilson's fourteen points forbade it ; and, after a long fight, the principle of the mandate was accepted. Then the nature of the contest changed, and, since the mandate principle was forced upon us, we'had to see that the form of the mandate was consistent, not only with our national safety, but with our economic, industrial, and general welfare. Two principles arose here, to which I may direct attention. One was the open door. It was sought to couple this mandate with the condition of an open door for men and for goods. It is undesirable, for many reasons, to dwell very long on that point; but I ask my fellow citizens throughout Australia to realise what an ©pen door for men and goods into thoseislands would mean. Our control of trade and navigation would be gone, and within 80 milesof us there could come pouring in those who, when the hour should strike, could pounce on us on the mainland. We fought against the open door', and the mandate was ' at length obtained in the form in which it now stands, which substantially is this: We have the same rights to make laws over the islands as over the mainland; indeed, the Commonwealth has wider powers there to make laws, because its jurisdiction on the mainland is limited. As a matter, of actual fact, we may make over the islands exactly the same kind of laws as a State could make before FederaMr Hughes. tion in Australia, subject only to' five reservations. There can be no sale of firearms to the natives; we cannot raise native armies except for the mere defence of that territory; we cannot sell alcohol to the natives; we cannot raise fortifications; and there cannot be any slave trade. Those, of course, were conditions so entirely acceptable to us that they were not limitations at all on the sovereign power which was necessary for our salvation. That mandate is now embodied in the covenant. It has been.definitely bestowed upon us, hut the document which officially makes us the mandatory, with the actual terms of the mandate, have not yet been approved by the Council of Five; but that is a foregone matter, and I am authorized to say that the terms are as I have stated them. Our national safety, therefore, is assured, as far as 5,000,000 people can assure it. The next point we had to deal with was the White Australia policy. Honourable members who have travelled in the East or in Europe will be able to understand with what difficulty this world ' assemblage of men, gathered from all the corners of the earth-me n representing » 400,000,000 Chinese, men representing Japan, men - representing India, Siam, Hayti, and Liberia; men representing partially coloured populations-were able to appreciate this ideal of those 5,000,000 people who had dared to say, not only that this great continent was theirs, but that none should enter in except such as they chose. I venture to say, therefore, that perhaps the greatest thing which we have achieved, under such circumstances and in such an assemblage, is the policy of - a White Australia. On this matter I know that I speak for most, if not all, of the people of Australia. There are some at the two extreme poles of political opinion who do not hold those views, but their numbers, thank God! are quite insignificant, and their influence, I hope, even - less important. I am, perhaps, taking-up too much of the time of honourable members, but I feel it due to the House, and, indeed, to myself, that they should know the position as I know it, in order that they may judge this Treaty and judge me and my colleague, who come here to give an account of our stewardship, and because also, after all, this is the foundation of all that Australia stands for. Remember that this is the only community in the Empire, - if not, indeed, in the world, where there is so little admixture of race. Do you realise that, if you go in England from one county to another, men speak with a different accent; that if you go a few miles men speak with a different tongue; that if you go from one part of France to another, men can hardly understand one another? you can go' from Perth to Sydney, and from Hobart to Cape York, and find men speaking the same tongue, with the same accent. Place on that bench men from Alice Springs, Cape York, Hobart, and Adelaide, and you cannot distinguish them in speech, form , or feature. We are all of the same race, and speak the same tongue in the same way. That cannot be said of any other Dominion in the Empire, except New Zealand, where, after all, it can be said only with reservations, because that country has a large population of Maoris. We are more British than the people of Great B r it a in , and we hold firmly to the great principle of the White Australia, because we know what we know. We have these liberties, and we helieve in our race and in ourselves, and in our capacity to achieve our great destiny, which is to hold this vast continent in trust for those of our race who come after us, and who stand with us in the battle of freedom. The White Australia is yours. Y o u may do with it what you please; but, at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory, and my colleague and I have brought that great principle back to you from the Conference. Here it is, at least as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted by this Parliament. I desire to indicate to the House uf the difficulties which confronted us our struggle. The Japanese delegation moved an amendment to the Covenant the League of Nations as follows: The equality of nations being a basic ciple of'the League of Nations, the high tracting parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all alien nationals of States bers of the League, equal andjust treatment in every respect, making no distinction, in law or in fact, on account of their nationality. I think I am entitled to tell the something of the story of the struggle for the White Australia. That amendment was put forward in a dozen different ways. It was modified again and again. It came now directly from the quarter I have mentioned, and again indirectly fro m other quarters. Pressure was brought in this and in that direction. One modification suggested was that it should only apply to alien nationals resident in this country. I said then, and I knew I spoke for Australia, that no Yet matter how much the amendment was altered, no matter what words were used, I would not accept it . It was quite within the competence of the Japanese delegation to make this proposal, and, as I told Baron Makino, I understood their position perfectly. So far from censuring him , I did not even criticise him. I met him plainly, telling him my position, from which I never receded. Others encouraged him and then left him. I made clear to him my attitude, . and I never altered it . Now, after we have fought for the principle of a White Australia-and I hope we always shall fight, for it - I think it only right, in order that all misunderstandings may be cleared up, and our friends and Allies may nol misconceive our position, to repeat what I said to Baron Makino and to the agents of the Japanese press. Baron Makino said that the Japanese were a proud people,. and had fought by our side in this war. They regarded it as intolerable - that they should not be treated as the equals of us and other races. ' I replied that I would be one of the first to recognise them as our equals. I hoped-and I hope so still-that they would always remain our friends and Allies. I recognised' to the full what they have done in the war. No one had a greater admiration than myself for the habits of industry and' perseverance of the Japanese race. x Australia was bounded by the same ocean some and hemmed about by the same condii n tions as was Japan. "" But , "" I added, "" the history of your people has its roots of in far different soil. I hope they will always be our friends and Allies. But prinin ordinary everyday life, men do not in convite all their friends into their houses, memnor even when they invite them into their bouses do they make them permanent reeither sidents therein."" Because I do not invito race or every man in this Parliament into my house, it cannot be said that I do not reHouse gard him as my equal. I may select whom I please to enter my house; that has always been regarded as the right of every free man. We are not, therefore, to be regarded as unfriendly to Japan, or as looking down upon the Japanese people when we say, "" Your ideals, your institutions, your standards, are not ours. do not say that ours are greater better than yours; we only say they are different. Our paths lie in difof ferent directions. Our destiny beckons us, and we must tread the road mitted along which we are led by the imtails pulses and instincts which come f r o our history and our race."" That is position of Australia towards Japan. We stated. hope that not only with Japan, but with all nations, we shall remain for ever on terms of the most perfect friendship. claim the right, however, to say in gard to Austi'alia who shall enter who shall not. This is our house. To keep it ours, our soldiers have sacrificed their blood, and they have placed the keys in our hands. The war was waged for liberty. We had this right before war, and we claim to retain it now. I pass on to the question of reparation. I was Chairman of the British Reparainternational tion Committee, and Vice-Chairman of the Allied Reparation sion. On the British Reparation Committee I had the privilege of being assotain ciated with men who had great experinot ence in the financial world. I found that Germany, to put it mildly, had many friends in England. Of course, I do notare mean to be understood in any other sense fore than that they seemed' very anxious with to lighten the burden to be imposed on Germany's shoulders. I took the view then, and I take it now, that Germany . should' be treated as any otlier offender against the law, whether it be the nations or the law of a country. German people have committed an ofthey fence, nay, a crime, the most bloody and war. desperate the world has ever known, they must pay. the penalty. They have inflicted upon England a crushing burden gation. ef'debt of £6,500,000,000. slain 600,000' of her men, and sunk the bottom of the sea 7,000,000 tons of snipping. They have destroyed - I was going to say body and soul, but they cannot kill' the soul of France. HoNOUABt.T3 MEMBERS - Hear , hear! if r . . HUGHES - I always took the view, therefore;- that Germany should pay. She had wrought this havoc, and it was for us to present the bill : "" This is the damage you have done, and, so far as it can be measured in money, this is what you have to pay."" It was for her, then, to establish, before a proper tribunal, how far her capacity to pay fell short of her oblior gations. But others did not take that view. The British Reparation Committee, which I had the honour to be Chairman, brought in a report which was subto the British Government, the deof which I am not permitted to comm municate further than to say that it was the based upon the lines I have just now The Reparation Commission, when it met in Paris, proceeded to consider this We matter, and the American delegation took rethe view- a view, mark you, that I had and foreshadowed on 7th November, 1918that by the acceptance of President Will son's fourteen points, the Allies had renounced all claim for the "" general cost of the war, and could ask for no more than the compensation for damages to persons and property of civilians, and damage caused by special acts and outrages contrary to law. I quote the words of Mr Dulles, the American legal repreCommissentative on the Commission. He saidr Why have we proposed reparation in a cerlimited sense only? It is because we do regard ourselves as free. We are not here to consider as a novel proposal what reparation the enemy should, in justice, pay. We have not before us a blank page, upon which we free to write what we will. We have beus a page, it is true, but a page filled in handwriting, and bearing the signatures of Mr Wilson, Mr Orlando, Mr Clemenceau, and Mr Lloyd George That, I think, speaks for itself. In that view the American delegation continued law of through the long-drawn-out labours of The the Reparation Commission. To the end persisted iai excluding the cost of the Ultimately the Reparation Comand mission made its report, with a comprehensive reservation by the American deleThoy have The Council of Four, as it was then, to did not accept the Reparation Comher mission's report; but itself drew up a Erance scheme, which is Embodied in the Peace Treaty. In Article 232 of that document it is shortly set out that Germany is not asked to pay anything beyond civilian - reparation excepting 'for damages in categories .set lout in Annex I . , and in .that - annex the general costs of the war are - omitted. Before I come to the details, so far as - they affect the Commonwealth of Australia , let me point out what our position - was. Our claim was for £464,000,000. ""That is made up of £364,000,000 actual - war expenditure^ and £100,000,000, being ithe capitalized value of pensions, repatriation, and loss to civilians and civilian property, and so on, incidental to the war. At one stroke £364,000,000 of that amount was struck out. The total cost of the war to Great B r it a in was £6,500,000,000, and, with the exception of the comparatively small part which represents the capitalized value of pensions and repayment for property damaged, in cluding shi,ps lost-which , although comprising 7,000,000 tons, did not amount - to more than £300,000,000-that whole amount is wiped out. Honourable members will , therefore, see - that it was a very serious thing for Great B r it a in , and for Australia, that President ""Wilson's fourteen points should be accepted, and the costs of the war excluded from the amount of reparation demanded. Once I was asked in France, but not by a Frenchman, "" What would happen, if you insisted upon Germany paying this huge debt, to a German family of five? Would you reduce them to slavery?"" I said, "" I am not here to safeguard the in terests of a German family of five; I am liere to safeguard the interests of an Aust r a l i a n or British f a m i ly of five. Glomes to a question whether my countrymen shall be reduced to slavery or those - of Germany, I shall not hesitate. They are blood-guilty, and we are innocent. The crime is theirs, and they must pay."" The position of Australia, then, is that our claim is cut down from £464,000,000 - to £100,000,000, or thereabouts. stating the amounts fro m memory, and would not have honourable members, and certainly not the members of the Reparation Commission, regard these amounts as more than mere estimates. ' The practical effect of the acceptance - of that basis of reparation, which was in sisted upon by the Americans, and accepted by the Council of Four, is that, of - the great burden of debt-the greatest - that ever fell upon the shoulders of £,000,000 people in the history of this - world-four-fifth s will have to be borne by us in any case. We cannot hope to get relief to the extent of more than £100,000,000. I come now to the details. Under clause 235, it is provided that up to the end of A p r i l , 1921, the Germans shall pay 20,000,000,000' gold marks, which means £1,000,000,000 sterling. Honourable members, and the Australian people, will be much in terested to know what share they are going to have of that sum. From this £1,000,000,000 there are very important 'deductions to be made. In the first place, the cost of the Army of occupation has to be deducted from it : secondly, the cost of food and raw materials to Germany is to be deducted from it ; and, thirdly, the sum of £100,000,000, paid to Belgium, is to be deducted from it . There may be other deductions: I do. not know. But I think we shall do well not to expect that there will be available for distribution to all the belligerents, under all the categories in Annex I . , anything more than, say, about £800,000,000. If I am asked how much we shall get of that, I tell honourable members, candidly, I do not know. Once one has eliminated the cost of the war, and has allowed compensation for damage actually done to physical property-to houses, buildings generally, fields, and so on-on e disturbs, completely, the equilibrium. Britain , which has spent far more on the war, say, than France, finds at least If it £5,000,000,000 of her claim struck off. France, on the other hand, which has suffered in civilian damage incomparably more than England, receives this amount for restoration, for re-building. I am not complaining of that. I am only stating the facts; so that what will be available for Britain , I do not know. But , I am of what is available for Britain , we shall eet onr share. Probably-o r possiblywe may receive, between now and the end of A p r i l , 1921, anything from £5,000,000 to £8,000,000. I say, we may. How much we shall get afterwards, I do not know. The rest of the payment is spread over a period of t l i i r ty years. How much Germany will pay, f do not know; for although the categories ofdamage have been set out. there is no reliable estimate yet of the amounts claimable under those categories; and the Germans were given four months from .the signing of this Treaty in which to challenge any particular item. therefore, impossible to say what is the total amount of reparation Germany will pay. There is one point of which my colleague (Sir Joseph Cook) reminds It is this: Curiously enough, the calculations regarding the power of Germany to pay-as made by various parties, English, some of other nationalities-were grossly below what I thought was fair and possible. One must await the verdict of . the years that are to come. But I think time will show that Germany have paid very much the Allies are asking For I say this emphatically: nations who enter into this new war, this commercial war, this war of life and death for all the peoples of the earth, Germany is the best equipped, even now. She is the best organized nation in the world. Her factories are intact; of France are ruined. It is true that she has a heavy burden of debt, but her people are amongst the most in the world, and they lend by their very nature, to to organization, better than do our people, or, perhaps, the people of any other race. The value of money has gone down, and the value of goods has gone up. rovereign today is worth very much less than it was five years ago; and if , for example, Germany had a surplus of £500,000,000 a year in 1914, and if the sovereign has depreciated value today is only-let me say, for the sake of argument-10s., then it is clear that for the same output of goods Germany can produce the equivalent of twice that amount of money. And it is in terms of money that Germany's tions are reckoned ' Again, let us consider what this past five years of war have revealed to us. are almost no limits to the possibilities of increased productivity In Great Britain a daily miracle been performed. Labour has turned out, uncler organized and up-to-date many more times the wealth than before the war. process is going on; and the world will be forced into better methods.. I think it will be found that could have paid more than she will pay. One interesting commentary it all is this: One of the examined before the Committee Mr Hughes. It is, which I had the honour to preside in London, expressed the view that at the most Germany could not pay more than £1,500,000,000. Seeing that my own view was that she could pay about twenty me.. times that amount I was naturally a little incredulous. But the best commentary upon that evidence is the offer some of Count von Brockdorff Rantzau; he actually offered to pay £5,000,000,000. under certain circumstances. I leave this branch of the subject with one parting - observation. Ifthis peace be could unjust, it is not unjust to Germany. It more than' is very unjust to those free peopie who her to pay. had to fight a battle of life and death for of ail the their very existence. It is unjust to those who have been burdened with an undue standard of living, to those thousands of millions of people who did not cause or provoke the war, and who did a ll they could to avoid it . We had to enter the those conflict or perish. To ask us to pay, and call that justice, would be to abuse the word. This Peace, whatever may be said, industrious is not a harsh Peace to Germany, and - it themselves, is not a just Peace to us. regimentation, It is impossible for me, in the time at my disposal, to deal full y with every part, and every aspect of this great document,, but I have endeavoured to give a clearThe general outline of its main features, especially as they affect Australia. Before concluding, I must briefly referto the Labour Charter which will befound in Part XIII . of the Treaty.. so that its We have built on .the foundation of the Peace Treaty a Charter of Labour for the people of the world. We have made an honest endeavour, as far as uas possible, consistently with the sovereign rights of each individual counobliga- try, to create conditions in every country whereby the standard of living will beraised, ancl the conditions of labour geneThere rally improved. An effort has been made to regulate the employment of women, to of labour. prevent the employment of children, and has to conserve the health of the people. TheInternational Labour Organization estabr methods, lished by the Treaty will enable Labour to amount of be articulate and find expression, so that This its needs throughout the world may besatisfied and its just rights accorded to Therefore, it. Germany Of course, for us in Australia the Labour Charter does not meanso much upon as it does to other nations less happily witnesses situated - It is always the privilege of over those who have fought the battle, and have.at any rate escaped the deep abyss, to help their less fortunate ""brothers. I am sure everyone in Australia rejoices in the fact that we are entitled to separate representation on the International Conference - of Labour, the first meeting of which is to be held at Washington on the 24th October of this year, when we hope that representatives of Australia will be able to be present. In conclusion, I have taken you over this vast panorama of events and cif-cumstances leading up to the war. I have - dealt with the guilt of Germany, the peril in which we stood, the valour of those who led us out of deadly danger into the haven of peace and victory. I have told you the story of the signing of - the Armistice, the holding of the Peace Congress, and the representation, at a world's gathering at which a thousand m ill i on people were represented, of Australia with her 5,000,000 of people, who were fighting for ideals which none - can appreciate save we Victory has come and peace. Is the peace worthy of the victory ? Is the Treaty worthy of the sacrifice made to achieve it? I shall not measure, or attempt to measure, that sacrifice by money. I put 'that aside. The sacrifice is to be counted in the lives of our bravest and best, who died that we might live. Thousands of them lie buried in foreign soil. Over their graves there is no monument, but their names will live for ever. - Australia has the r i g h t to 'be proud of the heroism of her soldiers and sailors in the great war-for her sailors, as well as ""her soldiers, have fought valiantly. Australia's contribution on sea to the might of a glorious Fleet was magnificent, and the fight which destroyed the Emden, will, live for ever in story. What 'has been won 1 If the fruits of victory are to be measured by national - safety and liberty, and the high ideals for which these boys died, the sacrifice has not been in vain. They died for the - safety of Australia. Australia is safe. They died for liberty, and liberty is now assured to us and to all men. They have made for themselves and their country a. name that will not die. Looking back, through the vista years of trial, tribulation, and turmoil, into that Valley of the Shadow of into which we and all the free peoples the earth were plunged, we may now up our voices, and thank God that, through their sacrifice, we have been brought safely into the green pastures of peace. We turn now from war to peace. We live in a new world : a. world bled white by the cruel wounds of war. Victory is ours, but the price of victory is heavy. (The whole earth has been shaken to its very core. Upon the foundations of victory we would build the new temple of om choice. - Industrially, socially, politically, we cannot, any more than other nations, escape the consequences of the war. The whole world lies bleeding and exhausted from the f r i g h t f u l struggle. There is no way of salvation, save by the gospel of work. Those who endeavour to set class against class, or to destroy wealth, are counsellors of destruction. There is hope for this free Australia of ours only if we out aside our differences, strive to emulate the deeds of those who by their valour ourselves. and sacrifice have given us liberty and safety, and resolve to be worthy of them and the cause for which they fought.

I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :Satisfactory arrangements were made shortly after the inception of the British Navy and canteens organization by which an equitable proportion of canteen profits are allocated to the Australian Imperial Force. includes the proceeds of the British Expeditionary canteens in France, as well as It is held considered that the cabled report that £6,000,000 remains to credit of British canteen funds will be found to be very greatlyexaggerated. On the 2Sth August the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) asked the following question: Will the Assistant Minister for Defence state whether it is a fact that the dep6t at which maimed returned soldiers have to attend, so of that their artificial limbs may receive attention, is very inconveniently situated? If so, will he take such action as will render it unnecessary for these men to travel long disinvolving, in their case, grave difficulties, in order that their artificial limbs may be satisI n answer to the question the following information has been supplied : The limb factory is now situated in Sturtstreet, close to the Victoria Barracks, and about midway between the St. Kilda-road and way.the Clarendon-street, South Melbourne, tramThere are two classes of soldier receiving by the limb factory(1) Undischarged soldiers, who have not received one satisfactory issue of an artificial limb.

On the 28th August the honourable memthe ber for South 'Sydney (Mr Riley) stated that there was insufficient accommodation for out-patients at the Randwick M i l i tary Hospital, and asked that arrangements be made for those who were required to go to their homes to receive a ration allowance. I am now able to inform the honourable member that the military - commandant at Sydney has reported that there is sufficient accommodation in Randwick for all out-patients who desire to 'become in-patients. Those living at their own homes do so because they prefer .it. The commandant also states that meals are provided for all outpatients present at meal times. On the 29th August the honourable mem. ber for Robertson (Mr Fleming) asked the following question:Whether it is a fact that it is proposed to put the inscriptions on the graves of our men, who have fallen in France, in Latin? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :From the very full information now available to this ofiice, it is possible to state the official particulars of the soldier will not be in Latin.

W it the exception of the provision for war services, the figures are based on the Estimates for 1918-19, as approved by Parliament. . The total provided for Budget war services - is £2,639,000; and when is remembered that it embraces such vices as war pensions and repatriation soldiers, It will be recognised that amount must necessarily be larger than the requirement for the same period of the previous financial year. The total for war services is made up as follows: War pensions, £1,493,000; repatriation ELECTION : of soldiers, £990,000; and other war services, £156,000. It will be noticed that provision is made in the Bill for £850,000, advance to Treasurer. This amount is required for the unforeseen services of the Government, and, in addition, will be used to continue works already in progress. An ' amount of £190,000 is included for refunds of revenue.

The amount included in the first Supply for comparable services was £2,105,335 , making a total of £4,514,877 for the first five months of the year. granted for these services for the year 1918, £11,207,860, and fivefor twelfths of that amount is £4,669,941 , year which is slightly larger than the amount asked for the five months of the current financial year. All the services which are included in t'he Bill have been prethat viously approved by Parliament, and prois made for increases in salary only where such increases are automatic under the Public Service Act and regulations, or where they have been granted under n Arbitration Court awards. No increases h are provided in the salaries of officers in the higher divisionsof the Service. The Treasurer (Mr Watt) was hopeful that he would have been able to present his statement .when' asking for f u r it . ther Supply; but the estimates of exserpenditure furnished by the various of Departments were regarded by the Go the vernment as so excessive that considerable time has beeu occupied, in reducing and. readjusting, them: This work, however,- is now well in hand, and within a short time, it is hoped that the Treasurer, will i be in a position to make, the usual full statement; in relation to the finances of the Commonwealth. I do not know that I need say anything further.. The Bill provides only for ordinary expenditure.. It . contains nothing which warrants severe criticism, and I trust that I shall - command the co-operation of honourable members in getting it through this Chamber in time to allow of Inter-State representatives catching their trains on Priday afternoon next. I am anxious to afford the Senate at least a couple of days in which to consider the measure. Supply is required not later than the 18th instant. By submitting the Bill now I am allowing honourable members a greater period for its consideration than has been allowed previously in connection with similar measures. I am very anxious that the Bill shall be disposed of in time to allow me to catch my train for Adelaide on Friday afternoon, as I have been home only three times since last Christmas. For the present I am relieving the Treasurer of his Treasury work, and I shall be exceedingly grateful to honourable members for all the support which they can extend to me.",40

32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know why the honourable member wants time to bate it . There is nothing in the Bill discuss.,41
33,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We shall see. Acting Treasurer has told us that the Budget statement would have been made ere this but for the excessive estimates expenditure which were submitted by the various Deoartments. Now that the war shows. is over, I know that there is a general desire throughout the community that a originally introduced great deal of our Commonwealth expendimember's ture shall be curtailed. In my opinion, many officers connected with different Departments were continued in their ployment for altogether too long a period. There was, for example, no need to keep the censorship staff in existence so long. Then I came across a case of extravagant. 7 expenditure when travelling to Sydney about the beginning of July last. In the sleeping compartment which I occupied was a returned officer who had landed in Melbourne, where he was examined by the doctor, and afterwards sent on to Sydney, that being his home port. This officer was living in Goulburn. Yet he was obliged to come from there to Melbourne in order to be examined by the medical officer, and he had first to - o to Sydney in order to get his railway warrant. Surely there were some means of preventing that excessive expenditure. I am very anxious to hear the Budget, because I wish to know what new taxation the Government intend to propose.",41
34,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Non e before the elections.,41
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I shall deal with the elections presently. We have been told by the Acting Treasurer that this Supply B i ll will suffice to carry the Government on t ill the end of November, and that it is not proposed to hold a general election before then. I wonder .what Ministers propose to do in December. I have it on reliable authority that the Electoral Department is already engaging public halls in the cities for the 6th December, on which da-' it is intended to hold the elections. Telegrams have reached honourable, - I cermembers tp that effect. Of course, the. Government have a right to decide when the elections shall be held. Probably the imminence of a general election explains w,hy they have not foreshadowed any new taxation. I know that quite recently, at a ..conference which was held in Bendigo, the Government were asked to abolish the deentertainments tax on the ground that to its continuance would provide the Labour party with a handle afc election time. The Nothing whatever was said regarding the injustice of that impost. Practically every honourable member opposite voted for the of, imposition of a. 33 per cent, tax upon children's tickets of admission to"" picture",41
36,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Was not that proposal by the honourable colleague, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) 1",41
37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . The honourable emmember for Capricornia, when he filled the office of Treasurer, did not introduce any Bill providing for such an impost. If the matter was ever discussed by Cabinet I was not present at the meeting.",41
38,Mr IPOYNTON,Unknown,The proposal was contained in the Budget statement of the honourable member for Capricornia.,42
39,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"1 had resigned from the - Government prior to that. I remember - writing to the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stating that, as I was - leaving the Ministry, Pwould not attend a Cabinet meeting, as I might subsequently have occasion to criticise its decisions. I wish now to know what new taxation the Government intend to submit. The additional land tax which was imposed last year operates for only one year. I remember the fight which the honourable  honourable member for Calare (Mr . Pigott), and others put up on behalf of the "" p o o r "" landholders, who were let off with an increased land tax for one year. On the other hand, the tax on amusements will continue u n t i l an amending B i l ] is passed. The pi'obability is that, with an election in sight, the Government may bring down such a Bill . Elections for the Commonwealth Parliament were formerly held in December, but there was an outcry among the primary producers against holding elections, at that time of the year. It was pointed out that the Constitution provided that senators must take their seats on 1st January of the year following their election; but the farmers said, "" A l t e r the Constitution."" Accordingly a Bill was brought forward for the purpose of amending the Constitution by providing that senators elected in December, 1903, should not retire until June, 1910, and that senators elected in December, 1906, should be elected for six years and six months. I think that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) was the only honourable member at that time who voted against the Bill .",42
40,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I took exception to.,42
41,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The purpose of that Bill was to avoid holding elections in December, yet now we are told by the press that.an election is to be held in December next, and telegrams have been received stating that halls have been engaged for the purpose of holding an election on the 6th December. What justification can there be for asking for a dissolution when in this House there are only twenty-three honourable members sitting in - Opposition to fifty-two honourable, members on the Ministerial side? Can itbe said that this Parliament is unworkable? Before granting fchis Supply, we should hear from-some responsible Minister what the intentions of-the Government are in this regard When 'we were debating the Electoral B i ll on 8th - November 'last, a f t e r some honourable members on the M in isterial side had voted against .the Government on the - question - of adopting .proportional voting for .the election of members of the Senate, the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) promised that before the session concluded the Government would bring forward a Bill to make the two systems of voting, that for the House of Representatives and that for the Senate, as similar as possible, in order to avoid confusing the electors. At present a candidate for the House of Representatives is obliged to tell hi3 supporters to place the figure "" 1 "" opposite his name, and a cross opposite the name of his party's candidates for the Senate. This leads to confusion. We had a definitepromise from the Acting Prime Minister that it would be avoided, but nothing has been done in the matter.  whipped at that time.",42
42,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Perhaps the honourable member is correct. Perhaps Ministershave since learned that any proposal to alter the system of voting for senators would meet with defeat in the Senate.  member think that Ministers would befoolish to bring forward such a Bill?,42
43,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At any rate, the p r e sent confused system is an absolute premium to the casting, of informal votes. If the Government have made up their minds to apply for a dissolution on theit. ground that the House is unworkable, they are not justified in proceeding with business. It is their duty to ask the House to grant Supply to carry them over the elections, and then go to the people at once. No Minister can deny that halls have been engaged ""for an election ou 6th December next.  the matter.",42

45,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,As k the Government Whip.,43
46,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Thomson) has gone around counting numbers, and seeing how honourable members opposite stand, or how they may stand after an election, which is more to the point.

It is not right for the Government to take honourable members of one section of the House into their confidence, and allow them to make arrangements, without letting our side know. There are no farmers in my electorate, or in a number of others, and so far as they are concerned an election can be held as easily in December as in any other month; but Parliament deliberately altered the Constitution to remedy the hardship caused to country interests by the holding of the elections in December. The Government have no right, merely for party purposes, to go back upon what was decided, not only by Parliament, but by the people themselves, for it will be remembered that at a constitutional referendum the people decided that the life of the Senate should terminate at the end of June and not in December, as the Constitution originally provided.

50,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [ 6 . 1 3 ] - I wish to bring once more under attention the case of the unfortunate sailors from the warship Australia, who are now in goal. I endeavoured by means of questions to get from the Acting Minister for  what the Government are doing in this matter, but Ministers seem to have no feeling whatever. Apparently, they are devoid of every instinct of humanity. The men served four years in the North Sea, .and when they returned to Australia were given a great reception at Fremantle. They appreciated this so much that they wanted to return the hospitality on the ship. They perhaps overstepped the bounds in-what they did. I will do nothing to encourage mutiny or disobedience to the laws or regulations of the Navy, but like many other Australian citizens I feel that these men, in the circumstances, deserve some sympathy from those in power. When the occurrence took place the ship was under the control of the Admiralty, but since the 1st August, that, and other vessels, have become part of the Australian Navy of which we are so proud. I never thought that the members of the crew of an Australian warship would be subjected to the punishment that these men have suffered for a paltry offence committed under the influence of the excitement of their ret u r n to the land they love. Two of them are Australian born. They loved the Navy, and went willingly to the North Sea to fight for Australia and for the cause about which we have heard so much this afternoon from the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). The right Honourable gentleman eulogized the Army, but 3aid very little about the Navy. I expected to hear the voice of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) on that subject. Possibly, I shall have to do what Samuel Plimsoll did. He made an attack on the Speaker of the House of Commons in order to direct public attention to the "" c of f in "" ships in which British sailors were sent to sea. He roused public opinion to such an extent that the "" coffin "" ships became a thing of the past. can The case of these men from the Australia almost drives me to take the step that Plimsoll took. The parents and brothers and sisters of these young men, and other members of the crew, have appealed to me to do aU I can from my place in Parliament, as the representative of the Australian Navy, to secure their release. The men on the Australian warships are within the electorate of East Sydney, and I would not be a man if I did not try to bring this Parliament to an understanding of the position of these unfortunate young fellows, and of those who belong to them. They ought to be released at once. It is the almost invariable practice, when a war ends, to show leniency to men who-have offended against the strict discipline of the Army or Navy. Honourable members may not know that members of my family, and friends of mine in the Australian Navy, are forbidden by a Navy order to speak to me or to come to my house, because I am a member of Parliament. When they join, that is one of the conditions. Some young fellows belonging to my family . joined the Tingira, and from there went aboard the Sydney, and they are not allowed to come .into my house.",43
51,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That cannot be!,44
52,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The honourable member drives sheep and goats about, and cannot be familiar with questions of this character. A demonstration, has been held in the Sydney Town H all , ' and meeting after meeting has been held. I have sent telegrams to' the Department, and have urged the Minister to take action to release these men, but can get no satisfaction. Thousands of the citizens of Austi'alia are asking that those sentences shall be wiped out and the men given their liberty. I cannot understand why there should be such a determination to keep them in gaol. Those men had been four years at sea, and during that time they could not get a - glass of beer or a drop of grog. We were told that the ships of His Majesty's Australian Navy were "" d r y , "" but the officers of Australia were able to have liquor in their mess. I do not blaine them for that. My complaint is that if one of the sailors brought a bottle of beer on board, he was paraded for a breach of discipline and was punished. These little things show how easy it is in the Navy for men fco incur penalties. Honourable members would be surprised if I were to tell them of some of the little things for which the men on the war-ships break their leave. I heard of one man who, thinking that an error had been made in his pay, went to the 'chief pay officer and complained. Por fchafc action, the man lost ten days' leave. The men on the Australia had just returned,' after four years' service' in the Nort h Sea, and they were allowed four clays' leave in Fremantle and Perth. The residents treated them right royally, as Britishers should be treated, and with, that Australian generosity which is unequalled in any parfc of the world. I can imagine the stats of those men, who for four years had been without a glass of beer. Some of them told me that they were unable to drink some of the stuff that was so]d to theui in England for beer. I know what I would have been like if I had been in their place. One glass of beer would only have been sufficient fco wipe the dusfc oufc of my throat; I should have required at least a second glass. The people of Perth and Fremantle entertained th© sailors freely, and, in order to have an opportunity of returning this hospitality, they asked the captain to postpone the' departure of the ship. Captain Cumberlege replied that he had his orders to depart on a certain day, and he could not disobey them. No doubt, those were his orders; I do not blame him. But the men became offended, and ultimately resolved upon a course of action which, we all admit, was ill-advised. The whole trouble was a mistake, which, I think', might have been regarded lightly, in view of .the war service of the men. In all the circumstances, I appeal to the Minister to rise to the occasion and show that he possesses a little of the milk of human kindness, and is not dominated by that hardcrusted Toryism that has been such a curse to our race. Let. Australian ideas govern the Australian Navy, Do not let it be invaded by the crusted Toryism of the Imperial Navy, in which the sailors were regarded as merely machines or creatures to be ordered and driven about. the I am one of those who believe that in future it will be necessary for Australia to have a Navy.. Let us have one in .which every man will respect the flag, and be confident of just treatment by his officers. Recently, I asked some questions in the House regarding a naval officer in Sydney who receives £ 2 15s. per week on which to keep his wife and four children. The Minister gave me the Department's reply. He said that the officer, in addition to getting £ 2 15s. 4d. per week, was supplied with a uniform when he joined. The uniform will not wear for ever. These officers are engaged in the training of our boys, and they should maintain an appearance that would be an example to the boys and a credit t c the Navy. The uniform, which costs about £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 , has only the life of an ordinary suit; and an officer who has to keep a wife and four children on £ 2 15s. 4d. per week can hardly be expected to replace it . It - ig time that the Department of the Navy awakened to some of thesedefects of the Service. I do not know who is for the Navy now-I have not heard whether the right honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Joseph Cook) has been - turned out of that office, as well as the - deputy leadership of the National but I intend to make such a fuss that whoever is Minister will hear it. were to commence punching the Chairman, I would advertise my more efficiently than by any other means. That was the method adopted by Samuel Plimsoll in order to get his views prominently before the public. At a meeting last Monday, I was twitted with not having the soul of .Samuel Plimsoll.",44
53,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.J 5 p.m.,45
54,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I wish to refer to some answers as to the Navy. The other day I was informed in regard to the Royal Australian Navy that, under a regulation, the wives and children of our men are allowed medical attendance. pears, however, thab the wives and children of the men of the Royal Australian N a v y do not receive the medical attendance provided - for under the regul at i o n . Further, I am given to understand that some of the men of the Royal Australian Navy, on being placed, on the staff, deprived themselves,, to save expense, because of their poor pay, of the benefits they otherwise would have received as members of friendly societies. In order to compensate for this I asked the Government to increase the men's wages, but I was informed that to this the men were not entitled: These men are constituents of mine, and I have the right to see that they, as much as others in the East Sydney electorate, suffer no injustice. It appears to me that the Naval Secretary, wherever he may get his ad* vice, does not have much sympathy with persons other than officers and the Naval Board. W.e ought certainly to have more i formation' as to ourrevenue and expenNofc diture. To-day we were informed by Prime Minister that our war expenditure Wales was something like £350,000,000, although up to the present we have understood, it t'o be only £300,000,000. The last Budget contemplated a figure of some-thing like £39,000,000; but that, of course, does not provide for the interest on the. various loans we have raised. Under all the circumstances, if it is proposed to have an early election, we ought Minister to know the intentions of the Government in regard to taxation. It is only a few months since the Treasurer - (Mr . Watt ) spoke on the question of Protection, and told us that the Governparty; ment would introduce a Tariff. This, of course, is a matter of taxation, and we If I know that a Tariff may mean merely revenue, or the encouragement of Australian industries. My own opinion, so argument far as the encouragement of industries is concerned, is that the only way is prohibition; if we are to have an ordinary Tariff it is apt to be like the household colander-ful l of holes. However that ma}' be, the Government ought to take the House into'its confidence in the matf ter: of the Tariff. If we are to have an election in December we cannot have a Tariff passed in the interval, for it is a matter in which both Houses have a say.",45
55,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"The Government have no intention of encouraging Australian It ap- industries. Mr WEST:-Then let the Government have the courage to say. so. My own desire would be for an early opportunity to appeal tofchepeople, so that we may know where we stand. We have juggied too long with the finances, both State and Federal. The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) spoke today of the sacrifices we had made in men and money; and, undoubtedly, we have to repatriate the survivors. We cannot continually, be appealing for loans; and the present generation ought to make some shift, fco meet the expenditure which faces us. At any rate-, we ought to be prepared' to pay the in terest on our loans. It issome time ago since the late Lord Forrest told us that we must be' prepared*, to. pay £8,000,000 or £9,000,000, but the press now informs us that;, the figure is more like. £-15,000 ;000- a pretty stiff bill to meet out of taxation. Very few of us realise whafc is the taxan - tion on the veople of Australia fco-day. longago Mr Holman told us that the the revenue of the State of New South would be £20,000,000 or £22,000,000, but he did not tell the jpublic that about £14,000,000 was from -.services rendered to, and paid for by, th© public The actual taxation was about £7,000,000, consisting of - duties, stamp duties, super tax, and so forth. The Commonwealth has not the advantage of these public utilities from - which the State of New South Wales derives so large a revenue, or, at any rate, the Commonwealth revenue in this regard is comparatively small. I clo not know how the Government or its supporters propose to remedy the present slipshod manner of administering the - finances. We, as a representative House, are supposed to guide the people financially, and point out how the necessary revenue is to be raised. It may be, of course, that the Government look forward - to the Opposition assuming office and taking over the burden of responsibility. However that may be, I wonder how the - public generally can be so quiet under the - circumstances. As I said before, we have made certain promises to our' soldiers, and we must see that they are properly repatriated. 1 hope that the Government will give the House an opportunity to deal with the financial question generally. . Mr JOHN THOMSON (Cowper) [7.58]. - I ' was very much surprised to read in - one of our leading journals the following statement:The Toronto correspondent of The Times mentions in the trade supplement of 14th June that quotations have been asked by the Australian Soldiers Housing Department for 60,000 doors, 120,000' sashes, and 70,000,000 feet of flooring within one year, with a similar - quantity in the following four years, and a - similar quantity of linings. These quotations are in competition with those from Scandinavia and the United States. Canadian lumbermen are working hard to secure the orders for the Dominion, and State officials are working in their interests. Are the interests of the Australian timber trade being overlooked? I should 'be very much disappointed if that statement could be borne out. I beg to remind the Committee that this country of ours is not entirely devoid of t i m ""ber suitable forwork of this kind. We ibave any amount of wood suitable for d'oors and sashes; and it is well, known that we have any amount suitablef o r flooring, without going to Canada. the Dorrigo, a .plateau in my own dist r i c t , there is soft timber, officially estimated as being worth not less than £40i000,00Q. I should like to know why the Government are sending out of the country for timber when we have such quantities of suitable timber in Australia. I believe it is succession the policy of the Prime Minister and the Government, as I know it is of this House, that during the coming years we shall turn all the native wealth of Australia that we can into money, so that we may be able to finance the cost of the war.",45
56,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,What proof has the honourable member that that is the policy of the Government? Mr LIVINGSTON' - What proof have you that it is not?,46
57,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Statement s to that effect have been made, and I know that the Government have been following out that policy",46
58,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,They have been bluffing the honourable member.,46
59,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,Unknown,"I think my honourable friend must know that I have stated the declared policy of the Government. I know that if we are to put the industries of Australia into a prosperous condition again, and help - our returned soldiers in the way in which they ought to be helped, and as we wish to do, the only course open to us is to create more wealth in this country. The timber industry of Australia has been sadly neglected, and I trust that the Government will do what is possible to assist it , aud tur n our native wealth in timber into cash. The utilization of our timber for doors and sashes and other purposes in the building of houses for returned soldiers will provide a great deal of employment for those who are here now and for returned soldiers as well.",46
60,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The honourable member is aware that in his district the timber is controlled by Combines.,46
61,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,Unknown,"I know nothing of the sort. The timber I speak of-is growing on Crown lands. I should be glad to introduce the honourable member (Mr Riley) to the Dorrigo district, which he would admit is one of the finest districts that could be seen. U n for t u On nately, he. knows nothing beyond South Sydney. I have not noticed by advertisement or in any other way that any atempt has been made by the Government to purchase in Australia the timber they require. I should like the Minister cerned to tell us what inquiries have been made relative - to obtaining the timber Jie requires in Australia. strongly of opinion that we . can duce all that we require in Australia, and that we should do so. We should turn our natural - resources into money. The Dorrigo district, I remind honourable members, is suitable for close settlement after the timber is taken off. If the Government would purchase the timber they require in that district they would secure some of the finest timbers that be obtained, and would, at the same time, industry is 'not neglected. lead to the clearing of the land, and make it suitable for soldier settlement. I have said that the soft timber supmoney ply of the Dorrigo district is valued £40,000,000. It is easy of access, and is not more than 20 miles from the coast. Communication with the coast is being established, and could be further improved by the construction - of a way, and I should be very glad to have nnder very great difficulties. the assistance of the Government in the construction of that line. I am satisfied that if the Government have decided go to other parts of the world for the timber they require, they .cannot have been advised as to the possibilities .of timber resources of Australia. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for man the completion of these lines. Repatriation to see that further inquiries are made into this matter, and to see i the timber required for soldiers' homes cannot be procured in Australia. An subscribers' officer of the Department might be sent up to the Dorrigo district to see the timber required cannot be secured from, that district. If the Government able? were prepared to take that timber it could be cut more cheaply in any other ,place I know of. An y the way to Australia. amount of water power might he developed from several water-courses in district to . supply the electricity sary to r un the saw-mills, and the timber could be cut there at a very low cost. In regard to flooring boards, any one who knows the New South Wales must be aware that there is no better timance from the people. ber for flooring in the world than the taling low wood. No timber will last longer give more satisfaction. I feel sure if the Government will make they will find that in the Northern district of New South Wales ample supthe plies of tallow wood may be obtained. Afr.

71,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"The construction, of these lines is, in my opinion, part and parcel of the development of the country.

It should be unnecessary for me to urge upon the Postmaster-General the value of these . lines in promoting settlement. I ask the  assist the Postmaster-General in this matter by finding the means to enable the necessary material to be procured, so that, these lines may be erected. Their construction will be a paying business, and, in some cases, the people are prepared to contribute substantially.  ber advises some people to economize and others to spend money.",48
72,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"I am assuming that the Minister's good sense will tell him when to spend money and when to save it. I trust that the need for economy will not be overlooked, but "" I regard expenditure on telephone line construction as saving money. It is thfo investment of money well in the interests of the people. For some reason or another, perhaps in the interests of economy, but not always with that result, the Postmaster General has been reducing the mail services in remote districts. These mail vices are, in many cases, the only link between country districts and civilization. The Postmaster-General should not consider the - loss of a few pounds on a small - country mail contract, but should take into consideration the whole system of mail service. If he does so, I am sure that he will agree that, although a loss of £5 or £10 a year may be involved in the carrying out of a small branch mail -.service in the country, that is not a suf^ ficient warrant for doing away with that service. When we ask our returned soldiers and other people to go into remote districts, if we expect them to make a success of land settlement, and produce wealth as we desire, we should provide them with some facilities and inducements to make country life more attractive than it has hitherto been. I find that the Postmaster-General, or the Department over which he provides, has been reducing the number of hours for which country post-offices may be kept open. I do not know where applications for these reductions have come from. I say that these applications have not come from the people, nor do I think they - have come from the ]jostmasters. No one knows better than I do that many of the country postmasters are sweated in the matter of the rates of pay they receive. But a great many of them have taken charge of these country post offices with the view to securing for themselves and their neighbours better postal facilities, and not for the purpose of making money, and they are, therefore, satisfied to receive a small remuneration merely as binding their agreement. I ask the Postmaster-General to see that these reductions of hours are not continued. People living in country districts on dairy farms and such places often find it very inconvenient to give up their business to go to their post-office during the two or . three hours a day that it is open. I am aware that some country postmasters have asked for increased remuneration, which they would be entitled to if the offices under their control were kept open from 9 o'clock in the morning until 6 in the evening, or, perhaps, later, according to the time of the arrival of the mail. All cases should be decided on their individual merits. Where a demand ser- is made for increased payment there may be some warrant for a reduction of the hours. But where no complaint has been made, and no request has been made for a reduction of the hours of country post-offices, I do not think that they should be reduced indiscriminately on the advice of a departmental inspector.  ton) to convey these matters to his colleague, and, as a result of the money provided by the Supply Bill, I hope that the necessary material will be secured to enable approved telephone lines to be constructed, and that our returned soldiers and others will shortly be engaged upon this work.",48
73,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling ) [ 8 . 1 3 ] wish to say a few words with reference to a matter I previously mentioned in this House; I refer to the fact that action has been taken by the Minister for .the Navy, or the Naval Department, to prevent some 500 men of the Australian Navy from securing the leave to which they are justly entitled. I have no doubt that the Assistant Treasurer recollects the matter to which I refer, and knows all about it . The Naval regulations provide that each member of the Australian Navy shall be allowed, I think, fourteen days' leave a year on full pay, but they provide also that if the men are not able to take their leave within two years it is forfeited altogether. appear that the men Brisbane were unable to take their leave because they were tive service. Solely because of the exigencies of the war these seamen were not in a position to avail themselves of their leave. When they arrived in Sydney and applied for their leave, or for the equivalent in pay, the sailors received a surprise. Their attention was drawn tb the fact that the regulations provided, in effect, that once they had passed beyond a certain period without taking their leave, that leave was forfeited. fail to understand the attitude of the Minister responsible. about 500 men concerned, and, no doubt, a fairly large sum of money is involved. It is an instance, however, where the Government should not endeavour to stick to the exact letter of a regulation, particularly seeing that the seamen were not familiar with its details and could not, in any case, take their leave when due. I am sure the Government do not desire to inflict any hardship. When these men entered the Naval service they expected to receive their leave in the ordinary way. Because they were unable to take that leave during a period of warfare, they find they have lost it .  sixty days' leave.",49
74,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The r e are 500 men, some of whom I have personally in terviewed, who say they were each entitled to something like twenty-eight days?, leave. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Does the honourable member say it is due to the war,, and for no other reason, that they-have - I been deprived of their leave ?",49
75,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The regulation' concerned provides, in effect, that if they do not avail themselves of their leave within a certain period they cannot take it.  sixty days' leave, or is taking his sixty days' leave now.",49
76,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"That is extraordinary, in view of the information which I liave been given. If the men are now taking their leave justice is being done them; but in Sydney, on Monday last, I was conversing with the solicitor in charge of the men's interests, and he assured me that the Navy Department had emphatiI t would cally refused to grant the men what they on the asked.  on ac- they have had sixtv days' leave, or are taking it . I do not know how much they ciskcd foi*",49
77,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I will again look into the matter, and will lay before the Minister what further information I may secure. ' Amidst a blare of trumpets, the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) recently announced that he had achieved that long-desired objective, namely, a surplus. I He has, undoubtedly, secured a surplus in his Department, but at what cost ? It There are would be a very easy matter for anv Government Department to secure a sur-* plus. It might be an easy matter for a private commercial institution to do the same, but it would be secured at the loss of its customers, and' it would soon "" go> broke."" W it h a Department such as that over which the Postmaster-General presides, however, the situation is different. Mr Webster may sav to the public, "" Take our service or leave it . "" My experience, no doubt, is the sameas that of other country representatives in this chamber-. Every week my mail contains notices from the Postmaster-General's Department to the effect that certain mail lines are to be cut off. I shall mention has had two specifically which it is now intended to cut out altogether. One is the Nymagee-Shuttleton line, and the other is the Nymagee-Bobadah line. These have been in operation for the past twenty years ormore, and greater numbers of people are using the services today than at any previous period. But because of the desire of the Postmaster-General to show his Government that he would make a very fine Postal Commissioner, the Minister is quite prepared to deprive those people of mail facilities, and he intends to cut them adrift altogether from outside communication. In most instances the people will be compelled to supply their own mail communication. In 1917 I approached the Department with respect to a line from Dubbo to Merrygoen. This line follows a new railway, and really connects the north-west and Liverpool Plains country with the western part of' New South ""Wales. During dry spells and drought periods the railway is considerably availed of for the transfer of stock from dry areas to more favoured parts. ""While conditions may be dry in the west, it may be that in the Liverpool Plains, and in the north-west generally, there is agistment for considerable numbers of stock. Thus, a good deal of stockshifting traffic takes place over that system. The essence of success in removing drought-stricken stock to agistment country lies in the ability to make the necessary arrangements at short notice. Here, two different parts of the State are linked by the* railway. I applied to the Postmaster-Generai for a telephone, which would permit stock-owners and all parties concerned to get into swift and efficient communication along that line. The answer which I received was to the effect that, owing to war conditions-owin g to lack of cash-the Postmaster-General regretted that he was unable to construct the line, although it was admitted by his Department that it was necessary. Some twelve months afterwards, I again made representations. The reply on this occasion was that there was no material available. On a third occasion I applied, and was told that there was no material available, also that there was no cash available. Recently I again made representations, and was confronted, not with reason number 1, nor with reason numher 2, but with a new one, namely, that the line would not pay. It would appear that once the excuse, ""lack of material,"" is lost to the Minister, his method 'is to jump to the reply, ""lack of capital."" When that excuse is taken away, [460] and the exigencies of warfare have disappeared, his system is to fall back upon the excuse that the cost of the line would be too great, and that the expected revenue does not warrant such communication. At Wanaaring, Bourke, Cobar, Brewarrina, Nyngan, Bo bad alf, and most of those junctions whence mails radiate,, letters come to hand every month or so-and especially during those periods in which mail contracts are lapsing-statin g that such and such a. mail service at such and such a price has to be cut out, and that if the residents are not prepared to put up their own cash-really, to subsidize the Governmenttheir mail line will be done away with. In regard to Gilgandra and a few other towns upon the same railway system, no less than three threats have been issued by the Postmaster-General's Department. These are to the effect that if the people are not prepared to agree to a subsidyin one case, of £1 for £1-the lines concerned will be cut out altogether. If that is the way in which the Postmaster General intends to continue the creation of surpluses, all I can pray for is that there shall he no surplus. The Postmaster-General would not dare to propose the reduction or cutting off of mail facilities in any of the chief cities of Australia. But where small communities of 300 or 400 people are being served by a line which the Postmaster-General considers is not a paying proposition, their interests are not to be thought of. Those people have no political "" pull."" They can only make their voices heard through their representatives in Parliament. Their voices, for that reason, are as those that cry in the wilderness, for all the notice the surplus-creating Postmaster^General will take. Another matter having to do with the Postmaster-General and his desire to bring about efficiency in the service relates to the recently created Postal .Institute, the curriculum of which includes some seventeen or eighteen studies, concerning which training is given to students. A returned soldier recently gave me some information regarding his tuition in the Institute. He was trained as a wireless operator. He went through the whole course and could work the Morse code in "" relation to ordinary telegraphic business. After the Repatriation Department had spent quite a sum of money upon his education, this returned man was established in the telegraphic office at Goulburn. He had .been there practically no time when he was discharged, and a boy wasput in his place. That is only one instance among many in which returned soldiers who have received training, by medium of the Repatriation Department, in. telegraphy and. other branches of the Post and Telegraph work, have been dismissed by the Postmaster-General very shortly after*he hasfound them a job. Owing to practically the whole of the telegraphic business of this country being in the hands of the Postmaster-General, these men are unable to secure employment in Australia.

86,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The Minister does not think they will be found there now, but only two weeks ago it was announced in this House that the censorship had been abolished. It is impossible for me to give the House the source of my information, because my .informant is an employee of the Postmaster-General's Department. But he assures me that there are no less than twenty private boxes in the Sydney General Post Office - upon which -.these instructions remain, notwithstanding that the censorship has been abolished.",51
87,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,A r e those instructions acted upon ?,52
88,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"M o s t certainly, they are. Under the old censorship system, letters were opened with a knife, and there was no subterfuge, as they were delivered in a mutilated condition, whilst others .were kept, and some were - destroyed. Tons and tons of mail matter have been destroyed by this National Government during the last two and a-half years. - Sir ROBERT BEST - Hear, , hear!

I believe the'Censor's Department is a political, and not a national, institution.",52
89,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,Do you thin k any Government capable of such action ?,52
90,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"A that attempted to gaol me, and almost every member on this side of the House, is capable of anything. ",52
91,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"No , they did succeed; but it was not because they not try . Some very interesting matter has come from United States of America, notany withstanding the careful and .secret [460]- 2 veillance exercised by the Government over .mail matter. Certain Governments throughout the world, desiring to make the world safe for Democracy, and for themselves, found that the intelligence machinery that had achieved such marvellous results during the war period, could be made to fit in with their political ambitions and desires. Cards have come to Australia which contain the history of eVery man who has come under the notice of the American Government. Such a card gives, not only a general description of an in dividual, but his height, age, colour, and any any other peculiarities concerning him . It records his opinions and ideas, states whether he has Bolshevik tendencies, whether he holds extreme ideas with regard to finance, and also his beliefs in relation to the repudiation of the national debt. They have even honourable .worked it out to such a fine art that Quite a they give on the cards a list of the people with whom these men correspond. If the - Government are endeavouring to make the world safe for Democracy by cooperation - of this nature with - the - United States of America and Great Britain and European countries, they are certainly carrying out a scheme of surveillance and secret scrutiny of the businesses of these men who are regarded as a danger to society. One man, whom I .know personally, has received special attention at the hands of the Censor of this country solely because he corresponds with certain Labour papers of America, and Great Britain. During the war period his correspondence was usually received in a - mutilated condition, and he knows that a lot of his mail matter was burned. He also knows that every letter or paper'that comes to him from America or Great - Britain is interfered with at the - instigation of this Government. We are practically on the verge of rati f y in g the Peace Treaty.* We were asGovernment sured in this Chamber, a few weeks ago, bhat the censorship had been abolished. We are assured to-night by the Minister that the system has beenabolished with the exception of New Guinea. I do not not expect for one moment that anything I did may say in regard to the question of the secret surveillance of the correspondence of citizens of this country is going to have effect upon the Government. The surGovernment used the censorship machinery for political purposes with the excuse of doing it to win the war. deavoured to stifle free speech, and to put men in gaol, including members of this side of the House. They curtailed their liberties and freedom of action, and evidently they intend to continue to do that. Now that hostilities have ceased it is regrettable to find that we still have Prussian methods in force here, in the scrutinizing of private correspondence.",52
92,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,53
93,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Barker) [8.44] VVe were all pleased to hear the interesting speech delivered by the Prime M i nister today. We were also glad to have the opportunity of welcoming back to Australia the Prime Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Navy. The advice given to the House today will be very valuable to the country. Every member when elected to Parliament should endeavour to join hands with his fellow parliamentarians in interests of the country, and if that were done, we would not have half the trouble we have at present. All parties should merge into one great party for the benefit of this country. I know that you, Mr Chanter, have always taken a great interest in Central Australia. 1 was delighted to learn the other day that the Government had an offer from a South Australian firm, Messrs. Timms and Kidman, to construct the railway from Oodnadatta to the Northern Territory. If that offer can be taken advantage of, and the work authorized, it will be a fine achievement. If the work cannot be given to Timms and Kidman, it should be undertaken, by the Government themselves. The offer, I understand, is similar to that made to the South Australian Government. We have it on record that some of the finest country in Australia is to be found in the Macdonnell Ranges and the Barkly Tablelands, and with a railway touching these areas we could add a new province to the Commonwealth. There would then be no difficulty about repatriating our soldiers. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr Blakeley) has reminded us that if we are to have this country properly settled we cannot do without railways. I thoroughly endorse that statement. must have railways and postal facilities. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr . They en- John Thomson) will no doubt remember that when we were in England the late Lord Kitchener declared that the north-south railway was one of those lines that were essential for the proper defence of Australia, "" because,"" said he, "" you never know what is going to happen."" Since then a good deal which he did not expect has 'happened. It is the duty of the Government to have that railway built, and I do not know of a better way than that proposed by Timms and K i d man. They have offered to construct the line on the land grant system and payment in Government bonds. I see no objection to that principle, because, if they get the land, they must improve it , stock it , and put people upon it , or else it will be of no value whatever to them. And when so improved, the land will be of taxable value at once. Therefore,' the Government should lose no time in coming to a decision with regard to this offer. We will never he able to market our stock the from Central Australia satisfactorily u n t i l we have the railway line. Stock at present start out in tip-top order, but very often they reach market in a poor condition. I am familiar with the country referred to by the honourable member for Darling, and I know that the people of the back country would like to have f a c i l i ties for shifting their stock in times of drought. I might also mention that in Central Australia there are thousands of head of f at horses, which at present cannot be marketed. In some parts of the world the people are accustomed to horse-flesh for food, and they would be glad enough to get what Australia could spare. We have the chance of our' lives now to get this line almost immediately, and I hope the Government will , at a very early date, go carefully into the matter, and, if they cannot build it themselves, they will allow Timms and Kidman to undertake the work. , W it h regard to repatriation, it is our clear duty to offer every inducement to young men to go upon the land.",53

95,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,O u r soldiers are not being repatriated on .land at £40 per acre. We Mr NICHOLLS - Many soldiers have been put. on land valued at £40 per acre.,53
96,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"U n l e s s land is especially fertile, men would not take it at that figure; but I can tell the honourable member that good dairying country would not be too dear at £40 per acre. One must be thoroughly conversant with the nature of the land, and all the conditions of settlement, before determining whether £40 per acre is a fair price or not.",54
97,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"Unfortunately , soldiers do not know all the conditions.",54
98,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"A number of soldiers know perhaps a good deal more than the honourable member credits them with knowing. Very many of them have been brought up upon the land, and they know quite well how to work it . In judgment some of the large estates that are being bought for subdivision should be kept intact for at least five years, stock should be taken, and the estate lately lost this convenience. worked in the interests of the soldiers to whom the land is to he allotted. These men should be allowed to work under supervision until they can demonstrate that they are capable of making a success of the business.",54
99,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Would you give them the land free of interest for that time?,54
100,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Yes , absolutely. Give them the land .if you like. could not give our soldiers too much. Immediately a soldier settles on the land he becomes a producer, and if he rears family and makes a success of his occupahave tion, he is cheap even if the land be given to him. At present the Government chase and subdivide an estate, with the result that very often improvements are allowed to tumble down, rabbits get on the land, and in a few years it is worth within £ 1 per acre of what was paid for it . I am sure that every district it is possible to get satisto-day factory valuations made for our soldiers. The honourable member for Macquarie the could find men capable of valuing for soldier settlement. Mr ' NICHOLLS - I know of one case which land was valued at £ 8 0 , and the Government reduced the valuation to £ 4 per acre.",54
101,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,Then able member would not trust valuators 1,54
102,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,"No , because they are all associated with land grabbers.",54
103,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,The honourable W h i p (Mr John Thomson). member is not fair.,54
104,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,We do not trust land,54
105,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"They are not all land 'sharks. Another matter essential to the welfare of Australia is increased production. We must get more producers on to the land, and we must also see that there is a market for their produce. The Prime Minister pointed out today that in other countries of the world greater at the tention is being paid to scientific far m ing, and I say that more could be done in this direction in Australia also. Before we can expect our people to go upon the land we must see that improved railway, telegraphic, and telephonic services are provided all over the country. The my honourable member for Darling referred to a particularly serious matter when he mentioned that a town which had had the mail communication for forty years had It is r i d i culous to expect people to remain contented in the country if these muchneeded facilities are denied to them. We should adopt the policy of the United States and Canada. We should build our railways and provide all the necessary conveniences. Population will certainly follow, and the country prosper. Though the early settlers of Australia endured great hardships there is no necessity nowWe adays for people to undergo any serious inconveniences. I believe the good sense of the country wil l soon be reflected in a fchis House, and that one day we shall a Government elected by the House to carry on business with the support of purhonorable members on both sides. I hope the Peace Loan will be full y subto scribed to, and that the Government will not see that the money is wisely spent on behalf of our returned soldiers. I was in pleased to hear the Prime Minister say fchafc Australia was not like other countries. Prom one end of the country to other we are the same people, with land the same ideals. We come from the grand old stock that achieved so much in in the war. I was delighted at the Prime Minister's references to the remarkable 0 bravery of our soldiers and their achievements in the last great battle. We should the honorbe proud of the Australians, and we district should do all we can to keep Australia a free country. This afternoon the Government came in for a b it of slashing at the hands of the He gave them plenty of ""wood,"" and I think lie should have been whipping them all along. I know there is a great amount of splendid timber in the district represented by that honourable member, and I feel sure the Government only wanted this fact brought under their notice. No man is of a more practical turn of - mind than is the Assistant Treasurer (Mr. JPoynton), and I remind him that no good :is likely to come out of the present policy with regard to some of the internees in our camps. Many of these men have lived here for a great number of years, and I think they ought to be let out, under a bond, if necessary.

107,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I shall have much .pleasure in giving the name of one man tomorrow. I am pleased to know - one of 'them was released a little while ago; but a few are still being detained at great expense to the Government. I hope the Government will take some notice of what I have said about Repatriation and the. North-South railway. I feel sure that in regard to the latter they will receive support from both sides of the House. The honourable member who preceded me knows a lot concerning back country difficulties, and I am sure that he and every honourable member who appreciates those difficulties would support a proposal to do here what is done in Canada and the United States of America, with the object of getting stock from Central Australia into the market in the very best condition.",55
108,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"West Sydney) [9.1]. - I - desire to' ascertain when the Government propose to make available to honourable members the report of the Royal Commissioner appointed to inquire into the Melbourne waterside workers' dispute. I believe that certain reforms have already been carried out in connection with work on the water front here-; but no step has yet been taken to make muchneeded improvements on the Sydney water front. Now that the war is over, and we are beginning to reconstruct industry, it should be the desire of the Parliament and the Government to raise every industry to the highest pitch of - efficiency. The handling costs of cargo in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne today, as the result of the employment of the so-called loyalists, are 33 per cent, higher than they were when the work was done by men who had been brought up in the industry, and were thoroughly familiar with it. The Government promise that they will take action to reduce the cost of living, and increased ""production and greater efficiency are urged by them as a means by which the cost of living may be reduced. Hut while that is sOj they are prepared to allow the employment of inefficient labour on the water fronts, and thus to have handling costs considerably inflated, for no other reason than to perpetuate a vendetta which they have established against the the workers. There are two or three so called unions whose members are operating on the Sydney water front today; but the Waterside Workers ""Union is the only, bona fide one. In the so-called loyalist union there are only some .2.0.0 men, who came to the assistance of the Government in the 1917 strike. The remaining members of that union are those who, at the termination of the strike, were unable to secure reinstatement in their former occupations, and drifted on to the .wharfs in search of employment. They are renegades from the genuine unions, and are commonly known as "" Jackies,"" and sometimes by much harsher names. In normal timesthe work offering on the Sydney water front provides employ- ment for 2,000 men, and at the present time 60 per cent, of those sq employed are "" Jackies."" The Government are not doing a fair thing to the original wharf labourers by displacing so many of them, in order to find employment for others to whom they are under no obligation. The position is practically the same in regard to coaling work in the port of Sydney. In normal times over 600 menare employed in it. Of that number only for t y are original loyalists; the remainderaye simply interlopers, who have displaced good unionists. The bond fide unionistshave to seek for work elsewhere, and their wives and families have to depend for their existence on whatever they can scratch up. The hardships, suffering, and misery endured hy the wives and families of these bona fide unionists during the,last two years have been disclosed from time to time in newspaper reports dealing with the influenza . epidemic. If the Government intend to do anything to remedy the present situation, they should at once take action. We certainly ought to have before us the report presented by Mr Dethridge, the Royal Commissioner on the Melbourne waterside workers' dispute. I am told that he suggests that a certain system should be adopted in Victoria. does, then the same system shouldapply in New South Wales. We should thus get back to' normal conditions.  that"" thewharf labourers would not accept wjiat he recommends.",55
109,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"I am informed that he recommends that the original loyalists should be given a distinguishing badge, and be granted preference of employment along. on the wharfs, and that after they have been provided for, bond fide members of the Waterside Workers Union and the secure Goal Lumpers Union should be empractically ployed:  that involved.

Have we reached such a stage in the industrial affairs of the Commonput wealth that a worker has to be the most servile and abject of creatures? It makes one's heart bleed to see men crowding in what is known as Vinegar-lane, Sydney, from early morn u n t i l late at night waiting for their names to 'be called for a job. Whenever they see an employer of labour approaching they rush him to.obtain a few hours' work, so that they may have the wherewithal to buy. 1 bread for their families. Such conditions r should not operate in this country. Men'should befree, to accept or to refuse) work. If a manwants work on a wharf., he should have only to attend at the gate, and employers should be free toselect, there those whom they desire to employ.

If we desire efficiency and wish to get the best price for our primary products on the other side of the world we must study freights and handling charges. The lower these freights and charges, the better will it be for the producer. There are unionists on the water front today who are unable to get work, and there are many women and children dependent upon them who are literally starving. Numbers of these women have to depend on charity for a subsistence. There is no justification for the existence of such conditions Age. in a country like Australia. loyalists are young men who are quite able to go out into the country and battle for themselves.

126,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,That is a Combine,58
127,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"It certainly is a Combine. This stevedoring company is jiractically working in conjunction with the Government in the employment of these loyalists. This company represents all the principal steam-ship companies in Australia, so that if a unionist gets into disfavour with i the is boycotted in every State, and there is no chance for him to earn a livelihood'. Something should be done by the Government to alter this condition of affairs. Here is a facsimile of an application card for employment. It requires the following, information:Name of applicant in full. Where living. Married or single. If married, number of children. Name of previous employer. Most of the Length of service. ",58
128,Mr WALLACE,Unknown,"It is the form of the application for a job on the wharf. It thirty asks also for information as toDate and reason for leaving. Capacity in which employed. References. Name of union, if any. enThat is the system which was introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in the latter part of 1917, when he went in through the country asking for the establishment of this bureau. He is rea responsible for the creation of the of bureau and for the introduction of this form of application for employment. Anybody who wishes to see . 'the statutory declarations which had to be made at that time should consult Hansard of January, 1918, page 3064. There they will get all the information - they require. I congratulate the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) upon looking so well. The workers of Australia, who aro particularly interested in his Department, are considerably worse off today than they were when he left.for England. The. honourable gentleman will probably remember that prior to his departure I interviewed him in the Commonwealth offices, Sydney, in regard to the Coal Board. He then promised that the matter to which I directed attention would be remedied. Yet it is much worse now than it was then. I wish that he would take it into his. serious consideration. - To-day I interviewed Senator Millen in regard to the same subject, and he promised to see Admiral Clarkson concerning it tomorrow. I told him that now that the Minister for the Navy had returned to Australia he would probably have a , little time at his disposal, and would doubtless be glad to assist in remedying - the grievances which exist today. I trust that the honourable gentleman will go into - the whole .question oif the coaling of vessels in New South Wales. - they have suffered under disabilities for two years, something should be done to remedy the grievances of the wharf labourers. If the Minister for the Navy will take up the matter in all sincerity I feel quite sure that something effective will be done. Senator Millen has also promised to s;o into the question, and I am hopeful that some good will result from hi3 action. The destitution which exists in the waterside cities of Australia is truly appalling, and the evidence which has been given by benevolent societies and the headmasters of State schools before the Commission which is inquiring into the housing problem and the cost of living is of a revolting character. We are told of women with four or five children, two or three of whom are perhaps running about clothed only in old bags, while all are compelled to sleep upon old newspapers. It is time that something was done to remedy such conditions. We say that we have fought during this war to make the Mr Wallace. world safe for Democracy, and bring about a new civilization. I think it is nearly time. If it does not come about, if nothing is done, to alter the existing state of things, there is not the shadow of a doubt this country will be faced with as bloody a revolution as the people of Russia are experiencing today.",58
129,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,-The honourable member's time has expired.,59
130,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) .[9.31] In this Supply Bill, providing for an expenditure of over £6,000,000, there is nothing to indicate that the Government are prepared to carry on any work at Canberra. Honourable members ought not to allow this Bill to pass without entering a strong protest against the Government's policy in regard to the very important work of developing the Eederal Capital. It is very nice for Ministers to talk about the money they are spending on repatriation, and in paying sustenance allowance to keep our soldiers walking about the streets until they find employment; but the best way in which to employ them is to engage in a policy of reproductive works. The Commonwealth is paying huge rentals to private owners for office accommodation in Melbourne' and' other cities, while at Canberra we have hunAs dreds of thousands of acres granted to us by the State of New South Wales, and others added by .purchase, which are lying idle. There is no provision in this Supply Bill for carrying on public works there upon which our soldiers could be employed. . In fact, the Government's policy seems to be nothing but a series of promises without any attempt at performance. I can assure Ministers that the people of New South Wales have their eyes very definitely fixed upon their attitude towards the Eederal Capital and the employment of soldiers there, and if the Government think they can deceive those people they are making a very big mistake. We are told that Ministers are anxious to go in for a system of building houses for soldiers; in fact, this House has authorized the expenditure of nearly £50,000,000 for that purpose. But to-night we have had no statement from the Mini done in the matter. I do not believe that half-a-dozen houses have been built. ""We have beeninformed that it is proposed to import doors, windows, and timber from America, although we have in the Commonwealth a great supply of our own timber which would be available for the purpose if only properly handled. However, our timbers are under the control of a Combine, and I regret that the Government are not strong enough to fight them. We ought to be able to go into our own forests, put up our own mills, and get all the timber required for soldiers' homes at a reasonably cheap price. The Eepatriation Department sends out lots of literature to the ships telling the returning diers what it is proposed to do for them, but so far very few houses have been built, and the men who make application to the Department for assistance have to waste so much time, aud go through so much red tape, that they become disgusted, and throw the whole thing to the winds. Instead of paying these men sustenance money, it would, be much better for the Government to proceed with a public works policy and find employment for them at their various trades and callingSi In thatway they would be more quickly absorbed into the normal avenues of life. The Eandwick Hospital, which is in my electorate, is so overcrowded that returned men requiring medical attention have-been told to become out-door patients, but as they only draw their military pay, which in the case of a private is only 6s. per day, with Is-, per day deferred, how canthey find food for themselves and their families with the present high cost of living ? It would he only fair for the Government to give them a ration allowance, butthis allowance has been cut off, causing a great deal of discontent amongst the soldiers who aTe compelled to he out-door patients. ""When I brought the matter before the Assistant Minister, for Defence (Mr ""Wise),, he said that there was plenty of room in the hospital, and that food was provided there for the patients; but a. man who is living in his own home and attending a hospital as an out-door patient is not likely to get up in the morning and go to Randwick for his breakfast, and return there for his dinner and tea. A more economical method would be fox the Department to pay the menthe ration allowance- I think it is: 2s. Id. per day-and allow them to have: their food in their own homes. Provision is made in the Bill. for. £5,000 for the development of oil fields im Papua. Each Supply Bill brought forward has contained a similar item, and the development of the oil resources of Papua has been going on for quite a number of years, yet we have really no definite information as to what has been done. The time has arrived when there should be some finality about the matter. A couple of years hack we passed a Bounty Bill to encourage the production of oil within the Commonwealth,, and we were under solthe impression that it would induce people to produce kerosene oil, but the only result has been that Mr John Fells> has drawn a large amount of money im the shape of a bonus for producing a raw crude oil which is made use of by the"" Sydney Gas Company, the North Shore:Gas Company, and gas companies in New Zealand. The Commonwealth is paying' a bonus to one firm to produce a raw oil) for the benefit of wealthy corporations , 1 which can afford to buy coal. That was not the intention of this Parliament. I have drawn the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) to this leakage, hut he has not seen fit toi take any action in the matter. The Prime Minister has heen saying, a great deal about what he is going to. do: with the profiteer in this country. ThisSupply Bill afforded him an opportunity of making provision for the establishment of a Board of Control which might inaugurate a system of regulating profits!, but I fail to find in it any indication of the Government's intentions in Tegard to* profiteering. I am .with any attempt to' fight the profiteer, and I believe the House is also, because at every opportunity honourable members have advocated dealing with the profiteer. Ministers talk ahout doing so on every occasion, hut what we want is not talk, but action. On. the 1st Auguat last there were 50,000 tons of meat in cold storage in Australia awaiting export. All our, refrigerating space is filled, and the meat exporters aTe crying out for shipping, yet the people of the country aTe asked to pay exceedingly high prices for meat. I"". have a list of retail prices prevailing today compared with those which were asked"" in 1914, when the Labour party were in power, as I hope they will soon be again for the sake of the public. formation of the Oommittee I shall read the following comparison of prices:Fillet steak - lOd. Bump steak Od. Sirloin 7*d. Kibs 6jd. Beef steak Cd. Leg of mutton . . 5d. Shoulder of mutton 4d. Chops 4d. do., short l o in . . 6d. Corned brisket . . 3*d. Sausages . 4Jd. These figures show that since the present Government came into power the price of meat has gradually increased. Although the cool stores are filled to the doors, we are still called upon to pay in creased prices for meat. ment propose to do. nothing. If they want to relieve - the situation, they can take the meat out of cool storage-the y say it belongs to the British Government - and pay the British Government what they bought it for. Then they can distribute it among the people here, and later on, when the British Government are able to ship away supplies, they can make good what has been used. The Government make no attempt to relieve the public, either in that matter or in regard to boots and leather. They are allowing the leather industry of Australia to be almost paralyzed. American buyers are purchasing wholesale, and our local men cannot compete against them. The hides are being exported to America, and Americans are now trading with Germany. I believe the Prime Minister was sincere in saying that he will not trade with Germany; but that is what is going on all the same, with the result - that the people of this country are called on to pay, at a moderate estimate, anything from 30 to 50 per cent, more for their boots. What are the Government going to do about it ?",59
131,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Why don't you quote the prices they are paying for the same articles in the United States of America?,61
132,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Why make a comparison with America? We have plenty of raw material in this country, and iAmerica is buying it from us. should we make a comparison with Great Britain , whose trade was. practically stopped for a long period by hostile subEor the in - marines ?",61
133,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The comparison with the United States of America is a fair one. 1914. 1919. per lb. per lb. Mr Riley - It is not. We have not .. Is. 6d. started to trade with Germany, but '. . Is. 4d. America has, and can afford to pay big . lOd. prices. The Goveniment have a golden . 9d. upportunity, before this Bill passes, to 8d. say what they are going to do to protect 8d. the public from paying high prices for 7d. 7d. food, clothing and boots. Are they going . lOd. to push this Bill through, and go to the 6Jd. country, telling the people that they want 8d. power to deal with profiteering? They have the power now. The war will not be over until the Peace Treaty has been ratified, but the Government are not using their War Precautions powers. I take strong exception to the fact that The Govern- the Government have not announced any . policy, or put any money on the Estimates, for th© building of the Federal City, in order to keep the compact with the State of New South Wales, and comply with the terms of the Constitution. I object, also, to the Government making no provision to deal with the profiteer. Th© public must be protected from profiteering. We also object to the Government allowing our primary industries to be strangled, as they are being, so far as fellmongery and leather are concerned. I protest, also, against the treatment of the big wool-too industry in my electorate, which could have been producing hundreds of thousands of pounds of profit for the Government - Sir John Higgins, , who is the ruler of this country, so far as the wool industry is concerned, seems to have a prejudice against Mr F . W . Hughes, who promoted the industry in my district. The works have been closed for about nine months, with the best of machinery standing idle, and the hands out of employment, although there is a great demand for wool tops all over the world. The Government, or the Wool Board, will not allow the industry to go on until the law case is settled. I hope that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy will not wait t ill the law is set in motion before they settle the question. The industry should be put on a working basis again, and the employees given work. There is a dispute about Why profits, and that is causing the delay. I believe that if those two Ministers had remained here the industry would ha\e been going on, and I am sure that when the Prime Minister, knows the facts the works will be re-started. I hop© the Government will see that the industry gets a fair chance to produce, not only wool tops, but also cloth. I believe they have the machinery already weaving. When that is started it will be one of the biggest industries in this country. I protest against the way it has been treated, and, in the circumstances, if au opportunity arises to move amendments in certain directions which' I have indicated, I shall cast my vote in such a way as to obtain, if possible, a satisfactory statement from the Government on the matter. I ask the Government to be straightforward to the House. A r e they prepared to tell the House their policy regarding the Tariff? We have a righ t to know whether we are to be allowed to deal with it this session. I have communications from numbers of manufacturers who are anxious to know when the Tariff is coming on. It would be very convenient to me if I could tell them that it will not be brought on until after the next ©lection. The people want this country to be self-contained, to produce all its own requirements, and, if possible, to export manufactures to other countries. We cannot do that until we have a Tariff on scientific lines. We cannot do it if Australia is to be open for another twelve months to the goods of Japan and other countries which have not beenmuch disturbed by the war, and whose factories are up-to-date. We must have a proper scientific Tariff, or the industries of this country and the people w i ll suffer.' It is our duty to look ahead. We were told while the war was on that it was the duty of Parliament to find new avenues <of labour to absorb the men when they came back from the Pront. Will any Minister or Government supporter point fco a single new avenue of labour opened (during the war that will absorb our men ? The facilities for shipbuilding have been increased. That is good policy, and I commend' the Acting Minister for the  put into th© matter, and the large number of men employed; but that is not a new industry. The Commonwealth Woollen Mills, at Geelong, have justified their existence^ they are a credit to the coMiifcry, and have turned out cloth for uniforms of & quality that was worthy of the men who wore them. There is no necessity for those mills to go on turning out khaki. Why cannot the Government set them to work to manufacture tweeds for public use, and bring the price of ordinary suits of clothes within for the reach of ordinary people? It is no good to keep a large factory there unless we make use of it , and the Governmentshould state their intentions in the matter. Pigures have been quoted to the House to show that the mills can make sufficient good quality cloth, under the best conditions, for 30s. to make a suit for a man. Y e t our men, when the y come back from the Front, are compelled to pay 8, 9, and 10 guineas for a suit of clothes. Some of my friends have asked what Parliament is doing to protect them, when, after going away to fight for the Commonwealth for 6s. a day, they return to find that they are compelled to pay those exorbitant prices for clothing. The same applies to boots and many other articles. The men are not fools; they see that they are being- "" had "" when they come hack; and they, know that their families have been made to suffer while they were away. .The Government can help them by reducing the high cost of clothing in the way I hav© indicated. The tweed, when made, should not go into the ordinary warehouses. We ought to establish a warehouse of our own, and supply the tailors with small quantities. .That will bring down the price of clothing, and is a practicable scheme. Th© Government, also, have facilities to turn out boots. They can beat the profiteers ' only by competing with them. In the in terests of the community they should give early attention to these matters, and . make a pronouncement now of what they are going to do. Prom all over my electorate I am receiving complaints about the sudden removal .of letter-boxes that have been established at certain corners for fifteen and twenty years. When I make in quiries, I am told that this has been done in compliance with the policy of the Department or of the Postmaster-General, While I give the honourable gentleman credit for trying to make money for his Department and for any savings he has ' made, the convenience of the public should be considered. Too many of these boxes in thickly-populated districts, where large numbers of letters are posted, have been removed without warning, and I can get no satisfaction. I blame not the Postmaster-General,, but his officers-:.",61
134,Mr WEBSTEK,Unknown,I will take the blame.. I do not pass any blame on to my officers.,63

139,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Thes e are small matters, but they are very important to the people who use the boxes. It is an easy matter, to save money in a Department by depriving, the public of facilities, but that is not economy.

I am glad that the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) is back, and I hope that he is in good temper, and will apply himself to amending all the. wrong things that have been done in his Department. I am not complaining, of the administration of the Acting Minister for the Navy  spruce timber cut from the second plank below, the load; line of the Speedway, one of the new ships recently sent from America to the order, of. the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members can see how the wood is bored through and through, by the teredoI f . the contract for the construction of the shipwas made by an officer of the Navy Depart1 ment or by duly accredited' agents in America; the men who supervised the construction in the interests of the Government must have neglected their duty. If spruce, which is generally used for making light boxes, was used instead of good sound oregon, the Government should have some right of action against the contractors. I understand that the Speedway was fitted up, and went outside the Heads, but has returned,, and that a contract is now being let to refit the vessel at a cost of something like £3,000. This has happened within the last few weeks. I have previously cautioned the Department about the unseaworthiness of three ships, and my warnings have proved only, too well-founded. Two of them left. Hobart, and were wrecked, but, fortunately, with no loss of life. They should not have been allowed to go to sea. The last vessel in regard to which I uttered a warning was the'John Murray, which also was unfit to be sent to soa. ' I know that her previous captain would not have taken her outside the Heads. But the admiral of the House, 'the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) thought that a certain expenditure on the ship would make her safe. I , however, warned the Government that if the John Murray met bad weather, she would be lost. That prophecy has been verified. If these new ships that are heing built in America are in the condition - indicated by this piece of wood, they should not be allowed to go outside the Heads. I ask the Minister for the Navy to get the Law Department to peruse the contract for the construction of the ships, and if spruce has been substituted for oregon, and there is justice in theTJnited States of America, the Government should have a good case for damages for breach of contract. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I ask the honourable membeT to send me a copy of his remarks.",63

Such a question might be answered by the Minister for Trade and Customs or by the Prime Ministei . I make this gestion to him for his own peace of mind. I know that the honourable member is anxious to protect the industries of Australia; but one really wonders why these industries should need all this protecting after so many yeaTS of office of my honourable friend and his Labour followers, which have always been so solicitous about the industries of Australia-whe n in Opposition.",66
162,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,That is too t h in !,66
163,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But is it not as I say?,66
164,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,No ; we are the only decent party in that regard.,66
165,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My own i m pression, for what it is worth, is that my honourable friends opposite, during the whole, time they held the reins of government, never introduced a Tariff of any kind.",66
166,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is quite wrong; a Tariff was introduced by Mr Tudor.,66
167,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That , I believe, has always been left to other people.",66
168,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No , the honourable gentleman is wrong.",66
169,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Shal l I put it in this way: That my honourable friends opposite have introduced a Tariff,66
170,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The honourable gentleman has improved in temper.,66
171,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to get at the facts. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr HiggB) insists that the party opposite have introduced Tariffs. Have those Tariffs, then, been of such a character DrMALONEY - The whole thing has been a fraud ever since we came here. We promised that we would have a Protectionist Tariff, and we have never had it . Sir JOSEP H COOK - Then that is the kind of Tariff my honourable friends opposite have introduced !",66
172,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,They have all been a fraud up to the present.,66
173,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My honourable friends opposite either did introduce a Tariff or they did not. My impression is that, the party with which my honourable friends are' associated never took upon itself the responsibility of introducing H Tariff in this country. I am not criticising that fact just now, but only stating it. It does strike one as a little inconsug- sistent in the circumstances that the honourable member for Capricornia, who never, when over on this side of the House, troubled very much about the Tariff, should seem to be so tremendously concerned about it now.",66
174,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,There were too many of the honourable gentleman's way of thinking in the party when we introduced the Tariff.,66
175,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am addressing myself to the honourable' member's Deputy Leader. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) should assail me in this way, and perhaps I had - better resume my seat. . Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.23 p.m.",66
