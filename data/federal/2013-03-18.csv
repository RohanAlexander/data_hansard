Personally, I am comfortable with the idea for so many of the excellent reasons outlined MP in his Kirby oration last year. I do not limited time available, but I do wish to make society. I stated this in my first speech three in all shapes and sizes. I believe that changing include same-sex couples will not lessen the status will strengthen it by building stronger bonds of gender and sexual orientation. There will be some people in my own family position on the subject, because they have between a man and woman. There will be others marry is predicated on such a change. In ourselves and that we express our views in cost. The coalition party room has not yet debated the upcoming election. There is one thing agreement: it is that with any change religious mosques should not be forced by law to conduct forced to marry anyone today. Certainly this distinction between the civil and religious institution civil unions. Civil unions represent gradual and incremental facilitate statutory recognition of enduring federal level. There is clear broad based support to take stock, build further community consensus sex marriage just as it has taken place recently countries that have legislated for same-sex marriage. Unfortunately, this issue has been hijacked issue as a political weapon to divide the community outcomes. Hence we stand here today debating addressed rather than taking some",219

On the contrary, I think that it of commitment between two people regardless who will be disappointed with my personal a sincere view that marriage is an institution in my family, though, whose own ability to the end public life demands that we be true to an honest and open manner no matter what the what our commitment will be on this issue in though on which there would be universal institutions such as churches, synagogues or same-sex marriages just as they are not is my view. Naturally, this also highlights the of marriage and leads to the question of change in a highly charged area. They relationships which do not currently exist at a for them. They would allow the community and then consider whether to move to samein the United Kingdom and almost all other by one political party that prefers to use the rather than achieve any real progress or a bill that the parliament has already steps forward. I think that is a shame. to be able to make a contribution once is a source of regret for me and I know for many unable to see success in the vote on the earlier in this term; however, needless to say, it does not change the expectations I had when ultimately, we will see change in this area just to marriage and the status of people within decades. It is important to recall that fact, because marriage has been unchanging and remained cast at the last 100 years to see that marriage has Australians. Australia agreed to be bound by the International 1980 and, in doing so, it recognised the importance of nondiscrimination-and those are principles very dear. Many members of the Labor Party of nondiscrimination in a range of legislative means. After winning the 2007 federal election, Commonwealth laws to remove discrimination entirely appropriate that we did so. Accordingly, see many members of the Labor Party campaigning that context, I would like to put on record who have endeavoured to progress this debate think that they will end their efforts. I said at the outset that this is simply changes which have related to marriage and the I reflected on the role of women in marriage Indigenous people and their capacity to seek although women gained the right to vote in nationality when they married a non-Australian 1966, members will recall that many women had getting married.

Here he is: the first person ever in Australian opposition position from government. Can waste-watch spokesman. Can you believe Fraser. He cannot get on the government front bench from government. Now work that out. It is a bit the same as trying to work out played by the Labor Party because opposition might do as a result of two recent think tanks.

Can you imagine people Party? I know we have a bill before the cutting down any debate in newspapers-exactly now have the academic thought police over political history to be appointed to an you imagine? They have made him an opposition it? How embarrassing for the poor member for bench, so he is already on the opposition front this motion. This motion is a bit of a joke being if you look at the first point: (1) notes that: (a) a bipartisan parliamentary report recommended which is now operational having passed Parliament … That is true. Of course, it was policy was the Leader of the Opposition in his budget from the member for Fraser. We missed that the member for Wentworth's idea in the first Office, and so we do support a Parliamentary Budget Office particularly because when each going to have a deficit-that is a word you certain amount, but the final budget figures expected, we are looking for some independent because what we are seeing from the Labor government Australian budget on a rolling basis Therefore, we are suspicious of and sceptical We know they are politicised. We know that figures, to ensure that the budget looks more best way to ensure we get updated figures election. That takes me to point (2) of … calls on all parties to have their policies costed release them to the Australian people in That is an interesting point. So let us have costings before the election campaigns. In 2004, when Mr Latham was the leader Latham? I remember Mr Latham. I loved watching essay about the Labor Party last week. I really interesting analysis by Mr Latham. He does have the other side. When he was the leader of costings on Thursday, 7 October 2004. When within 48 hours. That was what we needed! policies costed consistent with the Charter Australian people in enough time for a well-informed years ago, and it was Mr Latham who was the that.

If you think you are getting the smell of 2010, when they were actually even in government, government to prepare for the election campaign, policy costings in that election campaign? August 2010. So that was within 24 hours of Labor Party and the member for Fraser think debate about policy costings. This is absolute hypocrisy. This is from up $12 billion of expenditure based on a tax They booked up $12 billion of expenditure, to have a debate about policy costings! What It is the greatest own goal in Those on that side of parliament, who inherited 2007, have turned that around to a $265 billion that last week in parliament the Prime Minister increasing the debt limit, and they want to record of releasing their policy costings We also heard the member for Fraser talk run in South Australia and Tasmania relating what has happened here.

The so-called their costs have subsequently been significantly not being forthcoming and fully frank with policies fully costed. That is why we have set up to ensure that we do not do that.

24,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," As I did pass a motion that, in the upcoming budget, papers that provides a 10-year road map on is talking to those mid-term structural issues forward estimates, as is the tradition, but of Australia's story lies. I hope that the House House supported it last year, a document was skinny document. It highlighted the need for executive government to be encouraged to story. Really, the only item of any significance timetable on the transition from nine per cent and the staggering of that transition over time. Whether you like that policy or not, it is need to do on a number of fronts. I continue reform and for a 10-year story to be told as state and federal taxes in our country, where a more efficient tax base and away from the system, which will, if unaddressed, have Australians. Up till now the comment has been, that.' It really is getting to the urgent point about the point that we cannot afford not to do standard of living. This parliament has done many good things the member for Riverina, when I entered the one of the important steps that has been taken that is a direct lift from the Henry tax reform reform as it is on responding to climate policy. responding to many of the science questions, but the tax-free threshold from the middle of this significant step along the journey of the recommend lifting the tax-free threshold through from the tax system altogether and all the inefficiencies and government. We have taken in this parliament-to Taxation to maximise the standard of living for Australians tax reform as a standalone Budget Paper as part of beyond the 4 year forward estimates period. last year, I seek the support of the House to a separate document be attached to the budget comprehensive tax reform and on how the budget that the economy faces-not just the four-year more focused on the 10-year agenda, where so much once again supports this motion. Because the attached to the budget papers. It was a very more of that 10-year story to be told and for do more focused work on sharing the 10-year in last year's 10-year road map was the superannuation to 12 per cent superannuation a good example of what Australia and this place to emphasise the need for comprehensive tax to how we are going to transition from 125 local, only four of them do 90 per cent of the lifting, to many, many inefficiencies in-built in our tax a material impact on our standard of living as 'Oh, we can't afford this,' or, 'We can't afford where it is less about what we can afford and more it. It will start to cause material damage to our and much good work. Despite the comments of room, about climate policy, I think that that is in this parliament. It is a market based scheme work. It is a step in the right direction on tax Not only is it a market based mechanism directly attached to that is a significant lift in year from $16,000 to $18,200. Again, it is a Henry tax review recommendations, whilst he did to $25,000 and removing even more people that go with that both for individuals this parliament's credit-a significant step in moving along that journey of lifting from the burden on participating in I would hope that, as this place starts to to put their cards on the table with regard to moment the position of government is not clear not clear either, nor in public commentary maintained or whether we return to the backwards in the tax-free threshold and bringing the tax system. I hope that can be corrected. Some of the other good things this communication technology and regional equity view that, so far from what I have seen, the the surface look like a fight between cat differences in detailed policy, they are not great. big push on education policy with regard to regional equity on that front that we can make I hope that has bipartisan support when it happens. All of those pressures make the point that policy sense and we have to make our tax system talk more between local, state and federal considerations. a material impact on our standard of I think it has been a great disappointment executive government to negotiate either through the bones of comprehensive tax reform and of inefficient tax issues whether in recommendations made by the very good work happened-the loss carry-back work with small lift coming in the middle of this year is excellent. furthering the research base in some of these income superannuation tax payments and the are cherry picking the nature of what is meant with those state governments and working issues of overlap, double-up and inefficiency and to the direct detriment of the I mention the ACT as a bit of a shining housing, and the transitioning that happened consider, and for us as a parliament and hopefully facilitate that work for other states.

This is simply not up to the task and that it simply with this government's reporting obligations. communities like those represented by the tax reform; but, as we saw with the Henry tax the job. The constituents of Lyne must question this government was the right one. States government, under President Lincoln, Transcontinental Railroad.

However, that get broken and then they fight each other The government of a young country with great to make long-term plans and then commit to the must not be changed on a daily basis to gain a steadfast. This government has lost direction by on the bridge, and that puts us all in peril leadership and long-term planning, and this will see this motion as an opportunity to debunk being a significant reforming government when very hard to reform the tax system. In fact, directly benefited people in my electorate, and earners-and I will go through some of them a high-taxing government, I think the 'facts' coalition government, the Howard government, In fact, the tax-to-GDP ratio will be lower Howard government, we would have collected $30 we came to government that tax reform was a must who deserved it. Our first action was to give reform and it came soon after we were cuts to lowand middle-income earners-to those But we did not stop there. Indeed, we took increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,200 be increased to $19,400. No-one can underestimate low-income earners. It is not only that those but that people are encouraged to get into the That is only the case under this government, the shadow Treasurer that the Liberal Party, million people back into the tax system.

Those two incredibly important measures Treasurer has also said that he will put the superannuation. It was very interesting to superannuation. It is those on the other superannuation-indeed, onto those who These are two very significant tax reforms. many others. We have certainly enabled people businesses through the loss carry-back and help with the cash flow that is so important previous government ignored but that we have There is a plan for the future. (Time expired) Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (12:51): I thank trying to sing the praises of this government's facts. Firstly, in relation to the tax-free threshold, to this meant that there was an effective tax-free been a small increase to $18,000, and the government per cent to 34 per cent for those earning more trick of this government; it just highlights policy. I would like to thank the member for Lyne made. However, given that he has been in a position of power, so to speak, I find it quietly strange 2½ years to advance the points that he sets out that, not having used that opportunity, he one million people out of the tax system by on 1 July 2012, and then from 1 July 2015 it will the impact that this will have for many in the workforce are able to pocket more money workforce because they are not being penalised. because we know through slips of the tongue by if they were to ever get elected, will put those will make them pay tax. They will discourage in the workforce. This is very shortthis particular reforming aspect-and not only to the effective tax paid on superannuation by there is a flat tax rate for superannuation tax rate has led to low-income earners receiving that is addressing that and that will provide a annually for individuals on adjusted taxable of the superannuation taxation arrangements. low-income earners, 'We are going to help you you can participate in the workforce; but we will when it comes to superannuation, when it come were opposed by those opposite. The shadow tax back onto low-income earners when it comes to hear the previous speaker talk about tax on side that have a plan to put tax back onto have the most difficulty in earning. Time does not allow me to get to the many, to have better cash flow in their small the instant asset write-off. These two measures for small business. It is something that the allowed. Indeed, it encourages investment. the member for Kingston for her contribution, tax policy. Let me enlighten her on a couple of the low-income tax offset that we had prior threshold of $16,000. So there has only really also increased the base tax rate from 30 than $18,000. So it is the usual pea and thimble where this government really is in terms of tax for his motion, the intention of which is well for the past 2½ years of holding the reins that he has not used the opportunity in the past in his motion. I think it is quite hypocritical now puts this motion before the House. That is especially the case if we have a look at his seen over the past 2½ years. He supported both why is he putting this motion before the House increased taxes is pretty much unblemished.

Imagine at this stage we had previously ruled out the mining tax. The million-dollar tax forum to a major new tax initiative, the Business Tax with doing the government's work to find forums, summits, working groups: it is all talk increased taxes. In the past five years, we have the most notable being the carbon tax tax, mentioned in the Henry tax review. the government release 'a 10-year road map for budget paper'. We cannot go six months without the past nine months, we have seen countless consistent approach to tax, and we have seen of tax legislation.

NA of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013 Second Reading the second reading of this private member's suite of measures that are necessary to bring to that has characterised, and been experienced under, the governance of the current government. Kingsford Smith said to Steve Price, then with 2UE: … we'll change it all … He later sought to distance himself from protection, there was no truer statement issued that. This government has changed it all when has changed all of it, every last little bit of it. Those changes started with the abolition described by the then minister for immigration, abolition of the Pacific solution. They broke just days before the election in 2007. commitment. They abolished temporary protection on the table for people smugglers to sell. They May 2008. They abolished temporary protection They abolished the Pacific solution. They But they did not stop there. They abolished made in the process of determining whether adopted by the UNHCR all around the world. series of subsequent appeals mechanisms have that if at first they do not succeed, an asylum again, because they have a 75 per cent chance are routinely turned into yeses if you come by boat. They restored full access to the courts when any of the legal protections for Australia that notion that this government have moved on comes to whether people have access to the government had already moved to give them full as well. This government also, in effect, abolished because they thought it was wrong; they did detention centres had become so overwhelmed under this government's failed border policies run out of options. They had blown the budget. and those involved in riots and all sorts of for maybe one, possibly two, who were actually and outrageous acts that took place, as Australians burn to the ground. They abolished mandatory detention and community with work rights. I remember warning those who were seeking to come by boat everything boat, straight into the community and straight were getting and continue to get what they paid for. Prior to the 2007 election, the member for those comments. But, when it comes to border by any member of the now government than it comes to border protection in this country. It of the Pacific solution back on 8 February 2008, Senator Evans, as his proudest moment: the their promise to turn back boats, a promise made Prime Minister Rudd walked away from that visas, putting permanent residency back did that, interestingly, on my birthday, on 13 visas. They abolished turning back the boats. abolished at all. They changed at all. the single officer review process for decisions someone is a refugee. Now, that is the process Abolishing that process and putting in place a revealed again today, as have previous figures, seeker coming by boat will certainly try and try of that 'no' decision being overturned. So noes they took their decision to effectively abolish existed in having excised offshore places. The excising the entire Australian mainland when it courts is a complete nonsense, because the access to the courts. So they abolished that mandatory detention. But they did not do it it because the detention centres were full. The due to the scale of arrivals that has occurred that they just had to let people out. They had People who were in centres burnt them down outrageous behaviour got away scot-free-except convicted for their roles in those offensive looked on and watched detention centres in late 2011 they released people into the at the time that this was basically giving they were looking for-straight off the into the opportunity to have work rights, they This was the complete removal of every last former Prime Minister of this country to ensure that wall down in its entirety. It is all gone. what they destroyed but in the rebuilding, have shown neither the conviction nor the competence least in terms of the Pacific solution. I briefly mention again this government embarked on a system of release into the community no protocols to not only protect those who appropriate protections for the community itself. government's lack of guidelines and processes needed to be addressed-it does need to be addressed government will not address it. Their policy mind'. Their policy on community release is every last brick in John Howard's wall government. What has been the result of all this? We know that former Prime Minister Rudd Minister Gillard has been unable to stop them, Prime Minister and her government lack both as has been demonstrated. The result has been that more than 30,000 people have arrived illegally government was elected; over 1,000 people are blow-outs since the last election alone and over people who would have otherwise got a permanent humanitarian program, our offshore program, of sight, out of mind. No visas for those desperate situations that, frankly, none of us been to some of those places-and I have In the latest statistics which have been 10,384 Afghans made applications under our those, 712 received a visa-just seven per arrived illegally by boat and had their claims received permanent visas. So under Labor's are 13.7 times more likely to get a permanent offshore. Why wouldn't you get on a boat under odds-13.7 times more likely-then that is called demand and will continue to be The number of permanent visas given to times higher than the number given to offshore more visas, in absolute numbers, were given those who had applied offshore. That is despite of applicants offshore. But they are out of those who have come by boat, through their process, measures that worked under the Howard government. brick in the wall that John Howard built up as we had strong borders. They have knocked Lately, they have made attempts to try to rebuild having been dragged kicking and screaming, they to put those measures back in place, at abolishing mandatory detention. They have now that has no safeguards, no guidelines and are released into the community but also provide A few weeks ago, I made the point that the around their community release program and it still needs to be addressed. This now on community release is 'out of sight, out of 'no care, no responsibility'. So we have seen of border protection knocked down by this started the boats and we know that Prime and she will never be able to, because this the policy and the resolve to address this issue, chaos, cost and tragedy. The result has been by boat, on over 580 boats, ever since this dead in the water; over $5 billion in budget $6 billion since they were elected; and 8,100 protection visa under our refugee and did not get those visas. They were left out-out who are waiting in places around the world in could really imagine unless you have physically seen some of those places first hand. released by the department for the year 2011-12, offshore refugee humanitarian program. Of cent. Of the 2,058 people from Afghanistan who assessed in that same year, 96 per cent of them policies if you are an Afghan seeking asylum you visa if you get on a boat rather than apply this government, frankly? If they are the a people smugglers' product. It is in high if it is 13.7 times more likely. Afghans who arrived illegally by boat was three applicants from Afghanistan. Three times to those who came here illegally by boat than to the fact that there were five times the number sight, out of mind. This government is favouring their decisions and their abolition of the According to the most recent stats from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship applicants were rejected and did not get visas to nine per cent of rejections Under Labor's policy, people coming on nothing that will underpin a business model better through the evidence I have put before you. government it makes eminent sense, even at that permanent visa are significant. They are through the more regular process, as tens of thousands apply offshore.' Over 10,000 Afghans applied got a visa. This bill is designed to take permanent Australia illegally by boat. This bill is about hope the government would adopt all the ensuring that permanent residence is The measures are twofold. The first of directly and have entered Australia illegally temporary protection visa, and that temporary rights. Those rights would include things like temporary protection visa and a bridging visa that-temporary. It is given at the end of process to be a refugee. A bridging visa is refugee as yet. In fact, no-one who has arrived community today has had their claim A temporary protection visa would go temporary protection visa would be given to come through the proper method through an delinks the two programs. Not one permanent given to someone who has directly arrived by out of the same pool, so everyone who continues from someone who has applied offshore. Our policy of temporary protection visas The other thing our policy does, which is encapsulated on permanent residence for anyone who has made application to have their refugee status someone who had that opportunity, in Indonesia to be a refugee if they arrived in Australia protection visa, there would be a statutory residence and, therefore, obviously citizenship as well. These are the sorts of measures you need that overall package of measures that ensured that fact; they did. It was the result. It was the achieved that purpose. I contrast that to the for the 2011-12 year, 40,000 offshore last year. That is 85 per cent. That is compared for those who turned up on boats. boats are getting what they paid for. There is than that. They are guaranteeing the result For those who seek to come on a boat, under this the risk to their own lives. The odds of getting significantly greater than if you apply offshore do. It is often put to me: 'But they can't offshore in 2011-12. Seven per cent of those residence off the table for those who come to putting back in place this key measure-while I measures, I know that is a forlorn hope-and not something that will go on the table. those measures enables those who have come by boat or otherwise to be eligible for only a protection visa would have attached to it certain the ability to work. The difference between a is that a temporary protection visa is exactly the process where someone has been found by the given to someone who has not been found to be a since 13 August last year and is out there in the even assessed, let alone determined. to those who had completed the process. A someone not at the expense of someone who has offshore application. The coalition's policy protection visa offered under our system will be boat. The government system takes those visas to come by boat will continue to take a visa That is the government's policy. does not do that. Our policy separates the two. in this bill, is that it puts a statutory bar come through a country where they could have assessed-a secondary mover as it is known. So or Malaysia, for example, if they were found and were in the position of gaining a temporary bar against that person going onto permanent we had in place last time that were part of the the boats stopped coming as they did-it is a purpose of those measures, and those measures measures that the government has put in placemeasures that abolished it all, changed it all, chaos, cost and tragedy. The government should today, I think, be as these measures as they were in 2007, if they really idea. But if they do that then they need to take turning up on 582 boats; more than a thousand people denied permanent visas who are waiting world and other places; and more than $5 billion failures. The government should be accountable Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (13:12): is going to be totally ineffective. This is support the government in defending Australian bring in further stipulations on 457 visas, an the worse abuse in the Australian immigration student intake led to racist attacks in this media because a person stabbed his wife to was responsible for the death of a child; and seemingly murdered by their employers in a attacked and hailed as racist in India because They will not take responsibility for the that to do is increase wariness in the Australian population, that we cannot trust people coming into this regard to the rather flamboyant suggestions society the local police should be told. The fact that the statistics, the real world, says seekers in this country is far What we are seeing today is a rather perverse know will fail. The previous speaker spoke have entered by boat. He said 'It's a fact that year of the introduction of the temporary protection 12,000 people came by boat. Yes, the number connected with this policy, it would seem to traceable in any measure for about two years account, that these people sitting around the message earlier. This is again an indication that the level with what is happening in countries overseas discrimination, torture and murder, than it itself. I attended a function on the weekend related murdered by bombings and direct assassinations reality that drives the boat arrivals. It has very that the opposition come forward with. Yes, boats coming to this country, but they do not are another example of when they did not have a policy. removed it all-and the consequences have been boisterous in talking up their abolition of all believe it, if they thought that was the right responsibility for the results: 33,962 people people dead in the water; more than 8,000 offshore and languishing in camps around the in budget blow-outs as a result of their for those failures. (Time expired) The previous speaker well knows that this a guise from an opposition who is not prepared to jobs with regard to a long overdue attempt to opposition whose total dereliction of duty led to system: the blow-out of the international country and more extreme elements of the Indian death; because a friend of a family in Melbourne because Indian nationals in the Riverina were dispute over wages. This country was ostracised, of the mess created by the previous government. dereliction of duties but what they are trying to increase a sense of worry and terror: country by boat. We saw this more recently with that whenever an asylum claimant is released into local community should be advised, despite the that the level of criminality committed by asylum lower than the general population. attempt to give some cover to a policy they about the numbers of people in recent years who the boats stopped' because of their policies. In the visa measure and the two years after that, of boats eventually declined; but, if it is to be have had a very long term impact, as it was not afterwards. One would have thought, from his coffee shops in Jakarta would have picked up the of boats coming to this country is very much to do in regards to human rights abuses, racism, does to do with the policies within this country to the 20,000 Pakistani Shia that have been over the last few years. This is the kind of little to do with these so-called cure-all policies they have a problem with the large numbers of have the solution. Temporary protection visas One of the brilliant outcomes of their policy-and boats, and I talked about the boats that kept to stop family reunions. What did we see as a coming here by boat from Iraq and Afghanistan magnificent accomplishment on their part because, and women coming by boats increased from people were not allowed to bring their endangering themselves and leading to tragic three-quarters of the 353 people who drowned-dead and children. This is just a guise, a pretence: they are area that they alone in the world can stop America faces it, but they alone in international this. They know it is not true and they know that, in planes is related to what is happening in their poverty and socio-economic problems in the country, coming here in these boats, as I said the other very real and continuing human rights abuses. We have seen in the last week a degree confident that they will win the next election, reality of their election. Up to now it has coming. No problems; we will do it within previously said that he would stop the boats suddenly retreat from that comment, saying that He said: We can make a difference from the first few weeks. He was going to stop them despite the advice Australian service personnel and reservists everything.

When is very enthusiastic about stopping the boats-the government would reduce the number of boats commented, 'I am not making any forecasts.' He is making such forecasts. He These people supposedly, allegedly, have people are concerned about. In electorates like the member for Cook did refer to those coming after the introduction of this policy-was result of that? In 1999, 12 per cent of claimants were women and children. It was a two years later, the number of children 12 to 42 per cent. It was augmented. Because families here, they started to come by boat, events such as SIEVX in October 2001, where because of those policies-were women so brilliant and know so much about this policy the movement of people.

Clearly, people day, originate from countries where there are of truthfulness from the opposition. They are so they have to soften up the electorate for the been unquestionable: 'We will stop the boats weeks.' While the Leader of the Opposition within months, last week we saw the him he would only be able to 'make a difference'. from the Navy, despite the dangers to in those boats. He was above that.

Of the recipients of TPVs issued when the incoming government-widely advised policy, 88 per cent had already been granted people on TPVs-the supposed solution to the was going to stop people paying smugglers been granted permanent status. So one wonders the remaining 1,000, 815 were to be The truth about TPVs-which the opposition neon lights for the Australian public-is that actually departed the country. After all the in this system-this process of leaving people 379 people departed the country. The TPVs did not stop the boats. The boats two years. They were a spectacular failure in with a successive rise in the number of unauthorised the end of the day, a very miserly proportion country. As I say, this legislation is just a policy to be effective against these boats. Whilst the Prime Minister of the country today Burma in regard to human rights issues, particularly Rakhine state of Burma, we cannot have any this issue with Indonesian authorities, the people had two visits there. As I indicated last week, satay peanut sauce with the Indonesian President, the Opposition did not discuss. It is the central according to the opposition, but he did not manage, about the fact that Australia, under him, would that the Indonesians might not be impressed somewhat hostile and might have given a message have thought that he actually should get the this region for a regional solution to the there and he discussed everything under the have, of sending the boats back. One has to doubt to doubt their sincerity today about TPVs. Quite frankly, I do not think we can have affairs taking it up. We saw the rather depressing, in Sri Lanka recently, where she alone of international have been there and commented found that basically The opposition are trying to intimate to the Now, as an election gets closer, all of a sudden going to make an effort; we're going to do definite position, as I said earlier. solution to everything actually led to very visas getting on planes back to their between their introduction in 1999 and 2008, by experts in the field-abolished this harsh permanent status. Eighty-eight per cent of the problem, the so-called dissuasive policy which and stop people coming on boats-had already what kind of disincentive that really was. Of granted permanent status after that. have not really been too keen on putting in only 3.4 per cent, or 379, of the people on them boats, all the people coming and all the claimants in a limbo land of uncertainty for years-only kept coming at a fairly high level for another terms of achieving the stated deterrent objective, maritime arrivals after TPVs. Then, at of the people on TPVs actually departed the guise, a pretence that the opposition have got a will take it up to the visiting President of in relation to the Rohingya people in the faith in the Leader of the Opposition taking up that we have to get cooperation with. He has he might have discussed lumpia, gado gado and but there was one issue that the Leader of issue, the biggest problem in the country, in those discussions, to at any stage talk send the boats back. One would have thought with that idea, that they might have been back to the opposition leader. One would cooperation of Indonesia and other countries in question of boat movements. But no. He went up roof except the central policy the opposition their sincerity about this policy, as one has much faith in the shadow minister for foreign to put it mildly, performance that she put up visitors, including world leaders, who all things are great there: 'There are no problems in Sri Lanka at the moment. It's all boats would be coming.' This is in contrast to able to make some analysis of problems there. This is a policy which is not going to succeed. But it is a policy which would bring great suffering Western world, a group of nations we associate They are saying that a person that they themselves have grounds for protection, will only be reviewed in another three years.

Instead, This policy for TPVs should be rejected. the Australian public that they have some solutions-solutions are solutions which essentially led to only 'We're going to send them back'-leaving the received TPVs under their previous regime stayed it is just show.

There is no doubt about that and it have to say it is here to stay with great benefit of this report. I am very glad that we have been tabled. It was a mammoth effort with 32 public hearings all over the country-regional of Adelaide and a visit in my electorate to the migrants to settle into the country. The college courses, et cetera. The inquiry was chaired the deputy chair was the member for Brisbane, both of them and the committee for This committee had a bit of a South majority on the committee. I would like to greatly to the report. He is here in the Senator Gallacher, and the member for Makin. It is important to make that point because Don Dunstan multiculturalism was an area that in other parts of Australia. It was good to working on this report. The report is unique in that it has bipartisan member for Brisbane and from other members worth celebrating. Today this report highlights share the values and the same vision for Australia is a very good thing. We agree that support in and from our community and we agree that diversity is not something just to not only is there a role for every Australian every Australian stands to benefit greatly history of Australia with its waves of migrants. knowing that whilst there are often heated debates chamber downstairs, there are also times principles. Getting to this point has been no easy hundreds of submissions pouring in from all with different solutions and different plans. diversity is all about-getting all those different have their say.

We be accepted but to be celebrated. We agree that in helping to create a welcoming country but that from doing so. We have seen that throughout the It is very encouraging to be here today in this Federation Chamber and in the main when we unite to support a common set of path. When the inquiry was announced we had over Australia, with many, many different views We all saw that. It was good and that is what views in and listening to all those people to carefully consider every submission in chair myself, as have many others, I know left unturned. That is what is so powerful about that any report taken in this area. It will and to refer to when we are discussing issues and I was pleased to see that many of of multiculturalism as a long-term cultural and she said it quite well, 'Settlement is a multiculturalism can't and won't happen That is so important.

It is a magnificent community. I congratulate Kim Hebenstreit, to assisting new arrivals to get the services that the certificates that they require in English within our society and live, as I said, good Many organisations gave evidence to the All of them try their hardest to do all that language difficulties and certainly people who, these services, would find it very difficult employment and access to the services which people who gave evidence to our inquiry. In looking forward together on these issues, come on the issue of multiculturalism. The where we are today was quite stark during the my parents came over in the early fifties. They They had very few English skills. They worked those days, Australia was a very different place as a young child, when they took out their citizenships the immediate area-and how important that day something that will stay with me forever and those days, when I think of the period when still had the white Australia policy. The receiving their citizenship would have been not the UK, because they did not need to obtain different place. We have moved We know that one in four Australians were more than 150 countries, and there are more alone. It was so important that this report looked because at the end of the day what affects them ensure that we provide the services that are lives.

I note that the report of the and Financial Services into the Trio collapse I do want to comment on his thoughtful but I want to make three points in the that Trio is a tragedy. Second, I think we should self-managed superannuation funds. And third, I which is contemplated in this motion. what happened in Trio was a tragedy, $176 million lost money investing through their self-managed the ARP Growth Fund.

The policy in the brief time available is we ought to be superannuation funds. For people who understand a very good and flexible vehicle for people to market evidence suggests that with now over $450 in self-managed funds.

But involved and the fact that, if you take on the savings, you are taking on that responsibility. member for Throsby has highlighted, the fact that in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) funds in the case of fraud and theft. I do caution that there are a number of powerful are not too happy about the quantum of superannuation funds. It suits them to suggest superannuation fund vehicle. As policymakers, degree of self-interest involved on the part might lead to quite onerous regulation applying compromising their effectiveness What I also think is very important, that collapse, is that our $1.5 trillion superannuation criminals. We must make sure that there is adequate to protect against that threat. One conclusion collapse is that our regulators have perhaps Recommendation 14 of the report was that the options to create an organisational focus working in cooperation with Thirdly, let me now turn to the specific in his motion this evening. I am going to speak which talks about a member funded compensation scheme investors. I note that in his remarks managed investment schemes. That would actually would apply to managed investment schemes and other kinds of investors invested. Let me of the motion-that is, the idea that if a particular money due to fraud or theft, then other self-managed way levied to compensate for that or potentially sector. I think both of those are potentially motion. I certainly acknowledge the genuine but I do not think this is the right solution. Firstly, the whole notion of self-managed choose to take on, as an individual, the responsibility the pool of funds built up to fund your retirement four other people, usually members of your close The policy basis that has applied for the last do not have the benefit of the last-resort APRA regulated funds. Secondly, for people who have consciously relying upon a professional investment manager, the benefits.

Australian Federal Police should consider the on matters pertaining to superannuation fraud, the Australian Crime Commission. measure that the member for Throsby has proposed specifically about the wording of the motion, scheme for self-managed superannuation the member for Thorsby talked about a levy on be a different type of policy measure that into which self-managed superannuation funds restrict myself to what is described on the face self-managed superannuation fund loses superannuation funds should be in some that there ought to be a levy across the entire contemplated by the kind of language that is in the policy intent to deal with this serious problem, superfunds, as I have referred to, is that you for managing your retirement savingsincome-together with the savings of up to family. That does bring with it greater risks. 20 years or so is that one of the risks is that you compensation scheme that applies in the case of chosen to-as it were-go it alone rather than a corollary is that if it goes well you capture the losses. Those are losses from making poor fraud and theft. That is not a very palatable message if you do well-but it is inherent in If you do not want to take that risk, and I not well advised to take that risk and are do not choose a self-managed superannuation The third point I would make is that any where there has been fraud or theft proven. real policy challenges in this area is moral scheme available then people who lose money advantage of that scheme and they might also than you would be if such a scheme did not exist.

55,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," I rise (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection colleague the shadow minister for immigration coalition's long-held belief that we need to return of the Howard government if we are to regain control over who comes to our country. There was an announcement by the government illegal boat arrival today. That means that financial year alone-and bear in mind that we financial year-than occurred under the whole just an indication of the unprecedented wave experiencing because of the failed border protection Labor Party since they have come to office. Given that very serious record of failure, will not return to the point where they broke and did things like repealing the issue of temporary solution. They refused to implement their stated turn the boats around. It strikes me as very point of August 2007 when they broke the inherited from the previous government.

The bill was moved by my and citizenship and is in line with the to the successful border protection policies some control over our borders and have some about an hour ago that there was another there have been more illegal boat arrivals this are only three-quarters of the way through this 11 years of the Howard government. That is of illegal boat arrivals that we have been policies that have been pursued by the it strikes me as very strange that the Labor Party the system. That was when they came to office protection visas and abolishing the Pacific policy for the 2007 election, which was to strange that the Labor Party do not go back to the robust system of border protection they had they made those policy changes they sent the people smugglers that Australia was once again a to have the resolve to stand up to their evil In September 2008, literally a month after the Pacific Solution and the abolition of went back into business. In September 2008 come down to Australia again. They came Subsequently, at the end of 2008 and in unprecedented rate of arrival has been continuing over 14,000 people arrive illegally this financial is getting very close to one illegal boat arrival Australia. As a result, even though the detention cope with this influx, the government has been live on welfare, with no entitlement to work, also to the Australian taxpayer. This bill is an attempt to rectify some of makes perfect sense to me and my colleagues reinstate the strong border protection policies problem when we were faced with it in very year 2001. Prior to 2001 we had a substantial arrivals. Success breeds success with people get people down here illegally the more people smugglers and the more people would arrive was faced with very similar circumstances. boat arrivals continue to increase in the late Howard government said: 'Enough is enough. controlling our immigration system. We are going down.' People smugglers are not some sort of diabolical criminals who cared absolutely here, to the point where you can hear dreadful employed the services of the people smuggler abandoned ship. We will not know the extent this journey because it is impossible to get people who have lost their lives taking this There is no doubt that hundreds upon hundreds journey-hundreds of adult women It is not the case, as the government would can do about this, that we have to accept that smuggling, that it is going to be ever-present is not the case. The reason we know that is not past. The Howard government was faced with tough but necessary decisions that were controversial time. What you cannot argue is that they taken they essentially completely and In the years after 2001-2002 and up until an average of three illegal boat arrivals per those changes had been made-the abolition of temporary protection visas-the people smugglers we had the first wave of illegal boat arrivals in what was, in hindsight, only a trickle. 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and this year the to increase to the point where we have had year alone, and almost 240 illegal boats. That per day. That is not a rate that we can sustain in network has been massively expanded to forced to release people into the community to in a way that I think is detrimental to them and the damage that the Labor Party has done, and it in the opposition that we should seek to that the Howard government used to solve this similar circumstances in the decade up until the increase in every given year of illegal boat smuggling: the more the people smugglers could would seek out the services of the people in Australia illegally. The Howard government Success bred success and the number of illegal 1990s and in the year 2000.

That the case is we have solved this problem in the very similar circumstances. In 2001 it took within the Australian community at the were not successful. Once those measures were utterly closed down people smuggling. 2008 when those policies were reversed, we had year. Three per year; that is one every four months. If you want to put that into context, we used to have three a year under the Howard policies and now we can have double that Party's failed border protection policies. The way we are going to reverse this is to actually worked. A very successful part of Temporary protection visas work incredibly people smugglers are selling.

In the meantime, comfortable with everything the panel report known-it has presented recommendations which But TPVs have utterly no place in the panel's place in Australia's response to the circumstances that neither in the recommendations of the Houston sanction the use of temporary protection visas, its comments on TPVs are confined to referring 91 of the report. It is worthwhile noting that Howard government's TPV arrangements being by saying that 95 per cent of asylum seekers protection visas were ultimately granted a The opposition has long claimed that TPVs by boat to Australia. The facts simply do protection visas were issued between 1999 will work again with a newly elected coalition speaker's contribution reveals to me is those opposite would rather resile from convention no concept of them.

Around 11,200 temporary and 2008 and, of that number, around 380 people actually left Australia-that is around 3½ per TPVs, there was a rise in the proportion arrived in Australia carrying asylum seekers reunions. On practical grounds, TPVs simply fail, but is not refuge and cannot be refuge if it is away. How can people ever be expected to accepted at one point in time as a well-founded temporary stay? The cruelty of TPVs is that, even if an asylum the convention and our laws, they would face expiry of the three-year period for which they on refugees to demonstrate that their Under the bill before us a person in genuine country that is a refugee convention country permanent protection. There are many reasons provision is simply a penalty. It means that certainty for an unknown period of time. The Liberals' previous version of this permanent protection if, in their travel to Australia, of seven days where they could have sought as I remarked earlier, this was difficult to 'could have sought and obtained effective protection'. precisely the same language as the original-in absolutely nothing from the failure of their grounds and it fails in its drafting. But the most important issue for me, and for question of the hardship faced by those government's term.

So the idea that somehow just nonsense. We have an incredibly difficult situation work in the Howard years and they will not the boats increased-and they were not temporary. permanently. The visas were cruel beyond belief, women and children on boats. So at The visas were introduced in 1999 by the unauthorised maritime arrivals.

76,Ms HALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," This week, is an opportunity for all communities in my senior citizens and to let them know how contributions. It is important that members much we value them. I am passionate about Australians, one that recognises their Governments and the media in advertising stereotypical image of older Australians, wonderful people. For instance, the Intergenerational Howard-Costello government looked at the costs and age expenditure, fragility, workplace placed costs on the Australian economy, rather that older people make to our country. Australian with spending pressures. It states: Ageing of the Australian population will contribute It goes on to project increases in age related report continues along the same lines throughout its pages. Every approach from the Howard-Costello looks at the cost of ageing. At no stage does the contributions that they make to our society. 'doddery' instead of looking at 'active', 'caring', people are. In this place during Seniors Week put on the record that we believe that older society. Whilst I talked about the negative literature for some more positive articles. To be quite frank the contribution of older Australians. There but nowhere does it set down very Some figures I found in the Productivity volunteering does contribute to our economy-and parliament would recognise the enormous contribution The report mentioned that about $21 billion work done by volunteers. That is $21 billion community. It goes without saying that the older. Whilst we talk about the cost of an ageing look at the benefits to our society-what those regard to those figures for volunteering, if for themselves, developing something from cleanest and greenest food available anywhere to modernise their own properties. This is a New South Wales Seniors Week New South Wales celebrates Seniors Week. It home state to celebrate the achievements of our much we appreciate their achievements and ensure that seniors in their electorates know how creating a positive message around senior achievements and ongoing contributions. have often opted to create a negative rather than promoting a positive image of these report commissioned under the of an ageing population. It looked at health participation and pension, and how these issues than looking at society and the contribution 2050: future challenges identifies ageing to substantial pressures on government spending … spending to 27.1 per cent of GDP in 2049. The government, in the report that I referred to, it look at the benefits from older Australians and It uses words like 'frail', dependent', 'slow', 'connected', 'vibrant'-all things that older in New South Wales, it is important for us to Australians make an enormous contribution to our that surrounds older Australians, I have looked with you, I could find very little that details is vague reference to volunteering and child care, definitely their enormous contribution.

With you factor in informal childcare arrangements, the figure goes up to $42 billion. That is a $42 billion our society, which is quite a contribution. Many senior Australians would still like retirement age. Unfortunately, there are many the workplace which act as a barrier to advertising, you can see it is based on younger-looking of society are portrayed as tired and worn disability and dementia, when two out of three 'good or excellent'.
