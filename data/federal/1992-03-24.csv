3,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. In the Sydney Morning Herald of Thursday, 19 March, in an article by Tom Burton headed 'Factional dispute over MCLeay still unresolved', reference was made to your own position, Mr Speaker. In this article there is a comment that at that meetingMr Hand-Ob, come on! Sit down. This is a waste of Parliament's time. What about the preselection for the front bench of the Liberal Party?",10
4,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! Will the right honourable member get to where he maintains a point of privilege is involved?,10
5,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"Happily, Mr Speaker. I quote from the article: At that meeting the Minister for Defence and strongman of the Victorian Right, Senator Ray, is understood to have said Mr MCLeay was 'the worse speaker they had ever had'. While I understand that under the Parliamentary Privileges Act there have been changes relating to defamatory comments, you will recall, Mr Speaker, that in a ruling of your own not so very long ago, on 9 October 1990, as reported on page 2421 of Hansard, you said: I would be very happy if the House would like to change those ruleswhich are with respect to the Parliamentary Privileges Actso that we might bring statements made by the Speaker or other members outside the House into this chamber. Mr Speaker, you will know that in the House of Commons, to which our Standing Orders require us to turn when our own Standing Orders are inadequate, there have been a number of recent rulings relating to allegations about the impartiality of the Chair. I would suggest that they have real relevance to this allegation by Senator Ray about yourself. Indeed, Mr Speaker, if you would like to tum to page 250 of the House of Commons Hansard of 17 January 1978, you would see that a similar matter was raised by a Mr Anthony Grant in which he referred to a photograph of Mr Speaker of the House of Commons and said: There are a whole series of precedents, Mr. Speaker, whereby accusations of partiality on the part of the Speaker ,have been held to be a contempt of the House. The Speaker considered that particular matter, and I think it worthwhile even for members of the Government to understand the response. I refer them to page 460 of Hansard of 18 January 1978, where Mr Speaker in the House of Commons responded: Yesterday, the hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr Grant) raised a matter of privilege concerning a caption on the back page of The Guardian which, he claimed, implied a reflection on the impartiality of Mr Speaker. I should inform the House that within two hours of the complaint having been made. I received a letter  giving me an assurance that no such reflection was intended and expressing regret that the caption may have been misconstrued. Mr Speaker, I put two questions to you. Firstly, I believe this is a matter of parliamentary privilege, for you will know that although the provision in section 6 does not mean that a defamatory attack may not be found to be a contempt, it also means that it can be by reason only that it is defamatory. In other words, there is reason for the allegation by Senator Ray to raise doubts about your impartiality. I put to you, sir, two suggestions, therefore: one, that it should be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges; second, that failing, that you take up that admonition that you yourself expressed on 9 October 1990. The question of that particular subsection of the Parliamentary Privileges Act should be referred to the Privileges Committee to see whether it should be deleted. I am sure that we all believe that any suggestion of partiality on your part would not be capable of being sustained. We would want the assurance that members of the Government felt the same. On that basis, in spite of the difficulties that may be having in preselection, I suggest to you that those comments are totally untoward and that Senator Ray should be brought to heel on the basis of having declared you 'the worse speaker they had ever had' .",10
6,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I just say three things to the right honourable member for New England. The first is something that I have said to him in the past frequently: he should not believe everything that he reads in the Sydney Morning Herald. The second is that the right honourable gentleman quite properly referred to section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987. As he is well aware, and as other honourable members are obviously well aware, statements made outside the House are not of the same nature as they used to be. The third thing I say to him is that I do not have any intention of giving precedence to a motion to be moved. I call the Prime Minister. NA",11

10,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that as the Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, will be absent from Question Time today tomorrow due to family bereavement.

In his absence questions should be directed to the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths. NA Unemployment: Wills Electorate",11
11,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask: is you the Prime Minister aware that there are nearly 19,000 unemployed people in Wills and related areas, washed up by the recession that he created? That is a 71 per cent increase in the last 12 months. Is he also aware that at the close of business yesterday the Coburg CES listed only 26 jobs in the electorate of Wills? What is the Prime Minister going to tell the other 18,900-odd jobless in Wills: 'Trust me; I will, get it right next time'?",11
12,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We saw in the national accounts figures last week that the economy had recorded positive growth for the second consecutive quarter. The linkage between employment and GDP is a very close one. If one wants to look at any graphic illustration of that back over 10 or 20 years, one will find that whenever GOP moves so too does employment. Therefore, as we have often said in the House, employment is a lagged and lagging indicator of activity. Therefore, one would expect movements in employment to follow a shift in GOP-to succeed it, to come after it. That said, though, there has been, over a period of months, a consistent trend towards a stronger level of employment in the economy, notwithstanding the fact that unemployment has risen a jot with a shift in participation rates.",11
13,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A jot? What is a jot?,11
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it has risen from 10.4 per cent to 10.5 per cent in the last monthnot in the last 18 months. I can only say that, the economy picks up, particularly as the Government's One Nation package has its and impact upon economic activity, as we see ac'tivity rising, we expect, therefore, to see the employment picking up. But the main thing I is that we have preserved the larger proportion of the employment gains of the 1980sof the 1.8 million jobs created between 1983 and 1990, l.S million have been retained. It is a more fully employed society than it was, notwithstanding the fact that we are less than happy about the unemployment rate which obtains at the moment, and that would obtain in Wills as it does in other parts of the country.",11
15,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Look at the population when you compare the figures.,12
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order I The honourable member for Bendigo will cease interjecting. Mr KEATINGI do not recall the Leader of the Opposition through the late 1980s, when he was a Treasury spokesman or a backbencher in the Parliament, talking about those months when we were having 90,000 and 110,000 a month in employment growth. I guarantee that we would have gone weeks and months without a mention of employment from the Opposition side. All we have now is the focus by the Leader of the Opposition, the continual gloomy comments coming from him about the economy and his belief that, if the economy is weaker, then his fortunes will be politically advanced. Mr Ruddock interjecting",12
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Dundas.,12
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He used the remark about 'washed ashore'. What we have seen washed ashore with him is just an attempt by him perpetually to diminish confidence in the economy and to suffocate whatever latent pick-up there is in either confidence or activity. Business Investment,12
19,Dr CHARLESWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer and relates to tht'(December national accounts figures released last week. Can the Treasurer advise the House what those figures show ip. relation to investment? Can he also advise whether initiatives in One Nation will improve business investment?,12
20,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. It is true, but not surprising, that investment at this stage of the economy's turnaround from recession to recovery is weak. It is a fact that investment tends to be procyclical and picks up during a recovery. The Government had this precise point in mind when it took the decisions it did in One Nation to review and improve the taxation treatment of investment in plant and equipment in order to build in a new incentive for that kind of investment. "" We now find that Australia has a world class depreciation system in relation to the taxation treatment of investment in plant and equipment. This will be aggressively competitive for businesses in Australia making a decision about where they invest and businesses outside Australia making decisions about where they invest. The point is that it will likely bring forward investment decisions which will have the effect of hastening the progress of the recovery in this particular economy. It is worth comparing what the Government has decided to do in relation to the taxation of business with what the Opposition proposes. It is worth bearing in mind that the Opposition has said nothing whatsoever about depreciation allowances or how it would deal with the question of the need to improve the former depreciation arrangements that we had in Australia and those which we are now proposing to introduce. On the contrary. the Opposition proposes to batter business with increased taxes as a result of the shifts which it has in mind. It is not often that I have the opportunity to quote Des Moore who writes for the IPA Review. In a recent article, he states: Regrettably, the Coalition has given credence to this misconception by purveying the notion that there will be a $20 billion cut in taxes on businesses. It could just as well be argued on that basis that the $27 billion estimated to be raised from the GST will increase taxes on businesses. It is business that pays the GST in the first instance and then has to recoup it by passing it on in prices, just as it is business that will not pay the other three taxes in the first instance. The real picture as far as business is concerned is that there will be a net increase of $7 billion as a result of the increased incidence of taxes on business due to this amazing money laundering scheme which the Opposition has in mind-a further $7 billion imposition of taxes on business as a result of this change.",12

22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise. Dr Bob Woods-Read the bottom line.,13
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Lowe!,13
24,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you do not have to rely on Des Moore.; you do not have to rely on me. You can, however, rely on what has actually happened in a couple of the model economies which the Opposition seeks to emulate. The first of those that I would refer to is that in Canada, where we know the Canadians introduced a consumption tax in 1991. So in awe of Canada is the Opposition that it actually invited spmeone out from Canada to tell it how to do it. The Opposition may have been told how to do it, but has it heard of what has happened as a consequence as far as small business is concerned? The Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 71 per cent of surveyed firms felt that the consumption tax had a negative effect on their business and 85 per cent of respondents of small and medium sized firms identified the tax as imposing additional costs, which were more significant for the smaller than the larger firms. Indeed, firms with less than 20 employees pay about 82 per cent of the total private implementation costs. That is, in Canada as a result the tax which the Opposition is emulating, we find that small business has been battered to the point where 71 per cent of small businesses are worse off and 85 per cent say that it has imposed additional costs in terms of collecting the tax. The point is that the Opposition would turn every business, small or large, into a branch office for taxation arrangements. That is, of course, the point",13
25,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,13
27,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The galling point for the Opposition is that it wants to turn every business in Australia into an arm of the Australian Taxation Office. There is another model economy closer to home, just across the Tasman, which the Opposition is fond of referring to as the kind of model that it wants to follow. There is a very interesting review of the impact of the GST in New Zealand on small business particularly. I quote from an accountant-and the Opposition is fascinated by accountants; they are the ones who will really benefit from the changes the Opposition has in mind. John Morine gives a bit of advice which he hopes small business in Australia will take to heart. He says this: If and when a consumption tax or GST is introduced in Australiahe is addressing this to small businessyour personal stress level will rise sharply. Sunday at the beach with the family will be a thing of the past as you spend your l-isure time grappling with GST returns and trying to unscramble your accounting records from taxation complications you do not understand. You should consider how you will cope when you lose one day a week to the GST, whether your business will survive and what you are going to do about it now, with so little time left in which to lobby against the GST. He goes on with this plea from the heart to Australian small business: If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive. of Here we have the Opposition with nothing to say about encouraging investment in Australian business, bemoaning as it does on a daily basis the statistics which emerge when, in fact, what those opposite have in mind is not only to impose an additional $7 billion of taxation on business but to do it in a way which will be bewilderingly confusing for small business and will have the unhappy kinds of consequences in Australia which we have already seen in reality in places such as Canada and New Zealand. Youth Unemployment: Wills Electorate",13
28,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the youth unemployment rate in Victoria is 46 per cent, and even higher in the electorate of Wills? Does the Prime Minister share the view of his Treasurer that the level of youth wages can deny young people job opportunities?",13
29,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course an increase in It youth unemployment is to be lamented. While the national youth unemployment rate of over 30 per cent amongst 15to 19-year-olds is high, it represents only about 9 per cent of this age group. Opposition members-Oh!",14

31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I,14
32,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. The last time the Government came into office when there was a recession, in 1982-83, under your policies only three children in 10 completed secondary school. The rest of those children were basically then on the job market. That number is now seven in 10, and 30 to 40 per cent of those are going on to tertiary education. We are now about to lift vestment in TAFE, or technical and further youth wages. education, so that when Australian students complete their secondary schooling they can question? train themselves in either tertiary or vocational education institutions.

34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable tertiary member for Bendigo.,14
35,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have created, 120,000 extra places, the equivalent of 12 universities over what you propose. What is your policy? It is that students will get in with full fees at $12,000 to $13,000 a place. So someone would have to have a pre-tax income of $20,000 to afford to send one child to university. That is your idea of what you call opportunity for Australian children, whereas we have created already the equivalent of 12 sanctions? universities and dramatically lifted the opportunities for Australian kids to go on and complete tertiary education. We are now about to remodel the TAPE system and do TAFE what we have done for universities. What do we find from you? You have allocated the most modest funding for TAPE. lasts for one year and then drops away, yet we have a $720m program over three years to dramatically change the landscape as far as too vocational education is concerned and, in addition, to lift its status so that people who walk away with a qualification from TAFE, from vocational education, do so on the basis that that qualification will be sought and There's recognised in the marketplace. That is the kind of objective we have for Australian youth-kids staying in school and leaving school. Even after you had let the country get to the point where only three kids in 10 completed secondary school so that we could not hope to cope as a clever country or a capable society, when the most basic building block of technological change, being education, was completely neglected by you, you still have the gall to get up and ask inquestions about youth unemployment and Mr Charles-What about answering the Mr Costello-At least they got a job.",14
36,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is no wonder that young people are deserting the coalition in droves, because those opposite never cared about them. They regarded them simply as factory fodder, as untrained people who leave school at 15 years of age and go and get ajob in a factory or doing something else. The fact is that the Government has invested in the system and the secondary system and now in technical and further education. That is why there are fewer of them in the labour market: they are now training themselves. South Africa",14

We hope that the referendum result will produce momentum towards the adoption of a democratic, non-racial constitution in South Africa. We want to see progress in that direction at the forthcoming meetings of CODESA and the consideration by the that working group of the working party results there. The referendum result is a clear vindication of the Government's consistent support international pressure aimed at the abolition of apartheid in South Africa.

Mr Coetsee said that with stagnation 'staring us order. in the eye', the National Party leadership set about dismantling the system it had built create new opportunities for itself and for South Mrica.

There is a long history over this century of economic sanctions proving to be futile. Wrong, wrong, wrong again. One of the fundamental reasons why I and others have opposed the march towards sanctions that has been joined by the Government is a donesiansconcern that, as inevitably will be the case, the sanctions will not bring about a change. That is wrong again, on the admission of the South African Justice Minister. In June 1991 the Leader of the Opposition stated: They have had it consistently wrong. As African Foreign Minister said in an earlier interview, they have messed things up. They did not do any good by their sanctions policy all the through. When the sanctions policy has brought and compounded this change in South Africa, what is his remark? 'Lift the sanctions imthe mediately'. There are, of course, more statements by the Leader of the Opposition. On 18 March 1992, the Leader of the Opinternational position said: The Federal Opposition is more convinced than are rare. ever of the appropriateness of the policy approach towards South Africa which we have advocated over the past year or so. When do you ever learn? The honourable member for Mayo said: The coalition has never supported the application of punitive economic sanctions against South Africa. He called on the Government to lift all sanctions on Australian trade and investment in South Africa immediately. He went on to say: I think we have been vindicated. These economic and trade sanctions are the very sanctions which, by the admission of their own Minister, 'turned us into a political South and economic cul-de-sac with stagnation that staring us in the eye'. The Opposition then shifted its policy and said that it had been vindicated. The fact is that you were dead wrong about this right the way through. If these sanctions had not been imposed, we would not be where we are now in the history of this important transition in South Africa. The fact is that the Opposition was wrong always about South East Asia in the 1960s and the of downward thrust of communism. We had the honourable member for Bennelong's mate former Senator John Carrick with his red arrows and the Chinese coming to get us in many their sampans.

What is the likely impact on health costs of proposals which would place greater emphasis on private health insurance?",17
70,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for· Cowan for her question. As it happens, in terms of the national health strategy, review paper No.7 looks in some detail at the issue raised by the honourable member, that is, the question of distribution of costs within the health system. The material in that report, which I would commend to all honourable members, is based on the 1988 household expenditure survey and shows that under Medicare 45 per cent of households spend nothing on basic health care and 75 per cent of households spend less than $4 per week. That paper clearly identifies the reasons. Under Medicare, hospital care is guaranteed free, and under Medicare almost two-thirds of all medical services are bulkbilled, with no out-of-pocket costs for people. Mr Braithwaite-It is free.",17
71,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
72,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to interjections, honourable members might be interested in some statistics from the electorate of Wills which indicate that two-thirds of all services in Wills are bulkbilled-64.2 per cent-and the percentage of services at or below the schedule fee is 75 per cent. Under Medicare, medical fees are restrained by an insurance system which keeps the pressure on doctors' charges. The Opposition would in fact throw all of this away. It would, effectively, slug families with a fourfold whammy. First of all, the Medicare levy would stay, but Medicare rebates would be cut by 10 per cent from 85 per cent of the medical benefit schedule fee to 75 per cent; secondly, bulkbilling would be abolished; thirdly, families would have to take out private insurance; and, fourthly, there would be a compulsory co-payment on top of private insurance. The impact of such 3; policy on families would be quite dramatic. The analysis by my Department is based on a very conservative assumption. My Department assumes, firstly, that the Opposition would prohibit bulkbilling and that a family which currently goes to a bulkbilling doctor would therefore be charged the medical benefit schedule and not the AMA schedulea somewhat generous assumption. Secondly, it assumes that doctors who patient bill would lift their charges to the AMA schedule because that is the level that will be supported by private insurance. The result for families on $30,000 who go to a bulkbilling clinic and who currently have private insurance is an increase in costs of $7.50 per week. The result for families on $30,000 who take out private insurance for the first time and get the $200 tax credit is an increase in costs, my Department estimates, of $23.50 per week. It is for those reasons that the Treasury, its overall analysis of the Opposition policy, estimates that health services would increase by 22.63 per cent under that Opposition policy. Those figures would be higher if we add in the other likely impacts of Opposition policy: the raising of all fees to the AMA schedule, which is 30 per cent above the level of the medical benefit schedule; a lift in the AMA schedule itself-after all, that schedule is to be determined in negotiation between the doctors and the insurance industry; and increases in costs of insurance to cover these increases in medical charges. In that alternative policy we see a very substantial increase in the cost for families. As a result of the shift from the medical benefit schedule to the AMA scheduleeffectively doctors setting their own ratesultimately the cost of health in this country will go up very substantially. Ultimately, a system which has been associated with the maintenance of spending on health in this country at about 8 per cent of GDP would effectively be sabotaged and scrapped. The net result would be a very different picture in terms of the distribution of expenditure from that contained in this background paper coming out of the national health strategy. Unemployment",17
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for-ah-MCEwen. Mr Beale-Ray was right.,18
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suppose ifbackbenchers got more chances to ask questions I might more readily recognise them. Mrs BAILEYI raise with the Prime Minister the case of Thycon Systems Pty Ltd, a high-tech computer power systems company based in Coburg. Before your recession, Prime Minister, Thycon employed 100 people",18
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. There is a way to put this stuff in correct terminology in terms of the answering of questions in order in this place. This is manifestly not a question which is asked under the Standing Orders as they are stated there. You are not allowed to provide inforin mation. You are obliged to place your questions in the form of questions. Mr Fife Mr Speaker, on the point of order taken by the Leader of the House: the honourable member for MCEwen was reciting the preamble prior to asking a very important and a very sensitive question, obviously; otherwise the point of order would not have been taken. I submit that the question is in order.",18
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take somewhat the point raised by the honourable member for Hume when he says that the honourable member for MCEwen is getting into a preamble. Of course, the honourable member should be aware that we do not have preambles; we have questions and then we get answers. So the honourable member might forget about the preamble and get directly to her question. Mrs BAILEYI am getting straight to the question, Mr Speaker, and I continue to direct my question to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that a company, Thycon Systems, a high-tech computer power systems company based in Coburg, employed 100 people before your recession and it currently employs 45 people? Sales have dropped by half",18
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will come directly to the question.,19
78,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sales have dropped by half because of your recession and government purchases overseas. My question, on behalf of the national sales manager of Thycon, Mr Terry Robarts, is this: when will you realise",19
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for MCEwen can ask a question on her behalf, but not on behalf of someone else. If the honourable member has a question on her behalf, she can ask it.",19
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you seriously saying that we are not supposed to raise questions on behalf of electors? That is not true.,19
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,19
82,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister: when will you realise that Australian industry needs action and not just words to lift us out of the recession that you created?,19
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the years the Government has been in office it has had more than twice as much growth as in the previous period of the coalition government. That is an average over twice as fast. It is' wonder, therefore, that we had the reflection of that in the very high rates of employment growth over the period, taking the work force from six million to 7'h million with the recession included and, of course, to activity and profitability in the period. But coming through the late 1980s, where demand was exceeding production by a factor of twowhere demand was running twice product growth by a factor of two-and where that was being satisfied by imports, the Government had to curb the situation with a policy response. That means that the general buoyancy that existed in business opportunities in the late 1980s does not, and could not, exist now. Notwithstanding that we want to see the economy continue to progress to recovery, the fact is that it has had an impact upon business opportunities and upon employment. I cannot make a commentary on the performance of this company in answer to a' question without notice. I do not know what the company's performance is; I do not know what opportunities it has made for itself; I do not know to what extent it is built upon government procurement policy; I do not know to what extent it is a company engaged in export; and I do not know to what extent it was simply a company that lived happily in the heyday of high growth rates in the late 1980s and its management was unable to cope in a lower growth economy and not find opportunity for itself abroad, as many other Australian computer businesses have succeeded in doing. They have found opportunities abroad to augment national demand. The honourable member will have noticed ""in the national accounts the term 'net exports', that is, import replacement and exports. Many Australian companies have engaged in exports as a complementation of their domestic production. Maybe this company has not; maybe it should. This is one of the fastest growing areas of the world. There is a great demand for computer software. There is enormous demand for software and computer products in the South-East Asia and Asia-Pacific areas. Maybe this company should avail itself of it. But if the honourable no member is saying that the Government should take responsibility for its business decisions, well of course it cannot. Tourism",19
84,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Tourism. I refer"" him to reports published yesterday which indicate that the expansion of the tourist industry in Queensland is likely to result in substantial job growth by the year 2000. In view of this, I ask: how does this accord with the Government's own projections? What measures is the Government taking to realise the potential of the tourist industry, not only in Queensland but across the nation, thereby providing additional jobs and a further boost to growth?",19
85,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First off, I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his strong interest in these issues. I will make the almost obvious point that the outlook to which the honourable member referred is very good news indeed for Australia in terms of the whole range of economic indicies, but in particular in terms of the prospective 200,000 extra jobs that will be created in this decade. However, obviously these jobs will not be just wished into existence; they will not be, as the Opposition has done, simply plucked out of the air without a policy regime underpinning them.",20
86,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like your 800,000. It was plucked out of the air. Mr GRIFF1THS-Well you ought to have a talk about it, because right across the tourism industry in this country people know that the professor has let them down. Mr Tim Fischer-Where is the third runway? Answer that.",20
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting.,20
88,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister alerted me to a quote from the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend that, in terms of the forecast under the Fightback package of 'two million jobs', the professor has now conceded it is 'only a judgment'. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You are continually requiring members of the Opposition to refer to honourable members by their seat or their title. I ask you to require that of the Minister.",20
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the Minister is find referring to a member, he should refer to the member by his or her title.",20
90,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of tourism this policy, basically the Government's objective has been, first of all, to attract tourists to this country-and in that context, obviously the announcements of the ATe's considerably increased funding are relevant-and, once they are in Australia, to ensure that we can move them at low cost. The significant, indeed historic, reforms to the aviation sector and also to the road and rail infrastructure, and in terms of the requirement to accommodate these inbound tourists, are dramatic improvements to the amortisation and depreciation arrangements. The Leader of the Opposition interjects about a whole range of things, but let me give one reason why the tourism industry is almost having a Boston Tea Party about the Opposition's policy. That one reason goes, of course, to the issue of GST, and it is the only aspect to which I will advert at this point. For those who argue that the GST internationally has not had a negative impact on the tourism industry, let me give just one fundamental example. In 1990 Sweden introduced a new consumption tax,' a new impost on its tourism industry. Bed night numbers fell by a massive 13 per cent. The Economist Intelligence Unit attributed this fall in the main to the introduction of this new tax. In the light of this dramatically negative circumstance for its industry, the Swedish Government recognised that its policy was a massive mistake and in January 1992 it overturned the decision. In doing so it implicitly and explicitly acknowledged that a consumption tax particularly disadvantages has the tourism industry. That is not news in the OECD. France, for example, has a general consumption tax rate of 18.6 per cent with a tourism rate of 4.1 or 5.5 per cent, depending on the service. In Canada the general rate is 7 per cent, but tourism services are zero rated. And so it goes through a range of other OECD countries. The Opposition is running around saying that some countries have a GST on tourism and therefore we also should have it. What I inexplicable, and what I find I am totally incapable of accepting, is that when we have a comparative or competitive advantage over very price sensitive industry of international tourism, we should give it away. Why would we give it away? The overseas evidence is compelling; but even at home, if the Leader of the Opposition had taken the advice put forcefully, but apparently fruitquestion. lessly, by his own shadow Minister, not have proposed a consumption tax tourism. Welfare Services: Wills Electorate",20
91,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to his by-election brochure, which states: Emergency relief delivered through non-government welfare organisations will be increased for the of 1992. Why then has the Government stopped funding the Northwest Onestop Welfare Centre, which serves 50 per cent of youth who are unemployed in Wills? Given that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam personally opened the Centre in 1975, will the Prime Minister return now to Wills to personally close it down?",21
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You want to cut out all CES programs, you goose.",21
93,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To add to what the Minister said by way of interjection, under Fightback you want to chop the CES to pieces. You want to cut the Budget to ribbons, and yet still have the right to put this kind of question. The fact is that the Opposition wants to basically cut the public sector to ribbons, cut all those services to ribbons, including support for youth and for the aged. The fact is that this Government has been the only government that has catered for young people by giving access to the labour market and catered for the elderly, substantially with a total change to policies for the elderly through geriatric assessment, home and community care and these areas. Mr Fife-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, and this time. I refer to relevance. Mr Hand-There has not been an Opposition member in the area since the office was opened.",21
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Immigration will cease interjecting. Mr Fife-Either the Prime Minister does not understand the question and does not know the answer or he is deliberately flouting your ruling in relation to relevance. I ask that you require the Prime Minister to answer the he would Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Prime on Minister is answering the question. The honourable member for Hume will resume his seat. Reserve Bank of Australia,21
95,Mr DUBOIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Treasurer: is he aware of proposals for a so-called charter for the Reserve Bank of Australia whereby the rest bank would target an intlation rate of 0 to 2 per cent? What would be the impact of such a policy on interest rates and unemployment? What are the Government's intentions in this matter?,21
96,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order. That question has considerable matter relating to the hypothetical, and as such should be ruled out of order. It is a completely hypothetical question.",21
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I call the Treasurer.,21
98,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,21
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the honourable member for O'Connor continues to interject, I will deal with him.",21
100,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,21
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the honourable member have a further point of order?,21
102,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I refer you to standing order 144. I ask you: are we now to throw that particular standing order out? It quite clearly refers, under paragraph (g), to 'hypothetical matter'. I have drawn your attention to the fact that the question is entirely hypothetical. As such, it should be ruled out of order. Are our Standing Orders worth the paper they are printed on?",21
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. I call the Treasurer.,21
104,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, is it not extraordinary that, whenever the honourable member for O'Connor has been away for a while, he likes to make his presence felt when he comes back? It does not matter how ridiculous he has to be, he always has to let everyone know that he is back. Well, Wilson, you were wrong; you were wrong again. Mr Connolly- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the standing order that requires that a member be referred to by his title. I also emphasise that what the Minister is doing now is quite clearly giving a massive preamble which has nothing at all to do with either the question or the answer. This is completely at variance with the way that you responded to the asking of a question a few moments ago from this side of the chamber.",21
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I draw the attention of the honourable member for Bradfield to the Standing Orders. He might have a look at them. He will find that a lot of things are said about preamble to questions but nothing is said about preamble to answers. I do not think that the Minister should be too familiar with the honourable member for O'Connor by referring to him personally.,22
106,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take your advice to heart. The Opposition is somewhat sensitive about this particular issue, as the House will have noted. It is honourable members opposite who have proposed, as a policy for themselves, that they would in fact have a charter for the Reserve Bank which would impose on it the obligation of getting inflation to between zero and 2 per cent and then keeping it there. But, of course, what they will not do is own up to the consequences of that particular policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is fond of pointing out how people are caught red-handed. He ought to know all about that as a result of his little excursion with Laura Tingle of the Australian newspaper a few days ago-and I speak metaphorically here. In an interview between Ms Tingle and him he was asked if the coalition was targeting an inflation rate of zero to 2 per cent and the inflation rate was then at 3 per cent, and if the coalition wanted monetary policy to play a role in bringing inflation down, would this not imply the need for interest rates to rise? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition responded by saying: Well, I suppose theoretically that's right. He went on to make a few other points to Ms Tingle, and then he said: What's the status of this conversation? At which point Ms Tingle said: Well, it's on the record. At that point, the Deputy Leader's heart stopped because he had been caught in a rare display of candour. He had been let off the leash temporarily by his minders-by his control-and he had been allowed to speak on the telephone with a journalist. He had actually owned up to the truth about the consequences of the Opposition's policy. He then had to trot around to his Leader's office and say, 'John, I have made a terrible mistake. I have told the truth'.",22
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I ask the Treasurer to refer to honourable members by their title.,22
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At that point the Leader of the Opposition said, 'For God's sake! What did you do that for? Put out a press statement and deny it'. So he did. He put out a press statement saying, 'I didn't say it. It's not true that I said it'. . But it obviously is true on the evidence of the Australian s record of the interview. In any event, if inflation is between 3 and 4 per cent, if we then say to the Reserve Bank 'You must get it down to below zero and i per cent', and if we do that with monetary policy and in the context of imposing another 5 or 6 per cent onto the CPI as a result of introducing a consumption tax, undeniably it must be the case that interest rates will go up. That, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, is the consequence of that particular policy. Even if candour has not become an epidemic on the Opposition side of Parliament, at least it has in some areas of the Liberal Party. Just today, we have had the observations of Mr Frank O'Collins, who for five years was a campaign officer with the Liberal Party. He skites about the fact that he has references from the shadow Treasurer the honourable member for Flinders; from' the honourable member for Kooyong; from Tony Eggleton; from the honourable member for Pearce; from Senator Alston; from Senator Parer; from the honourable member for Hume; and from Senator Vanstone. He has this string of references but he says this about the consequences of the Fightback package: ""A vote for Hewson is a vote for high unemployment . . . I think this is an extremely dangerous policy. Mr O'Collins thinks that it is his duty as an Australian to draw to the attention of the Australian people the actual consequences of this particular policy. He says that the Liberal Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, are trying to distract people from the real consequences of this particular policy. He continues: ""The truth of Fightback is that if it is implemented in its current form, unemployment increases-it's got to. It's common sense. Here we have someone who has been with the Liberal Party for five years, who has a string of references from all these people who are now running around advocating the virtues of Fightback, but who feels that he can no longer subscribe to this piece of nonsense. What he knows is that, as a consequence of trying to target, amongst other things, inflation to between zero and 2 per cent and, as a result, put up interest rates and therefore make Australian industry and Australian jobs the chopping block of the Opposition's policy, unemployment must go up. He cannot remain silent any longer. He has decided that he must speak out against his own Party and tell the Australian people the truth that the Leader of the Opposition will not tell and that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tells only by accident. Interest Rates",22
109,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I also refer him to the remarks of the Treasurer in respect of interest rates in answer to the last question. Is haveit not a fact that, when the Minister said on 16 December 1991 that he was quite certain Treasury would advise that interest rates would go up under Fightback, in truth, Treasury had provided him two weeks earlier with advice in writing that interest rates under the coalition would actually fall? Government members-Oh, oh!",23
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,23
111,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality of life under the Opposition, if it were to become the Government and operate the GST, would certainly be an increased level of inflation. It would certainly be the case, according to the plan as spelt out, that in the year in which the inflation was put into the system at 5 per cent or more through the GST the Opposition would also ease up on fiscal policy. In those circumstances, if there was not to be a building-in of that inflation rate, there would absolutely have to be a tightening of monetary policy. Of course, there may not be. But in that case",23

116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,23
117,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Okay, have that; but have the rest of it. In that case, Mr Speaker, you would certainly have the maintenance of that inflation rate. This whole assumption that you would squeeze inflation out of the system if you did not tighten monetary policy when you were easing off on fiscal policy is an absolute nonsense. You would not have a wages policy. You would have no way of keeping wage claims down. You would not be compensating wage and salary earners for the impact of the GST on their incomes. Mr Smith-Then you certainly would",23
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bass will cease interjecting.,23
119,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In those circumstances they would be making wage claims to make up for the impact on their living standards. You would be easing off on fiscal policy. If you did not tighten monetary policy, you would certainly have a high level of inflation, not just for a year but pennanently built into the system. That is what we have been saying to you for months, since that time last year.",23

They know that that is a nonsense. The only way that that could be truethe only way-would be if you had a severe tightening of monetary policy, particularly in the circumstances where it would be certain that wage rises would be increasing. If the Opposition wants to pretend that it would not be tightening monetary policy, it really has a big step to go to convince the Australian people of that. The only alternative to not tightening monetary policy in those circumstances is to have pennanently a much higher level of inflation. Mr Smith interjecting",24
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Bass.,24
128,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All this stuff about getting to an inflation rate of between zero and 2 per cent would just be a complete fabrication. If you instructed the Reserve Bank of Australia that it must have inflation at that level, obviously, as the Treasurer has been saying, there would be no alternative but to have a very severe tightening of monetary policy.",24

132,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this matter. I also thank the Leader of the National Party of Australia for his interjection. The Leader of the National Party was recently in northern Queensland. When he was visiting northern Queensland he, in his usual manner of all promise and no responsibility when he gets away from this Parliament, made a promise. He said: 'What you must do is upgrade reporting of cyclones'. That is very laudable indeed. But he forgets two things. First of all, that has been occurring. In fact, last year the radar on Willis Island in the Coral Sea was upgraded, so now it has full weather watching capabilities. Secondly, the Leader of the National Party forgot to read his own Fightback! document. On page 274 of the Fightback! document, which I hope he has read-have you read it?-what does it say? On one line on page 274 it says that those opposite will cut the funding of the Bureau of Meteorology by 9 per cent or $lOm in the 1991 and 1992 outlays. How will those opposite do that?

Anyone who is dependent on efficient and accurate weather information will suffer. Even with those closures there is still a shortfall in the Opposition's proposals of between $3m and $4m. This would be made up only through reduction in the annual equipment replacement program, leading to a further marked decline in forecasting capability. Then those opposite say, 'We are going to avoid all that. What we are going to do is to have user pays'. But who is the user who is going to pay? Is it going to be the current free international meteorological services that are provided, is it going to be these very important services that are provided in the science area, or is it going to be those people who currently do not pay for the service, that is, the media and ,farmers? We are left with a situation in which those opposite cannot tell us where the money is coming from. In this assessment we have looked only at what those opposite say they will cut out of the expenditure of the Bureau of Meteorology. We have not looked yet at the GST impact.

200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The shallow attempts by the Keating Government to divert public attention away from Australia's tragic unemployment problem. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",32
201,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bennelong) (3.42 p.m.)If, for just a fleeting moment, the Government imagines that, by gagging the suspension of Standing Orders moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) at the end of Question Time, it would in some way be relieved' of the agony and embarrassment of debating the way in which the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) misled this Parliament in December last year about the key social and economic issue facing the Australian people, namely, the issue of unemployment, then it was sadly mistaken. That action of the Government reveals its extraordinary sensitivity on the matter which is before the House under the Standing Orders as a matter of public importance. Everybody in this country, and celtainly every member of parliament, knows that, above all else, the major political issue, the major social issue, the major national issue facing the Australian nation at present is unemployment. The fact is that over a million Australians are unable to obtain work. When we add the number of unemployed and underemployed together-the underemployed are people working two, three or four days a week instead of the normal five because their employers do not have enough orders to keep them fully occupied, despite the fact that the economy is supposed to be out of recessionwe have a total number of people either unemployed or underemployed approaching the staggering figure of 20 per cent. What is the response of the Government to this colossal, staggering, tragic social problem? The response of this Government is not to address the issue fairly and squarely. In a moment of total candour it does not say, 'We are sorry that so many people are out of work, we are sorry so many families have been destroyed, fractured and broken by the incidence of unemployment'. Its answer is to create a series of diversions. I will say this about the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating): he certainly is not the master of economic management; he certainly is not the master of the truth; he certainly is not the master of having a vision for the future of this country. But I will say this about him: he and some of his colleagues are the masters at creating diversions from the real issue: We have seen some classic examples of it in relation to unemployment. One of the diversions the Government has chosen in order to get the attention of the Australian public and the attention of this Parliament away from the issue of unemployment is, of course, the diversion of telling untruths about the impact of the Opposition's Fightback package. Ever since that package was so successfully launched in November",32
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Orderl I suggest to the honourable member for Bennelong that his speech does not need the phrase 'telling untruths' and he should withdraw it.,32
203,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a very reasonable man ..",33
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am asking you to withdraw.,33
205,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I cannot say that members of the Government lie because it is unparliamentary. I accept that. But, surely to goodness, if what they are saying is dishonest, I am entitled to say that they are speaking untruths. For heaven's sake, the language loses all its meaning.",33
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am asking the honourable member to withdraw.,33
207,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I, with great respect, ask you: by virtue of what standing order do you ask me to withdraw a claim that the Government is telling untruths?",33
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am suggesting that it is not helpful to the debate.,33
209,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I think it is very accurate.,33
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am suggesting that it is not helpful to the debate.,33
211,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in deference to you, I will return to the matter on another occasion. I really think it is not helpful to debate in this Parliament if members are unreasonably constrained from talking in a robust fashion. I think that, by any measure, one could hardly say that the words 'speaking untruths' go beyond the definition of robust exchange. But in deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in the interests of using my time productively, I will go on and say that the Government has dishonestly impugned and deliberately misrepresented the substance of the Fightback package. We had a classic example of it in Question Time today. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) got up and, on the strength of an article in the Australian, tried to suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been embarrassed on the subject of interest rates. The burden of what the Treasurer said was that the impact of the Fightback package would lead to an increase in interest rates. That was the whole burden of what the Treasurer said; it is the whole burden of what Senator Walsh has been saying; it is the whole burden of what the Minister for Finance has been saying both as Minister for Finance and in the brief time that he was Treasurer. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, quite properly, got up and asked the Minister for Finance why he was in full flight on 16 December last year, suggesting that the impact of the Fightback package would lead to an increase in interest rates and that there would be horror and destruction because of those higher interest rates. Yet 14 days earlier that same man, as Treasurer of Australia, had received a minute from the Department of the Treasury telling the Treasurer that, in the opinion of the Department of the Treasury, the Fightback package would actually produce lower interest rates. That is the measure of the deception we have been subjected to, and that is the measure of the diversion that has been created. When the Government has a problem with unemployment, what does it do? It goes out into the community and spreads dishonest interpretations of what the Opposition is on about. It does not try to address the problem of unemployment; it does not acknowledge that it is a serious social problem. It does not say to the Opposition, 'Why - on't we, as people interested in the future of Australia and in the future welfare of young people of this country, sit down together and try to work out a sensible approach to unemployment?' Why does the Government not recognise that there are some good things in the Opposition's Fightback package? Why does it not pick them up and say to the Opposition, 'Congratulations, these will make a contribution'? Why do members of the Government not take advice of the Treasury minute which they, and the then Treasurer, had conveniently forgotten? On 16 December, when the Minister for Finance was replying to a question in the House from the Opposition, why did he not tell the House what the minute had said: unemployment would fall as a result of the Fightback package because of the beneficial effects of the removal of the payroll tax? Why did he not tell the House, and why did the Treasurer not tell the House today? Why does not the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), being the reasonable man that I know him basically to be, get up and acknowledge that one of the effects of the Fightback package will be that employment in the first three years, using the same model that the Treasury used, would actually be above the base case scenario and that unemployment would actually be below the base case scenario, using that model? Why does the Minister not have the honesty to do that? Why does he not address that problem of unemployment in a more objective and honest fashion? Why does he embark upon so many diversions? Why is he so terrified that unemployment will scar the Government irreparably? I know that it will bum the Minister the next time there is an election in Swan-as it will bum the experiences of many other sitting Labor members. The truth is that the diversion of attacking the Fightback program as being a program that would lead to an increase in interest rates has been totally and comprehensively exposed in the Parliament today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He has produced a minute froin the Department of the Treasury which proves, root and branch, what the then Treasurer said on 19 December. I will read from the Hansard record what the Minister for Finance had to say. He said: The last thing the Australian people need is the kind of approach that the Opposition is proposing:I emphasise these wordsimmediate imposition of a tighter fiscal policy to increase unemployment and stop any recovery occurring and then, in the second year, a big inflation impact and a massive increase in interest rates to overcome the inflation impact. .. I repeat his words 'a massive increase in increase rates to overcome the inflation impact'. Those words were uttered to this Parliament on 19 December. Yet on 2 December, just over two weeks earlier, the Treasury said that the package: ... leads to considerably lower short term interest rates. They were the words of the Treasury commenting on our Fightback program. Treasury then went on to say: This validates the fall in long-term bond rates in the previous year. n continued: The lagged impact of lower short-term interest rates (in the second year) also stimulates dwelling and business investment. In other words, if we go through the document which was in the hands of Treasurer Willis on 2 December-he must have known of it when he got up in the Parliament on 19 December; he quite literally misrepresented through his teeth the true position-we get a measure of the dimension of the distortion and the diversions undertaken by this Government. It will do and say anything in order to divert attention from the real issues. I am very disappointed in the honourable member for Gellibrand, the Minister for Finance. I will be very disappointed if the Minister at the table, when he gets up to reply, emulates the antics of his Leader, the Prime Minister. We all know that the present Prime Minister of Australia will say and do and distort and misrepresent and deceive and mislead and deliberately falsify anything in order to score a politiCal point. No man in such a short-if I can paraphrase somebody",33
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I suggest,34
213,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are not seriously going to tell me that some of those words are unparliamentary? I think that you are pulling my leg, Mr Deputy Speaker; I really do. I think that you are pulling my leg by trying to suggest that some of those things are unparliamentary.",34
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The difficulty the honourable member for Bennelong encounters is when he refers to an individual member and suggests that he is trying to misrepresent the House.,34
215,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister is no individual member. He is the Prime Minister of this country. What the Prime Minister of this country is doing is engaging in national diversionary tactics of a mammoth scale-of a scale the like of which we have not seen before. Some of his colleagues on the front bench are following him' I hope that the Minister at the table does not: The Prime Minister has embarked upon a cours- of i-dulg-n¥ himself in a totally negat1v-, natlOnahstlc campaign. His latest caper IS to try to prove what a terrific Australian he is-as though he has some kind of mortgage on that identity; as though he is the only person who has ever walked in this Parliament who feels proud to be an J\u-tralian. Instead of offering us a positive VISI0?- of the future of this country, instead of talkmg about the positive virtues of Australians, he seeks refuge in a negative criticism of another country. It shows the puerile limitations of that man's mind. It shows how pathetically inadequate he is for the tas- and for the proudest office that any Austrahan could occupy in this nation-that of being the leader of this nation. I say to the Minister at the table: do not fall into the trap of following the abysmal standards set by your Prime Minister. Do not make the mistake of the Treasurer who fascinatingly enough, the day after we wersupposed to be back on the road to recovery, the. day after we got those terrific, exhilarating nattonal acco-nts, said that we were growing at the fantastic rate of 0.3 per cent in the Decembe- quarter. Instead of going out into the factones of Australia; instead of going to the T-FE colleges of Australia and trying to explam to the young people of Australia how the- might get t!t0usands more jobs from this temfic, economIC growth; instead of addressing some small businessmen and explaining to them how they might get better investment pr?spects !n the nirvana of rapid growth now being dellvered under the auspices of the Keating Government-where did we find the Treasurer? We found him in the vastness of the Australian National University in Canberra. Not much unemployment there; well below half the national average in fact. What was he talking about? Was he talking about growth; was he talking about employment· was he talking about the future of the childreo- this country? No, he was rabbiting on in hIS normally mcoherent fashion while launching a book by some second-rate academic about Australian history. Of course, guess what? He was talking about the new nationalism, Keating-Dawkins style, which does not consist of being proud in Australia of Australia, but which consists of bashing the reputation and the integrity of other people. It is just another example of how this Government and many of its senior members-but I hope not the Minister at the table-will resort to any tactic, any device, any stratagem at all, to take people's eyes off the main game. Well, the news out of today's Question Time, and the news that the Government will get from the electorate of Wills, is that this Parliament, this Opposition and the Australian people have their eyes on the main game. The main game is the Government's total, abysmal failure to the people of Australia on the subject of unemployment.",34
216,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am interested in this interpretation of the Opposition's Fightback package. According to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who has just spoken, if the Government chooses to debate the issues in the - ightback package we are t-erefore saying nothing about unemployment m this country. If we engage the Liberals in a debate on what they say is the solution to the country's ills then we, by doing so, are creating a diversion from the main debate or the main game of d-aling with the issue of unemployment in thiS country. Was that ever an admission that the Fightback package may have something to do with many things, but that one thing it has nothing to do with is the issue of employment in this country! If anyone thought for one minute that that might not be the case, what we have now had from the Opposition spokesman on employment is confession. Confession is good for the soul. For that reason alone, I enjoy the fact that the honourable member is able to stand up here and reveal that to us. I am disappointed in the remarks of the Opposition spokesman on employment in this regard. He is one of the broader conservative members in th,is place. He is one of those conservative rrl.embers who believe that the issues of this nation do not simply revolve around this or that aspect of narrow economic concern but that those narrow economic concerns are best addressed by looking at how we propose to tackle the problems of society as a whole. That has been a position which he has adopted in the past. Whilst I have never agreed with his analysis of Australian society or the direction in which he would wish to take it, one advantage that he has had over the current incumbent of the leadership of the Opposition is that he has been a complete politician. He is a person who is concerned about the polis, concerned about its totality, concerned about its needs and concerned about the philosophies which drive the decisions which government takes to benefit it or to have those issues dealt with in some other way. That has been his position in the past. I am sorry that the honourable member Bennelong has sullied that aspect of his reputation by a rather silly contribution in place suggesting in the first instance that Government's discussing the Fightback package means that we are not concerned played about unemployment; ergo, it has nothing do with unemployment. Then he suggested that statements on the way we feel about nation and its direction have ultimately nothing to do with the economy. Of course they do. The question of confidence in the comthose munity is absolutely central to the willingness of business to invest in the community, to the willingness of young people to develop themselves through the educational tunities that are presented to them, and to the willingness and morale of our society as a whole to tackle the social problems which at the end of the day in a democracy do simply confront governments but confront whole society. The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as Prime Minister, addresses a range of issues, and so he If members of the Liberal Party had had wits about them and left the honourable member for Bennelong in place as Leader the Opposition, he would have persisted past policies of similarly addressing the Common Market. totality of the interests of society in the way in which an Opposition Leader should, that is, by engaging the Prime Minister in direct debate. The honourable member for Bennelong does his best, now and then, to do that from the Opposition benches, but he seems to be somewhat curtailed from time to time. What the Prime Minister has addressed is absolutely central to where this nation goes. What this nation fundamentally has to understand is that we are a nation alone. We are part of no people's trading blocs. No people with whom we have had to deal over the years, particularly in economic matters, have cared one jot for the national interest of Australians or have put those interests ahead of their own when they have come to consider our fate. It has to be said, because the honourable member for Bennelong drew attention to what for the Prime Minister had to say about the record on national security policy, that during this World War II the British, for reasons that the made a lot of sense to themselves, made strategic decisions in which this country no part. If one looks at the issue of the to survival of the United Kingdom, one might ask why ought it not make such decisions. this However, as far as we are concerned, there are lessons to be learned from that. I am proud to say that when I was Defence Minister of this country I sought to address lessons by creating for ourselves, as this Government has, a self-reliant defence posture in this country. It is precisely those lessons that we learned in World War II which opporinformed us to do that. Turning to this objecting to tugging the forelock: National Party leaders are generally so mindful of the potential impact of trading not blocs of which we are not a member in the predominating potential markets for Australian agricultural produce, but on the occasion of the creation of the European Common Market the National Party leaders should. tugged the forelock and walked away. their However, this is still an issue in New Zealand. Why? Because the National Party of Government in New Zealand got concessions in his when the United Kingdom went into the The New Zealanders still have arguments every now and then with the French about how much tripe they will let into the European Community, and they have arguments with the British about how much lamb is going to be allowed from New Zealand into the Economic Community. That is because during the 1960s there were a few people in the New Zealand Government with a bit of guts who decided that they would stand up for New Zealand interests. What did we get from the Opposition at the time? 'No, I am very glad that you have found your way into this organisation. Please, Sir, we won't do anything to inhibit you there or ask you to negotiate anything difficult on our part'. There is absolutely no reason for the Opposition to feel proud about that situation. I get. back to my first point, which is the Opposition's position in Fightback on unemployment. I noticed that when the Opposition spokesman got up on his scrapers and talked about Fightback he actually did not have much to say about the issue of unemployment per se. And well might he not. The Opposition spokesman was kind enough to give me a piece of free political analysis what might happen to me in my own constituency. I am always grateful to receive a piece of free political analysis from him or anyone else in that regard, and.J take some comfort from the thoughts of Frank O'Collins on the subject of the swung constituencies, as he has been responsible for Liberal Party direct mailing campaigns for some time. His view as far as the direction of Opposition policy is concerned is that the Opposition had effectively given up on Swan and Canning because of the single-minded way in which wrong-headed policies were being pursued by the Liberal Party. One does not have to be a genius to figure that out. If one went around some of the areas in my constituency and told the people that the Liberal Party was going to impose on them a 15 per cent consumption tax for no particular gain in order to benefit the tax scales of the very wealthy, one would not need to be a genius to figure out how they might feel about it. It was kind of Mr O'Collins, as a person experienced in Liberal Party policy making, to arrive at conclusions similar to that which I have arrived at myself. However, I am more interested in what Mr O'Collins had to say about other aspects of the Liberal Party policy than in my own fate. He was reported as follows: Mr O'Collins said the Coalition's plan to end tariff assistance would be particularly damaging and would result in about 200,000 people being sacked during the first tenn of a Hewson Government. He goes on to say: ""A vote for Hewson is a vote for high unemployment. .. The bottom line is that you can't afford to lose any more jobs in Australia than we have already lost. I think this is an extremely dangerous policy. As we are talking about diversions, this is another interesting quote: He said he believed the Liberals were deliberately focusing on the tax changes in the package to divert attention from the issues of jobs. That is an interesting turning on its head of this particular matter of public importance. We have Mr O'Co!Hns, a noted Liberal Party on organiser for some considerable time, saying that Fightback is a diversion to discuss taxes as opposed to discussing jobs. Well might he say that. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have had a great deal to say about the Liberal Party's analysis of One Nation over the past few weeks since it was brought down. After the One Nation statement had been subject to analysis by the Liberal Party as to what it would achieve-albeit an analysis which disagreed in several areas with our own conclusions-its view was that the 800,000 jobs we were promoting as the likely outcome of the One Nation package were in fact something over 900,000. That was the logic of the Liberal Party's analysis of our propositions. What has happened to the Opposition's own position on unemployment? We can remember the fanfare when the Opposition said, 'You get a 15 per cent consumption tax, and the various activities based around that will produce two million jobs'. There were no ifs or buts. If we look at the incredibly wordy propaganda which the Liberals are now posting out to mailboxes around the countryside on that particular matter, we see that there is no resiling from the assertion that with a 15 per cent consumption tax there will be two million jobs. It is not 'there might be' or 'that is a matter of judgment' or 'the particular modelling did not incorporate a consumption tax'. None of the various things that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said are flaws in the assertion that arising from the Fightback package two million jobs are created in the Liberal Party's propaganda. We are talking about honesty and integrity in this place. The qualifications that have been put on the Fightback package now by the Opposition, confronted with having to deal with a government front bench that at least has a pretty fair understanding of what the Leader of the Opposition is about and confronted with knowing that therefore he just cannot keep arguing by assertion, were not put on it in the Liberal Party's propaganda. What the Leader of the Opposition moves away from in this place, or in front of a gallery, he does not move away from when it is presented in the average citizen's letter box. If it comes to the issue of deceit and duplicity, I do not think there is anything going on in Australian debate that is more deceitful or duplicitous than that particular exercise as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. It is no wonder that we talk about the Liberal Party's position, because we are engaged in a great debate in this country. There has never been an occasion on which our parties have been so divided on matters of general principle. On the one hand we have a Liberal Party that has behind it the extremity of free market ideology presented in the early 1980s, where Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher can be described as having got it half right but where, more recently perhaps, Argentina has got it all right. That a man could actually say that sort of thing and believe it, as the Leader of the Opposition has, is an indication of the extent to which an obsession takes away one's judgment about what one ought to present locally. We have people of that ilk who actually make this kind of statement without realising the hurtful political nature of them. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition a man who deliberately sets out to hurt, but to the New Zealand National Party in Christchurch last year he said this as a joke: I am also impressed to see that you do keep in touch with other parts of the electorate and having two soup kitchens is a very nice touch. I do not put that in the category of nasty politicians; I put it in the category of Marie Antoinette. When that poor lady said, 'Let them eat cake' to the peasants who were screaming for bread, she did not do so because she hated or was contemptuous of peasantry; she did that because she genuinely did not understand that some people were not presented with a choice between bread and cake. She thought it was simply a problem of underproduction at the local bakery that was producing that lack of choice. I genuinely think that the Leader of the Opposition has got himself so far into the ether when something concerns the coalition's package that, even though he may have had-he is losing it now-a spurious popularity around the country, when he addresses the real needs of people, when his policy is compared to what is needed, he is so far out of place that there has been no equivalent in Australian political history to this point. In contrast, the Government has a view that there is a proper role for government intervention in all processes-in micro-economic reform to improve the efficiency of the economy and in training our people so that the work force has the skills it needs to be productive. All of that is included in the One Nation package and all of it is rejected by the Opposition. The final insult when it comes to employment policies is when those opposite get up and ask questions about what is happening to this or that private provider. The Opposition's proposition is to close all CES operations and eliminate all youth access centres and, having done that, to hand it all over to private providers, who will then be charged a 15 per cent consumption tax on the jobs they find. There will be no zero rating. So, if a private provider actually acquires a job for someone, that someone will have to pay the 15 per cent. The employer paid the provider to acquire the job, in which case I suppose he has some capacity to pass on the 15 per cent he has to pay on other services that he provides. But, if the client happens to be an unemployed person, that person has to pay the 15 per cent to the private provider for the job that is subseabout quently provided, which amount will go to the Government. There cannot be any more obscene obsession with this whole centrality of the taxation issue than that as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. I am afraid to tell honourable members on the back bench who opposite that we will be talking a lot more about these things over the next few months because they are central to unemployment; they are not a diversion. And those opposite will stand condenmed by the electorate. (Time expired)",35
217,Mrs BAILEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has demonstrated today, this Government will use any means at its disposal to divert attention from the most severe problem facing us as a nation: the problem of unemployment. No amount of posturing about nationalism or a new flag or whatever by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can hide the fact that officially we have 920,000 Australians unemployed; that 11/2 million Australians cannot get a job or are working fewer hours than they would like; that hidden in those figures are 262,000 families which have the chief breadwinner unemployed; and waitresses. that 218,000 children are-living in a family where no-one has a job. No amount of hyperwith bole or cant by the Prime Minister or any of his Ministers can hide the fact that among those statistics thousands of people have lost their businesses, their homes or, tragically many cases, their families. But the problem is far worse than that. Families all over the country are helplessly watching their children become victims of Government as well. The national youth tunity unemployment rate is now 32.7 per cent. the Prime Minister's own electorate per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to tell you that in my State of Victoria the level youth unemployment is as high as 40 per cent may have or 50 per cent in some areas. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, this trend is worsening and will continue for some time. Again, the statistics hide the human face of this massive problem. They hide the despair and the lack of selfworth of young people, the fear they have their future and, tragically, the number of suicides. Those statistics also do not tell the anguish of parents who have worked hard to provide their children with a better education, to keep their kids at school. Those statistics do not tell us the number of women work in order to provide a better future for their children, only to find all their efforts amount to nought as their children cannot find work-or, in the case of Victoria, approximately 22,000 cannot even get into a tertiary institution to continue their education. The policies of this Government have produced for young people only a vicious circle of uncertainty about their future. The lucky ones have Austudy to enable them to stay on at school, but for a growing number that simply means delaying the day of being unable to get a job. For those who cannot or who do not want to remain at school, they face, at best, temporary or part time employment and, at worse, the prospect of becoming long teon unemployed. For those who are able to gain entry to tertiary study, the prospect for their future is uncertain as well. In fact, there is a growing number of graduates working as hotel porters and The record of this Government in dealing youth unemployment is abysmal. It has conducted a public relations campaign to tell us that we are a clever country, that we are on track. And now the latest: One Nation. In in that statement the Prime Minister said that he wanted a civilised country where we take care of those in need, where we invest in our children. The best way to take care of those this in need is to provide them with the opporof a job-a real job, so that in the case In of young people they can look forward to a it is 39.2 secure career path. The only investment this Government is of making in young people is sinking money into an education system that often is not providing our young· with the skills to match a fast changing workplace. It is sinking money into training schemes like Jobtrain which, at an annual cost of $120m, has had one of the lowest records of assisting the unemployed back to work among the various programs offered by this Government. The Auditor-General revealed last June that Jobtrain was very poorly targeted, it was poorly evaluated in tenns of outcomes and that the funds spent on it were poorly accounted for. What hope is there for the young unemployed in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement? Mr Broadbent-None.",39
218,Mrs BAILEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the honourable member for Corinella says, there is none. Where does the Prime Minister show his commitment to these young people? Sadly, I have to report that for the one in three young people who are currently unemployed, there is no real hope to plan for a better future because all the Prime Minister has really done is to recycle some of the already failed training schemes by diverting almost $60m from the existing apprentice and trainee incentive schemes during the next three years along with pulling $40m out of Jobtrain and $7m from the training skills program and putting those amounts into new schemes. Are young people supposed to have any faith in this sort of recycling tactic? Opposition members-No.",40
219,Mrs BAILEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleagues resoundingly say, no, indeed. No doubt these measures will also be given some new buzz word title and will be distributed in a new glossy pamphlet. But young people }Vill not be fooled. It is really the same tactiq as has been used in Victoria by the State Labor Government. We used to have a public train system that was called the Victorian railways. The trains were repainted and the system was renamed Vicrail. Then the trains were repainted again and, with another change of title and a new corporate logo, the system was named V/Line. But it is the same train system that does not work and loses nearly $3m a day. Another tactic used by this Government to deal with youth unemployment is to try to deny its existence. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has recently tried to convince the Australian public that youth unemployment is not the severe problem we all believe it is. He has tried to convince anyone who would listen that the youth unemployment rate is only 8.8 per cent. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) knows that in his area the rate is much higher than that. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has stated many times that this Government will do or say anything to further its cause, and this is a classic case of just that. To reach that deceitful figure, as the shadow Minister for arts, heritage, sport and youth affairs, Senator Michael Baume, revealed in the Senate, the Minister said that the measure of youth unemployment was achieved by taking the official numbers of unemployed as a percentage of the whole youth population when the real measure of unemployment is the number of young people looking for jobs. What the Minister tried to get away with was including in his figures all young people at school or at university plus those not looking for a job. To my knowledge the Minister still has not retracted this claim. I wonder whether this Government is going to use the same creative criteria to try to change the real figure of adults unemployed. Will it include retired people and women at home looking after their children to try to confuse the real figures as yet another diversionary tactic? The Minister may indeed want to change those high youth unemployment figures to try to divert attention away from the problem, but the problem does exist. Ask any of the young people who queue at CES offices; ask any of the homeless, because they are the living testimony to the real figures of 32.7 per cent. All this GOvernment has done is invent figures to pretend that this growing problem of youth unemployment will disappear. It will continue to exist for as long as this Government fails to address the real problems that are causing unemployment, and no amount of fiddling the figures will change that. I have spent hours talking to many young people in my electorate of MCEwen about what it is like to be 17 or 18 wanting to start an independent life, to start a job, and to look forward to their future with certainty, but finding that the jobs they believe they were suited for do not exist. I want to know on their behalf why this Government, which has had nine years to develop a blueprint for the future of our country, has not even done the research to know what sort of workplace we will have in the year 2000 and beyond in order to properly plan on behalf of our youth. I want to know on their behalf what trends the Government has identified for the work force of the future and what it is going to do about them. On behalf of all young unemployed people, I call on this Government to stop all the diversion, stop trying to change the facts and show some real commitment to the future of our country by making youth unemployment our No.1 priority.  p.m.)-One would think that the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) had a monopoly on concern for people who are unemployed. I suggest to her that she look back through Hansard and read what those opposite, when in government, were doing in respect of unemployed people in the period leading up to the 1983 election, She might well want to swallow her words after reading of that experience. It is very clear this afternoon that the Opposition has a very confused approach to this issue. Unemployment is a most serious issue. It is a most tragic and worrying issue for those families which do not have a breadwinner in employment. This Government knows that and, more than anyone else in this country, is conscious of the need to g-nerate jobs for those families. No amount of chiacking from the Opposition, no amount of false testimony, no amount of whingeing, crying and screaming foul about diversions is going to detract ftom the need to generate jobs. That is an area where the Opposition does not have an effective policy. Might I say in respect of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), methinks he doth protest too much. That is my summary of his contribution this afternoon. He is a good debater, a good speake!, he is mostly an honourable man; but this afternoon his contribution was well wide of the mark. The very issue that he raised in this chamber, he diverted from himself. He did the very thing that he accused this Government of doing. The honourable member raised the critical issue of unemployment and the need to generate jobs. He did not elaborate on it. He went on to talk about how the debate was being diverted and asked how dare anybody in this nation question the Fightback package, the policy put forward by the Opposition. It is a policy that would further contract the economy of this nation and would further increase unemployment. It would do nothing whatsoever to help the people who need help today. Let me show honourable members this sham concern of the Opposition for people who do not have direct employment. We need to remember a few things. Firstly, the Opposition's policy will increase unemployment, even on the best scenario; secondly, its policy is to abolish unemployment benefits for people who are unemployed for t;>-riods of nine months or longer. The OppOSItIon talks about 'creating special benefit' - and we know that special benefit is the hardest form of assistance to get-but that is really a euphemism for 'throwing people who are unemployed for nine months or longer onto the scrap heap'. . The Opposition wants to impose upon this country the New Zealand disease-the disease in which we have this incredulous line that an employee or an unemployed person can sit down with an employer and· discuss terms of employment and negotiate a good package - f conditions by himself or herself. That IS absolutely ludicrous. People do not believe that· they know that is not true. But the poor old Opposition plugs on with the ideological approach. It wants to inflict on this country the disaster that is New Zealand today. Listen to the talkback radio stations and hear what people who have come from New Zealand and escaped, that disaster have to say about those sets of industrial relations arrangements. The fourth point I make is that the Opposition's policy provides for the abolition of the national wage case. The national wage case is there primarily to help people on lower incomes and to help those people in employment who, industrially, have little power and who, industrially, depend upon the national wage case to ensure that there is some level of equity for them in respect of wage scales. That is what the national wage case is there for. They are the four points that the honourable member for Bennelong did not want to talk about this afternoon. He wanted to cry Anyone who questions, debunks or exposes the sham of the Fightback package is accused of diversion. I am sorry for the Opposition, but the issue is the sham that consists of Fightback package. It is a sham. Let me go to some of the inaccuracies, the untruths, that contained in it. On page 116 it says: The key elements of our private sector strategy we will continue to provide preferred tax ment to the family home-in other words we will not tax the family home. But if we tum to page 225 of the same document, we see that it says: in the case of an average home the net Goods Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and tax. In other words, it does have a major impact on the price when people are buying a new family home. It is an artful presentation information designed to deceive people. That is a core issue within the Fightback package. It talks about helping people on low incomes. The reality is that a family with two children and on $20,000 taxable income would be required to pay under GST an increase in tax of $1,226. That increase in tax means the goods and services tax. That is based on taxation figures of basic supplies, basic foods; they are not my figures. I will not detain House with details of their origin, but they from the Taxation Commissioner. The income tax reduction under GST is $814. That family is $8 per week worse off as a result of GST. They are not my figures but figures from the Taxation Commissioner, from document itself. Let us put that aside and not get bogged down in that exercise. The real answer to the situation we face is to generate jobs. We are providing expanded levels of assistance for those who are unemployed, those who need additional training. We are giving support, additional training and retraining to people to help them get into jobs that are available. But we really need to generate more jobs, and that is what the One Nation package is about. The $2.3 billion expenditure over two years is designed to generate, in our estimation, at least 800,000 foul. new jobs and, on the Opposition's calculations, well over 900,000 new jobs. It is designed to generate domestic demand-and that is the real solution-lift the level of the domestic demand, create real jobs, true jobs, jobs that will spin off into greater demand for are other goods and services and so create opportunities. In addition to that, what this Government is doing-and what the Opare: position would not do-is provide assistance treatto those people who need assistance as they try to get better training and better education. We will create a new high status, better resourced vocational education training sector with an injection of $720m over the next and three years; we will develop a new, more the flexible entry level training system to build on petrol the best features of apprenticeships and to extend combined work study opportunities in the new occupations and industries; we are tackling the current downturn in apprenof ticeships and traineeship places with a wide range of additiopal and, enhanced incentives to employers and trainees; we will maintain a comprehensive safety net of labour market programs, advisory systems and support structures for young people during periods of unemployment. Let us contrast that with what members of the Opposition propose. Under their Fightback package they will slash spending by $140m the on the comprehensive set of safety net are programs available under this Government; they will cut Jobstart wage subsidies by $62m; they will abolish the self-employment the assistance program established by this Government; they will amalgamate the Comthe monwealth Employment Service with the Department of Social Security and contract out job placement services at commercial rates and, on top of that, they will charge a 15 per cent tax. That is the clear contrast between the support being given by this Government and the denial of support that would arise under the policies put forward by the Opposition in the Fightback package. The Opposition objects to the $2.3 billion expenditure that this Government has advanced under the One Nation package. Worst of all, on top of that, is the assault on small business. In this country 75 per cent of jobs are with small business in the private sector. Small business will be slugged with the enormous burden of being tax collectors and maintaining paper records of every transaction under the goods and services tax for seven years. This means that, from 71,000 tax collectors under the wholesale sales tax system, we will go to a situation where something like two million organisations will be submitting GST returns. The cost of GST collection for the average small business will be of the order of 2 per cent. As a result of the Opposition's policy, the opportunities for small business to create jobs will be severely disadvantaged. This matter of public importance exposes the hollowness of the Opposition when it talks about unemployment. The honourable member for Bennelong managed to say very little about unemployment and very little about creating jobs.",40
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The discussion is concluded. NA NA The following Bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 NA Assent to the following Bills reported: Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 NA Standing Committee on Community Affairs,43
221,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present a report on the prescription and supply of drugs entitled Prescribed HealthPart i-Regulation and the Pharmaceutical Industry, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",43
222,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE REPORT,I ask for leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,43
223,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"This report, the Committee's first on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs, has had a long gestation. The inquiry was first referred in the last Parliament and its terms of reference were advertised in 1989. Unfortunately, after a good response to requests for written submissions, the inquiry was delayed by the dissolution of parliament in 1990. The recommencement of the inquiry in July 1990 saw yet more submissions and increased levels of interest evidenced by the receipt of more than 130 submissions from individuals, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical and pharmacy professions, State and Commonwealth Government bodies and consumer organisations. The terms of reference of this inquiry are broad. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) asked the Committee to inquire into and report on the legislative and regulatory framework and professional practices influencing prescribing, retailing, supply and consumption of pharmaceuticals; standards for distribution, promotion and marketing; and current information and education on appropriate drug use. The breadth of topics covered by the terms of reference has meant that, for the first time, all factors involved in the distribution and consumption of medicines have been looked at in a comprehensive way. Other inquiries and studies have examined individual components of the overall equation, but this is the first such inquiry to be conducted by the Federal Parliament and I believe that it has provided impetus for many recent changes in the pharmaceutical environment and will result in more developments if the Committee's recommendations are adopted by the Government. Because of the broad scope of the inquiry, the Committee determined that it would table three separate reports, each addressing selected aspects of the tenns of reference. This, the first report, focuses on the current legislative and regulatory controls and responsibilities and standards which should apply to the promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals. The second report will address the professional practices which influence prescribing and the range and quality of information and education on appropriate drug use as opposed to commercial promotion and marketing. The final report will examine the current legislative and regulatory controls and professional practices which influence the dispensing, retailing and supply of medicines. This investigation into prescription drugs is timely and complements other inquiries and developments being undertaken. In particular, the Trade Practices Commission has released its draft report on the self-regulation of promotion and advertising of therapeutic goods and the Committee is pleased to support the majority of the findings and recommendations contained in the draft report. Whilst the Community Affairs Committee does not consider that there is gross abuse of the self-regulatory powers of the industry, it has recommended that certain areas should be tightened up. In particular, there should be wider exposure of the complaints process and industry code of conduct and more transparency. The Committee has also recommended broader representation on the complaints subcommittee of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association along with the imposition of stricter fines for breaches of the code of conduct. The Committee believes that a greater proportion of financial resources should be spent on educational, as opposed to brand product, promotional advertising. To this end, we have recommended that pharmaceutical companies provide more information to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority about the amounts to be spent on promotional activities, including the proportion of their promotional expenditure which is devoted to independent medical education. The Committee supports the preparation of ethical principles to assist professional organisations and, in particular, the medical profession in their dealings with the industry and has made a recommendation that ethical guidelines similar to those prepared by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians be developed by the AMA and other specialist colleges. Other initiatives proposed by the Committee relate to the labelling on medicines. One of these, which is designed to assist health professionals and consumers and to encourage more informed drug use, is to make it mandatory that the generic name of a drug be placed on labels more prominently than the brand name. This should reduce confusion about which drug is being taken and minimise adverse effects brought about by taking multiple doses of the same drug unwittingly. The Committee has also made recommendations designed to prevent the obscuring of essential information on labels by pharmacists, and to simplify warning statements that appear on labels. In relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the Committee has recommended that, in order to minimise listing delays, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee meet more often and, if necessary, for longer periods than it does at present. Recommendations also call on the PBAC to make greater use of clinicians in particular disciplines when examining specialist drugs and to increase the overall specialist expertise of the PBAC by reviewing its current membership. Comments and recommendations have also been made in relation to the use of cdst effectiveness analysis as part of the evaluation process prior to listing drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Such analysis should provide a better basis for listing decisions. In the area of consumer information the Committee has recommended that the therapeutic goods administration be responsible for approving and formally authorising information about drugs for use by consumers. This approved consumer information should be widely disseminated and available in a compendium for purchase by the public. In the final chapter of the report the Committee discusses the need for a national drug strategy. Rational drug use relies on a partnership and cooperation between the major interest groups; namely, the industry, health professionals, government and consumers. A feature of the first part of the inquiry was the conduct of a workshop over two days with representatives of these groups. One of the outcomes of this meeting was strong support for a national medicinal drug policy which should have four major components: a viable pharmaceutical industry, high quality products, equity of access and quality of use. In a recent editorial for the Australian Journal of Pharmacy, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services reinforced these four key elements in a national drug policy. The Minister cited costs to the health system and to individuals reSUlting from the misuse of prescription drugs. The Committee has also heard anecdotal evidence about the costs to the health system of prescription drug misuse but very little in the way of hard data. The Minister said: Approximately 40% of all drug related poisoning cases admitted to public hospitals (an estimated 20 000 people per year) are caused by the incorrect use of prescription medicines. It is estimated that between 30% and 80% of all people taking prescription medicines do not take them as directed. The full social and economic costs associated with the inappropriate use of medicines are immeasurable. Some steps have been taken to address this problem. The Government's pharmaceutical education strategy, involving professionals and consumers, is grappling with the identification of major factors contributing to increased consumer awareness and more rational drug use. The Committee's report will assist in this process. The second and third reports on this inquiry will focus in more detail on the need for further education of health professionals and a more coordinated approach to health care in the area of prescription drugs. The Committee will investigate the limitations of drug therapy and the means of encouraging greater awareness of non-drug alternatives. An inquiry of the magnitude of this present prescription drugs investigation requires the dedicated work of both the Committee members, which I am grateful that I have received throughout the inquiry, and the Committee secretariat. The Community Affairs Committee, like most other committees of this House, is ably assisted by the secretariat. I express my personal gratitude, and that of the Committee, to the Committee Secretary, Bjame Nordin, for his fine efforts throughout the conduct of this inquiry. He has received valuable research assistance from James Catchpole and administrative and secretarial support from Shirley Hunter. Their work is also of a high standard and appreciated by the Committee. The Committee looks forward to the concluding two stages of this important inquiry and thanks all those who have been so cooperative in our deliberations to this stage. I ask for leave of the House to move a motion to take note of the report. Leave granted.",43
224,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE REPORT,I move: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) adjourned. INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION NA NA Reports of Australian Parliamentary Delegation,45
225,Mr HOLDING,CHILE AND VENEZUELA,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Eighty-sixth Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Santiago in October 1991. I also present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Chile and Venezuela in October 1991. This, of course, was the delegation which attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Chile. I think it should be noted by the House again that the Australian delegation played a major role in the conference of the IPU. The Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay), is chairman of the Australian group, a member of the International Executive Committee of the IPU and a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. That meant that much of his time at the conference was spent in the very important executive meetings that took place. Equally, I am a representative of the IPU on the Committee for Human Rights of Parliamentarians and also the committee examining and monitoring the situation in Cyprus. That took up most of my time. It ought to be noted by the House that under IPU rules only one supplementary item can be dealt with at each conference, and the supplementary item was furnished through the Australian Parliament by the IPU Executive. It was no small matter, in the very fierce competition that took place, to get the item which was of concern· to the delegation and to this Parliament up for debate at the IPU conference. The item dealt with was the role of parliaments in supporting efforts to achieve a greater liberalisation of international trade, in particular through a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. Although there was some very strong support for that resolution from some of the developing nations, particularly our host countries and countries from Central America, one is bound to express the view that, particularly in many of the preliminary negotiations, while there was a general endorsement in principle, when some of the older nation states of Europe in particular were giving support to the proposition, it was support on the basis that everybody else got onto the equal playing field but them, thank you very much. One has to say that one feels that the equal playing field is becoming an increasingly lonely place for any nation state to venture onto. Nevertheless, I think the debate that took place urged support for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. To that extent, I think the general policies have been advocated within the Parliament were advanced. It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the very real work done with women parliamentarians by our two female delegates, who again distinguished themselves. I note the permanent delegate from the Opposition, who has laboured tirelessly over a period of time amongst the women parliamentarians, often without the reward which should be her due. Nevertheless, our two delegates working together produced a major change to rules. I will leave it to them to inform the House of the details of that. In Chile it was refreshing to see the enthusiasm that existed in all sections of society for the emergence of parliamentary democracy and their concern to make it work. That does not mean that all their problems have been solved. General Pinochet is still a figure in the political scene. Nevertheless, one could not help feeling wherever one went that there was a commitment and a concern to see that parliamentary democracy did not fail. I hope the fact that the IPU conference took place in Chile will assist the strengthening of the foundations of parliamentary democracy in that country. The Ministers we as a delegation visited made it very clear that they see themselves as part of the South Pacific region. They hope to playa part in that region and they look forward to closer relationships with Australia at both a political and an economic level. I believe we have established a base from which those ties can be strengthened. In Venezuela, the delegation spent a great deal of time discussing the possibility of Australian companies investing in joint venture arrangements. At one stage we found ourselves advocating, as a delegation, the role of a major Australian mineral exploration company in a very important development that could take place in Venezuela. I would like to finish on this note: in the past the delegation has had cause to complain about what we felt was insufficient SUppOlt from our embassy staff, but on this occasion one could only be full of praise for the efforts of our newly arrived Ambassador in Chile. that Nothing was too much trouble and he gave the delegation his fullest support and all of the backup which was possible in that situation. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our thanks to the Australian Ambassador, Mr Mathew Peake. The same can also be said for our Australian ambassadorial representation in Venezuela. Dr and Mrs De Stoop not only welcomed the delegation but also made very considerable efforts to assist us in our work. One should also point out that often it is not recognised that the presence of a parliamentary delegation visiting Ministers of nation states can also prove quite beneficial for ambassadors, particularly new ambassadors. The presence of a parliamentary delegation and its visits to Ministers opens up a whole range of connections which make life a lot easier and facilitate the kind of communication that newly arrived ambassadors often find difficult to obtain in a new situation. To that extent, I think the important relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and this Parliament deserves much closer scrutiny. We undoubtedly benefited from the experience and the efforts that were made by our ambassadorial representatives, but I am pleased to say that I think they felt they obtained considerable benefits too. I commend the work of all members of the delegation: Senator Bill O'Chee, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the able leadership of Speaker MCLeay.",45
226,Mrs SULLIVAN,CHILE AND VENEZUELA,I seek leave to make a statement on the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Eighty-sixth Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference. Leave granted.,47
227,Mrs SULLIVAN,CHILE AND VENEZUELA,"I say by way of explanation at the beginning that the reason I have not sought leave to speak on the report of the delegation's visit to Chile and Venezuela is that I was not part of that delegation. I of course had the opportunity to participate, as a member of the delegation to the IPU; however, for personal reasons I found it not possible to participate in that delegation. I want to refer to a couple of particular items in relation to Australia's participation in this IPU conference. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has mentioned that Australia has been successful in gaining a rule change in relation to the composition of drafting committees for IPU conferences. Australia agreed, on behalf of a meeting of women parliamentarians in Uruguay 18 months ago-12 months earlier than the conference that we are referring to now-to undertake to try to get a rule change to require that when compiling the membership of drafting committees there should be some regard to female participation. The significance of this is that items are debated in the plenum but the motion that the conference will vote on in the end is thrashed out behind closed doors by a small drafting committee which usually consists of, at most, a dozen people-it is sometimes smaller. It is at that point that the critical participation is made. There was a feeling amongst the women parliamentarians that on some issues particular dimensions were being overlooked by drafting committees. It is possible to amend the draft resolution when it is considered again by the whole committee of the conference; but in fact changes of substance are rarely made at that stage. It may be that something which a country or group of countries has tried to get into the draft resolution at the drafting committee stage but failed will be attempted again when it comes back to the whole committee, but I do not know of a single instance where that has actually succeeded. I know of only minor changes to the draft resolutions. No change can be proposed when it comes back for debate by the Inter-Parliamentary Council unless that change has already been proposed in the committee. The chances are that if it is rejected at the committee stage it will not be accepted at the Council stage, so in fact amendments are very rarely carried through to the Council. Therefore, drafting committees become very important. That is the reason that the meeting of women parliamentarians in Uruguay in 1990 gave this matt-r some priority. It was agreed that Australia, on behalf of the women, would investigate ways of getting the rule changed. The delegation brought this matter back to this Parliament's group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and it received its total support. A rule change was drafted and went forward. I had the honour of presenting this rule change at the plenum meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Council and it was passed unanimously. It is a very simple change which I think bears a little explanation. It adds the words 'and gender' to a clause which now reads, 'Its composition shall take into account equitable geographical distribution and political and gender balance'. I read that out in order to point out that there is already a number of considerations concerning the balance of drafting committees and it is not unreasonable to add that extra dimension of gender. I had the opportunity, together with the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who was a Government member of this delegation, to participate in the preconference of women parliamentarians which was held on the Sunday before the conference opened on the Monday morning. I think it was a very successful conference. It gave the women members of parliament an opportunity to meet with one another. This is such a large conference that there are not many opportunities for getting to know other members of the delegations from all countries. Women members of parliament typically constitute between 15 to 20 per cent of the delegates to an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. However, they make up a much smaller percentage of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. The Inter-Parliamentary Council comprises the leader and deputy leader of each country's delegation. As the Opposition's permanent member on the delegation for the life of this Parliament, that automatically makes me deputy leader of the delegation and means that I am a voting member of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. Whilst women may constitute as much as 20 per cent of the delegates, the percentage of the Inter-Parliamentary Council which is female is very low indeed. I would not care to hazard a guess, but I am sure it is less than 5 per cent. So the women have very little voting power, in practical terms, in the InterParliamentary Union. It is therefore very important to have that pre-meeting of women parliamentarians because it gives them an opportunity to get together, to share their views and to make sure that those women who do have a say in other councils of the Inter-Parliamentary Union are familiar with the views and can speak on behalf of women as a whole where it is relevant. It was relevant in relation to another matter, which I intend to raise later. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has already referred to the matter of the supplementary item on trade and the Uruguay Round which was put forward by Australia. We worked very hard to get that item up as the supplementary item for debate and discussion-that is, supplementary to the two items that were listed already on the agenda. It is worth saying that that item received an outstanding vote from the delegations voting one by one. As I recall, three items were put forward to fill that slot and Australia's suggestion was a very clear winner. I want to add one other comment to those already made by honourable member for Melbourne Ports in relation to the Europeans. I think it should also be noted that there was an amount of professed support for the item from some other countries-notably some Asian countries-which did not have delegates present to vote when it was actually voted on. In fact, delegates deliberately absented themselves at that moment so that when the name of that country was called out there was no-one there to respond on behalf of the country and to indicate how the delegation would be voting. That was a little disappointing, but we live and learn. I suppose that is the way of international politics, and particularly international trade. Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that it was a very remarkable success for Australia that we got the support we did from the conference. That was done only as a result of a large amount of extremely hard work and a lot of leg work and talking by members of the delegation doing the usual numbers exercise. I think it really paid off in the end. We got support. I wish to raise one other matter, and that the proposal that Australia made for an item to be placed on the agenda for the forthcoming conference in Yaounde, Cameroon. The Australian delegation had agreed to propose to this conference in Chile that the matter of AIDS was an appropriate subject for the conference in Cameroon. That was for a number of reasons, not the least of which being the conference is to be in Africa and the matter of AIDS is such a dramatic problem in Africa, as indeed it is in all countries and particularly developing countries. The extent of its spread in Africa is well known. On behalf of the Australian delegation, and with its support, I proposed this matter to the women's conference to seek the support of women delegates for advocating that their delegations support listing this item for the eighty-seventh conference. The item received that support from the women MPs. It was also proposed at the meeting of the Asia Pacific group, of which Australia is a member, and received support there. Indeed, I was very pleasantly surprised at the strength of the support from China in particular. I notice that the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), indicates she was surprised by that, too. One is used to China having an image of being rather prudish on the subject of sex, and certainly that has been borne out by my time in China in attempting to discuss matters of birth control and family planning with the Chinese. So it really was not a quarter from which expected strong support. The Chinese delegate made a statement which has really rung in my ears ever since in strongly supporting the proposal that AIDS should be discussed at the next conference. He expressed his belief that in AIDS it possible that we are actually witnessing the beginning of the end of the human race. That is a very strong and startling statement make. Those who have familiarised themselEuropean ves with the pattern of the spread of AIDS will now be aware that it is no longer seen the disease of homosexuals and intravenous drug users. People might, through misfortune, get it from attending to victims of trauma, is dentists may get it or people may get it from tainted blood transfusions. In fact, the spread through women from heterosexual sex and the consequent spread to the next generation-the very large number of children who have been born world wide and are HIV positive at birth-is a very, very worrying and daunting prospect. I have seen estimates that by the end of this century at least 10 million women will have acquired AIDS through heterosexual sex, and there may be as many as 40 million AIDS orphans. However, I digress. As I said, the comments by the delegate from China in that context really are very pertinent comments. There was also support for the idea in informal conversations with people from quite a number of other countries, particularly African and eastern European countries. I certainly did not canvass all the delegations, but a number of countries indicated support for it. However, it did not get support from 12-plus, who really did not want to talk about it at all. There was another item going forward on the environment, and it was decided that they would support that item. The alternative of a matter relating to AIDS was put forward but not debated. In fact, on one occasion when I attempted to debate it I found it impossible to get recognition from the Chair-who, by the way, was a woman. In the event it was not supported by the executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and essentially it failed because it was not I supported by 12-plus. The 12-plus group was originally a group of western European style democracies. It was the countries of the European Community plus like-minded democracies such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. It is becoming now overwhelmingly a European group. was Australia and New Zealand do play a full role, and I know we get good support from a number of other countries and delegates, but to I feel increasingly it is developing into a group. There are those who would be quite happy to see our role in 12-plus as downgraded in the future. However, not daunted, not deterred, we are going to have another go on that item at the forthcoming conference in Yaounde. We are going to try to get it up as a supplementary item. I do not know whether we have any hope, given that it was not supported by the executive. I think it is certainly worth a try because, as I said, there is some quite broad based support for the worth of debating that issue and looking at what parliaments cooperating world wide might be able to achieve against the spread of the disease. Finally, I want to say a word on Australian participation. Certainly in my time of going to IPU conferences our level of participation has been high. It was particularly noteworthy this time because of the success in getting the supplementary item up. Australia participated in two out of three of the drafting committees. The leader of the delegation, Mr Speaker MCLeay, was our nominal representative on the drafting committee on the supplementary item. I am aware that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports also participated. In what was referred to as the second item on the agenda-namely, human development, economic growth and democracy and the role of parliaments in ensuring necessary links between freedoms, citizens' involvement, economic growth and social investments, which has a very particular relevance to parliaments-I had the honour of representing the Asia-Pacific group. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was also a member of the Committee on the Violations of Human Rights of Parliamentarians and put a great deal of time into that extremely important committee as well as the committee on Cyprus, to which he has already referred. The Speaker is, of course, a member of the executive committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Australia plays a very active role in both 12-plus and the Asia Pacific groups. It is pleasing to see that the Asia Pacific group is becoming a more cohesive group and is starting to exercise a little more clout in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Its lack of clout in the past has not been because of the lack of importance of its members, but basically lack of coordination and organisation. On a personal note I would like to thank the secretary to the delegation, John Dyer; Wendy Barnes, who is a member of the Speaker's staff; and Bill Nelson from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who travelled with us. I would thank John and Wendy for their assistance, and Bill for his assistance and advice as a foreign affairs officer. With the level of participation of the delegation at this conference they were spread very thin. They worked extremely hard and they did an absolutely excellent job. I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Library staff and other Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officers who gave us excellent briefs to enable us to acquit ourselves, as I hope, very creditably on behalf of Australia.",47
228,Mrs CROSIO,CHILE AND VENEZUELA,"by leave-I had the opportunity to attend my first Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. I suppose from where I stand, I speak with experience different from that of both the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). I found the conference extremely useful, not only because of the contribution of the Australia delegation and the response from something like 110 countries, but also one has that opportunity provided to one to participate in the debate that is going on constantly and also in the debate that occurs after a meeting is finished. I found that very enlightening. I also join both the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Moncrieff in complimenting the staff which we took with us. It was extremely important to a person such as myself to have that first opportunity with respect to what should happen, what one is supposed to do and how one is to take one's part in the debate. The honourable member for Moncrieff, as well as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, has mentioned also the supplementary item and I would like to compliment the Speaker, too, in putting that item forward. It is very important to realise that when the vote was taken some 814 voted for that supplementary item, 89 voted against it and 219 abstained. I think it was a tremendous victory for Australia, not only to have that brought to the forefront as a supplementary item but also in the time of the Uruguay Round that was going on to bring forward the concerns of our country with respect to what is happening in that area of trade. Following the very successful completion of that IPU conference, we were then provided with the opportunity both by the Chilean Government and the Venezuelan Government to meet with their parliamentarians and Ministers and, most importantly, to see part of their country, and particularly to look at the areas that we as Australia and Australians could possible be involved with in trade. I was impressed with the Chilean open economy and certainly in seeing what has now happened to that country, after what we had read previously about the Pinochet regime, and how Chile has now brought itself out of what could only be described as a reign of terror to where it is now. I also had the opportunity, with Wendy Barns, to visit a mission run by Father Tim, who was actually born in Bourke, New South Wales, and see the work that is being achieved with the people in his particular area. I was very impressed by our Embassies and their staffs-the courtesy, the help, the knowledge that they had, not only of the country but of all of the matters that we were putting to them both from the trading aspect, the government aspect and the parliamentary side. It was very informative. I was particularly impressed, too, in Venezuela. I suppose that when one looks at the economy there, one sees that what should have been such a rich nation has experienced ptoblems. We saw so many of their farmers giving up the land and coming into the cities. We saw overwhelming poverty at times that should not have happened if, perhaps, the inflation tate was not running at the 30 per cent that it was and if, perhaps, a little bit more care were given to the housing and the needs of those people. I am not trying to be rude in being critical of the country, but I found it, I suppose, inspiring in the fact that we in Australia are so terribly fortunate because not only the type of government that we have but also the structure that we have in place in this country which assists and helps so many people who are in need through no fault of their own. Again, I would like to express my thanks to the Speaker, to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as the permanent delegate and to the honourable member for Moncrieff as the opposition delegate for the assistance and help that they gave both to me and to Senator Bill O'Chee, who was the other new member to go on that particular delegation. I believe that the reports which are now written and tabled in this Parliament will always be something that I will keep because, while one remembers things, from the copious notes which were taken at the time by John Dyerand I now see how he has put them together with the assistance of his staff into these reportsI can appreciate what we have achieved over that period of time. I again thank the Parliament and my fellow delegates who gave me the opportunity of participating in the conference, and I hope that I am able to add to many more in years to come. NA Joint Committee on the National Capital Motion (by Ms Fatin) agreed to: That: (1) the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory henceforth be known as the Joint Committee on the National Capital; (2) references to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in resolutions of either the Senate or the House of this session, be read as references to the Joint Committee on the National Capital; (3) nominations notified to either the President or the Speaker of Senators or Members of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, be nominations of Senators or Members to the Joint Committee on the National Capital; (4) paragraph l(b) of the resolution of appointment of the Committee be amended by omitting the words 'Australian Capital Territory' first appearing and substituting the words 'National Capital'; and (5) a message be sent to the ""Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly.

This Bill, seeking appropriation of some $204m, is introduced to accommodate special circumstances arising from the Government's statement on the economy and employment last November and the recent One Nation statement and to ensure continuity of funding for other important Government initiatives. The Bill addresses only three items of expenditure-labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry, residential care for older people and child-care fee reliefcontinuity of which the Government considers cannot be jeopardised by the timing of the availability of funds being dependent upon passage of Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 through the Parliament. To await passage of that Bill in the normal course of events would place severe hardship on many individuals, companies and charitable organisations. This is not the Government's intent. In short, payments for these measures are required in a time-frame which, on the basis of current estimates, cannot be accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance whilst awaiting passage of the Additional Estimates. Put another way this Bill principalthe ly deals with the timing of payments for these key Government programs. In light of the appropriations being sought in this Bill I would now foreshadow my 1992 intention to move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 at the proper time in order to remove from that Bill reference to additional appropriations for these programs. The relevant portfolio program performance statements provided in connection with that Bill will be amended to reflect the changed appropriation arrangements. In that regard, by seeking Parliament's agreement to accelerate separately the appropriations required for these three programs, the Government is responding to the urgency of needs that cannot await passage of the other Additional Estimates in the normal course. I recognise that the Senate, through its Estimates committees, will exercise its customary scrutiny over the range of Government programs in the course of considering Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92. I turn now to the specific programs: Labour Market Program Assistance to Job Seekers and Industry The Government's labour market assistance to job seekers and industry is aimed at assisting the unemployed retain their skills and links with the work force, which is particularly crucial at the present time. The Government announced an increase of $71m in the program for 1991-92 in the November economy and employment statement and a further $lIm net has been provided in the One Nation statement. Smaller increases in related programs, totalling $5m, result in a total appropriation now being sought in this Bill of some $87m, which will be removed from Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 as I noted earlier. Residential Care for Older People The Government's residential care for older people program is direct-d to ensuring that aged and disabled people who are assessed as being unable to live at home have available to them residential support and care appropriate to their needs. As part of the program, grants are made to religious, charitable and other organisations to defray cost of capital works. An amount of $50m is proposed in this Bill, reflecting a faster path to construction for approvals given. My foreshadowed amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 will remove an equivalent amount from that Bill. Child-care Fee Relief The Government's child-care program assists families with dependant children to participate in the work force and the general community by ensuring child-care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving the supply and quality of childcare. As part of the program, fee relief payments are provided quarterly in advance to service providers to defray the costs of child-care for low and middle income families. This program, unlike the majority initiatives where individual entitlements are met from standing appropriations, is currently funded through the annual appropriation mechanism. In light of the entitlement nature of the program the Government is considering in the longer term whether to establish a standing appropriation for the program. The appropriation sought in this Bill, some $67m, largely reflects an increase in the average amount per place for fee relief since the Budget Estimates were derived and a higher than expected number of child-care places being available in 1991-92. I propose amending Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92 to delete some $43m sought for this program in that Bill. The additional amount of some $24m sought in this Bill reflects updated calculation of the amount required, undertaken since preparation of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92. I wish to emphasise again that this Bill seeks to provide appropriations for programs to ensure eligible individuals and orin ganisations are not disadvantaged and placed in a position of hardship pending passage the Additional Estimates Bills. We have brought forward a specific Appropriation rather than proposing an increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to fund (No.1). these programs pending passage of the Additional Estimates. By taking this path the proposed appropriations can be scrutinised Parliament prospectively. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No.1) 1992-93 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",52
230,Mr WILLIS,REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. of This Bill, together with its companion Bills, Supply Bill (No.2) 1992-93 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1992-93, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1992 to 30 November 1992, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills which will form part of the Budget for 1992-93 will have been enacted. Supply Bill (No.1) seeks appropriations totalling some $12,383m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $320m, or 2.7 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No.1) 1991-92. This increase reflects a combination of factors, including: · price and cost increases and the impact of exchange rate variations; · the inclusion of those ordinary annual services of government items which appeared Supply Bill (No.2) in 1991-92 because they had not previously been included in the of annual Appropriation Bills; and · the full year effect of new and enhanced Bill programs which have commenced since the introduction of the previous Supply Bill The increases include: by For the Defence portfolio $72m for running costs largely reflecting the increase in service and civilian salaries approved in 1991-92; and $166m for equipment and stores reflecting the timing of contractual payments for equipment purchases in the Supply period. For the Employment, Education and Training portfolio $34m for running costs reflecting various new initiatives since the 1991-92 Supply Bills; $166m for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry flowing from initiatives previously announced in the 1991-92 Budget and the November 1991 industry statement and the One Nation statement; and $73m to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission largely reflecting the transfer of the community services element of the training for Aboriginals program from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and an increase in community development projects. For the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio $78m for services for families with children reflecting an increase in child-care numbers and average subsidy rates. For the Department of Veterans' Affairs $29m for other benefits flowing from an increased demand for treatment of veterans in non-departmental hospitals. For the Social Security portfolio $61m for running costs which includes provision for national wage case decisions and increased workloads. For the Treasury portfolio $29m for Australian Taxation Office running costs largely reflecting anticipated higher payments on salaries. The Government has decided to introduce a system of user charging for legal services from 1 July 1992. Provision has been made in the running costs appropriations for all departments and agencies to meet fees charged by the Attorney-General's Department over the Supply period. In addition, the legal practice trust account which will be the vehicle for implementing that decision will require a working capital advance, an establishment grant and contingency funding to cover any shortfall associated with a time lag between incurring expenditure to be met from the trust account and payments to the trust account by clients. With the exception of the contingency reserve, these provisions have been offset by a reduction in the proposed direct appropriations to the Attorney-General's Department. I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 199293 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No.2) 1992-93 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",53
231,Mr WILLIS,REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling some $4,037m, for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other services for the period 1 July 1992 to 30 November 1992. The amount sought is $596m, or 17.3 per cent, more than that provided in the Supply Act (No.2) 1991-92. Of this figure about $480m is as a consequence of new initiatives not previously included in the annual Appropriation Bills. The residual flows largely from timing of payments associated with existing programs which have previously been approved by the Parliament, partially offset by the transfer of items from Bill No. 2 to Bill No. 1. Major increases in existing subdivisions include: For the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio $46m for assistance to people with disabilities reflecting the creation of a new item in the 1991-92 Budget for transfer payments to the States in accordance with the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement; and $81m for health care access reflecting general price increases and renewal of authority for the hospital enhancement program. For the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio $72m for infrastructure support largely reflecting increased funding previously announced under the rural adjustment scheme. For the Transport and Communications portfolio · $100m for an equity injection to the National Rail Corporation. In respect of new provisions which reflect new government initiatives, these have been separately itemised in the Bill, in accordance with long standing convention, and include: For the Attorney-General's portfolio $21.7m for advances, establishment grants and contingency funding for the Legal Practice Trust Account as part of the arrangements for the introduction of user charging for legal services. For the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio · $32.5m for alternative general practice funding arrangements. For the Department of Veterans' Affairs · $5.1m for the transfer of repatriation general hospitals to the States. For the Transport and Communications portfolio · $412.0m for transport infrastructure funding announced in the One Nation statement. As indicated with regard to the Supply Bill (No.1), the provisions in this Bill do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 199293 Budget context. I commend the Bill to the House.

233,Mr WILLIS,INTEREST RATES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",55
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Does the Minister need to add to a previous answer or to clarify a matter on which he has been misrepresented?,55
235,Mr WILLIS,INTEREST RATES,It can be seen as an addition to an answer I gave at Question Time.,55
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,The Chair will grant indulgence for the Minister to add to an answer.,55
237,Mr WILLIS,INTEREST RATES,"During Question Time I was asked a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) who referred to a statement. I made at a press conference on 16 December in relation to the impact of the Opposition's Fightback package on monetary policy. He claimed that I had misled that audience and the nation by claiming that this would lead to a tightening of monetary policy when I had advice from Treasury to the opposite effect. I will quickly state the facts. A document was referred to by the Deputy Leader Opposition, which was in a group of documents subject to freedom of information action by the Opposition-document 21. That Treasury document of 2 December was the addressed to Dr Parkinson of the Treasurer's office, which was prior to the time that became Treasurer. However, I do not wish . make anything in particular out of that, but that document did not arrive while I was Treasurer. The document sought to model the Opposition package to some extent through the Murphy model. It attempted to model the main components of the tax and expenditure cuts outlined in Fightback, assuming that Opposition's claims were correct. In other words, it was assumed that there would be one-off increase in inflation of about 5 per cent and that there would be no flow on wages. That was a quite crucial assumption which W!.ls spelt out quite clearly in document. It stated: monetary policy has been set to allow a one increase in consumer price inflation of around cent in the year of implementation of GST. direct wage flow-ons are allowed. Of course, this was the Opposition asfactored sumption. The document continued: these monetary policy and wage assumptions critical in the simulations-ie the results (especially in the short-run) are sensitive behaviour of monetary policy and wage outcomes. Subsequently, looking at the key features of the tax mix in applying the Murphy model in this somewhat limited way to the Opposition Fightback package, on page 2 of the attachment it was stated: Money supply was increased by 3.7 per cent to the initial one off increase in the with the introduction of the GST. Adjustments were made to the wage equation residuals in order to discount wage increases for the direct inflationary impact of the GST. In other words, the model was throwing up higher wage increases and Treasury actively went back and took those wage increases out because, under the Opposition's policy, they were assumed not to occur or to have any effect on wages through the introduction of the GST. The Treasury was trying to be of the faithful to that assumption. The whole point of the comments that I made in the press conference of 16 December was that that assumption was not one which Government shared. It did not believe that it was a realistic assumption. The Government I believed that, if the GST were introduced, to there would then be a flow on of further wage increases, particularly in the context of there the not having been adequate compensation paid to wage and salary earners. The other point that should be mentioned in this context is that at the time Treasury did this modelling it did not have available to it its own analysis of the revenue side of the the Fightback package; nor did it have the finance modelling of the expenditure side of the a package. All that information was available by the time. I held the press conference. That to meant that the assumptions made about the impact of fiscal policy were quite different the from the reality of the package once those changes had been made and the $4 billion off shortfall was built into the system. The 5 per substantial swingaround in fiscal policy, the No relaxation of fiscal policy in year two, the year of introduction of the GST, was not into anything like the degree that it should have been by Treasury when it underare took the model, as reported on 2 December. It simply had not done the work at that time to the assumed to factor that in. Mr Downer-Because you have not asked them to cook the books.",55
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo does not help. The Chair is concentrating on the matter. Mr Downer-I am sure you are-to use in price level associated your electorate.,56
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"Order! The honourable member for Mayo should not reflect on the Chair. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, has the Minister completed his response?",56
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"Yes, I take it that he has. Does the Manager of Opposition Business wish to ask a question arising from that? Mr Fife Mr Deputy Speaker, the purpose of the response, as I understand it, was to add to and also to correct any misunderstanding. I assume that the Minister is politely apologising to the House for his inadequate answer at Question Time.",56
241,Mr WILLIS,INTEREST RATES,"That is a totally false assumption and the Manager of Opposition Business knows that to be the case. From what I have said it is quite clear that rather than any apology being forthcoming from me, the apology should be forthcoming from the Opposition for grossly misrepresenting the position that was being portrayed by me at that time, which was an absolutely correct interpretation of the impact of the Fightback proposals. Nothing that was said by me at that time is withdrawn in any way. NA REGULATION BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.",57
242,Mr COSTELLO,MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS,"Higgins) (5.40 p.m.)The Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill 1992 establishes machinery to allow Australian business regulators to assist foreign business regulators by obtaining evidence, information and the production of documents. It deals with the domestic arrangements to be put in place in Australia for our regulators to assist overseas regulators. It does not deal with situations where foreign business regulators will be requested to assist Australian business regulators. Clearly, however, the substantial part of the object of this Bill is to cooperate with foreign regulators so that they will reciprocate and cooperate with requests that our regulators make to them. Over the last 18 months I have had the opportunity to discuss cooperation between Australian business regulators and regulators in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and regulators in the United Kingdom, the Securities and Investment Board. In those discussions, the issue of cooperation has been raised with me: from their point of view, they would like information concerning the dealings of particular people in Australia; from our point of view we would like information concerning the particular dealings of people in their countries. Regulators can profit clearly from cooperation. Modem technology and communications have made it easy to deal across international borders, to invest, to sell and to trade. It is possible to buy shares in Australian companies not only in Melbourne or Sydney but also in London and sometimes in New York. It is possible to move prices on domestic stock exchanges through moving prices in foreign exchanges, and that is as old as the Poseidon boom of the late 1960s. The deregulation of financial markets and the movement of foreign currency have obviously also made such dealings easier to undertake; and, indeed, such activity should be undertaken. There is no reason why Australia should quarantine its financial markets; there is no reason why we should quarantine foreign investment; and there is no reason why our companies should be quarantined from investing overseas. But, where the possibility arises that some of those investments or trades might breach overseas laws, we should cooperate in law enforcement. Where Australian companies breach Australian laws by dealings in foreign parts of the world, we would seek foreign cooperation. If there is to be successful law enforcement, we must have the capacity to follow transactions wherever they go and, having followed them, to receive information which is admissible in Australian courts. The interesting thing about this particular Bill is that it is directed at providing assistance to foreign regulators who seek information but not. for the purposes of criminal proceedings. That is made clear in clause 6 where, before a Commonwealth regulator can deal with a request for cooperation, the Commonwealth regulator must secure an undertaking that the information or evidence will not be used for criminal proceedings or for the imposition of a penalty. The Bill is directed towards securing information to be used, presumably, for civil purposes by foreign regulators. Of course, foreign regulators will in many cases be seeking assistance and information to assist in relation to criminal proceedings. I assume that that will be dealt with either under a complementary Act which has already been in existence-the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987-or on another basis. It is important to bear in mind that this Bill and the machinery set up for it predicated on an undertaking being given that the infOlmation . will not be used for the purposes of criminal proceedings. Indeed, the machinery set up by this Bill is to call in a particular person and obtain information, documents or evidence. The Bill is not dealing with the situation where one of our regulators will, for example, just be passing across items on the public record-such as company returns and so on-to a corresponding agency in another country. As I understand it, that kind of exchange of information will have to be done through a memorandum of understanding between the regulators concerned. This Bill will not take away the obligation we have to secure such memorandums of understanding, which we will have to secure to get foreign cooperation back here into Australia. I urge the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) to keep working on such memorandums of understanding and bilateral agreements to secure cooperation for Australian regulators from agencies overseas. The system set up by this particular Bill is that a request will be made to an Australian business regulator and the undertaking will be sought and given. The Australian regulatorwhich, as far as I am concerned, will probably be the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission; there may be others but I imagine they would be the two principal ones-is then required to take into account certain particular matters and form a decision. If after taking into account those particular matters it believes that the request should be complied with, the matter is then passed on to the Attorney-General. The matters that the Australian business regulator is to take into account are such matters as: whether it is likely to be able to obtain the information; the cost of obtaining it; whether the foreign regulator could get material from another source; the degree to which the functions of the Australian regulator correspond with those of the foreign regulator; whether the foreign regulator making the request would be likely to comply with a similar request by the Commonwealth regulator; and whether the matter should be handled under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. If the Australian regulator comes to the conclusion after taking all those matters into account that the request should be complied with, the request then moves on to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General takes into account another series of statutory factors such as: the national interest; international law; whether the material could be used for punishing a person for an offence of a political character or whether it could be used for punishing a person on the basis of race, sex, religion or political opinion. Those matters are set out in clause 8(2). One matter not set out specifically in clause 8(2)-and I think consideration should be given to setting it out-is whether the foreign regulator has complied with conditions or undertakings imposed in relation to any previous supply of information. It seems to me that is a matter which should be specifically taken into account. If one is going to put conditions and undertakings on the supply of information, then presumably one should take into account in some way whether they have been complied with before dealing with another request. The Attorney-General may say, 'I can take anything into account that I consider relevant and I would consider that relevant, so there is no need to put it in the legislation'. However, certain matters have been specifically speIt out, presumably to direct the attention of the Minister to make sure that he does take them into account and consider them. It seems to me that the Bill could be improVed by making it clear. After all, the only way one is going to be able to enforce these conditions and undertakings is by holding over the heads of the foreign regulators the prospect that, if they do not comply this time, they are never going to get cooperation next time. There is no other practical way of securing compliance with undertakings and conditions. I would think that would be a matter to be specifically taken into account by the Attorney-General when he makes his decision. If the request has got through the Commonwealth business regulator and the Attorney General, the Commonwealth business regulator can take evidence. The way in which that is done is that, under clause 10, the Commonwealth regulator serves a written notice requiring the person to give information, to produce documents or to appear. It has been raised with me that, as an element of fairness in giving that written notice, something should be said about what the request is and what the request relates to. It would not be sufficient, for example, just to say, 'Come in and bring all your documents with you and get ready to answer some questions. The regulator in Panama has been on to us'. As a matter of fairness that written notice should say, 'We have received a request from X. They are investigating in relation to Y. They seek documents that may relate to it in the following way'. It may be that the rules of natural justice themselves will require that to be set out in the written notice, although I would not take that as necessarily the case by reason of the way in which the legislation is put. I raise that again not only for the attention of the Attorney-General but also for the attention of the Australian business regulator. When giving notice, I think in all fairness the notice should say what the matter relates to and give some kinds of particulars as to why the particular person is being called in. I would like to refer to another part of the legislation which fills me with some qualms. A protection against self-incrimination is set out in clause 14, but I notice that it does not include what we know as derivative use immunity. Presumably that is because a Bill is coming forward tomorrow to abolish derivative use immunity in relation to Australian domestic law and there is harmonisation. I must say th-t I have severe qualms about that and I will elaborate on them tomorrow. The privilege against self-incrimination is an old and an ancient one. When we whittle down the privilege against self-incrimination, as is proposed in a Bill to be debated ,tomorrow and as is in this particular BIll, we sho-ld do so only with extreme caution and great care. Parliament is here to consider always the right.'l of the citizen. The rights of an individual-ancient, historical rightsinclude a privilege against self-incrimination. The rights of individuals also include the right to be protected against corporate fraud. That is why it is such a tricky balance to strike. Rights cut both ways in a question like this. It is up to the Parliament to balance those rights. We will be debating those issues tomorrow and I will save my powder, as it were for' tomorrow to discuss that in more detaiL I wish to raise that particularly in relation to clause 14. I think it is necessary for Australian business regulators to cooperate with foreign business regulators. It is necessary to have a system in which that can be done where rights are protected. It is necessary to show good faith if we are, in tum, to receive good faith from foreign regulators. If I have an overall criticism of this Bill, it is that I consider the procedure to be rather cumbersome. It is at least a two-stage process. First of all, a Commonwealth business regulator has to go through matters and then the Attorney-General has to go through matters as well. I know that the Attorney General will be able to apply considerations that the Commonwealth business regulator would not, considerations such as the national interest. But it is cumbersome and I wonder whether it reflects a tension in our general business regulation areas, that is, the tension between where the line for the agency stops and where the responsibility for the Department starts. In this case, both the regulatory agency and the Department are involved. Some duplication will be involved and I think it may cause some diverting of resources, as it were, in the - ttorney­ General's Department to look at thIS, but we will have to monitor as time goes on. On the whole, the Bill has much to commend it. The Opposition will support it. We raise these matters in the debate as matters to be looked at. Some will have to be looked at in the ongoing evaluation as to whether the machinery works. I do not think anybody should be wedded to this particular machinery for ever. I do not think the Attorney-General is. It is a stalt. It is something that will have to be reviewed. I will reiterate that, regardless of putting in place this machinery, it seems to me that if we are to secure cooperation from foreign regulators, we have to continue to pursue on a bilateral basis memorandums of understanding, and I hope they are pursued with all the vigour that can be mustered from the Attorney-General's Department and the other departments concerned.  say at the outset that I welcome the comments of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the Opposition's support for the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill. May I say that I find some commonality with the honourable member on his views about the need to monitor continually the machinery of this process in the future. The Bill is, of course, a necessary and sensible move towards international of cooperation and assistance in administering and enforcing foreign business laws. The global business structure is continuing transmute with the increasing irrelevance of geographical and political boundaries. As that internationalisation of the financial markets counterparts. proceeds, the possibility of undesirable market practices swells and casts an unsavoury shadow over the integrity of markets. If effectiveness of the changes is to be mainwhich tained and community confidence inspired, governments must allow global cooperation with information sharing as a priority. It is longer a viable alternative to stick our heads in the sand of the past. As the Opposition already acknowledged in this instance, it does not believe that we can do so either. The object of this Bill is to enable Commonwealth regulators to render assistance to foreign regulators in their administration or enforcement of business laws by obtaining from persons relevant information, documents and evidence and transmitting such information and evidence and copies of such documents to foreign regulators. Mutual assistance is an important aspect in the internationalisation process which this nation is undertaking. If we are to attain this Government's goal of being an internationally competitive country that continues to strive for world best performance and provides equal opportunity for all citizens, we must all be willing to cooperate and mutually support our international colleagues in their endeavours. By encouraging this outward looking orientation we will be moving towards a more competitive and efficient economy which will benefit our nation. The deregulation of the financial markets, like any newborn, has, of course, gone through some faltering steps before it has gained its balance and contributed greater productivity and competitiveness to our economy. If this momentum is to be maintained, there must be a move towards a cooperative relationship which is embedded in the mechanism of the regulatory institutions. This can be obtained through the legislative process. Importantly, the objective mutual assistance and business regulation can be obtained without significant financial impact. Existing resources of the Australian to agencies will be used, with any additional costs being adequately offset by the advantage of reciprocal assistance from their overseas One of the main agencies which will be involved in this information sharing process the is the Australian Securities Commission, was set up by this Government for the regulation of companies and of the securities and futures markets in Australia. The Comno mission was designed as part of the overall strategy to meet the needs of the Australian has economy in the 1990s and, in particular, it provides public accountability, legislative responsibility and administrative responsibility. The benefits of such a commission are, in the light of this Bill, worth reflecting on for a moment: a single substantive law for all matters governing corporate, futures and securities activities; accountability to a single Minister and Parliament; uniformity of administration through a single administrative unit with Australia-wide coverage; and a uniform administrative law regime. This is just one of the policy initiatives this Government has introduced, and the Bill before us tonight can be seen in that light. The Commission, like its international counterparts, focuses on reinstating certainty in the domestic markets and regaining confidence in the international arena. Confidence is a vital component in the internationalisation process. If confidence is to be maintained it is necessary to promote an uncompromised market. Undesirables must be kept out of the market and, due to the interdependent nature of an internationalised system, it is important to inform and be informed of any possible dangers to that integrity of the market. At present, information sharing exists under voluntary ad hoc arrangements but there is a need to enhance the level of assistance between agencies by developing the right legal structures so as to provide a capacity for those various agencies to gather compulsory information on behalf of another agency in the appropriate case. The need for this mutual cooperation has been heralded internationally. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions in recognition of the impact of internationalisation on the enforcement of domestic securities and futures laws adopted a resolution as far back as 1986 calling for its member organisations to provide reciprocal assistance in obtaining information in respect of market oversight and prevention of fraud. This view was supported by the final communique of the Commonwealth law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, and by the OECD. In Auckland the meeting noted that the voluntary cooperation needed to be reinforced by legislative provisions. The OECD believed that information sharing would meet the need for ensuring appropriate regulation of financial conglomerates. Consequently, the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill represents an acknowledgment of and response to the internationally foreseen need for legislated reciprocal assistance between the world's regulatory agencies. Opposition to these progressive proposals may arise as to the problem of protecting pefsons providing assistance and privacy considerations. However, safeguards have been put in place to ensure propriety in obtaining information, and of course it is incumbent upon us all to continually monitor that. Appearances will be in private with the legislation, under clause 11, limiting the number of persons being present when a person is giving evidence. It states: (a) the person giving the evidence and the person to whom the evidence is given; (b) an approved staff member of the Commonwealth regulator; (c) a representative of the foreign regulator; (d) a person whose presence is requested by the person giving the evidencefor example, an accountant or legal adviser(e) a person who is entitled to be present under a direction given by the person taking the evidence; and (f) a representative of the person giving evidence. Also, persons giving incriminatory evidence or information, as opposed to documents, will not have that information used against them in criminal proceedings. In addition, foreign agencies will also need to acquiesce to this condition prior to any release of such evidence. However, regulators will not be precluded from making such use of any further information they are able to obtain as a consequence of a person providing evidence under this legislation. In addition, the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, and the Archives Act 1983 will continue to apply to the collection and storage of information by Commonwealth business regulators. The proposed scheme will be flexible enough to accommodate the various regulatory schemes which operate overseas. It will be able to take account of the different structures and the varying types of agencies involved in the business regulation, ranging from overseas jurisdictions having regulatory commissions with policing functions to those jurisdictions where the regulatory system is based on a concept of self-regulation. In particular, because of the need to act quickly in a fast moving market system, the scheme is designed to ensure that assistance can be provided quickly and with a minimum of procedural formalities appropriate to the circumstances of a particular request. The legislation has been designed to give optimum benefits with minimal financial impact in an administratively simple and flexible regime for collecting the information. The merit of this legislation is also enhanced by the safeguards which have been introduced to protect persons giving evidence from selfincrimination and will preserve legal professional privilege as well as allowing legal representation. This Government is trying to approach the need for economic and regulatory reforms to promote an international level of efficiency and competitiveness in a systematic and complementary manner. This present legislation will complement the scheme for assistance in criminal matters which is embodied in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The legislation will allow our regulatory agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to operate more effectively and have a greater capacity to protect our markets and foreign markets from fraud and allegations of disrepute. The benefits of this Bill are self-evident. Not only does it strengthen the integrity of Australia's financial system but it enhances the integrity of both our own and the international financial market. It is an integral in the Government's overall plan to rationalise the collection and sharing of information and evidence and to promote our willingness to cooperate with our international colleagues. In closing, I encourage the House to support the Bill and, in doing so, to help move Australia closer to its place in the international market.",57
243,Mr DUFFY,MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS,"Firstly, I thank the honourable  contribution to the debate. It is an area in which he shows a considerable interest. He outlined the objects behind the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill and what it is going to do in some detail. I thank him for his interest in this area. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) also made a constructive contribution, with a couple of bleeps, one being in relation to what I think we would refer to as the two-stage process, that is, the role of the regulatory agency and the role of the Attorney-General. Just at the end of the honourable member's contribution, and I think this is worth touching on, he somehow seemed to see that as reflecting in some way the tensions between the Attorney-General's Department and/or the Attorney-General and the regulator. That is something that I think is wonying the honourable member for Higgins. I can only say to him that there is not that tension that he refers to from time to time. Sometimes these things can become a bit obsessional. I think it is worth mentioning that there is not that intention, and it is certainly not the reason-irrespective of what the honourable member for Higgins may think-why the legislation is framed in this way. This is not the first time that criticism has been made in the sense of the way the Bill is structured. It has been said, for example, that criticism can be directed at the Bill primarily on the ground that it is overly restrictive, and especially that the regime it establishes will not be acceptable to some overseas agencies such as, in particular, the step United States Securities Exchange Commission. That criticism went along the lines that, because there was a two-stage process in that both-as the honourable member for Higgins indicated-the ASC and the Attorney-General have a role in deciding whether the request for assistance should be granted, the process was too slow and complex. I do not think that happens at all. In fact, the ASCs role quite clearly relates very specifically to operational matters. The request would be made in the first instance to the regulatory agency, and that agency would assess the request having regard to a number of factors. It would take into account the cost of the collection of the information and the likelihood of the country requesting it acceding to a similar request from an Australian agency. Quite clearly, those matters that are taken into account by the agency are operational. It is not a matter of doubling up in the sense that seems to be a concern to the honourable member for Higgins, because when it gets to the Attorney-General for consideration there are a number of broader issues which have to be taken into account as to whether or not request should be accepted-whether accepting the request would be consistent with international law, whether it is in the interthought national interest to comply with the request, and whether the information might, for example, be used to punish or harm a person because of race, religion, sex, political opinions or matters of that nature. So I do not think the two-step approach provides a mechanism which makes the process too slow or too complex. It does not, because it does not represent any doubling up. They are two separate issues. The Australian agency considers matters from a practical operational perspective, whilst the Attorney General's consideration would be based on broader issues which have that broader international perspective which I touched on earlier. It is also worth mentioning that the other point raised by the honourable member for Higgins was the question of the circumstance where, if in the past information had been provided to an overseas agency and that overseas agency had given undertakings that it would comply with certain conditions in respect of the supply of the information and did not, then that should be taken into account in respect of any subsequent request. The honourable member for Higgins referred to his concern that that was not spelt out in section 22. I take that point, but I mention the honourable member for Higgins that I think quite clearly that would be part-as anticipated the answer-of the second phase of the process, that is, the consideration the Attorney-General, because when the ber Attorney-General in that second stage takes into account any other matters that he or she thinks relevant in deciding whether to accede to a request, I think that that would certainly be a matter that would have to be taken into account if there was a record. Mr Costello-Why not spell it out?",62
244,Mr DUFFY,MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS,"I take that point. I acknowledge that maybe it should be spelt out. But I must say that I thought it was pretty clear, in the sense that I took the view, in looking at this Bill in the very early days, that that was one of the matters which imthe mediately occur to a person-that, if conditions are not complied with, what would happen in those circumstances. I would have that would be at the top of the list of the matters that an Attorney-General would and, in my view, should take into account in these circumstances. I take the point, however, that the honourable member thinks that it should be more explicitly spelt out. Finally, in respect of the interrelationship between this Bill and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, it is intended to complement the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, which I think is the point that was made by the honourable member for Higgins. That said, however, I suppose the legislative framework established by this Bill is flexible enough to recognise that a foreign regulator may not be able, at the outset, to identify where the investigation will ultimately lead. On one of the points, of course, made by the honourable member for Barton, the Bill restricts only the use of self-incriminating evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings. What the honourable member was saying about this being the civil side of the equation is, of course, correct. The other matter which the honourable there member for Higgins touched on was the question of self-incrimination in section 14 or, to more particularly, the issue of derivative use immunity, which is a matter to be debated in he this House tomorrow. I do not propose to say any more about that now other than to say by that the point made by the honourable memfor Higgins is, of course, correct; it is a very difficult balancing act between the rights of people to be protected and the rights that people have in relation to matters such as self-incrimination. That is a matter which, it being 6.15 tonight, we will leave to another day. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duffy) read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.",63
245,Mr SMITH,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill will be supported by the coalition. It is an omnibus Bill from the Department of Transport and Communications and it contains some amendments to the Air Navigation Act, to which the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Ju11) will speak after dinner, the Broadcasting Act and the Radio Licence Fees Act. I wanted to take the opportunity before dinner to make some remarks about the Bill and also some broader remarks about the radio industry. This Bill, in respect of the Broadcasting Act, together with other amendments, makes it possible to ensure that licensees of nonmetropolitan AM and commercial radio licence services who have PM translators will be able to apply under the Act for conversion to FM. My colleagues will know that there has been a great deal of concern in nonmetropolitan Australia to see that PM services are made available in country areas. This Bill attempts to fix up an oversight in the original Act. The second change relates to the radio licence fees, to remove an anomaly within the Act and the new complicated licence arrangements so that the full benefit of an earlier change proposed by the Government and supported by the Opposition where there is a reduction in licence fees c-llected from the radio industry will flow to those it is intended to benefit. In 1991-92 some $8m in reduced licence fees will flow to the industry. It has to be said that the reason the Government has had to address the problems in the radio industry is that the radio industry is now in the worse position it has ever been in. Those people who might be driving home tonight and listening to their radio stations, whether they be commercial or otherwise, ought to know that at least in the commercial area the revenues that have been enjoyed by radio stations-particularly the smaller rural radio stations-have been under severe stress and that some of them have gone out of business altogether. That, of course, has major impacts in regional areas-lack of localism, and so on. There was certainly a desperate need for the Government to respond to the difficulties in the radio industry. That is why we support these minor amendments and why we supported the earlier Bill when the Government presented it to the Parliament. Indeed, on that occasion I welcomed it as the shadow Minister for communications. There is great change taking place in the radio industry. That was brought home to those of us who watched this industry closely through the Australian delegation to the world radio conference in Spain, which returned about a week ago. Some major changes took place on that occasion. That conference went on for over a month and we learnt that a whole new technology will be available called DAB-digital audio broadcasting-and that will include the possibility of cleaning up all this confusion between AM and FM. We will see a dramatic change in the provision of services to regional and metropolitan Australia. As I have said on other occasions, we have to look to a new legislative regime to give effect to these dramatic changes which are being forced on us by technology. This is happening at a time when the financial returns from those in the radio industry are at historically low levels. That, of course, is of great concern to all of us. I think those who were involved in the Australian delegation deserve credit. I have not had a full briefing from the Department yet, although the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, assures me that that briefing will be forthcoming. In the reports that I have read it is quite clear that Australia did have a major victory in the very complicated area of spectrum management. We have to use spectrum in common with the rest of the world. We have a whole range of new services. DAB is one that I have talked about and mobile phones is another. What are known as LEOS, low-earth orbiting satellites, will be available, which will provide a whole new range of services. We have had some major victories. People such as the Indians and the Indonesians have supported us in trying to get a world regime conducive to the development of these new services. That is particularly important for Australia, because a country of our size with a sparse population, relatively speaking, spread over such a large area needs to maximise to every extent possible the best utilisation of those communication services. The Parliamentary Secretary at the table hosted a conference only last week in Darwin about remote area communications, which, unfortunately, I could not go to. He being from the Northern Territory and I being from Tasmania and having served in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, we appreciate the importance of utilising technologies to their best advantage. So what we are searching for in this Parliament is a legislative regime to give effect to these opportunities. I think we also need to be careful about understanding the difficulties that we have in the current regime; it is old and outdated and it has caused a great deal of frustration for many people around the country. I came into possession of a letter addressed to the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal dated 6 March and signed by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) in regard to a licensee in the Richmond area relating to a station called 2LM, which apparently is in Lismore. This is a letter asking the Tribunal to entertain a supplementary licence, at the same time ,as it is dealing with a licence for a 'new independent FM station in the Lismore region. Admittedly, Senator Richardson is the new Minister, but the interesting fact that emerges from his letter is that this independent inquiry from the ABT has been going for four years. There is an AM station in that area, and applications by two competing consortia for independent FM have been going on for four years. Now the Minister has intervened and said to the Tribunal, 'We would like you to join to that independent assessment an application for the existing AM station to have a supplementary FM'. I think that shows us that we have got ourselves into a mess. One can be critical about this, and I guess I have been critical on a number of occasions, but there is a growing recognition that we have to address this problem, because people are being denied FM radio. The policy that we have pursued in this country has meant that a 40-year-old technology has not been made available to many areas in regional Australia. Now we know from the conference in Spain that a new technology is emerging, which means that we are almost going to jump a technology that the rest of the world has enjoyed. I think our approach in radio policy has not only visited a financial disaster upon the industry but also put in place a regime that has not given to the consumer, who after all is the person we want to serve, the opportunity to enjoy even the technologies that are now available. I think the Minister has a major task in front of him to address those problems quickly. Another aspect of the administration of this area is the level of fees, which I raise by way of example to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, who I know is very diligent in these matters. We are talking in this Bill and in the licence fees Act about a reduction in fees. I received a letter today from a small company called Expamet Pty Ltd of Revesby in New South Wales. Interestingly, it is in the district of Bankstown, which is in the centre of the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I will read the point this small company makes and then get to the nub of the issue, from its point of view. The letter says: This company has been struggling to maintain employment for the 77 people still employed here. Before the recession we just had to have, and despite promises from Mr Keating that the Bankstown district would recover from recession last year, we find that business continues to be difficult to obtain and that profit is rapidly declining. That is true of many companies and small manifest businesses right around the nation. That is something the Parliamentary Secretary at table ought to be regretting. The Prime Minister says that he does, but it seems to somewhat of a hollow claim when he was one who designed the problems that these people face. According to the letter, the nub of the for this company is this: An $800.00 licence fee to cover two walkie talkies and a base walkie talkie, used by our factory despatch and maintenance personnel so that they are in touch with the office gives these mobile stations a status way above reality. The interesting postscript at the bottom of the letter gives it all away. It says: Daily operational time for our 'mobile station' would be ten minutes or less. An amount of $800-plus is paid to the time. Department each year for the two walkietalkies for 10 minutes use a day. It would seem to me that, if we are reviewing the licence fees for radio, perhaps we ought to look at the licence fees for this type of tivity. I think it would be only fair to do so, given that there has been a dramatic change in the technologies that are available. Industry policy and the policies that we are putting forward in this Parliament in Fightback package are all about lowering the input costs to business and saying to businesses that we will address their concerns by taking away payroll tax, allowing them to provide for better labour contracts, and looking at and abolishing the wholesale sales tax range. But we also need to look at the demands that government is placing on place businesses, for example, by the collection data for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, much of which we need, but all of that is done, unpaid, by small business. Here have another example in the communications area of what can only be described as a very heavy impost. Finally, I will take a minute to mention the Broadcasting Act and the changes that are made to it, relating to recent decisions that the ABT has made in relation to children's programming. Admittedly, that does not itself in the radio area, but it certainly does in television. It is not appropriate to the enter into a full debate now about those issues, but I make the point-and I think the be Parliamentary Secretary at the table would the agree-that we are about to enter into a consideration of the broadcasting services Bill, which is in draft form and available for issue community discussion. In the broadcasting area there has not been a more important Bill which has gone to the community for discussion, and will finally come to this Parliament, for 50 years. This will be the first full rewrite of the broadcasting legislation for 50 years. It would ill become either side of the Parliament to take this matter lightly, because we are seeing dramatic changes in technology which are going to impact tremendously on service providers. It will give the opportunity for the consumers to be their own programmers, in We are yet to have the whole debate about pay television and its intricacies and ins and outs. We wait for the Minister, who has just acreturned from overseas, to report to his Cabinet and, finally, to the Parliament. But all of those issues indicate that this is going to be a major change. These matters need to be dealt with sensibly, in an open fashion, and we must make sure that there is opportunity the for full and complete discussion in the broader community. I cannot stress too strongly the major changes that are going to be proposed. There by will be arguments about them, as there need to be, because out of arguments we will get a better Bill. The major changes that will take will require a lot of discussion. Tomorof row or the next day I will be releasing a discussion paper to all my colleagues to draw to their attention the significance of what is we being proposed. What we do here over the next six months will determine the legislative framework for how we deal with broadcasting for a very long time to come. Debate interrupted. SEVILLE EXPOSITION: NA",64
246,Mr GRIFFITHS,ATTENDANTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) for allowing me a minute or two to speak and I thank the House for its indulgence. I alert the House to the attendance in the gallery of a relatively large number of Australia's recently selected attendants for the exposition to be conducted in Seville, Spain, in the not too distant future. They were selected from in excess of 2,000 applicants. They have gone through quite a rigorous induction process, part of which is to be conducted over the next few days-part of which was their being brought here to be bored. On behalf of the House, I wish them all well. They have worked very hard to get to this point and I am sure they will provide a great service on behalf of this country.",67
247,Mr SMITH,ATTENDANTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence and the indulgence of the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), I cannot let this opportunity pass without our colleagues in the gallery knowing that they enjoy the full support of both sides of the House. We are all very envious that they are going to Spain and we wish them very well.",67
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ATTENDANTS,I am sure all honourable members wish our attendants in Spain every success. I am sure they will make excellent ambassadors for our country.,67
249,Unknown,ATTENDANTS,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed.,67
250,Mr HOLLIS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to take part in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I think it is correct to thank the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), for his contribution and to note that the Opposition supports the amendments to this Bill. It is difficult to see how the amendments could be opposed because they are basically of a housekeeping nature and they do not involve any significant policy changes. Some amendments are made to the definitions contained in the Broadcasting Act 1942 to ensure that certain AM commercial radio licensees, whose main transmitter is AM but who make some transmissions on an PM translator station, can apply to convert their licences to PM in the same way as other AM licensees. I do not think there could be any objection to that. This will ensure that those licensees do not suffer any disadvantage compared with other AM licensees. The Bill also makes a minor amendment to' clarify a drafting inconsistency between paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 80B(2) of the Broadcasting Act 1942. Part 4 of the Bill amends the Radio Licence Pees Act 1964 to correct a drafting oversight in the Radio Licence Pees Amendment Act 1991. This amendment will reduce by 50 per cent the current licence fee ceiling of 6.5 per cent for licensees with revenues greater than $1Om. Part 4 of the Bill also ensures that the licence fee reductions are applied to two old system licences. Old system licences are not licensed under the Broadcasting Act, but instead are licensed under transitional provisions in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1985. Old system licences require each transmitting facility to be licensed, instead of licensing a service to operate within a service area. As I said before, the amendments to this Bill are basically of a housekeeping nature. The Opposition has said that it does not oppose these and will be supporting them. As we are talking about transport and communications, I would like to expand my comments a little to deal with the transport area in general. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector is critically important to the Australian economy-an inescapable consequence of our nation's size and dispersed population. Equally desirable is the need to develop a more equitable society by increasing national income. The Government's guiding objective is the promotion and development of an integrated, effective and coordinated land transport system which reflects national economic and social priorities; pursues safe and efficient practices responsive to user requirements, with each mode undertaking the transport task to which it is most suited; and is equipped to meet the rapid growth envisaged for the 1990s and beyond. The means of achieving these essential goals is structural adjustment through microeconomic reform. Micro-economic reform aims to accelerate growth in living standards. It also seeks to establish an environment where industry can provide, at competitive prices, the goods and services demanded by Australians and by our trading partners. The task in the transport and communications sector is to improve intermodal choice and the links between modes in order to lower the real cost of transport. This directly benefits industries, exporters and consumers. In the transport area, more efficient railways, for instance, would decrease substantially the annual $4 billion drain by the railways on public sector savings and assist some of Australia's largest exporters. Improved efficiency in road investment and management can increase the returns to the community from the Commonwealth's considerable road funding. The Federal Government has also played a pivotal role in initiating road reforms that can deliver an extra $2 billion a year in national earnings. Working in partnership, the Federal Government, the States and the Territories have embarked on a reform strategy that aims to develop a more effective and responsive national transport sector. The basis of this program is the Government's fourth term policy commitment to structural reform of those industries with the greatest impact on the national economy. The impetus is the very real need for Australia to become competitive internationally. Its specific aim is to increase the economy's resilience and responsiveness by enabling higher growth in productivity, production and employment and real wages, and by easing Australia's susceptibility to changes in demand and fluctuating world commodity prices that can destabilise our balance of payments outlook. The Industry Commission has estimated that land transport reform has the capacity to increase our national income by more than $6 billion. The Government is determined to deliver these benefits to the economy and to all Australians. The changes which this Government has initiated and which are now under way are being pursued in a spirit of cooperation with other levels of government and through the establishment of institutions covering the national transport sector. However, more change is needed and at a faster pace. This is not solely a government responsibility, but one which all areas of the community must share. Australian industries and those sectors serving them need to be more efficient. For example, they could increase the return on public funds through better management practices, through more targeted investment, by lifting productivity and, of course, through the use of new technology. The efficiencies achieved can be passed directly to users in the form of lower prices. While increasing efficiency and improving performance in the transport sector, the Government will also act to safeguard public interest, social justice and safety objectives. The pursuit of a modem, efficient and costeffective transport system across all modes has required the creation of new institutional structures in both road and rail, national in outlook and commercially focused. As a consequence, governments are moving towards a consistent national institutional and regulatory environment which is conducive to structural reform and growth. More transparent cost structures will provide clearer price signals in the marketplace. It follows that goods and services will be valued appropriately. Savings flowing from these changes will contribute to a more equitable society through improved national income. Underpinning this restructuring of the industry is a forward-looking infrastructure development program-the largest of its type undertaken by any government in recent years. The Federal Government and the National Rail Corporation have committed $2.2 billion to mainline rail developments in the years ahead. This Federal Government will spend $4 billion on Australia's national road network in the three financial years to June 1994. The Federal Government's land transport strategy and the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) focus this Commonwealth spending on road and rail projects that reduce transportation costs for industry, speed the flow of goods and produce to ports, or demonstrate a capacity to lift national income through shorter travelling times and greater efficiency gains. Having said all of this, it would be remiss of me, coming from the Illawarra region and representing Port Kembla as I do, not to express some disappointment that no mention was made in the recent statement of the two transport needs in the Illawarra: the MaldonDombarton railway link and the Caloola Pass, a replacement road for Macquarie Pass. The port of Kembla will never reach its full potential as an export development port until we get that very' necessary infrastructure constructed. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very generous in allowing me to range a little widely from the Bill. But, as I said, it is a rather narrow Bill, dealing as it does with the Broadcasting Act 1942. I worked from the basis that, as it was in the area of transport and communications, I could have your laxity to range a little widely from the transport area. There is no great disagreement about this Bill. Basically, it is of a housekeeping nature and the Opposition has indicated its support for it. Quite frankly, I do not see how anyone could oppose it. I commend the Bill to the House.",67
251,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was quite entitled to range a bit. If he thought his terms of reference were narrow on this particular Bill, the section on which I wish to speak tonight, the amendments to the Air Navigation Act, is probably even narrower. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will give me a little leniency. I certainly will not be wandering off the point too much. The amendments to the Act proposed in the legislation relate principally to international aircraft movements in and out of Australian ports and for flights across Australia. It has been quite interesting because up until this time the operations of foreign aircraft have been covered in the Act, while the operation of Australian aircraft flying internationally has been covered by regulation. Basically this amendment ensures that all those aircraft are covered under the Act. There are some related items. All the offences relating to licensed aircraft flying internationally will now be contained in the Act, and there will be an upgrading of penalties for breaches of the Act from the present maximum of $5,000 to a new maximum of $100,000. The Opposition has no problems with that. The provisions of a prison term for serious offences will also be transferred from the regulations into the Act. A proposed new section of the Act, section 13A, will make similar provisions for the operations of scheduled international and non-scheduled charter flights on the same basis as scheduled operations. The only other real change to the operation of the Act is an amendment to section 19, which clarifies that it is an offence for an aircraft flying internationally to, from or across Australia to carry munitions or implements of war except with the written permission of the Minister. There are no new real regulatory powers in this Act, and I notice that the Minister's briefing suggested that there may even be a small saving of money in its implementation. Obviously we would all welcome that. When I first saw this legislation I contacted the people in the Aviation Division of the Department of Transport and Communications who very kindly faxed over to me the regulations and the rules surrounding the licensing of these particular flights. I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is representing the Minister tonight, to something which interests me. Paragraph 1.5.3 of the regulations state: Any proposed flights to or from the following, or involving the carriage of passengers or cargo between Australia and the following, may not be operated without prior approval: a. South Africa b. Taiwan c. Iraq d. Kuwait e. Cambodia f. Libya I ask: is the Government doing anything in respect of the South African flights and, indeed, the expansion of the flights that are coming from Taiwan at the moment? With the way the traffic is building on the Taiwan run and the estimates of the number of flights that will be applied for from Taipei, especially to Brisbane, if the Federal Airports Corporation can ever get its act together and get some gates available for those flights to arrive, it will be very interesting to see whether or not those carriers will have to go through this. I suppose that, in many respEets, this will be the first of a number of Bills that we will be seeing, and a number of amendments to Acts, as the Australian aviation regime goes through some major changes. This Bill is perhaps the first. There is no doubt that the announcement made by the Government in the One Australia policy, and indeed the policy changes that the Opposition has been promoting for nearly two years, will require a total overhaul of the way we see the operations of international aircraft in and out of Australia. We might have some requirements to make changes to these operations sooner than we think. The revolution in international aviation policy in Australia probably should have begun 11 or 12 years ago. I believe that we have already paid a price for our closed minds and our protectionist attitudes. For decades successive governments, including this Government, have argued that what was good for the national carrier was good for Australia. That attitude was wrong and we have paid the price. While we congratulate ourselves about the strides that we have made in attracting international tourists, for example, to this country over the past 10 years, in hindsight our performance in many ways has been quite pathetic. We still only have 0.5 per cent of the world international tourism market. We can compare that with a place such as Singapore, which has twice the international visitors than we do, or Thailand, which will expect about four times the number of international visitors that we get this year. I think one of the major points that should be made about what has happened in South East Asia, and one of the things that we should highlight, is the fact that we have not been part of that particular action over the last decade. We are operating in the most liberal and vigorous international airline regime in the world. If honourable members want to see what a liberal aviation regime can do, they should have a look at Singapore or have a look at Thailand. It is not about selling our sovereignty; it is about a liberal aviation regime, and we have got lots to learn from that. There is no doubt that competition and efficiency have brought our Asian neighbours great riches, and it is not without significance that the Asian airline carriers are amongst some of the most profitable in the world. But that is history. I am glad to see that the Government is making some tentative moves for a major evolution of Australian international aviation over these next few years. Australia could well be forced into a different situation, too, with what happens in the forthcoming aviation regime of the European Community, which we expect to see at the end of this year. We have already seen the emergence of US mega-carriers; we see attitudes that are still evolving in Asia; and we have seen the marrying up of international carriers into strategic alliances. All those things should be ringing warning bells to Australian carriers who have the chance of really becoming quite small fry in the international aviation regime unless we get our attitudes and our rules and regulations right. I would argue, for example, that the first thing we should be doing is getting a lean, mean, well financed 100 per cent privately owned Qantas that can get out there and compete in this international market. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of dual designators operating for Australia in the international markets. That will produce some international competition, provided all the bilateral arrangements can be changed to accommodate this situation. The other question we have really got to start asking in this country is: how long are we going to have the present bilateral arrangements? It would be my suggestion that we could well see the whole of the bilateral international aviation regime fall over within five years. The EC situation at the end of this year could be the start of it. I have no doubt that, if we see an aviation trading bloc starting in the EC, the North Americans will respond. There is talk about a common market at the end of this year between Canada, the United States and Mexico. If that happens, I am sure Japan can look after itself. We will see the ASEAN countries forming their own trade bloc, and what will be left? It will be Australia, New Zealand and a few Pacific islands, if we are not careful, and we will be very small fry indeed. Aviation has never been included in the Uruguay Round and we have now got a situation where GATT has asked the International Civil Aviation Organisation to submit some ideas to it for the liberalisation of international air rights. The bilateral framework that resulted from the Bermuda agreement of 1946 has to a great degree been the principal reason for the restrictive establishment of these aviation regimes. It is in its final years of effectiveness and, as I said before, if it lasts another five years I will be very surprised. I make the suggestion that probably the only option Australia has got open at the moment is to start making some tentative moves to become part of that ASEAN aviation complex. That is a fairly radical statement, but because of the things that I have pushed out before, and because of the movement of the world to multinational international air rights, I think it is about time we started looking very closely at equipping Australia for the brave new world, especially with the projected growth of air travel in the region. The World Tourist Organisation, for example, predicts that 120 million Asians will be travelling offshore for their holidays by the year 2000. If Australia could get just 10 per cent of that business we would have trouble handling the traffic. Can we do it with the capacity and the finance we have at the moment? If we look at what has been happening to other major industries, such as banking and insurance, we see that the whole thing is becoming internationalised. My suggestion is that Australia should be looking at doing just that with its aviation markets in the coming years. Such a system would demand the most efficient airline operations from Australians, and the best management of airlines, otherwise I acknowledge that there could be some real losers. Frankly, with the present efficiencies of Asian carriers and a newly structured privatised and well managed Qantas, few of the traditional carriers of the US or, indeed, Europe would be likely to be able to compete in this particular region. On the Australian side it would no.t only be Qantas that would be in the game';-lbut Ansett, Australian and any other carrier that may emerge. While some people may say that this is pie in the sky, I remind the House that Australian entrepreneurs have been very much at the forefront in getting this type of situation into place. I refer particularly to the TNT-Ansett organisation and what it has done with international air freight traffic within Europe. The arrangements that TNT has with a whole host of carriers ranging from Aeroflot through to Malev, the Hungarian carrier, through to the French post office, is an indication of the challenge that is there and of the way the rules are changing. I believe Australia has the capacity to get into that particular market and to do it. Indeed, if we want to be part of Asia, as both leaders and both parties are saying at the moment, maybe aviation is one of the doors that can be opened which could give us some of this access into those Asian markets. I have no doubt that a number of Australian airline operators, if they read this speech, will be screaming blue murder, but the plain facts are that if we are going to exist, expand and really get into this business, we have got to start thinking about it now. For those operators who scream and carry on, may I tell them that six of the world's 10 most profitable airlines are all ASEAN carriers. I would stack that up against the perfonnance of some of the Australian carriers in recent years. If they are worried about over-competition on the Australian run, look at the reality of what has happened within Asia. Seventeen carriers compete between Bangkok and Singapore, 11 compete between Singapore and Hong Kong and five operators ply between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. There is no doubt that there is more traffic there, but there is also no doubt that the competition and the efficiencies that have been brought on by the ASEAN have attracted traffic there. It is an amazing situation if, for example, we look at the services out of Japan, that the biggest carrier on, say, the Japan-Bangkok run is United Airlines. It carries more passengers than either the national carrier of Japan or the national carrier of Thailand. What I am saying is that if we do not get in there and start making our mark, we could well see some of the American mega-carriers getting in there, as they are already on the Japan-Australia run under that old 1949 bilateral and we could miss the boat. Competition, open markets and freedom of the skies have been very good news in Asia. That could be brilliant news here for to Australia. As I say, while the amendments this particular Act are only the very beginning of some of the major changes that I think will probably have to make, I am sure that people of good spirits and open minds would be prepared to look at just how we can into that common ASEAN aviation regime, to lift the shackles of the past and to make sure that we go into that brave new world so that Australia and Australians can get the full benefit of what a liberalised aviation regime can bring.",69
252,Mr SNOW,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I welcome the contribution of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) who is a national authority on tourism and aviation appropriately represents the Opposition on these subjects. I believe he made a very good point when he remarked how aviation has changed over the last few years. While we may condemn organisations such as Compass-and some years ago Solo, Bourke's, XL-for the way in which they have in a sense sacrificed themselves to show how deregulation can work, they have made a great contribution. While it could be said that Compass may have priced itself too low, it is quite evident that it did make it clear that we can have lower prices, and things will never be the same again because of the deregulation which took place. The same could be said of other finns which have initiated action. Quite often the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, has been condemned for his role with Solo and Bourke's, and Sykes has been condemned for his role with XL Petroleum, but in each of those cases they took quite historic initiatives which will be recognised by history as forcing down prices. Whatever else is said about all these organisations, they made that great contribution. Of course, the main aim of Hawke with Solo and with Bourke's was to get some price competition. It was the main aim of Hawke, Keating and the whole of the Federal Cabinet at the time to deregulate the airlines for the benefit of travelling Australians, and it was done. Now we see the Government looking at the potential available for lower prices by allowing overseas carriers carry people and the potential we have for to more efficient transport of people in that domestic passengers will be allowed to travel we on internal legs-for example, Melbourne to Sydney, Melbourne to Perth and Perth to Sydney-and also Qantas will be free to get operate domestically. So these are great moves, great changes that are happening. It took too long to happen, but it has happened and it did so under the present Government. Also, there have been some great boosts to airline tourism by the present Government, particularly through promotion, and that tourism is now linking into regions. In this region alone, many of the three or four million people who have visited this place and have come from overseas to see the building that is here. Tourism is now great news for Australia. It is a major part of our export industry. The advertising through Paul Hogan and the advertising through Greg Norman has assured Australia of more customers on aviation, and it has assured Australia of a greater level of tourism which is going to continue. This is quite obvious. The Bill looks at aviation, and the amendments are not particularly important amendments within the context of policy, but they do make some provisions such as replacing the existing general offence provision with specific offence provisions and penalties. They clarify the provisions relating to international airline licences, permissions and approvals, and they enable regulations to be made providing for on the spot fines for specific offences. They remove the power to prescribe in regulations a term of imprisonment. Other speakers have also referred to the reference in the Bill to the Broadcasting Act, which is again making some minor changes. These are in relation to AM commercial radio licence, non-commercial PM commercial radio licence and other matters relating to the Broadcasting Act 1942. I want to make some points about broadcasting because I believe some extremely important things have happened here again through the actions of the present Government which has made some great strides. In this region alone there have been some extraordinary changes. With respect to the areas served by radio, for Canberra, Queanbeyan, Yass and Yarrowlumla Shire the number of radio stations has increased from six to 11 and the number of television stations has increased from two to five. If we look around the region we can see similar progress. In the city of Shoalhaven the number of television stations has gone up from two to five, and the number of radio stations from one to four. In the Eurobodalla Shire where approximately 16,000 people had only one commercial radio station-no ABC radio station at all in 198384-we now see four radio stations instead of one and we see four television stations instead of two. Bombala Shire had no television at all in 1983-84. Now it has a choice of four television stations. Some people in Bombala could receive one radio station and now all can receive two radio stations. Tallagandah Shire had one television station for some people and for others they could not get television at all. In fact, they looked like losing that television station with aggregation and the move of WIN television to UHF. A lot of people would not agree with Malcolm Muggeridge when he said, 'I have had all my television aerials removed. It is the moral equivalent of a prostate operation.' People were certainly missing their television in that area, but instead of that one television station they now have five. Bega Valley Shire, instead of two television stations, has four, and Cooma-Monaro Shire has gone from two to five television stations. Snowy River Shire had no television stations at all but now they can receive four. There are some great things happening in television. The Government is now looking at pay television. It has recognised that the standard of public television will have to be maintained when pay television comes. People will be able to pay for access to television channels which provide music, perhaps; another station may provide drama; another station, sport; another, movies; another, news and current affairs. I am hoping that the ABC will be one of the organisations operating pay television, particularly in news and current affairs. I believe it should be given a go at that. I am worried, though, about the prospect of a funding cut of $IOm proposed by the Opposition because I believe this could well affect rural programs. It could well affect services in areas like Bega and Cooma. It could well affect the local news on Canberra radio stations. It could well affect important activities of the ABC such as its university courses. Let us not go backwards; let us continue the big changes that have already taken place. Particularly let us not go backwards in radio and television services. Let us not have, as exists in the United States, a situation where all sorts of people are able to get radio licences. One sees congestion and confusion there. I can recall seeing one television show which was broadcast from a backyard studio operated by Mqm and Dad; Mum operated the camera while Dad read the news. It was not of a particularly high standard, but there was not much competition. On the commercial stations in the US there is certainly not the range and choice that we have with the ABC and SBS here in Australia. We do not want that dreadful choice which is given to people if they are not prepared to pay for pay television. We need to keep our SBS and ABC services strong. That is particularly important. We do not want the changes that have happened in the United States with regard to the deregulation of airlines. We do not want the accident rate or the safety problems that have occurred in the United States. We need to maintain our safety standards at the same time as we deregulate. Important things are happening in aviation and broadcasting. These amendments are relatively minor amendments, but I welcome the opportunity of complimenting the Government on the way it has moved to reform both aviation and broadcasting.",72
253,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am happy to support my colleagues the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) in the debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill and also to join with the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in his thoughtful contribution. I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro very succinctly summed up some of the issues that arise for an electorate such as his with the need to provide adequate broadcasting services. One of the issues to which certainly colleagues on my side of the House constantly refer is the need to try to provide better services for people in country areas, and certainly for people in remote areas. The whole strategy in recent times has been to improve those services, and I support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in his remarks about Government reforms of broadcasting. The Government has tried to offer a wider choice. Certainly the ABC has played a significant role in setting standards of broadcasting. Whenever one moves beyond capital cities one is conscious that the ABC becomes very significant in broadcasting. I know the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is constantly aware of that so far as his constituents are concerned. I think these are very important elements. One of the particular concerns I have in relation to this Transport and Communications Bill regarding broadcasting also relates to some particular areas of television. One of the issues raised in recent times has been the move by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to reclassify children's programs. I am pleased to say it has now got sense. Quite frankly, it made a mistake in its approach to the classification of children's programs. Here I refer to the move on the Fat Cat and Friends and Humphrey B. Bear programs. The Broadcasting Tribunal took an attitude towards those programs which meant that Fat Cat would not qualify under the Australian content requirements. It was of concern to many people in the community that these relatively harmless programs were being denied airplay. I ought to be absolutely accurate here. It was not that the Tribunal said that Fat Cat could not be put on air; it was quite simply that it would not qualify for points under the Australian content requirements. So from that point of view I think that the Tribunal saw the error of its ways and said, 'We will leave it to the television stations to undertake their own classifications'. I think that is a more sensible outcome. Children were being denied access to programs which in many senses were relatively harmless. I make the point, and I think it is significant in terms of this legislation, that neither of those programs was particularly insidious in respect of their injection of commercial content. I do have a specific concern about a program on Channel 10 called Studs, which, quite frankly, ought not be on air at that time of day. I say that not because I am a prude but because I doubt whether it qualifies for being put on television at all. It is degrading to women, and I say that very strongly. Mr Snow-Hear, hear! It is.",74
254,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"In fact, it becomes a commercial meat market. As my colleague alongside me recognises, it is degrading to women, and the fact that it emanates from the United States gives it even less appeal. It does not even provide employment for Australians in its production. It is particularly poor television and 1 object to its being shown in prime time. Given the Broadcasting Tribunal's attitude towards children's programming-and it has seen the error of its ways-I wonder why it continues to allow a program like Studs to be on air at prime time. I have raised the issue with the Broadcasting Tribunal, and 1 would hope it will see the error of its ways.",74
255,Mr LLOYD,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,Fat Cat would be far safer.,75
256,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I think it would be far safer in prime time, quite frankly. The point 1 want to make is that it is very difficult in this Parliament, within our regulatory framework, to be adopting a deregulatory posture in relation to television stations if then, as a consequence of that, the deregulatory environment is abused by putting on air programs like Studs, which really cannot be defended. 1 repeat: it is demeaning to women; it is a commercial meat market on television. In fact, we ought not have it on television. When 1 contacted the Tribunal I was asked whether I was also concerned about a program called Chances. I have not seen that program, although my constituents have raised this matter with me. It seems to me it is probably one of those rather voyeuristic programs. The general drift of television does concern me. Firstly, tllere is the program called Studs, which 1 referred to; secondly, there is the question of the deregulatory environment for advertising. I think that deregulatory environment failed. 1 will guarantee that if there good quality movie on, and I am sure people agree with this, as the movie nears its end the viewer is deluged with advertisements. The television channels cynically play the viewer along and, just as the viewer thinks, '1 had better watch the end of this movie. It only runs for two hours, and I have been sitting here for 31/2 hours already', the television station cynically adds more and more advertisements to try to milk as much revenue as it can. 1 think that is a disgrace. Television stations are simply abusing their position. 1 strongly object to viewers being subjected to that. The Tribunal has seen that that has been a failure and has recognised that we should be going towards a model in which a limit is placed on the number of advertisements shown per hour. Another matter that has been of concern to me for quite some time is ratings. If one was to stop anyone in the street and ask, 'Can you tell when the ratings are on TV?', the answer would be, 'Of course 1 can'. All the good programs are on in the ratings period. The rest of the time there are B-quality programs on. What other commercial organisation could afford to put two quality products on the market? Clearly they only put their A-grade product on the market when the market is being tested; the rest of the time they put a secondary product on. Mr Downer-They have random ratings now.",75
257,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"l hear the honourable member for Mayo. The important thing is that this new electronic rating system has improved things. The situation used to be quite farcical in the past. In the summer period there were only repeats and so on because it was not a ratings period. The electronic rating system has improved the situation, and 1 think the viewer is getting a better deal. But it was something that needed to be addressed. For 26 weeks or perhaps even longer-for 32 weeks of the yearviewers were getting good quality programs but for the rest of the year they were being subjected to repeats and B-grade television. All of us in this place must recognise that we owe a responsibility to our communities is a in terms of the quality of programs being broadcast by television stations. 1I have a specific concern about a program called Studs shown in prime time by Channel 10. Frankly, I think that is a program that ought not to be shown, and 1I have complained to the Broadcasting Tribunal about it. I believe that there are other programs that need to be examined for their suitability for television. My third pqint relates to the abuse by television stations in terms of the amount of advertisements they show. The types of advertisements now appearing on television have also been raised with me. In particular, some women are concerned about the advertising of women's hygiene products on television. Frankly, I doubt that those products ought to be advertised on television at the times they are. My final concern is the level of violence on television. I am assisted here by a report by the Broadcasting Tribunal on violence on television. The report says quite clearly that there is considerable concern amongst people in the community about violence. If we do a breakdown in terms of age, education, religious affiliation, family status and so on we see a very real concern about violence on television among many people in the general population as well as among those who were specifically surveyed. I think that much of the violence is contained in American produced programs. I object to that. Quite frankly, it is sometimes quite a joy to watch Australian or British produced programs, which can be quite as dramatic as the American programs but which one can view with a sense of relief because no-one gets shot or beaten up. I feel that the salacious violence injected into Australian viewing by American produced television programs is quite unhealthy. In this respect I am at one with many people in the community, who find that violence quite unnecessary. To use an example, the British produced program The Bill very rarely has violent scenes because the British producers know their game well enough to realise that one can create enough tension and enough drama without having to enact violence. Again, I refer to what I would regard as a magnificent piece of television produced by the ABC called Phoenix. There was one significant violent act in that series when a car was blown up and a policeman and a policewoman were killed. But it has not been felt necessary to inject violence into that program every week. Why is that? Because the producers know their job. Why is it that we so often have to be affronted by American produced programs displaying violence? It is rather interesting to do a body count during the programs to see how many people are murdered. From my point of view and my family's point of view and, significantly, from the point of view of the community at large, there is a considerable rejection of violence on television. I believe we owe it to our communities to look at the program classification system and at the amount of violence which is injected into our television viewing. In the past in Australia we would not have been regarded as a violent society. We were regarded as a vigorous and very competitive society, but not by nature a violent one. I do not believe that we should allow this injection of violence through the medium of television, and largely American produced television, to corrupt our standards in terms of what we regard as a healthy society. It is interesting to talk to children in schools. One can ask them their views on how we should deal with crime. The number of children who respond by saying that you shoot the baddies is rather alarming. In other words, their perception of justice, developed from seeing American produced television programs, is that, if someone is bad, ipso facto, one shoots them. If that is the way that we are developing children's attitudes in terms of violence on television, I believe that we are making a grave mistake. We ought not to wonder when that violence is replicated on the streets of our cities-which, of course, it is. That brings us back to the role of violence on television. I have found the Broadcasting Tribunal research very useful because it reveals the concern of people about violence in the community at large and violence on television. I believe that it is up to our television executives to consider whether they are putting sufficient constraints on violence on television. There is an issue that comes up frequently in my discussions with people. Often movies with an Adults Only classification that are shown late in the evening are promoted-with significant violent extracts-in prime time when children are watching television. We have to ask ourselves whether the television stations are getting around the requirements of the Act and whether they are ignoring the standards that ought to be set for the community. Some television stations argue that stills of violent actions are different from movies of violent action, However, I think the issue that has to be addressed is whether our community accepts that we should have as much violence sho'Yll on television as we do. The answer that comes across in this report, entitled Sex, J!!oien,ce and Offensive Language, is that the VIew ill the community is that there is too much violence. There is a concern about the frequency of bad language on television. There is also a concern about the number of sex scenes on television. Again, I do not say this from the point of view of being somewhat sheltered in relation to what television does, but because television is a very powerful medium that is viewed in many homes in Australia. My concern is, therefore, in two areas. One of my concerns relates to the demeaning of people, in particular women. I refer to programs such as Studs and to violent programs. Secondly, I believe that television executives have a very significant responsibility to look at the quality of what they are putting before us. If they actually talked to people in the community, quite separate from th-ir ratings-:- whic.h the Broadcasting Tnbunal, to Its credIt, has done in this report-they will find that there is a very real concern about what is shown on television. I have not dealt with another area of real concern, the content of news programs, but I believe that that is a big issue that needs addressed. However, I suggest that people sit down some night with a stopwatch and look at commercial television news to see just how much real news they get. Certainly there is a lot of interchange between the tw- talking heads; there is a lot of chit-chat about what has been happening. But in terms of hard content there is very little. Mr Downer-Murders.",75
258,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"There are stories about murders and cats up trees, and many very short stories. Mr Downer-All up at the front of the news.",77
259,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Yes. I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his interjection, because he is right. We get very low quality stories. Many people in the community tell me, - SBS news tells me what is happening in the world'. The ABC, when it is doing its job properly, has a properly structured news program. I recognise that there are commercial stations which try to do a very good job with their news programs. However, when one is subjected to only about three significant stories and the rest happen to be cats up trees stories, one wonders whether we are being given sufficient news or whether, in fact, as has been discovered in the United States, news has become entertainment. This is now called 'infotainment'. That is an interesting word because news content is reduced and it becomes more entertainment. What the news executives are looking at is not a program with a real news content but something to entertain their viewers. In the end we have to ask ourselves whether, if viewers are not being properly informed, our democratic society is being conducted properly. I respond by saying that I do not believe it is. A proper democratic society requires proper levels of information, not entertainment posing as news. I suggest to many people that they take a stopwatch next time they watch commercial television news and take a note of how much real news they get compared with chit-chat and cats up trees stories, and how many advertisements are shown during the news to be program. If we went into a restaurant and bought a meal that undersold us in the way that commercial television news undersells us, we would wonder whether we would ever go back to that restaurant. However, people are great creatures of habit, and come 6 o'clock at night they tum their television on to a certain station. I accept that, and it is not all bad news. However, if people such as us in this Parliament do not draw the attention of the people at large to these issues we are perhaps not doing our job. I make these comments about television because I believe they are significant in regard to the broadcasting legislation before us. There are issues that people raise with me on a regular basis in relation to their families, in particular their children, and what is being put forward in the form of television programs. I refer again to programs such as Studs which, frankly, demean women and ought not to be on television. I suggest that the 10 network must be in grave financial strife to have to buy a program that is as cheap and hopeless as Studs. As I have said, I have raised that matter with the Broadcasting Tribunal and, to its credit, it is looking at it. But I did so in the context that, rather than its making life difficult for a program such as Fat Cat, I think it should look at Studs, which I think is harmful whereas Fat Cat was harmless.",77
260,Mr LLOYD,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,What about Skippy?,78
261,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I believe the question of Skippy has already been raised by the Premier of Queensland. The honourable member ought not to provoke me, but I am glad that he did. The issue at stake here is that some people in the Broadcasting Tribunal were making decisions about what they thought was fit for us to watch. That is all right. We ought to be looking for better children's television and, frankly, they were trying to do that-although I think they were mistaken. But, in doing so, they were blinkered to some of these other programs that were on television which in fact were harmful to children. That is what excited my interest. What does concern me is that when one asks teachers about how many children watch television programs at night-it is worth doing this-one discovers that many children are watching television as late as 9.30 or 10 p.m. Not only is this bad for the children, but also we have to look at what programs they are viewing. I want to make quick remarks about two radio stations. I particularly want to pay a compliment to the management of a radio station in Perth called Radio 6PR, which is one of the few profitably operating radio stations in Australia at the moment. The managing director, Cheri Gairdner, has done an excellent job in getting that radio station back in the black. I see that it has just signed up a commercial arrangement today with a number of country stations to service that station. I believe that will not only improve their news content but also offer them better commercial positioning in selling products. The other station is interesting because it is Radio 6NR in Perth which is an outgrowth of Curtin University. This station is doing a fantastic job with limited resources in providing services to a wide range of community groups as well as sporting groups which have not been served well in the past. With very limited resources it is doing a wonderful job in providing a service to the community at large. I would like to acknowledge those stations. In closing, I say that I believe this issue of broadcasting is one that has a constant interest for the community. I thank the House for its attention.",78
262,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.51 p.m.)I would like to fhank everyone who contributed to the debate for the passion with which they spoke about this subject, although I must say that not many of them said anything about the legislation. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), has illustrated, a great number of issues in relation to broadcasting attract the attention of this House, not least of which are those which the honourable member mentioned. I will just refer to the legislation which is, after all, what we are debating, although I am not going to mention all the issues which have been canvassed. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 relates to the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964. As I have said, a number of speakers have canvassed a variety of issues, some of which were relevant to the legislation but most of which were not. I would like to thank the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) for his contribution and particularly for his endorsement of the work which has been done by the officers of the radio communications division of the Department of Transport and Communications at the recent WARC conference in Spain. He raised a number of important issues which the communications industry in Australia, and indeed this community, will have to come to terms with in the next few years. He also mentioned that a person had written to him about licence fees, which as far as I can ascertain were not broadcasting licence fees but related to the use of a land mobile radio communications system. Whilst I am not conversant with the particular company which was mentioned, the honourable member said that it was a company which used walkie-talkie sets which cost the company $800 a year for a licence. I cannot really give an answer to that comment without having definite information, apart from saying that $800 is not an unusual amount to pay for licensing a land mobile base station and associated mobile stations. I would be happy to provide for the honourable member's information the licence fee schedule which was brought out in December 1991. This shows, for example, that the licence for a base station in an extra high density location of a major city-and I understand this company is in Revesby-would cost $706 per year and associated mobile stations would cost $47 per year. I will make this schedule available to the honourable member because it might be able to answer the inquiries which have been made. But, as I said, this is not an unusual fee for a land mobile base station. ",78
263,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"It is not that expensive in terms of the industry and what is common in this country. Turning to the other contributions which were made during the second reading debate, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) did not really address himself to the issues pertinent to this legislation, although raised a number of important matters in relation to transport, particularly as it impacted upon his electorate. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr rull), as with the honourable member for Bass, indicated that the Opposition had no problems with the amendments which have been proposed, but he did raise a couple of questions about aviation policy. Whilst it is important that we do debate the question of aviation policy, the honourable member for Fadden talked about open skies, a brave new world of aviation and the need for a sudden upturn in the number of inbound tourists to Australia. I am sure that the honourable member would agree with me that the carefully targeted initiatives announced in the One Nation package will provide much of the stimulus which he refers to and contrast dramatically with the proposals which have been made by the Opposition. _ I just remind the House about some of the broad policy objectives for the aviation industry that came out of the One Nation statement: promotion of Australian interests; facilitating tourism and trade; fair access by Australian airline operators to international domestic markets; competitive policy and industry efficiency-both most relevant to the contribution which was made by the honourable member for Fadden. The Government has taken the view that the international and domestic airline industry will be enhanced by creating an environment which will foster, amongst other things, increased competition and pricing flexibility leading to greater economic efficiency in the airline industry free from unnecessary government controls, increased responsiveness by airlines to consumer needs and the promotion of tourism and trade. The Government's policy will, as I am sure the honourable member knows, encourage greater competition both domestically and internationally and the development of a more robust, integrated and internationally competitive Australian aviation industry. It also builds on the already substantial program of micro-economic reform in the international and domestic aviation industry with benefits he for the crucial areas of international domestic tourism and trade and for the national economy. It recognises that the Australian and New Zealand aviation markets are relatively small and that there could be advantages for consumers in both countries and for the ability of our airlines to compete internationally if the two markets are merged. The policy also allows for the privatisation process for Qantas and Australian Airlines to continue with - eater certainty. It provides scope for greater regional diversity of international flights to and from Australia, as well as scope for the development of Australian designated international carriers based outside Sydney. It ensures that airport infrastructure will not become a barrier to growth in the aviation industry. It encourages a vigorous cost effective regional aviation market by accelerating the final transfer of Commonwealth airports and withdrawal from the ALOP; and it recognises that the Civil Aviation Authority and Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will continue to maintain national safety standards. These sorts of changes have been applauded by the industry. Most informed commentators agree that this is the sort of way in which the aviation industry should be managed into the future. I commend the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the afftrmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",79
264,Mr REITH,MINISTER FOR FINANCE,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that this Aldred, K. J.

I move this censure motion because the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) came into the House this afternoon to correct an answer that he gave during Question Time and in that answer misled the Parliament. Motion (by Mr Snowdon) put: That the honourable member be not further heard. The House divided. [9.04 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Les Scott) Ayes 63 Noes 60 Majority ......... 3 NA Baldwin, P. J.

COARSE GRAINS LEVY BILL 1992 [COGNATE BILL: AYES COARSE GRAINS LEVY (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1992] Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",81
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Coarse Grains Levy Bill NA 1992 concurrently with the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",83
268,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"I want to congratulate the coarse grain growers of Australia and through their representative organisation the Grains Council of Australia on this bringing together of the different coarse grain research and development arrangements for their combined or total industry. That is what these Bills, the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, do; they bring together all of the different coarse grains. At the present time we have barley and triticale within the research and development arrangements. This brings in cereal rye and oats. Others potentially, as I understand it, to come into the system would be grain sorghum and maize. This legislation is part of the standard rural industry research and development arrangement, through the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, that is, the dollar for dollar, industry and Government. arrangement up to a maximum PAIRS of 0.5 of the gross value of production for the particular industry. It is particularly commendable that oats and cereal rye, which are just coming into the scheme, are immediately going to the maximum level that attracts the matching contribution from the Government. Barley and triticale are already there. It is my understanding that they will all go higher than what has been the target set by the Government for what is seen to be a worthwhile pJ: a reasonable contribution on the part of the industry to research programs. I believe this legislation also signifies further development in coarse grains and grain industry research generally. I see it as being in three stages. The first stage was when wheat, alone of the grains, had a research arrangement with the Government. Over a period that was seen to be too narrow; the concentration was on wheat when there was a need for research to develop more appropriate strains of other coarse grain varieties to meet market opportunities and also as required for better fann management practices in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia. Of course, that broader concept of grain crops is not just wheat and coarse grain, but also legumes and oilseed crops. The second stage in this development of research arrangements came with the inclusion cif that broader range of grain varieties in the research arrangements. We are seeing some of that still going on, and that is part of this legislation tonight. In this second stage, yield as well as suitable varieties for different climatic and soil situations were the dominant factors. I believe that grains industry research is now moving into a third stage, where the yield is still important but the market requirements are now having a higher priority than before. There are a number of market opportunities for specially bred coarse grain, oilseeds and legume varieties, particularly in that developing market area for us of Asia and the Middle East. One example of this is barley and beer. The growth in beer consumption in Asia is quite astonishing. It is an acceptable form of alcohol to the governments of those countries and it is one that is available to the mass of people. Barley is needed to produce it, and Australia produces very good barley. But there are particular requirements for special beer markets or types of beer. Whereas we have been very successful with China and its beer requirements, and there have been some good joint venture arrangements between some of the Australian barley marketerssome of the barley boards in Australia-and China, the converse is the situation in Japan, where we appear to be missing out on that country's market for barley because the Canadians have bred varieties more suitable for the particular type of beer that the Japanese prefer. The best example of all of these grains and oilseeds, where there has been special breeding using the latest breeding techniques to develop or change a variety to suit particular markets, is canola. There has been a dramatic increase in canola production at the present time where, through some very clever breeding, as I understand it, the ratio of mono and polyunsaturated fats has been changed and maximised so that that is now a very desirable product for a whole range of end uses. With cereal rye and oats coming into the breeding program for the first time, it is interesting that both of these have special appeal in the health food market. Oats are a low cholesterol breakfast food and rye has been seen to be of beneficial value from a dietary point of view for some time. Cereal rye also has the added advantage that it is perhaps the best crop that can be grown in the lighter sandhill-type soils of the Mallee area of Australia. It plays an important part in soil stabilisation as well as growing a worthwhile crop. The Opposition parties will be supporting this legislation. We acknowledge the progress that is being made with coarse grain research and recognise that there is now a need for more special research to pick up these market opportunities. We particularly congratulate the grain growers of Australia. At a time when they are experiencing their lowest incomes on record-for this financial year, minus $32,000 on a farm business basis, according to ABARE, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics-and the tremendous uncertainties and unfairness of a corrupt world grain trade, these people really are setting an example for the rest of Australia. They are saying that our future lies with research because it is through research that we can get productivity and breed what the market really needs in its particular fonns for different end products and different geographic areas. It is not just wheat that is affected by the corrupt world grain trade. Barley and some others are affected as well, and the price effect of the major grains flows on to the other grains. Therefore, even in this particularly difficult economic time, these growers are prepared not only to meet the standard or the challenge set for them by the Government of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production but also to go beyond it. If the other sectors of Australian business were prepared to make the same sacrifices now for long term gain for the international competitiveness of their industry, Australia would be looking forward to a far better future than would otherwise be the case.",83
269,Mr COURTICE,NOES,"I endorse the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), with regard to research and development. They certainly are correct. I had the privilege yesterday of speaking to some of the representatives of the CSIRO about the importance of research and development for agriculture, which is vital if we are to take a leading edge in the competitive world which we are in. The fact that countries such as the United States and European nations are hiding behind subsidies and corrupt world markets makes it harder for us to do that, whether it is under the EEP program or the policies of the EC. I think it is commendable, as the honourable member for Murray said, that at a time when we see a downturn, particularly in the grains industry, grain growers are prepared to put up money for research and development for the long haul, because the long haul is what it is all about. Over the several decades a lot of people from all walks of life have looked to the short term. It will be a long haul if we are to be competitive and improve production with less input costs. The Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992 incorporates the existing barley and triticale research levies and provides for new levies on oats and cereal rye. The levies will attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. To date, barley and triticale research levies have been imposed under separate Acts which in the main are differentiated only by product specific provisions. The oats and cereal rye levy arrangements will be similar. Consequently, omnibus levy legislation has been developed covering these grains, with provision for other coarse grains to be added by regulation having regard to any recommendation of the relevant grower organisation. The Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988 will be repealed under the related Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992, which includes provisions to ensure continuity of current levy arrangements for these grains. These arrangements are being implemented at the request of the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of coarse grain producers after consultation with other relevant industry bodies, including the Triticale Grain Association of Australia, which is the representative industry body under the Triticale Levy Act 1988. The GCA is currently the representative industry body for barley and has been nominated as such for oats and cereal rye. Other organisations consulted include the Cereal Rye Growers Association and the various State marketing authorities. Levies will be imposed on grains produced in Australia and will not be payable unless the producer delivers or processes the grains. Grain used by the producer for domestic purposes, whether processed or not, will bexempt from the levy. Maximum and operative rates of each levy are specified in the Bill, with provisions for the operative rates to be changed by regulation on the recommendation of the relevant grower last organisation. The maximum rates may be changed only by Parliament amending the Act. The introduction of value based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the GCA reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer. That is only fair. A value based levy has applied to wheat since 1989. Initially, the operative levy rates for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, with provision for these to be increased to a maximum of 5 per cent of the value of the grain. The Bill provides for the method of ascertaining the value of grain for levy purposes to be prescribed in regulations. It is envisaged that the method will parallel that for wheat. By that I mean pool payments or sale price net of handling, storage and transport costs. Further consultations will take place with industry in drafting these regulations. The barley and triticale levies will continue as specific rates, with the operative rates unchanged at $1 per tonne and 75c per tonne respectively. The maximum rate to which these may be increased by regulation is from $2 for triticale and 75c for barley to $5 per tonne for both of these grains. The Government has made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. While the maximum specific rates proposed for barley and triticale, as requested by industry, generate levy revenue above this level, they allow scope for the operative levy rates to be increased in line with increases in the GDP and to fund and expand a research program. Whilst the proposed maximum rates for the value based levies are 10 times higher than the operative rates, they are not excessive compared with that proposed for the specific rate levies. For example, at the maximum rates estimated, levy revenue expressed as a portion of GDP from the value based levies will be lower than that from the specific rate levies. Regulations to be made under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will provide for collection of the levies. Other regulations under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will attach the new levies to the GRDC to enable the corporation to administer the research programs for oats and cereal rye. Additional expenditure resulting from the extension of matching Commonwealth funding to oats and cereal rye will not commence before 1993-94. At the proposed levy rate of 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, matching Commonwealth contributions' for 1993-94 are estimated at approximately $250,000 for oats and $20,000 for cereal rye. The cost to the Budget of Commonwealth matching contributions for the existing barley and triticale schemes is estimated at $3.1m and $90,000 respectively for 1992-93. Similar outlays are expected in 1993-94. The serious drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales is expected by ABARE to restrict Australian coarse grain production to 6.9 million tonnes in 1991-92. Although there has been some damage from the rains we have had-as the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) recognises better than I-I think they will be beneficial in the long term. It is unfortunate that there has been damage and flooding in the short term; but I think that, in the long term, most grain producers will welcome the rain that will certainly recharge the aquifer and put some decent moisture into the subsoil. Whilst unfavourable planting conditions and poor price prospects for wheat have seen the area planted to barley increase frqm 2.5 million to 2.8 million hectares, production is expected to remain at around 4 million tonnes, reflecting drought conditions during the growing season in northern New South Wales and Queensland. Sorghum plantings are also estimated to have increased from 398,000 to 540,000 hectares, primarily as a result of the current Queensland grain shortage. With recent favourable planting conditions in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, production is expected to increase from about 0.9 million tonnes to about L 1 million tonnes. Oat production is also expected to remain at around 1.5 million tonnes and cereal rye will remain at about 15,000 tonnes. With wheat planting severely reduced and rain inadequate for normal early summer crop plantings, feed prices have risen sharply. For example, Brisbane sorghum prices rose from about $123 per tonne in February 1991 to about $195 per tonne in October 1991. The price has since fallen to about $153 per tonne in February 1992 as a result of rising confidence of an assured supply, particularly from southern Queensland. Other increases-based on Sydney retail prices-include oats from $93 per tonne in December 1990 to about $158 per tonne in December 1991; barley from $115 per tonne to $159 per tonne; triticale from $113 per tonne to about $160 per tonne; and maize from $168 per tonne to $199 per tonne. High prices could continue until winter crops are harvested in late 1992. I certainly hope that the prices go up and stay up. It will take quite a long time before many grain producers are able to replace machinery and plant and get back on their feet, but it is certainly a more positive sign than we have seen in the past. High prices have prompted the shipment of grain to Brisbane from southern Statesparticularly barley from South Australia. The reduced availability of grain for export has highlighted the expanding feedlot operations for pigs, poultry and beef. I think tant to recognise that because it is value adding. If we are able to use our grains in feedlots and sell the finished product-the beef-to the Japanese or to the Korean market, then we are really value adding. Rather than selling the grain or the grass-fed beef, it makes more sense to get that actual value added for a commodity which the Asian market wants. Coarse grain export tonnages for the 199192 financial year-estimated at 2.4 million tonnes-are expected to be down by about 19 per cent on the previous year. Barley will certainly be down from 2.9 to 2.1 million tonnes, and sorghum will be down from 220,000 tonnes to almost nothing. They represent the major declines. I recognise, as does the honourable member for Murray, that we are facing one of the lowest farm incomes we have had in many years-certainly in our lifetime. That reflects the state of the world's economy and certainly, as I have said previously, the behaviour of the European countries and the United States. I think all eyes will be on the Dunkel agreement and, hopefully, there will be a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. Unless we can get some sanity into world trade our farmers will always be behind the eight ball because we are so reliant on export markets. It is good to see that on some occasions-' as on this occasion; I will acknowledge it, as I have in the past-there is bipartisan support at a Federal level in regard to trade initiatives. It certainly adds weight to our cause. It is certainly better if we have a unified approach when we take on those large countries. It is interesting to note that 60 per cent of the EEP program in the United States does not go to grain producers; it goes to grain traders. That sort of thing is often missed. I think it demonstrates the inability of the United States Administration to come to grips with the problem. It is certainly living with hangovers from the mid-1930s and some of the Roosevelt programs, which at the time were far-reaching and right in themselves but which are certainly not beneficial for the Western world today and certainly not it is impor- beneficial for us. A point which concerns me and about which I am not able to be bipartisan is the approach to roads and road transport as stated in the Fightback package. On page 58 of the Fightback package it says that over the longer term responsibility for road funding will be transferred to the National Road Transport Commission and roads will be funded through road user chargesMr Lloyd Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Fightback package and road finance have nothing to do with this Bill. It is a fairly narrowly defined Bill, dealing with the coarse grains levy.",85
270,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Truss)Obviously the point of order has some validity. I require the honourable member for Hinkler to direct his remarks to the subject matter of the Bill. Obviously passing references to some things are permissible, but he can hardly speak on road funding when the Bill is dealing with the coarse grains levy.",87
271,Mr COURTICE,NOES,"I am surprised by those comments. Grain can be transported in only two ways: by road or by rail. I am surprised that the Deputy Leader of the National Party would find that there is something incongruous in mentioning road transport and grain, particularly given that the former Premier of Queensland, Mike Ahem, once said that ifi we deregulate the wheat industry- .",87
272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Hinkler! It is true that grain is transported by road and that we are dealing with the coarse grains levy Bills, but I am sure that has nothing whatever to do with road funding. I require the honourable member to speak on matters which are relevant to the Bill.",88
273,Mr COURTICE,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will have a chance to cover those areas this week, so I will not miss that opportunity. But, as I have said, I do find it strange that the transport of grain by road does not have much to do with coarse grains. It certainly does if we want to get it to market. Ports are also involved because we actually export the products from there. In my electorate we have to export through the port of Gladstone; that is a great terminal. The Opposition says in the Fightback package that it will privatise ports. I will not comment any further on that matter during the debate on this Bill because I will speak about it during the debate on the Appropriations Bills. Coarse grains are exported by ship from ports and they are transported by road and rail; so I do find those comments strange. But I appreciate the good humour we have tonight and I will take the gloves off later in the week. I close by saying that it is good to see bipartisan support for this Bill tonight. Certainly, as the honourable member for Murray said, I congratulate the industry on having the vision to support research and development. I think that is vital. The CSIRO plays an important role in that. It is also important that, when we talk about international trade, we do have bipartisan support. It is a pity we do not have it when we come to discuss the welfare of the country.",88
274,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"I have the dubious pleasure, once again, of following the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force. Mr Courtice-Get used to it.",88
275,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"1 do not know whether I will have to get used to it after the next election because I understand that the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force is having a little trouble with his preselection. That might reflect his lack of ability in representing truly the rural people of Australia, which has been clearly demonstrated in the House on many occasions. I tum to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which are before the House, because I do not want to wander from the point as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) did tonight. The purpose of the Bill is to impose a levy on certain coarse grains in order to fund research. It introduces new levies on oats and cereal rye. The existing levies on barley and triticale are to be maintained and all of the levies are to be incorporated in a single Act. The levy revenue will attract matching Commonwealth contributions, and I see that as a very positive point. Further, provision will be made in the Act for other coarse grains to be included if recommended by the relevant grower organisations. I notice that the Bill says that the levy is payable when grain is delivered for processing. However, when grain is used by the producer it will be exempt from the levy. I find this a little hard to follow because, clearly, the farmer who produces these grains and uses them on the farm in order to add value to that grain is gaining a considerable degree from the research funded by other people. We do need to monitor the situation where this levy is to be paid at the level where it is delivered to the processor. However, the people who produce these grains and add value to them on the farms-and in many cases they could be used just for feeding livestock-are not required to pay the levy. I believe we have to monitor the situation very closely to see that a gaping hole does not emerge there that would allow a fairly large leakage of funds that could well be going to research. I would like to declare my interest in this Bill at this point because I happen to be a grower of barley, oats and sorghum. Mr LIoyd-Why not triticale?",88
276,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"The honourable member for Murray asks, 'Why not triticale?'. Triticale does not grow very well in the rich soils of the Maranoa, particularly around Muckadilla. It may grow well in Victoria, but not in the rich soils of the Darling Downs. So I certainly have a vested interest in this Bill. Only last year I sent money to Canberra to the DPIE for research into barley. I am a great supporter of the need for producers to fund their own research, and this should be recognised by goverrunents and they should match the contributions. The levy rate for oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of the value of the grain, but there will be a ceiling placed on that, and that is a maximum of 5 per cent. However, barley and triticale are based on a per tonne basis of 75c per tonne for barley and $1 per tonne for triticale. I must say that as a producer I have always been a great believer in a per tonne levy because that allows the industry to determine more accurately the amount of money that is going to be generated by these levies. I just wonder why the industry has agreed on this occasion to vary the methodology that has been used in the past and has gone to this percentage levy rather than sticking to the per tonne levy. Perhaps the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) may have an answer for that. I have always been a great believer in the per tonne levy. It is a bit like a per head slaughter levy, if you like, or a per head transaction levy. It is much better and people are more able to determine the level of funding on a more predictable basis. The coarse grains comprise feed wheat, triticale, sorghum, feed oats, feed maize and feed barley. Together, coarse grains constitute Australia's second most important crop after wheat. Barley is the principal coarse grain, accounting for approximately 60 per cent of coarse grain production. Mr Andrew-Especially in South Australia.",88
277,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"The honourable member for Wakefield says 'Especially in South Australia'. I must say that when the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and I were on a mission in China some 15 months ago we saw Queensland barley at a malt factory. It was highly regarded and it was preferred over the South Australian malt barley because of its malting qualities. It is an important crop and we saw first-hand that barley being processed in China. I know the honourable member for Murray will back me up on that. It is a valuable export crop, not only for Queensland but for Australia. Triticale is the name given to a grain developed by crossing wheat and rye. Most of the triticale grown in Australia is used in animal feeds, mainly for pigs, poultry and lot feeding of cattle. However, there are uses for triticale for human consumption. It is used in flakes and muesli-obviously it is a health food-for flour, whole grains and speciality breads. It is also used in the manufacture of triticale macaroni. For those people who are conscious of their diets, and particularly sports men and women who need a high intake of pastas, it is obviously very important that we do encourage further production and research into the qualities of triticale. It is really impossible to quantify in dollar terms the value of research and how this research has benefited the Australian agricultural sector, and how it has led to improvements in productivity. Without this research that has been carried out in the past, we would have been left behind long ago in the race to have breeds of cereals such as oats, wheat and barley, and we would not have had products that we could sell on the export markets because our quality would have been much lower than that of our competitors in other countries. What I believe our research must do in the future is move in a direction to reduce the plants' dependency on pesticides. There must be continued research to improve the rust resistant varieties that we have today because we are only now just keeping pace with new rust spores which breed in the fields. We are only just staying in front of the race to get plants which are continually more rust resistant than their parent counterparts. We have to get crops that utilise soil nutrients more efficiently, and this certainly can be done by genetic engineering. It is research of this calibre that will give our grain industry a competitive advantage in the international markets because it is not only price that we are talking about when we are selling these products on the international markets; it is all about quality. It could well be baking qualities or protein levels that are very important. I would like to touch on sorghum and maize because there is provision that in future, if the industry decides that sorghum and maize should also make a contribution to research, those levies could be incorporated within this legislation. It is important that we develop better varieties of sorghum and maize. We celiainly need to develop varieties which are much more midge resistant than the ones we have today. At present the only method of attack that the industry has to combat attacks from pests such as the midge is by the use of pesticides. Unfortunately, where pesticides are used, it is not only the midge that is eradicated, but also the midge's predator, in this case the little wasp. In our research in future years we must ensure not only that we get better yields and better quality grains, but that the plants are better able to resist attacks, in this case from the midge. By relying more and more on pesticides to remove these pests and not allowing nature to take its full course, we will get to the situation where we become totally dependent on pesticides. There is a golden opportunity for us in Australia to be leaders in this field. Unfortunately, we do not have levies at this stage for sorghum and maize, obviously this sort of research is being only by commercial seed companies. It is estimated in Australia that probably only about 10 per cent of the total research that carried out on sorghum and maize varieties is carried out by commercial firms. The balance of it is carried out in Australia by the State departments of primary industry in their plant breeding research programs. It is obviously very limited by the funds it can have access to without a contribution from the industry. This really is directly related to the fact that we have for so long relied on overseas countries for the development of new parent varieties in the hybrid sorghum and hybrid maize plants. We have very much relied on the Texas Agricultural University for this research. In fact, the Texas Agricultural University was responsible in the beginning for the breeding of hybrid sorghums. It is the largest plant breeding university in terms of summer maize and sorghum in the world. So relying on research conducted overseas is not the most efficient way of going about things, and I would urge the grain industry to take a long, hard look at this and come up with some solutions to the way it can levy itself to get more money going into the sorghum and maize industry. Whilst we rely on overseas countries for these new varieties to come on stream all the time, if we want to be efficient we look around the district to see who is the most efficient farmer, who is successfully growing crops, and think, 'So and so is a very successful farmer. I'll do exactly what he does next year'. But the only thing is that next year when we do exactly as he did and we look over his fence, we find that what he has done today we do tomorrow and therefore we are not doing it in exactly the same way as he did it. By relying on overseas research in the sorghum and maize industries, we get the benefits later and much more slowly, and we lose that competitive advantage. I would urge the industry to look closely at the area of levies for sorghum and maize. In the future research with respect to these cereal grains needs also to look at lifestyle. As a nation we can capitalise on our research so in this area because there has been a tremendone dous upsurge in the awareness of health foods, not only in Australia but around the world. As lifestyles improve in'the Asian area is there is obviously going to be an increasing demand for health foods, and cereal grains fit very well into that area. We have only got to look at the significant increase in demands for oats, cereal rye, rye-based biscuits, bread and breakfast cereals. Goodness me, Australia was once a land of steak and eggs for breakfast. Now it is muesli and rye bread toast. Our lifestyle in the last 30 years has changed and almost done a 180 degrees tum; we are going back in the other direction. Therefore, there are huge opportunities for research to improve the varieties of oats and ryes because there are growing markets in both of those areas. It gives farmers the opportunity to diversify into other products other than the traditional ones of wheat, barley and so on but more particularly oats and ryes, and of course this Bill is mainly addressing the levies on these two grains. Research in this area should be directed towards capitalising on this growing awareness of health foods. People are becoming more concerned over cholesterol levels and the obvious way to combat them-we have seen research carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-is by the use of bran in our diets; oat brans, barley brans. All these high fibre diets are not just trendy things to be involved in. They are certainly well proven medically. The other thing with the research is that we can have it as an export commodity. We can sell not only the product from these better crops but the technology of the grains and parent plants to overseas. So, not only is it better for our farmers in that it is going to give them more opportunities to diversify into crops other than the traditional ones we know today, but also if we do have research in this direction-namely genetic engineering which looks at plants which are less reliant on pesticides to eliminate some of the pests that attack them-we could find ourselves at the forefront in this area of research and technology that we as a nation could export. I certainly support the Bill. I do have two concerns about the way the levy is paid, that is, where it is paid at the point of procesindustries. sing and that those producers who use it onfarm will not be required to pay the levy. I think we must monitor that aspect of it to ensure that we do not see a gaping hole develop where people can avoid paying the levy just because they add value to the grain on-farm and yet they derive all the benefits of other people's money. I think we must watch that very closely and monitor it. I certainly commend the matching Commonwealth contribution. It is good to see the Commonwealth getting behind producers' willingness to fund their own research. It is certainly sensible that the Commonwealth does so. I support the Bill.",89
278,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate on this Coarse Grains Levy Bill, the purpose of which is to impose a levy on barley, cereal rye, oats and triticale produced in Australia and, of course, to see that levy matched, as indicated by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), by Commonwealth grants. There may be those listening to the debate or even those in the House knowing little about coarse grains who imagine that coarse grains are in some way different from other grains and the term 'coarse grains' implies a certain vulgarityMr Bruce Scott interjecting",91
279,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his interjection. In fact, the term 'coarse grains' does not mean that these grains lack any finesse. One should appreciate that coarse grains are a major contributor to Australia's balance of payments and one of our major export crops. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will be aware, coarse grains constitute Australia's second most important crop after wheat, and barley-one of the grains being considered by this legislation-has earned something like $708m, oats $178m, sorghum $136m, and these rank among Australia's top income earners. This legislation, as previous speakers have indicated, leaves unchanged existing barley and triticale levies and extends the coverage those that exists for research in the barley and triticale industries into the oats and cereal rye As has also been mentioned, the rates will be set with barley at 75c a tonne, triticale at $1 a tonne, and oats and cereal rye will be 0.5 per cent of net farm gate value to a maximum level of 5 per cent. The levy, as the Minister is well aware, will be set by regulation within those particular limits. It is intended that the legislation before the House will enable 250,000 tonnes to be raised for oats research and 20,000 tonnes to be raised for cereal rye research. As is frequently a problem when one participates late in a debate, much of what ought to be said has been said, and the point has already been made by the honourable member for Maranoa, that those who are unfamiliar with triticale ought to be acquainted with the fact that it is a cross between wheat and rye, that it proved attractive because of its drought tolerance and its capacity to adapt to acid soils and, in addition, that much of it is currently being used in the animal feed industry. I think it is significant that we are debating these Bills tonight because we are effectively on the verge of what will be much of the 1992 cereal planting season around Australia. With what have been encouraging-if early, nonetheless encouraging-opening rains in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland we can expect, if this is to continue, that there might be a large acreage sown to grains in one form or another around Australia, particularly given the rural recession and the need for rural producers to be particularly productive in the 1992 season. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been suggested that it could well be that we will see wheat tonnages-and wheat acreages, obviously-rise and coarse grain tonnages fall, partially because of changes in crop rotation principally because there has been hesitation about planting wheat because of what have been depressed prices over the last two seasons, and these prices, while not turning dramatically around, look as though they are moving the right way this year. I think it needs to be appreciated that because of the move into beef feed lots and to the value adding that this offers to Australia's primary producers, it is expected that in spite of the legislation before the House and in spite of the enthusiasm for coarse grain production, feed grain is likely to be in even more demand than coarse grains in the coming year simply because of the interest in beef feed lots and the expanding beef market. I want to make a comment or two about the barley industry in Australia because I represent the electorate of Wakefield, and the electorate of Wakefield includes the York Peninsular, the leg as it were-some people say the only leg Australia has to stand onthat characteristic leg of South Australia which claims, not without justification, to be the barley capital of the world. In fact the town of Minlaton, about in the centre of that leg, claims just that title as its town title. I do not want to enter into a debate with my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa about who grows the best or highest quality barley, but it is reasonable for me as a South Australian to be participating in this debate because of the importance of the barley industry in South Australia. I should say that legislation currently being considered by the South Australian Parliament directly affects the barley industry and deals with the issue of whether or not the South Australian Barley Board ought to be appointed or elected. This matter of sensitivity currently being dealt with both by the farmers organisation in South Australia and in the Parliament needs to be dealt with speedily or South Australian growers may well find themselves outmanoeuvred by decisions to change barley administration in the eastern States of Australia anyway. In my focus on barley I want to point out that all the figures would indicate that beer consumption is rising in Asia, and this provides a real opportunity for an expanding export market in malting barley both out of South Australia and in the other States of the Commonwealth. Dr Kavanagh of Carlton and United Breweries has indicated that there are real opportunities for quality Australian barley to be used in this expanding beer market in Asian destinations. I would hope that part of the impetus that will be given as a result of the legislation before the House, and the opportunity for additional funding, will be an impetus encouraged by the Grains Research and Development Corporation to develop barleys which will be marketable for their high quality rather than simply having to compete on price. There is little doubt that quality will be a major consideration as we endeavour to break into malting barley markets, particularly the Japanese market. I think we ought to recognise that what has happened to barley production in South Australia and is happening to barley production around Australia is that as a result of research, particularly varietal research, we have had increasing tonnages of barley available from paddocks that have been cropped year in and year out and available in spite of falling farm inputs. That, of course, is a real credit to research. That is the direction that has been characteristic of Australian agriculture and a direction that ought to be applauded by this Parliament. In fact, it is acknowledged by both sides of the House this evening. Much of the success of farm research has been due to the work that has been done in the paddock and in various selected lots where researchers have been determined in their genetic selection and have come up with superior barley lines that have enabled barley to stand in storms and not shed the grain that normally is shed as a result of storm damage to barley crops. However, as well, the success is the result of what I think has been charactrue teristic of Australian primary productiondence very effective extension. I doubt whether there is another industry in Australia that claim to have been as effective in its extenenthusiasm sion as has Australian agricultural research generally. I know there are many who despair about agricultural research and say there are farmers who are not availing themselves of the latest techniques. There is some justification for concern. But if one looks-and you are familiar with it, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - at the changes in farm practice over the last two decades, particularly at the emphasis on the astute use of chemicals in agriculture, one sees as a result of minimum tillage techniques a dramatic increase in production without dramatic increase in inputs. Much of this tribute to and a result of what has been very effective farm extension. Incredibly, of course, this farm extension has resulted principally from the sharing information among farmers. Farmers have been prepared and inclined to take what has been information available from departmental officers and opened their individual farms to field days so that their neighbours may see what are the best techniques to adopt and what effectively works most usefully in area as compared with another area. I think this sense of sharing available research ought to be lauded and recognised. This legislation encourages further research, but the effectiveness of this research and the way in which it is applied to meet the needs of Australia in regard to increased export opportunities will largely be determined by the way that research is made available to farmers. I would like to applaud organisations such as the bureau movements around Australia which, without any political base at all, and without even an agro-political axe to grind, have simply dedicated themselves to making sure that farm groups avail themselves of the latest research, the research that we are seeking to fund here this evening. There are just two other comments I want to make. I want to pick up the point made by the honourable member for Maranoa when he referred to a health conscious society. It is that there has been an increasing depenon cereals in our diet, and that is to be applauded. Of course, we have seen an can increasing demand for oats as a result of the for oat based cereals. This is reflected in sales and in what I hope will ultimately be a healthier society. In my other comment I want to look briefly at the cereal rye industry. This industry has not received a great deal of attention, but in that electorates such as mine and in a State like mine where rainfall is in such short supply, cereal rye has played an important role in ensuring that sandhills that would otherwise be drifting, particularly in the Mallee soils of South Australia, in areas such as Wanbi and spots in the northern Mallee, are locked in a place. Whilst it has been easy for people to is a see the sandhills as being the result of careless vegetation removal by farmers, the fact is that it is those same farmers who are now holding sandhills that previous of generations were not able to secure. Much of the success in stemming the spread of sand drift has been the result of the very careful use of cereal, rye and the development of cereal rye varieties which are drought tolerant and in fact able to - teadily make their way in the face of what has previously been seen as one an unassailable assault of drifting sand. The legislation before the House deals principally with the question of grain research. There are great opportunities no doubt for genetic engineering and great opportunities to develop even more new varieties which will allow us to capitalise on the facilities that we have in Australia to continue to be a major source of food for the rest of the world. I would like to applaud and support the legislation before the House and encourage the emphasis on genetic engineering in the hope of producing high quality grain and of maintaining our reputation as a nation, from a grain trading point of view, well worth dealing with. I support the legislation.",91
280,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,"In an attempt to be helpful to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who questioned the use of ad valorem levies in relation to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill and the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill, I am advised that the introduction of value based levies for oats and cereal rye at the request of the Grains Council of Australia reflects the Council's policy of relating the amount of levy payable more directly to the return received by the producer. The value based levy has applied to wheat since 1989 and under the legislation any new levy schemes introduced in the future will take the same fonnat. The existing barley and triticale levies will continue with specific rates for the present at the request of the respective industry bodies. It will be possible for these levies in the legislation to be converted to value based if industry so desires. In relation to another matter raised by the honourable member for Maranoa expressing a concern that grain processed by the producer will be exempt from levy, I am further advised that subclause 13(1) of the Bill sets out two conditions for exemption, both of which must be met. Subclause 13(1)(b) makes it clear that grain processed by the producer will not be exempt if it is used by the producer for commercial purposes. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Griffiths) read a third time. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1992 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 26 February, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Griffiths) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February- on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.  We have before the House the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992, which is an omnibus Bill to amend various Acts in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The coalition will not be opposing the passage of the Bill. The Bill amends three Acts: the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and the Family Law Act 1975. As the adjournment will be moved in approximately eight minutes, I will take the seemingly simple matter of the Judges' Pensions Act first and seek leave to continue my remarks on the other aspects of the Bill on a later day. It is proposed to amend the Judges' Pensions Act to remove the current limitation that a pension payable to the surviving spouse of a judge or a retired judge ceases to be payable on remarriage. Subsections 7(2) and 8(2) of the Act currently provide that, if a widow in receipt of a pension remarries, the pension ceases. Proposed new subsection 8A(I) will provide that a surviving spouse who has lost her or his entitlement to a pension by virtue of having remarried may apply to the AttomeyGeneral for restoration of the pension. The Attorney-General may direct that a pension restored where he or she is satisfied that applicant is in need or that the restoration the pension is otherwise justified. The Attorthat they: ney-General may, in special circumstances, direct that a pension be restored from a date earlier than the date of application. However, that date, of course, must not be earlier than the commencement date of the Act. Where a decision is made under subsection SA(l) not of to restore a pension, the Attorney-General must give written notice of that decision and include the reasons for the decision and want notification of the applicant's entitlement apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review. The proposed amendments will bring the entitlements of judges' widows who have remarried broadly in line with those of widows of public servants and politicians. There appears to be one main difference, which is that the amendments to the Judges' Pensions Act do not give widows who have previously lost their pension due to remarriage an automatic entitlement to the pension. These widows need to apply to the Attorneythe General, who will then restore the pension he is satisfied that the person is in need or that the restoration is otherwise justified. the future, the repeal of the sections prohibiting payment of the pension on remarunderstanding riage will most likely mean that the pension will automatically continue as it does for the widows of politicians and public servants. That is fine as far as the judges' pensions are concerned, but I take this brief tunity to remind the House of this Government's poor record when it comes to judicial salaries and judicial independence. It was approximately a year ago that I referred the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to an extraordinary letter written by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, to the Remuneration Tribunal. In his letter Sir Anthony referred to the Government's treatment of the judiciary and in particular the Government's attitude to judicial salaries. Sir Anthony, in writing the proposals to increase the remuneration payable to senior law officers, namely, the Solicitor-General-that was a saga in itself in be addition to the salary that the Attorneythe General sought to pay him-and the Director of of Public Prosecutions, said of the proposals ... indicate a want of understanding of the constitutional position of the judiciary and the relationship which that position requires to be preserved between the judiciary and the Executive Government. More than that, when viewed in light the history of salary determinations in recent years, they indicate an apparent want of understanding on the part of the Government of the nature and significance of the role of the judiciary. That of understanding has led to an erosion of the to remuneration and status of the judiciary. They are not my words; they are the words of the Chief Justice appealing to the Government to recognise the diminished standing of the judiciary that has occurred during the period of this Government. Whilst the Attorney was falling over himself at that juncture to look after the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General-as I say, that was in advance of all the other cosseting he sought to provide for the Solicitor-General-he was, in the words of the Chief Justice, diminishing status of the judiciary, which is fundamenif tal to our system of government. Each time. I have raised the issue, the In Attorney has been unable satisfactorily to enlighten me or anybody else of his of the independence of the judiciary. I remind the Attorney again that the evil of this erosion of judicial salaries will continue as a threat to judicial independence as long as sporadic and partial correction of the process of erosion is left to depend on the opporvery arms of government of which the judiciary should be independent. The judiciary is dependent on the Executive for effective initiation and the legislature for implementation of reform of the present system. There is some merit-I am not proposing it today-in the suggestion that there be an independent tribunal free from government and trade union pressure to determine the appropriate levels of judicial remuneration, subject, of course, to the Parabout liament's constitutional responsibilities. The point is that there is a nexus in this arena which the Attorney has long denied in terms of the standing and status of the judiciary. It continues to concern me, not so much because of the particular levels and types of remuneration, but rather because of the. chaotic and disorderly manner in which they are currently arrived at. I raise these matters again today in the hope that the Attorney will reconsider the misguided position he has adopted on this issue and appreciate that the matter of remuneration bears directly on judicial independence. At the commencement of my remarks I referred to two other pieces of legislation which the Bill also deals with. These are the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and the Family Law Act, those two Acts, in addition to the Judges Pension Act, being amended by this omnibus Bill. I just say before the adjournment is moved that the Bill in seeking to amend the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act provides that the Minister rather than the Governor General may approve leave of absence for members of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal. This will simplify the process of approving leave of absence for members of the Tribunal and really requires no further comment. As I say, the Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks on another day on the omnibus Bill, particularly as it relates to the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",94
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Truss)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Australian Broadcasting Corporation Services: Gold Coast",96
282,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"The people of the Gold Coast do not get their 8c a day value from the ABC. Presently, neither Radio National nor ABC FM classical music services is accessible to people on the Gold Coast. In my view, it is an absolute disgrace that a community of almost 300,000 people does not receive these services, considering that they are provided to a number of lesser cities and towns around Australia. Mr Courtice-We don't get an Indy race though.",96
283,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"That is right, but I assure the honourable member that the Indy race is no substitute for the ABC. I have taken this matter up with the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, on a number of occasions. In August 1990 I was advised by him that the installation of transmitters was scheduled to occur in the third quarter of 1991. When the third quarter of 1991 came and went, I reminded him of the commitment he had given to me previously. I received a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), which states: Detailed planning by the Department of Transport and Communications, for the delivery of these services to the Gold Coast, has revealed that the available 'frequencies would cause interference to ABC television broadcast from ABDQ3 Darling Downs. Introduction of these services will now not be possible until ABDQ3 is cleared from channel 3, under the Band II clearance program, around the end of 1992 or early 1993. Not being a technical person, that is absolute gobbledegook to me; in fact, it is a very lame excuse indeed. I am advised by some people who do understand the technical intricacies of this matter that this implies the use of unique frequencies for the provision of ABC Radio National and ABC PM stereo services to the Gold Coast. On behalf of those who do understand these things, I ask: why are repeater services not being - onsidered, if only as a temporary solution to the problem? I ani advised that interim facilities could be installed simply to repeat the Brisbane services alongside the television services which are already coming from the Mount Tamborine area, which is adjacent to the Gold Coast. In my view, the Parliamentary Secretary-I have passed his letter on to those who understand and are concerned about these matters-shows his absolute ignorance and lack of concern that this Government has for the people of the Gold Coast by merely trotting out some technocratic excuses for why things are not happening there. I have also been involved in attempting to get an improved ABC television reception for the Gold Coast. Once again, these services are inadequate for many Gold Coast residents. My dealings with the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, have also been totally unsatisfactory and inadequate. The Parliamentary Secretary has given me some absolutely inane responses to the representations I have been making on behalf of residents of the Gold Coast in respect of television reception. At one stage, he told me to advise my constituents to resite their television antennae-as if that were the solution to the problem. Once again, without getting into the technical side of the question, there is an obvious need for greater attention to be given to the actual transmission of ABC'television on the Gold Coast. The Government has shown its absolute contempt in the provision of ABC services to residents on the Gold Coast. I believe that they deserve better treatment than this. Contempt Laws: Protection of Journalists",96
284,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of this House matter which has already attracted. national and international interest regarding our justice system and the rights of Australian journalists. The gaoling of Queensland journalist Mr Budd for contempt of court for respecting confidence of a senior government official deplorable. The actions of Mr Justice Dowsett of the Brisbane Supreme Court must go under the microscope to ensure that the rights of Australian public are preserved. It has been said that the judge in this case was only doing his job and that the law is an as, not Mr Justice Dowsett. I could not agree more. The laws of contempt in this country have been roundly criticised and it is at the judge's discretion what penalty is imposed. the case of Joe Budd, the judge certainly use his discretion. He told the court before sentencing Mr Budd: In all the circumstances, being as lenient as I can be, I order you be imprisoned for 14 days. Lenient indeed! Joe Budd has been in Queensland's most notorious prison since last Friday and, although he has the sympathy of the Corrective Services Commission and its officers, could face no greater threat than coming face to face with criminals he may have reported on during his years as a police and court reporter. Budd is only the second Australian journalist this century to be gaoled for refusing to reveal a confidential source. The other was Western Australian journalist Tony Barassironically he once worked for the same newspaper as Budd-who served five days of a seven-day sentence. These men were bound by their code of ethics, yet the justice system has scoffed at these ethics. I can stand here confidently in this House and raise these important issues knowing that, if I say anything outside the House which could result in my being called before a judge, in this place I am protected under privilege. It is a privilege that is not used lightly but, importantly, in the public interest. Unfortunately, journalists are not afforded these same privileges, but they seek to protect those very same interests. This dilemma between ethics and the law has spurred protests, not only of Mr Budd's a professional colleagues but also those in the wider community who recognise the importance of an unmuzzled media. Australia is a modern democracy characterised by the Joe presence of a free media. The proper the operation of the media relies on the rights, is freedom of expression and access to information. The information is available to journalists from a variety of sources including the dare I say it-high ranking politicians and from people who fear victimisation if they were to be identified. This was the case that resulted in Joe Budd putting his personal freedom aside. Yet the judicial system has ruled that this is wrong. I call upon my fellow members on both of the In sides of the House to help change the law did which put Joe Budd in gaol and to prevent other journalists from facing the walls of a prison cell for simply doing their job. My message is particularly aimed at the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his State counterparts who have set the reform wheels in motion. These laws must be changed expeditiously to ensure that the public's right to know continues unhindered. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has discussed the matter. A model Bill was drafted and included in a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Bill was circulated and comments sought. A new Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the revised draft Bill will be presented to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in July 1992. I compliment the Federal Attorney General and his Department for the work they have put in. It certainly requires the cooperation of all the States to ensure that we do improve this law. I make the point that, were it not for people with courage like Woodward and Bernstein, Watergate would not have been exposed; were it not for people like Phil Dickie, the Fitzgerald inquiry would not have happened. I believe in the proposition put forward by Thomas Jefferson so many years ago: our freedom does depend upon the freedom of the press. That can never be limited without being lost. It is a principle that members on both sides of the House should support and all parliaments should collectively work together to improve this process. As I have said, the Federal Attorney-General is working on that. My thoughts tonight go to Joe Budd who is in Boggo Road gaol. Friedrich August von Hayek: Death",97
285,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Mackellar) (10.39 p.m.)Sadly, I have to report to the House the death of Friedrich August von Hayek, economist, political philosopher and Nobel prize winner, at the advanced age of 92. Friedrich von Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 and became a naturalised British citizen in 1938. After 10 years of employment in the civil service and teaching in Vienna, Hayek occupied the Tooke Chair of Economics at London University from 1931 to 1950. Between 1950 and 1962 he was a Professor of Social and Moral Sciences at the University of Chicago. Returning to Europe, he was a professor at Freiburg from 1962 to 1968 and at Salzburg from 1968 to 1977. His Nobel prize for economics, shared with Gunnar Myrdal, was awarded in 1974. Hayek was a towering figure in the economics and politics of liberty and free markets. In his early career before the Second World War he concentrated on relatively technical questions. However, in the late 1930s he turned to more fundamental issues and in 1944 published The Road to Serfdom, which revealed his new focus on the problems of individual values in a world of increased economic controls. He argu-d the case for an economic system based on free markets and a political system granting individual freedom within the law. The interaction between economic freedom and individual liberty was a recurring theme in his work. Hayek was no supporter of laissez faire. Like the thinkers in the Freiburg School of the 1940s on whose work Ludwig Erhard based his revival of post-war West Germany, Hayek believed in a stable and predictable social and economic order within which people would be free to organise their lives. An important element of a stable framework was price stability; that is, negligible inflation. Curiously, Hayek's ideas, which tidied up the classical liberalism of earlier thinkers such as Adam Smith and related the basic principles of liberalism to the modem world, did not begin to dominate the intellectual climate until Hayek's old age. In The Road to Serfdom in 1944 Hayek warned Europe's intellectuals that they were making a grave mistake going down the socialist path. In distinguishing between the state totalitarianism of Stalin, for which they had considerable sympathy, and that of Hitler or Mussolini, of which they disapproved, they were guilty of a grave misapprehension. Further, he pointed out that lesser forms of socialism, such as those practised subsequently by Britain and Sweden, would not work either and if pursued to their logical conclusion would eventually lead to the snuffing out of human freedom. If Western intellectuals had heeded Hayek in 1944 and not, as they shamefully did, heaped him with contumely, an enormous amount of human suffering could have been avoided. The Soviet empire would almost certainly have collapsed earlier and countless Third World countries would not have been encouraged to embrace the disastrous centralist economic models that so many of them did. I urge honourable members who have not read The Road to Serfdom to do so. In it they will get a taste of the extraordinary vision and weather. depth of understanding of this remarkable man. They will also see laid out the explanation of what happened to the world between the end of the war and the collapse of communism in 1989, written during the war and published 45 years before those events reached their climax. Countless millions owe their freedom and prosperity to Friedrich von Hayek without ever having heard his name. Countless more millions suffered tyranny for too long because his words were not heeded. Let this House pay tribute to one of the truly great figures of the twentieth century. Royal Australian Air Force Amberley",98
286,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring the attention of the House to an event of considerable significance in electorate of Oxley. As honourable members will be aware, RAAF Base Amberley has been an integral part of the Ipswich region many years; in fact, well over 50. On Moncivilians. day, 16 March last week, celebrations were held at Amberley to acknowledge 50 years service to the Australian Defence Force by No.3 Aircraft Depot and 482 Maintenance lived Squadron and to acknowledge the formation of 501 Wing, which is theRAAF's newest and biggest unit. The celebrations included a parade of No. 3 Aircraft Depot's Queen's Colours and the Governor General's banner of 482 Squadron. This parade was the last occasion on which the colours of the two units were publicly paraded, a matter of considerable significance in RAAF history and the history of the Amberley Base. Those who attended included the former Governor of New South Wales, His Excellency Air Marshall Sir James Rowland. The RAAF Air Command Band was flown up from RAAF Base Richmond to take part in the colours parade. There was also a less welcome visitor at the celebrations, with Cyclone Fran making her presence felt. This meant that there was a heavy downpour throughout the whole ceremony which spoilt the day somewhat. However, the RAAF's wet weather capabilities came to the fore, ensuring the success of the event in spite of the bad It was a matter of considerable sadness to many people in the Ipswich region that 3AD and 482 Squadron ceased operations in their golden jubilee year. However, the units have been reformed within the new 501 Wing. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was officially formed at Amberley in 1942 and consisted of one officer and 106 airmen. During its 50-year history the unit serviced over 30 different types of aircraft, including many which have played a vital role in our national defence, such as the Tiger Moth, the Sabre, the Phantom, the Canberra-I think honourable members would have noticed the Canberra at Fairbairn when we arrived here yesterdayAir Base the Iroquois, the Chinook and, of course, the FlI1. The support services provided by the depot my were recognised in March 1980 when it received the Queen's Colours. When the depot was disbanded, it employed over 25 for officers and 650 airmen, as well as 30 No-one can argue that the depot made a significant contribution in ensuring of the operational readiness of the RAAF throughout its 50 years existence. The unit up to its motto of 'Excel', an indication of the high skill level its personnel obtained, having received the Defence Productivity Award in 1990. No. 482 Maintenance Squadron originated at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, with the formation of No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit on 18 May 1942. The unit became No. 482 Squadron with its move to Amberley in 1946, a part of the No. 82 Bomber Wing. During the 1950s the squadron provided support to the wing during the process of conversion from Lincoln to Canberra aircraft. An example of the important contribution this unit has made to the general community is the equipment it prepared for flood relief operations in Queensland and northern New South Wales in its time at the base. The delivery of the first FlllC aircraft to Amberley in June 1973 meant a change in roles for 482 Squadron. The squadron became responsible for the maintenance of the FlllCs used by No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons throughout Australia in exercises in Malaysia, New Zealand, Hawaii and the United States mainland. No. 482 Squadron received the Governor General's banner in 1981 in recognition of its 40 years of service to our nation's defence. Throughout its 50-year history, the Unit made a sigQ.ificant contribution to the operational effectiveness of the Royal Australian Air Force. It lived up to its motto, 'Trenchant', a word defined in the Oxford Dictionary as 'vigorous, penetrating and decisive'. In spite of its tremendous record of service, it was necessary to merge the two units into the new 501 Wing to meet the logistic needs of the RAAF as the nation enters the twentyfirst century. The two units will shortly be joined in the new wing by the Weapons Systems Logistics' Management Squadron from Victoria. Group Captain Chris Tyler, the last commander of No. 3AD, has become the first commander of 501 Wing. ensuring the historical link between the old and the new units. I am sure that all members of the Ipswich community wish Group Captain Tyler and his Defence Force personnel there well in their new role and recognise the contribution the units that 501 Wing is replacing have made. I am sure that all members of this House join me in acknowledging the fine contribution that the defence personnel of 3AD and 482 Squadron have made to the RAAF in their 50 years of service to Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.48 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Snow to move That this House: (1) rejects the Liberal,and National Parties' attack on the public service and Canberra; and (2) declares the proposal to move departmental heads and sections from Canberra to be contrary to the principles of decentralisation and an attack on the ACT and South Eastern NSW economies and people, Mrs Darling to move That this House: (1) deplores the enormous injustice perpetrated on Aboriginal Australians at the time of the European invasion; (2) recognises the richness and diversity of traditional Aboriginal culture; and (3) determines that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure that Australia finally sheds any and all racist overtones in every sector of our society. Mr Beddall to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment and fitout of Juliana House, Phillip, ACT.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Meat Inspectors (Question No. 845) Mr Anderson asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 28 May 1991: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 545 (Hansard, 18 April 1991, page 3056), is he able to indicate how much work has been performed by each of the 63 meat inspectors who are headquartered in towns where there are no longer abattoirs. (2) When was each of the abattoirs referred to in part (2) of his answer to question No. 545 closed. (3) Have any of the meat inspectors referred to in part (1) performed relief work at other abattoirs; if so, at which abattoir in each case. (4) What was the cost of travelling and other allowances paid to enable these meat inspectors to work at other abattoirs. (5) What action has been taken to declare redundant or redeploy excess meat inspectors. (6) How many of the 63 meat inspectors are still employed by the Commonwealth. (7) What total sum in wages has been paid to the 63 meat inspectors since their respective abattoirs closed. (8) Was approximately $200,000 worth of beef and sheep meat condemned at Cowra Abattoir following the withdrawal of Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) inspection staff on 16 April 1991; if so, (a) was the meat inspected by 2 fully qualified currently registered inspectors each with many years experience, (b) was any fault in the meat identified and (c) did he personally order condemnation of the meat; if not, who did. (9) Will he instigate an inquiry into the operation of AQIS; if so, (a) will the inquiry be genuinely independent and (b) how will those who will conduct the inquiry be chosen. (10) Will the cost of inspectors' services to abattoirs be increased by 10 per cent from 1 July 1991.",99
287,Mr GRIFFITHS,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) To determine how much work has been undertaken by each inspector who is headquartered in a town where the abattoir has closed would require the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service NA (AQIS) to examine all time sheets and rosters prepared for each establishment since the day it was closed. In the case of Bendigo abattoir more than seven years of records would have to be scrutinised. I am not persuaded that it would serve the public interest to devote the large staff resources necessary to this task. I can inform the honourable member that AQIS' practice is to employ such inspectors as part of the established pool of inSpection staff who regularly provide relief duties for other staff on authorised leave or undergoing training. Where appropriate such inspectors have been given priority in AQIS' current redundancy program. The cost of maintaining surplus inspection staff is not a charge to industry under the cost recovery system unless work is actually performed. (2) The date that each abattoir referred to in Question 545 closed is as follows: Queensland Pentland September 1989 Cairns August 1989 New South Wales Gosford May 1989 Maitland May 1987 Wyong March 1989 Deniliquin March 1990 (re-opened April 1991) Orange May 1988 Victoria Dromana May 1989 Bendigo January 1984 Seymour October 1990 (re-opened November 1991) Ballarat December 1988 Sunbury May 1989 Loch November 1988 Euroa August 1988 Kyabram November 1988 Moe January 1989 Mirboo North September 1989 TongaJa April 1990 Yarra Junction November 1988 Korumburra May 1990 Northern Territory Tennant Creek December 1989 (re-opened April 1991 closed again 2 September 1991 and has remained closed since that date) (3) Yes. As to where the work was perfonned, see the answer to part 1. (4) See answer to part 1. (5) AQIS is constantly addressing the issue of surplus staff, on a priority basis. Staff at closed headquarters are the first to be offered transfers to vacancies and continue to have a priority in AQIS' redundancy program to reduce surplus staff. From the commencement of the program in 1989 to January 1992, 373 inspectors have accepted voluntary redundancy. (6) Of the 63 inspectors identified by AQIS in February 1991 as headquartered in towns where there are no longer abattoirs, 42 were still employed by the Commonwealth in January 1992. On 18 October 1991, the Industrial Relations Commission endorsed an award restructuring package for AQIS inspection staff. Amongst issues negotiated with the Public Sector Union (Food Inspection Group) (fonnerly the Meat Inspectors' Association) and reflected in the award restructuring package are streamlined arrangements to relocate inspectors to suitable vacancies at other locations when they are surplus at current headquarters. (7) At the time of closure of each abattoir referred to in Question No 545, there were the following numbers of meat inspectors pennanently headquartered at each individual location. Queensland Pentland 2 Cairns I New South Wales Gosford 8 Maitland 2 Wyong 4 Deniliquin 5 Orange 5 Victoria Dromana 6 Bendigo 7 Seymour 3 Ballarat 9 Sunbury I Loch 1 Euroa 1 Kyabram 1 Moe 1 Mirboo North 1 Tongala 1 Yarra Junct. Korumburra Northern Territory Tennant Creek 2 To determine what sum in salaries has been paid to the above inspectors since the closure of the abattoirs would require AQIS to examine time sheets and rosters prepared for each establishment since the day it was closed. I am not persuaded that it would serve the public interest to devote the large staff resources necessary to this task. I can however infonn the honourable member that the basic rate of pay for a Meat Inspector Grade 1 in July 1991 was in the range $24,238 to $28,080. (8) Cowra abattoir slaughtered beef and sheep on 16 April 1991 without the services of authorised officers in attendance, contrary to legal requirements. The abattoir claims that the meat was inspected by two local veterinarians. It is understood that a number of carcases were condemned but no condemnation certification was provided nor was any other certification provided. Official condemnation of the meat for human consumption was authorised by AQIS' Chief Veterinary Officer for NSW. The meat was pennitted to be processed as pet food. (9) Ernst and Young Pty Ltd of Canberra were appointed by me to report on the organisational fonn and management arrangements of AQIS. The consultant was chosen by means of a competitive tendering process. On 26 November 1991 I announced details of significant changes which are contained in an organisational refonn package approved by Cabinet. This reform package was the outcome of this and other intensive reviews of AQIS, carried out during the previous twelve months. (10) On 17 May 1991, I announced that the charge for individual meat inspectors would rise by 3.8% and for individual veterinary officers by 3.3% as from 1 July 1991. The total cost base for the national meat inspection program for the year 199192 is estimated to be 1 per cent greater than in the previous year. Rural Adjustment Scheme (Question No. 1103) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Primary Industries am'- Energy, upon notice, on 10 October 1991: (1) What budget allocation was made to the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) in each financial year from its inception to 1990-91. (2) What is the Part A, Band C breakdown of each of the figures referred to in part (1). (3) What was the outlay for drought relief in each financial year from the inception of the RAS to 1990-91. (4) Will specific provision be made for exceptional drought relief under the RAS in 1991-92. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) came into existence on 1 July 1977. (2) ($) Year Part A 1977-78 41,599,000 1978-79 38,091,000 1979-80 15,757,000 1980-81 17,255,000 1981-82 16,223,500 1982-83 17,290,912 1983-84 32,904,942 1984-85 29,932,772 1985-86 13,413,082 1986-87 26,998,500 1987-88 33,683,699 1988-89 40,383,700 1989-90 43,383,700 1990-91 49,383,700 In addition to the provision of funds for Parts Band C of the Scheme, the Commonwealth provides funds for the administration of the Scheme. There have been extensive modifications to the Scheme since its inception in 1977, particularly those implemented in 1985 and 1989 such that the different parts of the Scheme are not always directly comparable. For example, prior to 1985, Part A comprised mainly concessional interest loan principal funds provided by the Commonwealth to the States for on-lending to farmers. These advances are repayable which is in contrast to present arrangements where funds are provided to the States as a grant Year $'000 1977-78 47,363 1978-79 42,280 1979-80 15,994 1980-81 17,409 1981-82 16,411 1982-83 17,851 1983-84 44,407 1984-85 31,254 1985-86 16,798 1986-87 33,878 1987-88 43,248 1988-89 53,263 1989-90 53,347 1990-91 62,450 PartB PartC 5,605,000 159,000 3,892,000 297,000 108,000 79,000 20,000 70,000 0 92,984 100,000 195,025 10,488,000 755,057 0 860,290 0 2,924,590 0 5,867,332 0 5,870,843 7,397 5,689,796 52,535 5,155,738 34,953 7,798,710 A, largely to subsidise interest payments on loans from commercial or State Government sources. (3) Drought assistance was specifically excluded from the RAS until 1 July 1989. The outlays for drought relief listed below are the sum of outlays for drought assistance made under the National Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA) and the schemes established under the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Act 1982, that is the Drought Relief Fodder Subsidy Scheme and the Drought Relief Interest Subsidy Scheme. Since 1 July 1989 drought relief is no longer a part of the NDRA and the amount for 1989-90 reflects retrospective payments.

The Commonwealth Government, while making no specific provision for drought funding under the RAS in 1991-92, has nevertheless increased total RAS funding to $173.1 million in 1991-92 compared with $62.45 million in 1990-91, partly in recognition of the effects of the drought in Queensland and New South Wales on farmers' incomes. Brisbane International Airport (Question No. 1197) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: (1) Has the Minister received any indications from international airlines presently operating through Brisbane that they would wish to increase the number of services through Brisbane International Airport within the next three years; if so, what indications. (2) Have there been any indications of new services to be provided by airlines not yet operating through Brisbane International Airport; if so, what new services. (3) Has the Minister received any indications from potential or existing operators that the lack capacity at Brisbane International Airport has thwarted their plans for expansion; if so, what indications.",102
288,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I have not received any indications from international airlines presently operating through Brisbane that they wish to increase the number of services through Brisbane International Airport within the next three years. (2) Northwest Airlines has indicated to my Department that it hopes to commence services to Brisbane during 1992. No application to do so has yet been lodged. No other expressions of interest have been received. (3) Due to restrictions on apron usage at Brisbane Airport, two new services, an Australia Asia Airlines flight from Taipei and a Qantas flight from Seoul, could not be allocated a suitable slot for the Northern Winter scheduling period by the lATA Schedule Coordination Conference and these services were subsequently deleted from Brisbane. The Federal Airports Corporation is spending $4.05 million to increase the capacity of Brisbane's present International Terminal. This work is expected to be completed in less than 12 months. In addition, work is already underway to increase the number of parking positions at the existing international terminal for wide-bodied aircraft. The apron expansion, which is expected to be completed by mid March 1992 at a total cost of $450,000, will allow 6, instead of 5, international aircraft to use the terminal. In response to concerns that demand for international travel to Queensland will increase faster than originally forecast, the Prime Minister announced on 26 February 1992 that the Government - i1l propose to the FAC that it brings forward the completion of the Brisbane international terminal from 1996 to 1995.

Kangaroo Meat (Question No. 1262) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) Which countries currently allow the importation of kangaroo meat for human consumption. (2) What efforts are being made to promote the export of kangaroo products. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Based on information collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia exported fresh, chilled or frozen kangaroo meat to the following countries in the financial year ended June 1991: Denmark, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Macau, PNG, Sweden, UK and the USA. In previous years, Germany, Netherlands and France also imported kangaroo meat for human consumption. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service oversees the production and provides animal and public health certification for the export of kangaroo meat for human consumption. Controls over the harvesting and export of kangaroo products are also exercised by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. (2) The direct promotion of the export of kangaroo products is undertaken by individual private companies and details of such activities are not available. Considerable effort by the Government in the past, concerning the promotion of kangaroo products overseas, has been directed at ensuring that accurate information has been provided to foreign governments concerning the management arrangements applying to the harvesting of kangaroos in Australia, particularly as regards to the protection of rare and endangered species. (Question No. 1264) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: Are quails exported from Australia not allowed to be imported into France; if so, (a) why, (b) does the ban extend to other poultry products, (c) which European countries are similarly affected by such a ban and (d) are any chemicals considered in determining regulations controlling the importation of quails into France; if so, what chemicals.",106
292,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No (a) While there is no ban on the importation of quails into France, the European Communities impose inspection and certification requirements that are more stringent than those in Australia's export legislation. At present no Australian poultry establishment can meet the import requirements. (b) The requirements for the entry of poultry (which includes meat from live domestic hens, turkey, guinea fowls, ducks, geese, quail, pigeons, pheasants and partridges) into France is covered by the Directive 90/494/EEC on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and imports from third countries of fresh. poultry meat. (c) All European Community member States enforce the Directive. A number of other countries wishing to join the European Community are aligning their import conditions to the Directive. (d) Australia is required to submit a National Residue Monitoring program on a yearly basis to the EC. The export of quails, were it to occur, would need to be included in this residue program. The details of the chemicals and testing levels would need to be negotiated. Power Plants (Question No. 1267) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a proposal of the Global Energy Network International (GENI) concerning the interconnection of the world's existing oil, coal and nuclear based power plants with renewable, non-polluting sources of power, such as hydro-electric, geothermal, solar and wind-powered Quails systems; if so, what is the Government's position with respect to the proposal. (2) Will the Government host or co-sponsor with the UN the World Conference on International Electric Interconnections to be held in Sydney in March 1992. (3) Will the GENI proposal be included in the (a) Australian report to the Climatic Changes Conventions and (b) Australian national report to the UN Conference on Environment and Development.",107
293,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Xes, I am aware of the proposal of the Global Energy Network International (GENI) to use high voltage transmission links to interconnect regional power grids into a worldwide energy grid. I recently met Mr Fisher, Manager of the GENI 92 Conference. Although the GENI proposal may have some merit as a long tem vision, there are complex issues which it has not addressed. For example; infrastructure costs, transmission line losses, technical impacts of large scale interconnections on system stability and integrity. The Australian Government is conscious of the potential economic and environmental benefits of grid interconnection. NSW and Victoria have been interconnected since 1959 and South Australia was incorporated into the network in 1990. The National Grid Management Council, a Commonwealth-State initiative, was established by the July 1991 Special Premiers' Conference to encourage and coordinate the most efficient economic and environmentally sound development of the electricity supply industry in south and east Australia, including grid augmentation and extension. As set out in the ""One Nation"" Economic Statement, the Government regards upgrading Australia's electricity grid as a high priority as part of a National Electricity Strategy. The Commonwealth is offering to contribute up to $100 million towards transmission infrastructure upgrading, contingent on the relevant States agreeing to a timetable for the development of a National Grid Corporation. (2) No, I advised Mr Fisher of GENI that I do not have the funds available within my portfolio to be able to offer financial assistance to host or cosponsor the GENI 92 conference. I advised GENI that I am prepared to consider in principle support of a non-financial nature for the conference. However, before considering this matter further I have asked GENI for written confirmation from the UN clearly setting out the nature and extent of their contribution towards the conference and their views on GENI. (3) (a) No, the GENI proposal will not be included in the Australian report to the Climatic Changes Convention. (3) (b) No, the GENI proposal will not be included in the Australian report to the UN Conference on Environment and Development. Medicare Co-Payment (Question No. 1276) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) What sum does the Government estimate it will save by introducing the $2.50 Medicare copayment. (2) How will the shortfall in revenue be accounted for if the co-payment is abolished.",107
294,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Net savings of approximately $60 million in Medicare benefits in 1991-92 are expected to result from the copaymentfbenefit reduction which applied in the period from 1 December 1991 to 1 March 1992 and taking into account the cost of the transaction fee. (2) The Prime Minister's One Nation Statement announced on 26 February 1992 has taken into account, along with the full range of the Government's other planned reforms, the effect on outlays of the decision to reverse the copayment and benefit reduction. The One Nation Statement presents this Government's Economic Strategy for Australia's future. Invalid Pensioners (Question No. 1281) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: How many persons in (a) total and (b) each State and Territory receive the invalid pension on the stated grounds of alcoholism or drug addiction.",108
295,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: From 12 November 1991 Invalid Pension has been replaced by Disability SuPPort Pension as part of the Government's Disability Reform Package. From November 1991, limited data on the medical condition of clients granted Disability Support Pension has been collected by the Department of Social Security. This, however, is not sufficiently detailed to identify alcoholism or drug addiction which are included in a larger category of psychological and psychiatric disorders. In any event, as this system has been in place only since November 1991, information on the medical condition of the great majority of Disability Support Pensioners is not available from the client payment file and therefore it is not possible to provide the information requested. However, a statistical survey of the medical conditions of Invalid Pensioners granted pension between 1 January and 30 June 1988 can provide some information on medical conditions classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 1975 Revision. From this survey, it is estimated that 437 people granted Invalid Pension in the first six months of 1988 had a main medical condition classified as alcoholism (including alcoholic polyneuropathy and diseases of the liver). This represents 2.3% of total grants in this period. As there are no ICD codes identifying drug addiction specifically, information on the grants of Invalid Pension to persons with a main medical condition of drug addiction is not available. Recognition of Siovenian Passports (Question No. 1285) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: Does the Australian Government recognise passports issued by the Government of Slovenia. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: On 16 January 1992, the Australian Government formally recognised the independent state of Slovenia which was previously part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Slovenian passports are therefore recognised by the Australian Government as acceptable travel documents. (Question No. 1294) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: (1) How many Australians living overseas receive pensions in (a) total and (b) each category of pension. (2) With respect to the pensions referred to in part (1), what sum is paid in (a) total and (b) each category. (3) How many persons living in Australia receive pensions from overseas in (a) total and (b) each category of pension. (4) With respect to the pensions referred to in part (3), what sum is paid by overseas countries in (a) total and (b) each category.",108
296,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Total (b) Age Wife Age Disability Support Wife Disability Support Widow B Sole Parent Carer (2) (a) Total annual payments (projected from fortnightly amounts as at 27 Feb 1992) (b) Age Wife Age Disability support Wife Disability Support Widow B Sole Parent Carer (3) (a) 200,000 is a reliable estimate. Not all countries provide statistics on their payments into Australia. (b) Approximately 90% are age/retirement pensions, 4% are invalid pensions and 6% are widow/survivor pensions. (4) (a) Approximately $620 million will be paid into Australia in pensions in 1991-1992 by countries which provide statistics. (b) Not known. Pensions Kangaroo 92 (Question No. 1304) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: (1) Has New Zealand been excluded from Exercise Kangaroo 92; if so, why. (2) How many Australian and US forces are involved in the exercise. (3) What will be the duration of the exercise. (4) Will the Kangaroo series of exercises continue every three years. (5) Will the exercises remain restricted to US and Australian defence forces. (6) Would a change in New Zealand's antinuclear policy lead to its inclusion in this and other major Australian exercises involving the USA. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honour33,036 able member's question: 18,605 (1) New Zealand has been invited to attend 1,931 Exercise Kangaroo 92 as an observer, but not as a 8,048 participant. The United States is a regular partici2,535 pant in the Kangaroo series of exercises and, as 1,908 there remain issues of substance between New 7 Zealand and the United States on international 2 security matters, it is not appropriate to invite both nations to participate in the same exercise with Australian forces. $m (2) There will be approximately 12,000 Austra195.5 lian and 800 US defence personnel involved in 106.7 Kangaroo 92. . 5.5 (3) Kangaroo 92 will run from 8 March to 3 56.9 April 1992. 13.1 13.2 (4) The Kangaroo series of exercises is planned .067 to continue every three years. .011 (5) Invitations to other nations to participate in these exercises will depend upon the nature of the particular exercise and upon the relationships between those nations and with Australia at the time. (6) Australia regards it as important to exercise with both the United States and New Zealand. Australia would welcome changes in New Zealand's policies that would remove the impediment to a restored defence relationship between New Zealand and the United States, so that defence activities involving all three countries can resume including those such as the Kangaroo series. National Bureau of Language Services (Question No. 1310)",109
297,Mr RUDDOCK,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2S February 1992: (l) Did the Government promise before the 1990 election to establish a National Bureau of Language Services. (2) Has the bureau referred to in part (1) been established; if not, why not.

(4) Have any meetings of departmental officials been held to discuss the matter; if so, (a) who was represented at the meetings, (b) how many meetings were held and (c) are the meetings still convened; if not, why not. (5) Has a meeting of ethnic affairs ministers been held to discuss the matter; if so, was a report produced detailing its recommendations or findings and when will it be made available. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Labor Party made a 1990 election commitment to establish a National Bureau for Language Services. (2) No. The Bureau has not been established because of confusion about its purpose and role and insufficient State and community support to allow it to proceed at this stage. (3) Yes. A Commonwealth/State Steering Group was established to explore options for the structure, administration and composition of the proposed Bureau in August 1990. The Bureau concept was a topic raised repeatedly by community representatives and individuals during my extensive round of consultations early in 1991. Following the March 1991 Commonwealth, State and Territory Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Ministers' Conference. in Sydney, a Ministerial Committee on the Provision of Language Services was appointed to consult extensively on the future of language services and to seek community opinions on a possible National Bureau. The Ministerial Committee has reported and their report is available for public scrutiny. (4) Yes. (a) The Commonwealth/State Steering Group comprised the heads (or their representatives) of State and Territory Ethnic Affairs Commissions (or their equivalents) and representatives from the departments of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Finance, Social Security and Attorney-General's. (b) Six meetings were held. The December 1991 meeting discussed the Ministerial Committee's report.

AQIS Meat Inspectors (Question No. 1311) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: Further to the answer to question No. 1073 (Hansard, 5 November 1991, page 2377), was the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service responsible for paying the hardship allowance to the officer under paragraph 63C(2)(a) of the Public Service Act; if s,o, did the payment contribute to the total costs to be recovered from primary producers.",110
298,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) paid all costs associated with the hardship allowance paid to the officer who was suspended from duty without pay. While suspended the officer concerned was treated as a surplus officer for charging purposes and, consistent with the Government's policy on surplus AQIS staff, was not subject to cost recovery. As a consequence the payments made to the officer did not contribute, in any way, to the total costs recovered from primary producers. National Forensic Science Institute (Question No. 1397) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 March 1992: Did Mr Justice Morling, in the report of the Royal Commission of inquiry into the Chamberlain convictions, recommend the establishment of a National Forensic Science Institute; if so, what steps have been taken to implement the recommendation.",110
299,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Mr Justice Morling did recommend the establishment of l! such a body. The National Institute of Forensic Science (NIFS) was set up under the auspices of the Australian Police Ministers Council by an Intergovernmental Agreement finalised in February 1991. A Board of Control, chaired by the Chief Justice of Victoria, Mr Justice Phillips has also been set up and a Director appointed. Other staffing and administrative arrangements are being finalised and it is expected that NIFS will be operational in the near future. Briefly, the functions of NIFS are to: sponsor and support research in forensic science of common interest to the parties to the agreement; advise on and assist with the development and co-ordination of forensic science services between the parties to the agreement; gather and exchange forensic information, including through the establishment of a national forensic reference service; support, co-ordinate and conduct training programs in forensic science; and conduct relevant assurance programs.",111
