Under these ""arrangements unemployed young people may be required to undertake an activity additional to job search in return for their unemployment payments. In many cases they are able to select an activity of their choice from a menu of Mutual Obligation activities. As Work for the Dole is one of the activities that can be selected it is no longer relevant to distinguish between voluntary and compulsory participation. As at 17 March 1999, there have been 148 participants who reside in the postcode areas. Federal Magistracy (Question No. 377) Mr MCClelland asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: (1) Has the Government decided upon an administrative model for a federal magistracy; if so, what will be the administrative structure. (2) Has the funding required to establish a federal magistracy been analysed; if so, with what results. (3) has the Government considered alternatives to the establishment of a federal magistracy such as dual appointments of existing State magistrates or judges. Mr Williarns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Like the other federal courts, the federal magistracy will be responsible for managing its own affairs, supported by a Chief Executive Officer and other staff. (2) Yes. The funding has been analysed and is currently being considered in the budget process. (3) Yes. The Government has considered a number of alternatives. Dual appointments of existing State magistrates or judges would be a more expensive option than establishing a federal magistracy, with complex agreements needed with each State and Territory and additional costs involved with training State magistrates or judges who would not necessarily have been appointed on the basis of their experience with federal law. Veterans' Affairs Community Care Seeding Grants Prograin (Question No. 388) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 9 February 1999: (1) Are businesses and services which are not ex-service organisations or non-profit community based organisations eligible to receive funding under the Veterans' Affairs Community Care Seeding Grants Program.

Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) (a) and (b) Yes (3) The guidelines do not specifically address this issue. I am not aware of any such grant being provided, but it is conceivable that minor items (such as tools) which are purchased with grant funds could be stored in a private home. Veterans' Disability Pension: Income Test (Question No. 389) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 9 February 1999: (1) Did his office write to a veteran, Mr A.J. Smith on 8 April 1998 stating that a report to the Government on the treatment of disability pensions as income for social security pension purposes had been prepared by the Department of Social Security in consultation with his Department and was being considered by the Minister for Social Security. (2) Did the then Member for MCPherson, Mr Bradford, tell the House on 3 June 1998 that the report had been completed and had been put in the too-hard basket; if so, did he deny Mr Bradford's claims and tell the House that the interdepartmental review was being done, had not been completed and was not finished; if so, on what basis did he make the denial. (3) According to records held by his department, on what dates were formal meetings of the interdepartmental review held and when was its report first received by his office. (4) What were the findings and recommendations of the review. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Member for MCPherson advised the House on 3 Jime 1998 that a report had been completed. This was the report that Senator Newman was considering when she responded to a letter from the Member for MCPherson in February 1998. However the report, although drafted, was not finalised at that time and both my Department and the (then) Department of Social Security were subsequently asked to do further work on it. (3) Following the direction to undertake further work, many meetings and discussions were held in the period March 1998 to June 1998 between officers of my Department and of the Department of Social Security as the redraft was undertaken collaboratively. Details of those meetings and discussions were not recorded in any formal sense. The final report was provided in late 1998. (4) The review was an internal one and the report was prepared essentially for Senator Newman and myself. As significant costs would be involved in any change to the current arrangements, the matter would need to be considered in the light of the Government's overall budgetary priorities and commitments to the veteran community. Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Question No. 421) Mr Albanese asked the Miriister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 15 February 1999: (1) Will specific purpose payments such as those made under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements (CSHAs) cease with the introduction of a goods and services tax. (2) Is the Government negotiating a CSHA for 1999-2003; if so, has the Minister obtained advice on whether the agreement will have effect after the introduction of a goods and services tax in July 2000. (3) If the CSHA is to have effect, are the cost implications of a goods and services tax for community, social and public housing organisations being taken into account during negotiations. (4) Will Commonwealth funding under the next CSHA be increased to alleviate the (a) increased cost effects of a goods and services tax and (b) cline in funding since the 1996-97 Budget. (5) Since the 1997-98 Budget, has the Government justified cuts to the CSHA by arguing that State housing authorities can absorb the cuts by pursuing more cost effective public housing management practices; if so, what are the cost effective management practices. (6) Has the Government forecast that State housing authorities will save up to $50 million per year until 2000-01; if so, how will the savings be achieved. (7) Has the Minister sought confirmation from the Department of the Treasury that social rental housing activities will be deemed commercial under a goods and services tax and therefore input taxed; if so, what was Treasury's response. (8) Considering the impact a goods and services tax will have on increased costs for maintaining and running public housing, has the Minister obtained Treasury estimates of the net impact in dollar terms for maintenance spent in housing programs in all States and Territories. (9) Does the new tax reform legislation propose to treat trusts in the same manner as companies for tax purposes; if so, has the Minister considered the impact on trusts such as the NSW Home Purchase Assistance Fund, which is predicted to lose $12.6 million of investment income because of the new tax laws. (10) Has the Minister prepared estimates of the reduction in the number of home purchasers who will be unable to receive purchase assistance as a result of the new tax laws; if so, what are the estimates. (11) Has the Minister obtained Treasury estimates of the cost per annum for public, social and community housing agencies to comply with the administrative requirements of a goods and services tax in all States and Territories; if so, what are the estimates. (12) Has the Minister obtained confirmation that a goods and services tax will apply to headleasing services provided to housing administrators by landlords; if so, (a) will the tax on these services be costed at the weekly rent value and (b) what are Treasury's predictions of the impact on the costs of headleasing for housing authorities in all States and Territories. (13) Will the Minister provide details of modelling or projections of the likely reduction in private sector engagement in the provision of public sector housing following the introduction of a goods and services tax. (14) Will the Minister provide estimates of the number of households likely to be forced out of their current accommodation because of increased de- rents following the introduction of a goods and services tax. (15) Will the Minister provide information on the number of persons who live in (a) boarding houses; (b) hostels; and (c) caravan parks in each State and Territory; if so, what is the breakdown by (a) age, (b) ethnicity, (c) gender and (d) household income. (16) Is it a fact that long-term residents of boarding houses, caravan parks and hostels will pay tax on their rents under a goods and services tax but house and apartment rents will be exempt; if so, what mechanisms has the Minister considered to address the different treatment. (17) Has the Minister prepared estimates of the number of households likely to be forced out of caravan park, boarding house and hostel accommodation because of increased rents following the introduction of a goods and services tax. (18) Will the Minister provide total numbers of Rent Assistance recipients, broken down by (a) country of birth, (b) languages other than English spoken at home and (c) principal language spoken at home. (19) How many Rent Assistance recipients had payments cut as a result of the reduction in Rent Assistance payable to single persons in shared accommodation. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. (2) The Government is currently negotiating a new Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA) with State and Territory Governments which will have effect as from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2003. (3) State Governments have been offered $269m, spread evenly over three years, to be included in the new CSHA starting 2000-01 in respect of the net increase in public and community housing costs as a result of taxation reform. (4) The current Commonwealth offer of $3.8bn, for a 4 year CSHA, is a generous contribution to State and Territory Governments for the provision of housing assistance. In addition, compensation the increased cost effects of taxation reform has been offered (see (3) above). (5) The expectation is a 1% increase per annum in efficiency. It is up to States how they achieve this and what cost effective management practices they introduce. (6) No. (7) Division 40 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998, introduced into Parliament on 2 December 1998, provides that residential rental accommodation, including public and/or social housing be input taxed after 1 July 2000. However, Subdivision 38-F, provides that a charitable organisation can obtain GST-free status (where they will be able to claim input-tax credits) duced. where housing is supplied ""for a consideration that is less than 50% of the GST inclusive market value of the supply"" or where ""the supply is for considerServices ation that is less than 50% of the consideration supplier provided, or was liable to provide for acquiring the thing supplied"". (8) The compensation offer of $269m over three years (see (3) above) includes compensation for the increased costs for maintaining and running public housing. (9) In ""A New Tax System"" the Government set out a strategy for reforming the taxation of investments and business entities that included taxing trusts like companies under redesigned company tax arrangements. On 14 August 1998, the Treasurer announced the appointment of Mr John Ralph, AO to chair a Review of Business Taxation. The Review's recommendations will be directed to the strategy for reform spelt out in A New Tax System. The Review is engaging in widespread public consultations, and is to report by 30 June 1999. (10) No reduction is anticipated. (11) Treasury estimates that recurrent gross compliance costs of the GST are on average, $1195 per firm. However, recurrent net compliance costs are much lower at $130 per firm. (12) Where a public or community housing body leases housing from a landlord in order to on-lease the housing to public or community housing tenants, the lease by the public or community housing body will generally be input taxed in the same way as a direct lease between a landlord and a tenant. That is, the lease will not be subject to GST, but the lessor will not be allowed to claim input tax credits. An exception is where the lease is a long term lease (50 years or more) and the housing is new residential premises. This would be treated in the same way as a new home purchase for where the purchase or lease cost is subject to the GST and any subsequent sub-leasing is input taxed. (13) No such modelling or projections have been undertaken within the Department of Family and Community Services, but there is no reason to expect any reduction in private sector engagement in the provision of public housing. (14) It is not envisaged that any households are likely to be forced out of their current accommodation because of increased rents following the introduction of a GST. Indeed, a range of personal income tax cuts, family benefits, increased pensions, benefits, rent assistance and lump sum payments for retirees will more than compensate for any projected rent increases once the GST is intro(15) The Department of Family and Community currently only holds data in relation to (c). the It is taken from ABS C-data 1996 which indicates that the number of persons living in caravan parks in each State and Territory is as follows: New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Australian Capital Territory Other Territories The Department does not have this data broken down income.

From 1 January 1999 people lodging in ""boarding house style"" accommodation such as private hotels, boarding houses and hostels have been exempted from the sharers rate of Rent Assistance (RA). The implementation of this measure was brought forward from 1 July 1999 to fast-track additional assistance for disadvantaged people who were adversely affected by the 1997 sharers measure. Young Unemployed Persons (Question No. 444) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 17 February 1999: Further to the answer to question No. 204 (Hansard, 8 February 1999, page 2121), how many of the 11 649 young unemployed persons referred to in part (2) of the answer as having commenced Mutual Obligation activities at 27 November 1998 had commenced training in (a) literacy and numeracy, (b) career counselling and (c) job placement and employment training. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The matter raised in the question falls within the responsibility of the Hon Dr David Kemp MP, Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who has advised me that, as at 27 November 1998, Centrelink data showed 11 649 had commenced a mutual obligation activity. Of these participants, 17 had commenced literacy and numeracy training, 39 had commenced career counselling and 32 had been placed in Job Placement, Employment and Training. The other participants were in other mutual obligation activities such as education and training, part time work, voluntary work, job search training, intensive assistance and work for the dole. Work for the Dole Projects (Question No. 445) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 17 February 1999: (1) How many work-for-the-dole projects are operating in the electoral division of Canberra. (2) Which organisations are involved in running work-for-the-dole projects in the electoral division of Canberra. (3) Where are the projects located. (4) How many (a) voluntary and (b) compulsory participants are there in each project. (5) What is the duration of each project.

Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One (2) The Southside Community Services Inc. (3) Narrabundah. (4) A total of eight participants. From 1 July 1998, enhanced Mutual Obligation arrangements were introduced. Under these arrangements unemployed young people may be required to undertake an activity additional to job search in return for their unemployment payments. In many cases they are able to select an activity of their choice from a menu of Mutual Obligation activities. As Work for the Dole is one of the activities that can be selected it is no longer relevant to distinguish between voluntary and compulsory participation. (5) Six months. (6) Seven out of the eight participants reside in the postcode areas. Medicare Offices: Quality of Service Survey (Question No. 449) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 189 (Hansard, 11 February 1999, page 2455), was the figure of 10 minutes obtained from research undertaken at the Hurstville Medicare Office. (2) Will he request the Health Insurance Commission to undertake research on the quality of service in specific Medicare Offices, particularly the waiting time of customers at the Hurstville Medicare Office.",193
35,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BARUSSALAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Health Insurance Commission's Charter of Care sets 10 minutes as its target maximum waiting time. (2) The quality of service in all Medicare Offices is always being monitored and procedures adjusted where necessary to guide the Health Insurance Commission towards it goal of greater customer focus. . Electorate Offices: Internet Access (Question No. 451) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: (1) Has his Department conducted a trial to provide Internet access to certain Members' and Senators' electorate offices; if so (a) which Members' and Senators' offices were involved and (b) has the trial been evaluated; if so, was it successful. (2) Will his Department extend Internet access to all Members' and Senators' electorate offices. (3) Is it a fact that many Government departments and agencies refer persons seeking information to their Wodd Wide Web sites; if so, is it also a fact that it is difficult for Members, Senators and their staff to conduct inquiries effectively on behalf of constituents if their electorate offices do not have access to the Internet. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1. Senator Eric Abetz 2- Mr Kevin Andrews MP 3. The Hon Larry Anthony MP 4.

36,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,BARUSSALAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Over the period of 1 February 1998 to 28 February 1999 inclusive, statistics for exemption requests for drugs with Therapeutic Group Premiums processed by the Health Insurance Commission are as follows: (a) Applied for (b) Authorised Rejected 51 51 0 34938 34698 240 7355 7306 49 5973 5934 39 11 846 11762 84 49375 48985 390 (1) Each drug Cimetidine Ranitidine Hydrochloride Farnotidine (2) and (3) The bulk of the products delisted as a result of decisions in the 1996/97 Budget had a dispensed price less than the copayment for general patients ($20 at the time). In addition, the bulk of the items delisted due to those Budget decisions were also available as over-the-counter (OTC) items and could already be purchased at a cheaper retail price by general patients through this avenue. Once a product is delisted from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Government does not collect data on subsequent sales of these products which are sold as either private prescription items through pharmacies only, or as OTC items through pharmacies and supermarkets. Department of Defence: Contract with Drake International (Question No. 467) Mr Bevis asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 March 1999: Did the Department of Defence enter a contract in July 1998 with Drake International allowing them to employ approximately 140 workers at the South Queensland Logistic group at Enoggera, Qld; if so, (a) what was the term of the contract, (b) what level of funding did the Department provide to enable the workers to be employed, (c) were 32 of the workers made redundant from 18 March 1999; if so, why and (d) has the Department reduced its funding under the contract; if so, (i) why and (ii) what is the level of the reduction. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth has a contract with Drake Industrial to provide personnel services for the servicing, repair, modification, and overhaul of Army vehicles and technical equipment 'in-situ' at Army premises in Brisbane. The sites in Brisbane are 7th Task Force (7TF) Enoggera and South Queensland Logistic Group (SQLG) Bulimba, Meeandah and Banyo. SQLG is the Contract Manager. The number of personnel employed by the Contractor varies in accordance with the rate of military training involving 7TF and SQLG.

(a) Applied for (b) Authorised Rejected 153 152 1 455 445 10 13 187 13 018 169 (b) The contract with Drake Industrial employees is for personnel services for the servicing, repair, modification and overhaul of Army vehicles and technical equipment. It does not specify a level of personnel Drake must employ, which is a matter for Drake International. (c) This is a matter for Drake International. Defence's contract was for provision of services and did not specify employee numbers. The level of services provided under the contract has been satisfactory. I note that the level of services is meant to vary in accordance with the rates of military training activities involving 7TF and SQLG.

(a)-(g) Consistent with past practice, the Australiana Fund has not informed me of the cost of the table or the details of the supplier and the Fund's selection process. However I am aware that the Fund's purchases are made in accordance with its acquisition policy. I am also aware that the table is Australian, dating from· around 1830, and is constructed of Australian cedar. (h) Yes.
