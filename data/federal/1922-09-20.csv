1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PAPER. The following paper was presented:Commonwealth Bank Act-Commonwealt h Bank of Australia-Aggregat e Balancesheet at 30th June, 1022; together with the Auditor-General's Report thereon. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",13
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In this morning's Age big headlines appear over the report - of the discussion which took place yesterday about the .situation in the Near East, and it ie therein stated that' the Government's pledge was endorsed by the House. I wish to say that the only question 'before the Houlse at the time was. that an extract from a certain'morningnewspaper' be (printed, and I made the position of my party perfectly clear. The Prime Minister told us thatThere is no need to talk now about sendinga contingent of troops from Australia. The situation as it now standi) is well in hand. It is a well-known rule of debate here that to provide an opportunity for disoussion a motion must be submitted, and the Prime Minister stated that, in order to facilitate the discussion of the matter that ho was bringing before the House, he would move ""That the.paper be printed,"" holding up a copy of the Argus, from which he had read a statement he had made. Had.not some such motion been moved no honourable member could have followed the Prime Minister without, the express leave of the House.",13
3,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said ""this paper,"" pointing to a particular part of the newspaper that he held in his. hand.",13
4,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,He proposed ' that his statement should .be printed.,13
5,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ' have looked up the records of the House, and am sure of my position. I said that I would have moved an amendment had it not 'been for the statement of the Prime Minister. I anticipate that before a contingent is sent from this oountry Parliament, will be consulted, and if that happens I shall put the position of the Labour party before the House and the people. LTNEMPLOTED RELIEF.",13
6,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Has the attention' of the Treasurer been drawn to the fact that the inland cities are prevented from' participating in the Commonwealth grant for the relief of the unemployed? I ask the honourable gentleman to see if the restriction that exists cannot' be removed, so that these cities may take advantage of the grant and provide work for the large armies of unemployed in our midst?",13
7,Mr BRTJOE,Unknown,"The only condition"" placed on 'the expenditure of the grant by the Commonwealth'Government was that the money should be used for developmental purposes. The grant was not a charity dole; it was intended that the money should be spent on developmental work which, by affording employment, would assist those in distress. The Government will have to adhere to that condition.",13
8,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Will the Government make it known to the municipalities that the money has been granted for expenditure upon main Toads ? There is some misunderstanding about the purpose of the grant.,14
9,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The money must either be spent on main roads or on developmental work, such as the making of district roads, in either case, outside municripaJitiee, and preference of employment must be given to returned soldiers ASSISTANCE TO FRUIT-GROWERS.",14
10,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"There is great anxiety in Tasmania about the marketing of this season's fruit, because of the uncertainty as to what the Government intend to do. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs df it is intended to - form a Pool this year, or to leave the marketing of f r u it to private enterprise!",14
11,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The Government having received representations from'the United Fruit-growers National Conference, and having heard the views of others interested, have formed the opinion that it is necessary to assist the producers in the marketing of their crop this year, though it has not been decided what form the assistance shall take. The honourable member, I think, refers to f r u it suitable for canning. Beyond that I do not think the Government - oould go. We have consulted the States, and have sug- ' gested the holding of a conference on the' 28th instant. SITUATION IN THE NEAR EAST. ister - CORRESPONDENCE) WITH BRITISH GOVERNMENT.",14
12,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister (received a cablegram today from Mr Lloyd George giving full aniormaThe tion about the position in the Near and, if so, will it .be made available to the House ?",14
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have received no cable conveying any information of any sort or kind' other than that which I reHouse 1 ceived on Sunday. Yesterday, I gave to the House the whole"" of the information contained in that message, although I did not read it word for word, and I now again invite the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) to come to my office and see the cable for himself. Another cablegram certainly came to hand yesterday, but its contents were published in the newspapers in extenso by, Mr Lloyd George. It referred to the satisfaction which had been expressed in Great Britain at the receipt of the information that the Commonwealth was prepared to associate itself with the Mother Country. That exhauslts all the communications I . have received from Mr Lloyd George or the British Government in regard to the - matter. Any other information which has come to hand has been contained in despatches which .are at least six to eight weeks old, and have no reference whatever to the (present situation. I may add that I said yesterday, in the course of my speech, that the British Government had been, asked to supply us with full and precise information. I repeat that all that we have had so far was conveyed in the' one cable the substance of which, without exception, I gave to the House yesterday.",14
14,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I desire to supplement the question submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. Has the right honourable gentleman sent any communication to the British Government based upon proceedings in this Chamber yesterday?,14
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"After the proceedings had terminated here yesterday, I sent a communication to Mr Lloyd George. It is the only message which has gone from myself to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.",14
16,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minany objection to laying on the table of the House the message forwarded to Mr Lloyd George 1 - Mr HUGHES - It is not usual to lay such cables on the table of Parliament. honourable member talks very abEast, surdly, more absurdly than usual.",14
17,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Wi U the right honourable gentleman give to the House the pui-port of the communication he sent yesterday after the proceedings in this Question not answered.,14
18,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, is it an absurd and improper question to ask to what extent the country may hav§ been compromised by any communication sent from our Prime Minister to the Imperial Government?",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, Does the honourable member desire - a withdrawal of the remark?,15
20,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Yes .,15
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As the honourable member takes exception to a remark made by the Prime Minister in reply to a question, I must ask the right honourable gentleman to withdraw the expression.",15
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,O E withdraw it.,15
23,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation. In a section of this morning's press, it was made to appear that the carrying, on the voices, of . the motion moved by the Prime Minister yesterday here, involved the endorsement of what the right honourable gentle. man has communicated to the British Prime Minister in connection with the situation in the Near East. That entirely misrepresents my attitude. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - And ours also. « Mr BRENNAN - I have not the slightest doubt about that, but I am speaking for myself.",15
24,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I have already spoken on behalf of the party.,15
25,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am .pleased to hear that. While the right honourable gentleman was speaking, I kept silent. It required a prodigious effort on my part, almost unexampled in the history of my association with this Parliament. have only to say that my feeling, in regard to the right honourable gentleman's message was one of intense amusement, faintly tinged with contempt. NA COMMITTEES.",15
26,Mr MCGRATH,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"On Thursday last, I asked a question in reference to the closing of .the Repatriation Offices! in Ballarat and Bendigo. Can, the Honorary Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation give the. House any information as to the intentions of the Minister in regard to the closing of those offices?",15
27,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"I answered the honourable member's question on Friday, and, as far as I can remember, I said that the Department of Repatriation had provided certain paid officers to assist Local Repatriation Committees, and that, in view of the work having diminished, it had been decided to withdraw the officers, but not to interfere with the operations of the Local Committees. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). SHEARING DISPUTE: ARBITRATION AWABD,",15
28,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""Tlhe judgment and award of Mr Justice Powers in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, in the case of the Australian Workers Union versus The Pastoralists Federal Council and others, and matters connected therewith."" Five honourable members having* risen in their - places,",15
29,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Whether a subject of this nature is one that with propriety can be discussed on a special motion for the adjournment of the House is a matter of some doubt, and I think must depend largely on the tone and scope, of the discussion. But, having regard to the /act that the honourable member for Darling has been debarred from ventilating the subject on a substantive motion, by I the decision of the House to give precedence on all sitting days to Government business, I do not feel justified in ruling the motion out of order, provided it is clearly understood that, under cover of this motion, no attack or personal reflection ,can be made upon the Judge or the Court, nor can the conduct of the Judge be debated.",15
30,Mr BRENNAN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"A m I to understand - that, under no circumstances, may a motion be moved in this House, the arguments in connection with which must necessarily involve reflections on the actions of a Judge in his judicial capacity? I understood that it was quite proper to attack judicial conduct, or to utter criticism of a judicial decision in a way which possibly involved reflections on a Judge, provided it was don© by a motion. This motion, of course, is for the adjournment of the House; hut would it not be fitting, and within the .Standing Orders^ to give the House the fullest and freest opportunity to discuss the Judge's conduct, as well as the award he made, and all the circumstances relevant thereto which we think should be ventilated ?",15
31,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"No , that is not permissible. All parliamentary authorities are agreed that such a discussion cannot be raised on a motion for the .adjournment of the House. If the conduct of a Judge is to he made the subject of criticism by Parliament, it can only he upon a substantive motion.' For the information of the House I may, perhaps, read what May has to say on the matterCertain matters cannot be debated, save upon a substantive motion which can be dealt with by amendment, or by the distinct vote of the House, such as the conduct of the Sovereign, the Heir to the Throne, the Viceroy and Governor General of India, the LordLieuteftant of Ireland, the Speaker, the Chairman of Ways and Means, members of either Houses of Parliament, and Judges of the superior Courts of the United Kingdom, including .persons holding the position of a Judge, such as a Judge in a Court of Bankruptcy, and of a County Court. These matters cannot, therefore, be questioned by way of amendment, nor upon a motion for adjournment understanding order No. 17. The conduct of a Judge cannot be discussed on a motion of this kind, and, therefore, the .present discussion must, be"" confined to the award and such matters as do not involve criticism and reflection on the Judge.",16
32,Mr HUGHES,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Would that apply if he were President of the Court and not a Judge, or does it apply only because he is a Judge ? I point out that the Deputy Presidents and the Chairman of the Coal Board are not Judges. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not taking sides in the matter at all, but only desire - to know whether the distinction is' to be drawn between the President, because he is a Judge, and Deputy-Presidents and - the Chairman of the Coal Tribunal, who are not Judges. If these latter may be criticised while the President of the Court may not be criticised, not because he is President of the Court, but because he is also a Judge,, then, to a certain extent, we are hampered in dealing with the (matter. I , of course, take a different view of the matter from that of my friend - opposite, but there is the position, and I desire your ruling, Mr Speaker. - Mr ANSTEY - Has the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) yet committed any offence against the Standing Orders ?",16
33,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"No. The Prime. Minister (Mr Hughes) deals with a hypothetical case, on which I do not feel called upon to give a ruling. If a case of that kind arises I shall be prepared to deal - with it ; but in the present case the motion deals with an award of a Judge of the Court. I have mentioned the matter at this stage to avoid, if I can, any occasion to intervene while debate is in progress. Question, proposed.",16
34,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Darling) [2.55] - I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) for giving me - warning as to what may befall me if I - transgress the rules of the House. This, 1 think, is the sixth attempt I have made here to ventilate the very extraordinary judgment given by Mr Justice Powers, the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There is a mass of material connected with the matter, and the time at my disposal will not allow me to' use it all. I do not desire to do the Judge any injustice, and I shall carefully give extracts from his own judgment, and use his own words as they appear in the transcript and minutes. May I say that in this Parliament it should be possible for any member, if he so desires, to submit a motion censuring a Judge and asking for his removal? But when I moved a motion, which was practically one of censure on Mr Justice Powers, it was placed at the bottom of the business-paper, and the Government refused to allow it to he discussed. Personally, I do not think that a man occupying a high judicial position should continue in office in the face of such a motion. To give an idea of the extraordinary circumstances in connection with this particular award, I shall refer, as briefly as possible,- to some of the incidents during the hearing. I take full responsibility for my action in dealing with this important matter, which involves between 40,000 and 50,000 men in Australia. The shearing industry is held up; sheds which should have been "" cut out"" three months ago are still without labour, and at the award rates are likely to continue without labour. This will mean a great loss to the country, and a great loss to the workers, because they are without shearing. I shall give one 'illustration of the many mistakes which have been made, and it is an extraordinary mistake on the part of a Judge occupying the highest position in the Industrial Courts of Australia. In one portion of his judgment, which appears in the Commonwealth Arbitration Records, he said that if a man sheared 200 sheep a day at 30s. per 100 this equalled £3 10s. This ought to have been stated as £ 3 ; hut, on the rate of £3 10s., the Judge declared that a shearer would receive £19 5s. per week.",16
35,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Does the honourable member say that that is in the first award Mr. Justice Powers made?,17
36,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,That is one of the incidents during the many hearings of the . case. Mr GROOM: - It is not in the award.,17
37,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"No , it is not in the award, it is in the judgment. A school boy of ithe second class could not make such a mistake, or, if he did, he would very hurriedly remedy it. That mistake of the Judge, however, still stands.",17
38,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Does the honourable member eay that that mistake is incorporated in the award?,17
39,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,No .,17
40,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,You say it still stands.,17
41,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"That was one of the reasons given when Mr .Justice Powers gave an award for 35s. In the first judgment, delivered on 5th May, 1922, His Honour fixed the shearing rate at 30s. per 100, and shed hands' wages at £3 per week. Four pages of his judgment were occupied in proving to the respondents and applicants before him that 30s. (per 100 was a fair rate; and, after he-had proved this to his own satisfaction, he suddenly discovered that he had made a mistake. Later on, based on such reasons as I have indicated, he fixed the rate at 35s. On page 16 of his judgment, Mr Justice Powers saysAs it is proposed, to fix the basic wage at the same rate as in the 1917 award, because the rate is fair now, the shearers and other piece-work rates and wages will remain the same as in the old award. I am satisfied that the 30s. rate will secure to the shearers in 1922-23-24 much better returns than it did, or, at any rate, what the Court intimated it would return to the average shearer in the days when .the 30s. was first fixed. As. a (inatteir of fact the basic wage for 1916 waa 63s. (vide page 71 March .Bulletin, No. 87, index No. 1324, equals 10s. 6d. per day, 63s. per week; whereas same Bulletin, page 73, shows index No. for March, 1922, as 1630, equals 13s. 4d. per day,""or 80s. per week). The old claim was based upon the 1915 index figures as. to cost of living (vide same Bulletin, page 71 index figure 1278, equal td 10s.. 2d. per day, or 61s. per week). That claim was for 30s. per 100, and though the case was not heard until about June, 1917, when 30s. was not a fair rate; yet, because it - was the limit asked for, and tthe claim could not be amended, that rate was"" awarded by consent of the parties, the Court having noi power to' do anything else. The rat© of 30s. was based upon the known-procedure of the Court; but, before we could obtain our award, the cost of .living had increased so rapidly that we were really entitled to the 32s. 6d. per 100. However, as I have just mentioned, we were legally prevented from securing anything better. Before making his award final, His Honour discovered that something 'had gone wrong with his figures, and ne altered the rate from 30s. per 100 and £ 3 per week, to 35s. per 100 and £3 10s. per week. And he said he had never intended to do anything else. ' That was after he had occupied four pages in order to justify his judgment for 30s. per 100. This, though an improvement on the first intimation, is not a fair award. His Honour; on 'page 24 of his statement,- says, "" On the whole I am satisfied that 25 per cent, lost time is reasonable for the whole expedition/' On page 25 he saysIn the judgment, when making the award in 1911, it was apparently accepted as a fair estimate that whatever average number of sheep were shorn' at .n shed, the average number for the time of the expedition was about 338 per week. Those figures appear to have, been accepted in 1917. His Honour further says, on the same pageOn the evidence before, although it was shown in 1.912 that shearers averaged whilst at the sheds 439 sheep per week, I do not think, even allowing for the better organization in some districts to secure a run of sheds, that shearers generally had increased the average for the expedition from 338 to more than 350. His Honour has evidently made a very grave error here. I quote now f r o Mr Justice Higgins' printed judgment of 1911, page 16Another aspect of the figures of Mr. jamin has been supplied to me hy Mr Jordan, an accountant of the claimant. The more preparties were collecting statistics. cise average of sheep shorn per week (start to finish of the shea) are, according to BenjaminQueensland ... ... ... 464 New South Wales ... ... 353 South Australia proper ... 345 South-East South Australia and Port Lincoln ... ... 308 Victoria ... ... ... 346 Total 1,815 Divide by the number of States, namely, equals 363. Leaving out Queensland, because it is the caseNew South Wales ... ... 353 South Australia proper ... 345 Victoria ... ... ... 345 South-East South Australia and Port Lincoln ... ... 308 Total Divide by 4, equals 338. Both results are the average of the shed, allowing 25 per cent, for lost time on the expedition, and taking that at twenty weeks. Average at shed ... ... 338 Multiply by working weeks of expedition to get . . . . ... Average - for expedition ... 5,080 Divide by 20, equals 254. This shows that instead of the average being, as His Honour states, 338 for the whole of the expedition, it shows only 254. Y e the bases his award on an average of 350 sheep per week-roughly , 100 more than f 911-17. The respondents put in evidence to show that shearers averaged 439 per week while at the shed, and though we had no returns to On show anything different, it is to assume that the average shearer does 100 per week more now than formerly. There may he a slight difference^ owing better organization of runs, but nothing of to account for any such increase. On page 2 5 A of his f o u r t h judgment His Honour saysAssuming that 439 sheep a week is the average while at the sheds, it is clear four weeks the number of sheep shorn by shearer would be 1,756; hut if 25 per cent, fair for lost time, it would take five weeks to shear them, and that would mean only 351 sheep per week. I cannot, therefore, basement shows:rates on 439 sheep, even if it is an average. But His Honour does base his rates on the 350 sheep per week, which is also should Mr Blakeley. wrong. If 439 sheep per week at the shed m is right, and 25 per cent, for lost time is fair , then the average number of sheep over the whole expedition is 329; and even Benthat total is 75 sheep per week more than shearers were shown to average when both The Mr reason why they can now show a 439 average per week is, most likely, because they knew we we're not collecting statistics; and they probably selected the sheds to show what they wanted. This view is borne out when one remembers that, in the hours case, a few months before the general .case, the respondents tried to prove five, to the Court that the shearer averaged from 5 to 27 per oent. fewer sheep in not in forty-four: hours than he did in fortyeight. I interpose at this stage to give a brief history of the case of the Australian ""Workers Union versus the Pastoralists' Federal Council and others. I shall 1,351 tabulate the particulars according to dates, as follows:Sydney -3rd , 4th, Sth, 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th, and 12th April-Hearing . Melbourne - St h May-Reason s given and proposed award. 12th May-Speakin g to 15 minutes. 18th May-Propose d final award and schedules announced. 26th May-Discussio n after parties had perused forms of agreements, &c. 31st May-Fina l award delivered and signed. 26th June-Intimatio n by Deputy President that he will hear respective representatives as to alleged miscalculations and errors. Sydney -14t h July-Partie s apply in chambers in accordance with above intimation. Melbourne -21s t July-Judgmen t on above chamber application delivered. page 26 of the judgment H is Honour ridiculous is reported to have said'I would not be safe in fixing rates on more than 400 a week as an average in sheds durto ing the term of the award for all seasons, pr more than 350 sheep a week for the time the expedition. It will be noted that if 400 at the start is right, and 25 per cent, is taken off for lost time, the average for the expedition that in is only 300 per week. His Honour only a allowed 12^ per cent, off by starting at is 350. Nevertheless he does it , as the f o l lowing further quotation from his judgHaving determined with some hesitation the matters referred to, I propose to see what be the rates fixed on Mr Allen's basis. That basis is as follows: The 'basis wage for shearers if on wages .. .. Margin for skill .. .. {Twenty-five .per cent, of £4 16s., loss of time generally during expedition .. Fares and travelling expenses .. - ' The basis wage includes the husband's food at home . . . . 0 14 0 That would be th© amount a shearer would get if he were a wages man and shore only 50 sheep a day, but in all awards made by this Court for piece-workers the rates fixed are from 10 per cent, to 33 per cent, more than on wages. If 20 (i9s. 2d.) iper cent, is added for piece-work, it ' would amount to about £6 l is . 2d. It would be necessary on these figures to give to the average shearer about 35s. per 100, if the average number he shore per week for the time of the expedition were 350 in order to secure to him £6 12s. 6d. Out of that amount he would have to pay his mess account of 25s. per week and 6s. per week for fares. It will be noted that 350 sheep at 35s. per 100 will only give £6 2s. 6d., not, as stated, £6 12s. 6d. His Honour says that the discrepancy is due to a typist's error, but most likely it was not, as he was testing a sum of £6 l is . 2d., and by making a mistake of 10s. in the sum misled himself. To produce £6 12s. 6d. it would require 38s. per 100, not 35s. as stated, but if the actual ayerage in the shed on the respondents' ownfiguresare taken, 325, over 40s. per 100 will be required to produce £6 12s. 6d. On page 9 of the Judge's 'final remarks he is reported to have saidThere are good reasons, in my opinion, why Queensland rates could reasonably be higher than a Federal rate for all other States. The Judge had no evidence at all with regard to conditions in Queensland. There was evidence for that State before the Court in 1911, when the pastoralists pleaded for a lower rate in the southern States than in Queensland. President (Mr Justice Higgins), who had the evidence of all the States before him, said {Commonwealth Arbitration Report No. 5, page 84)If any discrimination in rates ought to be made as between States the rate ought to be lower for Queensland, for the sheep generally Per Week. are in Queensland easier to shear and the £ s. d. tallies are greater for a day's work; and pwing to the prevalence of dry weather in the shearing months the average earnings from 3 18 0 start to finish' are higher. 0 ,18 0 Let me now give an illustration of the chaos which this award has caused in the . . 1 4 0 pastoral industry. I quote from the re0 6 0 port published in the Australian Worker Total . . . . 6 6 0 of 30th August of the case of the Graziers Association versus H . E. Boote, who wascharged with continuing a strike. This 5 12"" 0 was after Mr Barnes and I had been fined £100, and had been told by the magistrate that if we came - before him again he would be compelled to sentence us to imprisonment without the option of a fine. When an award is responsible for such chaos as exists in the pastoral industry, and is based upon such extraordinary miscalculations, no citizen who resists it should be charged with a criminal offence, and possibly gaoled. That is probably what will happen to some of us before this case is finished.",17
42,Mr CONSIDINE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Neve r mind; I shall come to see you.,19
43,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"I went to see the honourable member when he was in. gaol, and it would be only fair if he were to return the compliment. I only hope that my durance is as pleasant as was that of the honourable member, who had fruit, cigarettes, and plenty of reading matter, the warder coming at 5 o'clock in the evening and saying, "" Mr Considine, your room is ready."" If I can serve my time in a Victorian gaol, I shall not object so much. In the Graziers versus Booie case, the following evidence - was reported: Clarence Spier, manager of the Graziers Cooperative Shearing Company, said that under normal conditions tliere was no difficulty about getting men for shearing, but this year it was very difficult 'to get men. When it was known that 35s. was the rate, the men generally stated that they would not accept, and would stand out for_ Queensland rates. There had been great difficulty in getting labour right up to the present time. William Henry Eyres, a shearing contractor, said that he was a. member of the Merriwa Contract Company. There was no difficulty in getting labour during normal years. There The then was difficulty this year, the difficulty first manifesting itself about mid-June. . . . The witness said he was at Coonong on 12th July. The shearers .were there, but they did not start. Foster Francis Cooper, organizer of the Graziers Co-operative Shearing Company, said there was plenty of labour offering an normal years, but this year there was practically no labour offering at all. Since the Federal award came out there had been no labour offering. Herbert Lionel Davies, manager of the Federal Pastoral Shearing - Company, said under normal conditions there was no difficulty in obtaining shearers no difficulty about labour last year, but this year, as soon as the new award was announced, there was a very decided slackening off in both verbal and written applications. They had not been able to get all the labour necessary. Many men.refused work when he said he was paying award. rates. The difficulty in getting labour continued right up 'to. the present. Arthur Stanley Long, a shearing contractor, said that in normal times there was sufficient labour offering TMs year it had been very difficult to get men since the award was announced. A lot of men applied 'for work and then refused it. Charles MCDonnell, a member of a shearing contracting firm, and Thomas Bell Eyre, manager of Bringagee station, gave similar evidence. There have been strikes all over New South Wales. In South Australia practically the whole of the sheds, so far as we know, are shearing at £2 per 100. The contractors and pastoralists are paying the £2 without any demur, recognising, I believe, as quite a number of the squatters do, that the award is based upon wrong grounds, and that miscalculations and mistakes occurred, as a result of which the men are not getting a fair deal. On page 13 of his judgment, the President, after mentioning that different methods of calculating the rates for shearing had been suggested, saidFor instance, although the purchasing power of money increased as a matter of fact it decreasedby at least 2s. between 1907 and 1911, Mr Justice Higgins in 1911 found that 24s. a 100, the rate fixed in 1907, would give to the shearer under the then existing conditions, for the reasons mentioned by him, all he- were arrived at. was fairly entitled to during the expedition, and fixed the same rate in 1911 as was fixed in 1907, 24s. per 100. The Judge has made many errors. Did time permit, I could give, I think, twelve illustrations of the extraordinary attitude of his mind in dealing with this case. I do not know whether he personally arrived at the figures that he used or relied upon"" the calculations of some one else. If the calculations were his own, his education in arithmetic was sadly neglected, but in any case he was responsible for the correctness of the figures' used. One instance of the absurdity of Ifr. Blakeley. his calculations is the working out of' 200 sheep at 30s. per 100 asi £ 3 10s. There is not the slightest chance of the shearers working under the award, and no There was hope of peace in the pastoral industry under it . Next' year the men will be even more solid than they are this year. The pastoralists - may believe themselves strong, but we feel that we are much stronger. . We will not work under the award, and refuse to abide by its conditions. ' From 1907 to 1922 the Australian Workers Union worked under Arbitration Court awards and agreements.",19
44,Sir GRANVILLE TRTRIE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,The awards were in their favour all the time.,20
45,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"No . In 1917 we' claimed 30s., allowing a margin on the cost of living, which did not then entitle us to quite so much. Because of the congestion of business it was six months before the case could be heard, and by that time the cost of living had increased so. much that we were entitled to 32s. 6d-; but the law prevented us from claiming more than our original demand. During, the war we could have compelled the pastoralists, if we had wished to do so, to pay £3 per 100.",20
46,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,The . honourable member's time has expired.,20

48,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,There can be no extension.,20
49,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Then I urge the Government to seriously consider this matter. Let the Minister call for a report on this judgment from the Statistician's branch. I am sure that any such report would show that the figures-, used were wrong, and that wrong results I hope the Government will take steps to right the injustice that has been done.",20
50,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Darling Downsr-Attorney-General) [3.24] - I am sorrv that the honourable member did not pay me the usual courtesy of informing me of h i * intention to discuss this matter this afternoon, and of letting me know the lines on which he intended to proceed.",20
51,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,I am sorry that I did not do that.,20
52,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"The result of th» honourable member's neglect is that I am not so fully equipped with information as I would have been under other circumstances - I wish to say at the beginning that Parliament is not the place in which to review the judgments of the Arbitration Court. Were every honourable member to use his position here to get legal cases discussed in Parliament with a view to influencing decisions, the Courts would lose their character as judicial tribunals. - The Arbitration Court is part of our legal machinery. Parties have the right to go before it , and to submit to it the whole of their case, and law-abiding citizens in a Democracy, having the right to govern themselves, will abide by the decisions of such a Court, whether they like them or not. That is the proper attitude towards the judgment of all' the .Courts in a properly ordered community. Any other attitude towards them would produce chaos. Parties cannot go to a Court, take any benefit that may result from its judgments, and flout its jurisdiction when decisions go against them. The honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) has made an ex parte statement. I am not in a position at this moment to criticise it in detail. ' He based his case on remarks made by Mr Justice Powers during the progress of a trial; but what We have to ask is, Does the award do substantial justice? The honourable member cannot say that there was not every opportunity for his union to - put before the Court, every possible phase of its case - put before the Court what it considered",20
53,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,We did that ,21
54,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"The other side had the : same opportunity, and the Judge, after weighing the pros and cons, what he believed to be a fair and just award. Yet, no sooner was it delivered union 'than one of the parties refused to obey of it. The men were incited by their leaders, including the honourable member himself, to disobey the award. Accordingly, the matter came before the High Court, and judgment. Mr Justice Higgins, in delivering in > that Brisbane .the judgment of that Court, typist said It is' the duty of the union, when it obtains an< award, which in some' respects it thinks to be unjust tp its members, not to forbid the members to accept work under the terms of the award. ""There is the umpire's verdict; we do not agree with it in clause Z, but we 'cannot enjoy what is givenby clauses A to Y, and at the same time tell our members not to submit to clause Z . "" . The award must be, accepted as a whole. But even if l l r . Stumm's - construction of the section is right, how can l t - be said that the incitement was. not unreasonable under the circumstances? He spoke of the right that was given .to the union, if it sees a clear mistake made, to apply to the President to vary the award to rectify the mistake. We have not considered, we have no right to consider, we refuse to consider, whether there was any mistake in fact made by the ' President in his calculations. In face of this right to apply for a variation, how can this High Court say that the incitement to refuse employment is not unreasonable, when the .' union has made no application whether to vary the award in respect of that part which the union declared to be in. error ? The honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) based his case on a mistake in calculation, but Mr Justice Powers in -. dicated that he was quite prepared to hear any application to vary the award on the ground of mistakes.",21
55,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"We went before Mr. Justice Powers again, but that made no difference. : Mr GROOM - The Judge-heard the union's application.",21
56,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Bu the does not comprehend it ; that is the extraordinary part of the affair.,21
57,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"It is the honourable member's attitude that is incomprehen] sible. The union had its opportunity to mistakes,, and it .did so, and Mr Justice Powers, in a carefully reasoned judgment, dealt with every aspect of the case.' Referring"" to the miscalculations. that have pronounced been spoken of, he saidThe miscalculation or error on - which the principally relies was an error in copying the judgment by typing £6 12s. 6d. instead £6 2s. 6d. as the result of multiplying 35s. by 3* (300 at 35s. a 100) , equal to £0 2s. Gd. He shows that tlhe error did not affect his It has been referred to as if I could hot do simple sum correctly; and because the put in £6 12s. Gd. instead of £6.2s. Gd. it. has been, contended that I . intended'to give ' over 37s.' 6d. a 100 at least instead of 3os. a 100 He says furtherI t is true that since the award was made the Statistician's figures .show that the.cost of living has risen during the presentquarter, 'but I cannot take that into consideration on this application - - The union protested against the rate being subject to quarterly adjustments, preferring to leave increases of the rates during the term because of the increased cost of living to be granted by the Court on application to vary the award. It ought not to be forgotten in considering the request-(1 ) That the award rates in 1911 and 1917 were based on forty-eight hours a week, and the present award rates are based on forty-four hours a week; (2) the present award grants better conditions to shearers than in former awards, including lower prices for meat and stores than in previous awards; (3) although the thirty-towns' rates are based on the prices supplied to the Statistician by shopkeepers for meat and other food, shearers have to be supplied with meat at from 3d. to 4d. a lb., and other stores at only 7£ per cent, on their actual cost to the station; (4) the .basic rate of £3 18s. a week on which the shearers' rates were fixed is 12s. per week higher than the rural basic rate in New South Wales fixed by the Board of Trade in force - in June last and at the present time. The majority of sheep to be shorn under the award are in New South Wales; (5) the pastoralists of New Zealand offer to the shearers in June, 1922, iwas 20s. a 100 for flock sheep, but rates Jiave not been definitely settled.' Then he adds this reminderProm 1886 to 1907, for twenty-one years fore the Arbitration Court was constituted (although strikes had taken place to secure higher rates), the shearing rate was 20s. Since then the Court raised the rate, first, is. a 100; then because of the increased of living by 10s.; then by agreement by 20s. 100 (because the Court could have been applied to if no agreement had been made and retrocourse spective rates allowed). Surely when the cost of living has decreased by16s. since the 1920 shearing season-equa l to 7s. 2d. a 100-the union is not justified, cause the Court acts consistently and reduces the rate in partbecause of the decreased of living, in refusing to advise its members observe the award of 35s. a 100, and prive all its members of the benefit of arbitration, which has done so much for the shearers and its other members since 1906-and country generally-by avoiding the necessity of direct action to secure what the Court (not the union or pastoralists) considers fair rates for shearing and other work done members of the union. I am not here as an advocate of one side or the other.",21

65,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"I withdraw it, and say that the Judge is a very extraordinary Judge, and declare that it is a very extraordinary Government that stands behind him.",22
66,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"It was the union, and not the pastoralists, which went to the Court. Obviously, if I go to a Court and ask for a judgment, I agree to abide by the decision given; otherwise, it is hypocrisy on my part to go to the Court. The honourable member for Darling admits that all the facts were placed before the President of the Court. Both sides were heard, and the Judge, holding the balance fairly between them in an endeavour to do what was righ t as between beparty and party, as it was his duty to do, gave his award. The honourable member a 100. then went through the country conveying by the erroneous impression that the award cost given was based upon a mistake, and in a citing men not to abide by it . In this of action he and the other members of the executive of his union were checked by an injunction from a Court. The next step, taken by the union, was a further beappeal to the President of the Arbitration Court, who afforded them every opcost portunity to show where any mistake had to been made in his judgment. He allowed thus dethem to apply for a variation of the award, but on a reconsideration of that the award the Judge held that it was sound, and that no error or mistake had been made by him . In that judgment, which has been circulated to honourable memby bers, he justifies his award. The next step we have had in this matter is the . action of the honourable member for Darling, a dissatisfied litigant, who probelieves quite honestly that he has not secured justice, in coming to Parliament, and setting up propaganda here in the hope that it will circulate and create dissatisfaction, thus providing further confusion 'and unemMinisployment in the Australian industrial ill world. The honourable member's action is a thing to be censured.",22
67,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Deplored .,22
68,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,It is deplorable that an honourable member should use his position in the House to create discontent with a judgment with the obvious intention of insuring that men will not work under an award given by a properly constituted tribunal.,22
69,Mr BLAKELEY,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Hear , hear! I have done that inside and outside this House ",23
70,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"The honourable member's conduct is unworthy of this Parliament, and his attitude is false to the principles of unionism and arbitration.",23
71,Mr CONSIDINE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,I cannot Minister as an authority on unionism.,23
72,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"On ordinary principles of honesty, is it right for any person to invite a union to apply to a Tribunal for a decision and then, having got an award, given according to the law, to go out and create discontent, in order to nullify it? The judgment of Mr Justice Powers was given after a most careful inquiry, and it is deeply to be regretted that the honourable member has taken this action. It is certainly not in the interests of the workers. Before I conclude, let me quote the following, which shows what big money is earned by shearers under the award in question:In a statement issued by the Graziers' Association today, it was said that 2,000 shearers were earning from £9 to £17 a week in the sheds of New South Wales. These men are said to be working only forty-four hours, .weekly, at the Federal award rates of 35s. a hundred. Weekly earnings of from £10 to £12, it was also stated, were common, and ringers were drawing from £13 to £17. At Boorooma, Walgett, twenty-three shearers shore 14,725 sheep in one week, averaging about 640 a man. This, on the Federal award Tate, would work out at just .over £11 a man for a week's work. During a previous week at the same shed, the same shearers shore 12,302 sheep for the week, an average of about 534 a man. On award Judge. rates this would work out at about £9 6s. a man for the week. The ringer's tally for week was 752, which would return him just over £13. At Dummbral, Collarendabri, 20 shearers shore 13,008 sheep in one week, averaging a man, which would work out at £11 12s. a man. At Midkin, Moree, 40 shearers shore 21,800 in one week, working out approxicognisance mately at £9 10s. a man, while at Tallawanta, Garah, 10 shearers shore 7,258 sheep for the week, averaging £12 10s. a man. A ringer here shore 968 sheep, equal to about £17. Ten shearers at Wootawa, Morah, shore 7,617 sheep for the week, averaging a little £13 each, while the ringer's tally for the was 929, for which he would be paid just £16. At Charlton, Brewarrina, 13 shearers shore 1,946 sheep in one day, averaging £2 10s. pan, and one of the shearers was only a .^earner. One day the ringer shore 216, for jwhich he would be paid about £3 15s. , In the face of these figures the Association comments, "" Surely no reasonable man will contend that genuine shearers are. not at /work, or that the Federal award rate does not offer a good return to shearers."" Many of the bigger sheds, it is stated, are shearing or will shear a neighboring small ,man's sheep. This will increase the shearers' earnings for the season by cutting down their travelling bill and lost time in getting from .shed to shed. Shearers will have a highly accept the remunerative run this year. That report is an indication of the money that is being earned by the shearers under - the award they have, obtained. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Darling should seek to discredit a judgment that has produced such excellent results for the workers of Australia.",23
73,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Yarra) [3.43] - The Attorney-General (Mr Groom) waxed rather warm because the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) had raised this question in the House. He charged the honourable member with having aided and abetted men to break awards given by the Arbitration Court.,23
74,Mr GROOM,LOCAL REPATRIATION,The honourable member - for Darling admitted having done so.,23
75,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"The Government are charged with a very big responsibility on this question of Arbitration, and before the Attorney-General lectures the honourable member for Darling for having incited men to break an award, he should investigate the very grave charges that honourable member has made against a Judge, and see if they are true.",23
76,Sir GRANVILLE RYBES,LOCAL REPATRIATION,The honourable or member had made no charges against the,23
77,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"He made charges the against an award given by Mr Justice Powers, the President of the Arbitration Court, and any Government that believes 650 in arbitration and wants to see the sys6d. tem continued should immediately take of such charges, instead of proceeding to harangue the unionists of the country as to its' being their duty to abide by awards whether they are right or wrong. The honourable member for Darover ling was speaking today on behalf of week the biggest industrial organization in over Australia. Thisunion has loyally and faithfully abided by awards of the Arbia tration Court for fifteen years. Although it has had it in its power to create turmoil in the country, and although, on many occasions, it has not got all it has asked for and has suffered many disappointments in awards given since it first went to the Court in 1907, it has never once struck against a decision once an award has been given. The responsibility rests upon the Government to say how it happens that this union, which has so faithfully abided by the awards of the Arbitration .Court, is now proceeding to break an award today. Not one of the facts put forward by the honourable member for Darling has been controverted. It is a simple question of arithmetic. The Attorney General says that if the Judge made a mistake in arriving at his figure, the union should have gone before him again. As a matter of fact, the Minister knows that the union did go before the Judge again. It placed all these facts before His Honour, but its efforts were of no avail. The President of the Arbitration Court stubbornly stood to his mistake, not even admitting that he had been guilty of making a common, ordinary, arithmetical error. If the Government choose to bluff through a proposition like that, I am afraid that this big organization, the Australian ""Workers Union, will have nothing more to do with arbitration. I say this with regret, because if we can have peace in the industrial world, and justice done to the men who toil, without the arbitrament of strikes, it will be of benefit to the country. But if the Government choose to stand by a Judge who makes this kind of error, and stubbornly stands by it, they will have to take the responsibility for the industrial discord that will prevail in Australia. The award given by Mr Justice Powers is one of the worse examples of bungling ever perpetrated by a man in a responsible position.",23
78,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Order 1,24
79,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,It is very difficult to tell the truth in this case and observe the rules of the House.,24
80,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Before permitting this discussion to take place, I took theopportunity of reminding honourable members that, while they were at liberty to. discuss an award given by a Judge, no personal reflection or attack must be made upon the Judge himself! I hope that honourable members will refrain frcm remarks which are not in order.",24
81,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"We all know what theAttorney-General has told us, namely, that it is not within the province of this Parliament to review a decision given in any Court; but the issue today is something more than the mere matter of reviewing an arbitration award. The issue is, whether, in view of the serious statements made by the honourable member for Darling, the Government's appointment of Mr Justice Powers as President of the Arbitration Court was justified.",24
82,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Order !,24
83,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"It is very difficult to keep within the ruling of the Chair. I shall take one out of the many illustrations given by the honourable member for Darling to prove that the award in question was based upon a mistake. His Honour based his decision on figures supplied by the Pastoralists Union, namely, that the average shear is 439 per week. That this was an increase of 101 on the . previous year's average was admitted. The very men who came before the Court and supplied these figures were those who had previously contended that the introduction of the forty-four hour week would reduce the speed of shearing by from 5' to 27$ per cent. Yet His Honour accepted the ex parte statement of these' men, which, on the face of it , could not be true. He not only does that",24
84,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Order ! The honourable member - may discuss the award, but cannot discuss the Judge.",24
85,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"I will try my best to discuss the award itself. It provides for 439 sheep per week as the average, and then allows a reduction of twenty-five for lost time. An ordinary ""school boy with a third-class education, if asked to take 25 per cent, from 439, would give the answer as 329. but the award gives it as 351. I pin the Minister down to that one fact. Without traversing the supporting arguments of the honourable member for Darling, I ask the Minister, who is responsible to this country in the matter of arbitration, whether he is prepared to say that the workers are bound to abide by awards« based on such erroneous figures? When the question came before the Court again, and the figures were put before the Judge, no man not stubbornly prepared to stand by statements made, however, erroneous, would have refrained from, correcting them. That has not been done, and yet this body of men are expected to accept the award. Further, the Judge has allowed 20 per cent., although he says that the right allowance is 25 per cent. I ask honourable members to exercise their common sense, and to put themselves in the position of those men who earn their living in this industry may have gone to the Court, and have been disappointed in the award given, hut they have abided by the award. The Minister - for Defence (Mr Greene) says that that is because the awards have always improved the position of the men; but I point out that the awards were not always in accordance with the cost of living. These men, as I say, may have been disappointed in this regard, but in many cases have abided by the decision. When, however, there is ' an obvious mistake in arithmetic which robs them, at any rate, of 5s. per 100, it is asking too much of human nature to expect the men to accept the award. There is no organization in Australia, and certainly not the Australian Workers Union, which could ask its members to abide by such an award. If the Minister is simply going to brush the matter aside, and, lecturing the tell them that they must abide by the award whether they like it or not-that they must accept the bad arithmetic of the President-it is making a> farce of arbitration, and, indeed, wiping arbitration out.",24
86,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,What does Mr. Justice Higgins say ?,25
87,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Mr Justice Higgins, in the Court, said that the Australian Workers Union . had loyally and faithfully abided by every decision of the Court, although on several occasions the award had been against their claim.. Mr. Justice Higgins was ona of the men who made arbitration possible in this not that he gave the workers all they asked, but because he held the balance fairly between the parties. . It was cause of this that the Government did their best to get rid of him, and now we have this Judge in his place-this man Powers, who took a position that no other Judge in Australia would accept!",25
88,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL REPATRIATION,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,25
89,Mr SCULLIN,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Without going fur' titer, I simply say that there, is turmoil in the land today, and that the turmoil will not end this year. The Pastoralists Union has in this dispute "" bitten off more than it can chew."" The spirit of the old days of shearing is still in the hearts of the shearers, and they will stand to the position they have taken up. They will not, as the Minister says in his airy They way, accept the award. Those who, afterall, will lose the most .will be the members of the Pastoralists Union, who are sheltering themselves behind the Arbitration Court, and endeavouring to lower living conditions in this country. Only today Mr Justice Powers has lowered the daily wage of'the miners of this country by Is. below the basic wage. That is the kind of thing that is killing arbitration-it is that kind of thing which, supported by the Government, stands for industrial turmoil!. I stand for arbitration, and voted for it when I sat on the Government side; I am in favour of the principle of tribunals to settle industrial questions. Although that is my policy and belief, I say deliberately here, that for the Government to stand by awards like this, awards that are manifestly unjust, based as they are on bad arithmetic, is to sign the death-warrant of arbitration, and means going back to shearers, the old days of strikes. Even at this stage I ask the Government to accept the challenge of the honourable member for Darling, and to obtain the services of statisticians to investigate the merits of the question by an examination of the facts and figures. I am satisfied that such an examination would show that the Government made a great mistake when they appointed Mr. Justice Powers to the position of President of the Arbitration Court.",25
90,Mr CONSIDINE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"Barrier) [3.55] - I have no plaudits for the arbitration system or for the Arbitration Court. The country, honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has taken credit to the Australian Workers Union for abiding by the awards be- of the Arbitration Court for a considerable period. He has told us that the ol> jection to this particular award is the defective arithmetic displayed by the President, ME. Justice Powers; the men-re^ gard it as patently obvious that the rules of arithmetic have been absolutely ignored by the presiding genius of the. Arbitration Court.",25

CONSIDINE - T n his concluding remarks the honourable member for Yarra intimated that this same Judge had reduced the daily wages of the miners by Is. per day below the basic wage; and that is not due to any f a u lt of arithmetic. My view is that the mistake of the shearers was in going, in the first place, to the Arbitratio n Court. The Australian Workers TJnion desired, by means of a conference with the Pastoralists Union, to obviate an upheaval, but the Pastoralists Union refused to meet them and' discuss any alteration of the conditions. Of course, the Australian Workers Union has its own method of doing its business, and I am not attempting to dictate to the members of another organization.",26

97,Mr CONSIDINE,LOCAL REPATRIATION,"I do not know that that is so. If I can assist the men of the pastoral industry to w in the fight they are now waging I shall certainly do so, and we shall see whether or not the pastoralists are concerned about what I do. The honourable member who is so unconcerned at the present time, is not so Atkinson, L, unconcerned in his capacity of a pasBamford F. W. toralist when the officials of the Australian Best,' Sir Robert Workers Union stand by their members Blundell, R. P. as they are doing at the present time. Bowden, E. K. The pastoralists go to the Courts for an Bruce, injunction, hale members of the union Cameron, D. C. before Judges, have them fined, and Chanter, J. M. threaten them with imprisonment; and - Corser, E. B. C. that, I suppose, is all to show how unconFoster, Richard cerned' they are. The position,, as it Greene, W. M. strikes me, is that there is a calculated Higgs, W. G. effort on the part of the employers of this Hughes, W. M. country, through their various organizaHunter, J. A. J. tions, to wipe out the previous effects of the Arbitratio n Court with regard to wages and conditions. That effort is not Blakeley, A. confined to Australia; there has been a Catts, J. H. world-wide attack on organized labour Charlton, M. since the Armistice. We see this in the Gabb, J. M. United States of America, in Great B r i - Lazzarini, H. P. tain, and in every country where there is Maloney, Dr organized labour. There is a concerted effort on the part of organized capital to lower the standard of living of the workers, and to force them back to conditions which, if not worse than pre-war conditions, are certainly no better. It is no use our shutting our eyes to the f a c t ; there is a struggle taking place between organized labour and organized employers. This is not a matter that will be settled in the Arbitratio n Court; it will be settled, as in the past, by the strength of the organized forces. It will be the determination of the workers as against the bank balance of the pastoralists, and the desire of the latter to have their sheep shorn. It will be a question of whether the circumstances are - favourable to the pastoralists or the men. The latter are certainly handicapped by lack of resources, and by the fact that all the paraphernalia for repression is in the hands of their political and industrial enemy. I pasam glad that the honourable member for Y a r r a has intimated that the old fighting of the Australian Workers Union is not dead. Motion (by Mr MASSYGREENE) putThat the question he now put.

100,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"for Mr Rodgers) Marr, C. W. C. The answers to the honourable' member's Story, W. H . questions are as follow:1. Certain oversea mailboats do call at a port in each State except Tasmania. The only oversea mailboats running under contract with the Commonwealth Government to deliver mails in the United Kingdom are those of the Orient Company. Under the terms of the contract, three vessels of the line call at Hobart each year during the months of February to May inclusive. The vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Line carrying mails under contract with the British Government do not, it is understood, make Hobart a port of call. As regards the latter part of the question, investigation has shown that Tasmanian producers are not adversely affected to any appreciable extent by the failure of the Peninsular and Oriental vessels to call at Hobart, the r e f r i gerated space in any one of the "" Bay "" steamers of the Commonwealth Line (three of which were diverted to Hobart for the special benefit of the apple exporters) being more than equivalent to the whole of the refrigerated space 'available on all the Peninsular and Oriental Vessels that could have called at Hobart during the period mentioned. 2. Under the provisions of the Navigation .Act, permits to unlicensed ships to engage in the carriage of passengers between Australian ' ports can be granted only when there are no licensed ships available, and where the service by licensed ships is inadequate. In the case of the Sydney-Hobart trade, to which reference is made, is regular service is provided by licensed ships. On no occasion since the Navigation. Act came into operation has this service been unable to' carry all the passengers offering, so that it cannot, either in law or in fact, be regarded as inadequate. Under the circumstances, there is no power to grant the permits asked for. GENERAL ELECTIONS. DIVISIONALRETURNING OFFICERS'",27

ELECTORAL BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 19th September, vide page 2395): Clause 13Section one hundred and thirteen of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the word "" s h all "" (second occurring) and inserting in its stead the word "" may"". Section proposed to be amended(1) On polling day, an elector shall be entitled to vote at any prescribed polling place for the subdivision for which lie is enrolled, or he shall be permitted to vote at any other polling place within the State for which he is enrolled at which a polling booth is open, under and subject to the regulations to absent voting.",29
104,Mr WISE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Gippsland) [4.15] - I desire to be informed of the reason for the extraordinary amendment proposed in the Act. Since electors have been given the right of absent voting, they should be free to exercise it ; 'their opportunity to do so should not be merely permissive. One of the greatest privileges of our electoral system is the right of absent voting. It does away with much postal voting, and, compared with that method, is infinitely more to be desired. One of its advantages is that an elector need not worry about being within reach of ihis own subdivision on polling day. He knows that, under the law, he will be accorded the right of voting as an absent voter in any polling booth in the State in which he resides. Many an elector does not know, until the last moment, whether he will be within his own subdivision on polling day; by which time-in the case of his absence-if the law demanded that he should vote by post rather than as an [98] absentee, it would be too late for him to secure postal voting papers. The Government now propose that an elector shall no longer retain the right to vote as an absentee, as a matter of unquestioned legal procedure, but that he may be accorded that privilege. Who will determine whether he may or may not be so permitted? I understand, that the reason of the Government for proposing the change in the law is based upon trouble which arose out of the last election. At a certain polling place in the division of Ballarat there was an insufficient supply of absent voting papers. Surely, however, it is the duty of the electoral authorities to see that every polling place is furnished with adequate supplies. The Government should not stint money in securing full and true expression of the will of the people by medium of the ballot-box. Every possible facility under the law should be provided for electors to record their votes. Rather than that this permissive provision should be inserted in the Electoral Act, I would prefer to sec the privilege of absent voting actually withdrawn. Electors would then know exactly where they stood. It would be an altogether unsatisfactory position if , when an elector entered a polling booth at the last moment on polling day and aprelating plied for the necessary papers to enable him to record hi3 vote as an absentee, the presiding officer saw fit to withhold those papers. I ask the Government not to press this amendment of the law.",29
105,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [4.18] - The reason for the amendment is that in the last general elections trouble arose owing to an insufficiency' of absent voters' ballot-papers at one polling . place in the Ballarat division. It was held during the hearing of the petition arising out of that election that there was an absolute duty on the part of the Commonwealth Electoral Department to provide voting facilities, under section 113-that which is proposed to be amended-for any person who might make application; provided, of course, that the elector was able to fulfil the conditions of the section. I ask honourable members to visualize the enormous area of the Commonwealth, and to think of the tremendous number of polling places which are scattered over the length and breadth of the land. It may again happen that at some particular polling booth, there will not be sufficient absent voters' ballot-papers to meet an unexpected demand; whereupon the whole election might be invalidated. The object of the amendment is not to take away the right of absent voting; the Government realise as keenly as any honourable member the value of this method of vote-recording. Nor will there be curtailment of any of the facilities for voting, from ^ . a istrative point of view.",29
106,Mr MCDONALD,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"But there may he. . Mr GROOM - That is a possibility that I cannot deny; but the alternative is the possibility that, owing to the technical absence of a few voting papers, an election .might be invalidated.",30

Mr Wise - In the circumstances, it would be better to-withdraw the righ t of absent voting, iso that electors would be under no misappr.enhension .as to where they stood.

113,Mr MCGRATH,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Ballarat) [4.22] The Minister's explanation of the -.need d m in - for this clause is about the weakest. I have heard. A number of elections have been held under the existing law, and, so far as my memory serves, there has been only one .complaint in regard to this absentee voting. provision, and .that occurred in connection with the Ballarat election in 1919. Three men went to a palling place just outside the boundaries of the Ballarat electorate,' and asked to be .allowed to record absentee votes. .The evidence before Mr Justice Isaacs showed clearly that the Presiding Officer humbugged the men, and, .although - they waited in - the .booth u n t i l 8 o'clock, he would not supply them, with absentee ballot-papers. It was not - necessary that they should receive a ballotWpaper with the names of "" K e r by "" .and ''MCGra'fh"" printed on the m ; the .law would 'have been complied with had the Presiding Officer taken a - blank <gHp of .paper and written "".Ballarat election "" and the names of the candidates upon it . But either because of his anti-Labour-prejudices or his indifference to hisduty he refused both 'men an opportunity to vote. The Presiding Officer did not deny to the .Court that he had refused to allow the men to vote; it rwas clearly proved that their names were on the Ballarat roll, that their wives and families resided in Balilarat, and that they were merely temporary workers in the district in which they .sought to vote. Mr Justice Isaacs properly said that Parliament had expressed by its legislation the wish .that every adult should be given .an opportunity to record his voteThe absentee voting system is .much fairer than the > postal vote, because the elector .has to go into the polling boothto record his vote. The carrying of this clause will practically abolish absentee voting.

121,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,There is no such intention.,31
122,Mr MCGRATH,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Thar e is a risk of that happening in practice. One Presiding Officer may say that he is too busy to supply an absentee ballot-paper, whilst seme other Presiding Officer will courteously issue the paper. Thus one man will get an absentee vote,'whilst the other, though equally entitled to it , will be refused. I have had some experience of these cases. It was largely due to the refusal of a Presiding Officer to issue absentee ballot-papers that I was put out of this House .for six months, and forced to incur the cost of an appeal to the High Court and a by-election. I do not wish to leave iti n the discretion of any PresidingOfficer tat say whether; oar-not; a personal, shall be: allowed, to . exercise: an ; absentee i vote.. ;  thoroughly agree, with-the remarks,of the honourable, member tfor, Gippsland (Mr .

The operation, of two methods of marking is only leading to confusion., as was declared in connection with the disputed Ballarat election.

In the Ballarat election a number of ballot-papers were marked with the figure 1 opposite the name Kerby, and a cross opposite the name MCGRATH, and vice versa. Those votes were declared to be informal, and, I think, rightly so, because it was impossible to determine the intention of the voter. A number of other electors indicated their votes by marking 1 or a cross opposite the name of the preferred candidate, or struck out the name of the candidate for whom they did not wish to vote. We should understand whether such votes will be formal or informal. I think they should be allowed, because the intention of the voter is clearly indicated in all those methods.",31

We should treat as formal, so far as that is possible, every ballot-paper in regard to which the intention of the voter is ascertainable by the application of common sense; we should not make ballot-papers informal for mere technical reasons. Whenever the intention of the elector is discernible, his ballot-paper should be treated as formal.",32
139,Mr MAXWELL,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,An elector might put a cross against the candidate against whom he wished to vote.,32
140,Mr MAHONY,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Of course, no one can read another person's mind, and there will always be informalities. Similarly we cannot remedy mistakes such as are made when a voter numbers his ballot paper in an order which*does not, express his true preference. We can only take the marking on a ballot-paper as it stands, and if it clearly indicates a choice on the part of the voter the paper should be treated as formal. Where there are only two candidates standing, there is no : need to mark the order of preference by using the numerals 1 and 2.

144,Mr MAHONY,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Yes , and in my electoral campaigns I take pains to see that only one method of voting is spoken of; but why should we declare informal a ballot-paper which clearly indicates the wish of the voter ?

145,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Darlin g Downs-Attor ney-General) [ 4 . 4 2 ] - I would remind the Committee what a narrow right this marking with a cross is. The Act provides that in an election for the House of Representatives at which there are not more than two candidates, /the voter's preference shall be deemed to be sufficiently indicated hy a mark showing his first preference, and that the placing of a cross in the square opposite the name of one candidate shall be deemed to in dicate that that candidate is the voter's first preference. It is only in the case in which there are not more than two candidates that the voters have the option of using a cross or the figure 1. The effect of this option has been to make many votes informal, and thus ta deprive many voters of the franchise.",33

151,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Yes , and it is always a mistake to have two methods of marking. The present arrangement is intended merelv to cover a transitional period. Mr Justice Isaacs said I am impelled by some of the ballot-papers I have seen to observe that it is possible that some of the voters have been misled as to the use of a cross. Wihen they have placed a 1 for one candidate, and a cross for the other, it might be conjectured that they thought that they were simply crossing out and voting against the other candidate. That being only conjecture, I am not entitled to act on it in deciding this case. But the possibility might be guarded against for the future. It is noticeable that, although section 133 provides for a cross in substitution of the figure 1 in the cases mentioned, there is no reference to that in the ballot-paper, Form F in the schedule.. Perhaps some means of informing electors of the law as to the use of a cross may be desirable. The amendment is recommended by the officers responsible for the working of the Electoral Act , who say that it is desirable that we should have only one method of marking ballot-papers.",33
152,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Y a r r a ) [4.47] - The effect of the amendment would be to rob some voters of the franchise. At the present time, when there are only two candidates standing, a cross placed in the square opposite the name of one of them makes a ballot-paper valid, but, under the law as it is proposed to amend it , such a ballot-paper would .be invalid. The Minister holds that confusion is caused by permitting two methods of marking ballot-papers, but I do not think that he is right, because the electors are not instructed that they may use either of two methods. The provision which it is proposed to amend is a provision governing only the counting of ballot papers.",33

154,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Onl y by those who have made a close study of the Act . ' I cannot imagine that any one would direct electors to mark their ballot-papers with a cross. Even if the amendment werecarried, there would still remain an in consistency in the method of marking: ballot-papers, because where there are only two candidates the elector is allowed to indicate his preference by placing the numeral 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote, and leaving the other name unmarked; whereas, if there are three candidates, he must mark all three names in the order of his preference -1 , 2, and 3. This inconsistency has led some voters to think that it is sufficient, where there are three candidates, to set the figures 1 and 2 against their first and second choioe, leaving the t h i r d name unmarked. Such ballot-papers are informal, though they should, I think, be counted, because they clearly indicate the intention of the voter. Confusion also arises because where there are several candidates the elector is instructed to mark his first preference with the figure 1 and his following preferences with the figures 2, 3, 4, and. so; on. As? the figure-1 is printed in smallerand lighter type than' the-other figures,, a number of voters, have marked their ballot-papers 2, -3, 4, and so. on, without using the figure 1 to indicate their-first preference - In the-Yarra byelectibn anumber of ballot-papers were, accordingto the ReturningOfficer; thus rendered' informal: The intentionisto compel the electors to> expresstheir preference, and surely it is . fair, where a cross indicates the first preference of the v voter in acase .in which .there are not more than two candidates to treat, the ballot-paper as formal. There are many organizations - an which people still' vote by using the. cross. - Mr MAXWELL - If thene: are.three candidates, would the honourable membei: permit, the voter to indicate, his first preference! by> a cross I Mr S0U1LLIN - I - would not allow the-useofacrosswhere' there are more 1 1 'than two candidates. In the.South Aus1 tralianState'elections the-cross'is still in use. If the people of' South Australia are accustomed to indicate their, first: preference by the use of the cross in State elections,, they arei likely to use it in Federal elections, and it would be hard.to disfranchise them for doing so.,, particularly when nothing would be gained by insisting on the use of the figure 1. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise) says that it would be a disadvantage to have two systems of voting-on e for the House of Representatives and one for the Senate; but we already distinguish between baliloit-papers with two names and ballot-papers with more than two names. We should follow the broad principle that wherever there is no ambiguity as to the clear intention of. the voter the vote should be allowed. Nothing should prevent the clear intention of the elector beingcarried out. Mr BELL, (Darwin) [4.55] - 1 would be very loath indeed todeprive any elector of his righttohaver his vote, recorded where hisintention, is perfectly clear; but thet number of informal votes at every election is astonishing, and; w.eshall never obviate the trouble in. this regard until we have uniformity in the electoral laws of Australia.. Unfortu nately, some States, adopt, one. method of expressing voters' preferences, while: local bodies, inthose States adopt - anothersystem, and the Federal method, differs; from either.. We: shall-, never, educate, the..elec1 tors to that standard which will allow them to record their votes, clearly until we have greateruniformity. The amendment now sought to be inserted in >the Bill is-justified'for that reason. We can; not control the electoral laws of the 1 States orthe.votingsystemsadopted .by local bodies' in the States-, but. we can haveuniformityin-, our-, own voting system: The honourable member, for-Tarra (Mr Scullm) has shown that' where there - are threes candidates, and' the third preference' isnotexpreessd on the ballot paper,- the vote is informal':' TheAttorney General- (Mr Groom) haspointed out that where there' aretwo candidates 1 the ballot-paper is formal' if thesecond : preference' is, notshown: The only way out of - thei difficulty is to make itcompulsory that the voter should indicate 1 his order- - of preference'- right through, whether there are* only two candidatesor 1 more: . The only means by which, we can obviate informal, votes is: by educating the electors to observe one system, only. 1 While we are. so. jealous ofthesecrecy of the ballot , we must continue, to. have informal' votes;, but those - arei recorded mostly by electors who are voting, at a Federal election for the first time. Mr ELEJIING.:-How - cam. we get uniformity ?' Mr KEL»L - We cannot control State laws, but we canmake our ownvoting 1 system, uniform in the hopei thatultimately-the States, will also .adopt.it. Tasmania, has already done. so. We should start at once hy prescribing the compulsory use of our own system of expressing voters' preferences, and abide by it.  [5.0] - I hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) will not persist with this proposal. We should be» strivingto afford facilities for voting instead of curtailing them.",33
155,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"We are not curtailing them; we are enveavouring to have less informal, votes, recorded than we have at present.  case of the Ballarat by-election the Judge ruled that if a voter placed a cross alongside one candidate's nameand nothing opposite - the other candidate's name, the vote .was .a valid, one.

159,Mr FLEMING,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Robertson) [5.7] The electoral method ought to be such as to .give the fullest and freest expression of the will of the people. The argument put forwar d that where there are only two candidates, and where one of these only is marked, .the marking should be taken as an indication of the voter's in tention, is, in my opinion, a correct one. Of course, where - there are more than two candidates, it is essential ''that - numbers should be marked, but it by no-means 'follows that, in the case of only two candidates, 'the marking' of numbers is necessary. T f an elector has grown up under the old 'system of - making a - cross, ' I ' see no reason w h y we should now ""put h im in'a position'where he is likely to cast an hiformal vote. 'The proposed amendment of the Act appears to me a restriction of that freedom which, the people should have to express their desire, and will lea'd 'to more confusion' in a system already 'confused enough. 'There have been so many different systems of marking ballot-papers that it is very difficult for some people to 'know quite what to do.

Of course, the opportunity to express their choice is there, but in practice there are many thousand - informal votes, a great number of which 'are due to confusion in the minds of the electors as to how to mark the papers.

' Mr Considine (Barrier) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I join - with other honourable members in their efforts to persuade the Minister (Mr .

There is no doubt - about the confusion in the minds of a great number of electors as to the preferential system. Last election was the only experience we have had of the system for this Parliament, and I know that about 300 votes which were cast for me were declared informal, owing to confusion on the part of. the electors as to how the numerals should be marked.",35
160,Mr JACKSON,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,How many candidates were there?,36
161,Mr CONSIDINE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"There were three, and I am merely pointing out that at least 300 people were under the impression that if they marked numerals opposite candidates other than myself, they would be giving some support to those candidates, and, therefore, they marked no numerals opposite their names, simply putting ""No. 1 opposite mine. ""We all know how difficult it is, in view of the many changes in the electoral system, to remove the confusion in the minds of electors as to the correct method of marking papers. A voting paper ought to be accepted so long as it clearly indicates the intention of the elector, whether the elector makes a cross, strikes out the names of the candidates he does not favour, or puts a cross or a numeral in front of the candidate he does favour.",36

Why make any change from the system carried out at the last election ?

Although the amendment might make the Act uniform, the fact remains that the State and municipal elections are conducted with a different system of marking. If there were, as I hqpe there will be before long, a common electoral authority throughout the Commonwealth, I would heartily support the change, but to adopt the amendment under present circumstances would disfranchise many people because of the different systems in use.",36
175,Mr ATKINSON,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Wilmot) [5.19] - I do not approve of disturbing a vote where a voter's intention is clear, but we have heard a good deal of the confusion which exists owing largely to the fact that one of two systems of voting may be used. At present it is the law that a cross may be used where there are only two candidates, and the electors, although they know this, unfortunately use the cross where there are more than two candidates. The Minister (Mr Groom) and the Federal authorities claim that this confusion in the minde of the electors would be dispelled if all voters had to put their votes in numerical order. If the law strictly provided that the marking of ballotpaperswith crosses would render those papers informal, more valid votes would probably be cast than if electors were still permitted to make a cross. I presume that where there are only two candidates for one seat, if the name of one is erased, and there is no other mark on the ballot paper, the vote will be regarded as valid.",36
176,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"If an elector strikes cut one name only, or puts a cross against one of the two names, his vote will not be valid, for the reason that his paper has not been marked in accordance with the directions of the Act.",37
177,Mr CONSIDINE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"That has not been the interpretation. Mr ATKINSON "" - I understand that the High Court ruled, in the case arising out of the liast Ballarat election, that if there are only two candidates for one seat, and one name is struck out, and there is no other mark upon the ballot-paper, the vote should be accepted as valid for the reason that the ballot-paper clearly indicates that the elector intended to vote for the candidate whose name had not been struck out. It has always been the practice of Returning Officers to accept ballot papers in respect of which the intentions of electors are clear. Electors are now aware that, in certain cases, they may mark their ballot-papers with a cross However, in many instances, ballot-papers are wrongly marked with a cross; for example, in respect of elections where more than two candidates are seeking to secure one seat. The consequence is that many votes are informal, ""Upon first examining this clause I was not impressed with the Government's proposal, but I perceive that unless electors are informed that they may not in any circumstances mark their ballot-papers with a cross, numerous invalid votes will be cast. For that reason I shall support the Government's proposal.",37

179,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,Then all parties desire to bring about a system of voting which cannot possibly lead to confusion.,37
180,Mr RILEY,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"In my view, members of this House are as much experienced in elections as are many Returning Officers. Probably their experience is as wide as is that of the officials who made the proposal now before the Committee. The bulk of the people are used to a certain method of voting. ""Very many electors are accustomed to mark their ballot-papers with a cross. The public generally do not attend political meetings; that applies particularly to country residents. Their habit is to mark their papers with a cross before the name of the candidate whom they favour. If that method of voting is done away with , informal votes will grow enormously in volume. Where the intention of a voter is clear his vote should be accepted as formal.",37

182,Mr RILEY,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"H is vote would be informal. Electors have been trained to mark their papers with a cross. That is the principle in vogue in South Australia, and in many municipalities. If all the State systems of voting were made uniform with that of the Commonwealth, there would be fewer mistakes, and less in formal votes would be cast. The Government should not seek to interfere with the existing method. At present, there is no doubt.that if an elector marks the name of one of two candidates with a cross his vote is accepted by the Returning Officer.",37
183,Mr MCWILLIA MS,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Franklin) [5.30]. - The innovation, proposed by the Government is of a somewhat serious character, particularly since it is sought to be introduced on the eve of a general election. We are about to tell the peoplethat if they vote as they (have done at previous elections their papers will beregarded as informal. It is all very well' to say that we should educate the electors. Less than 10 per cent, of them attend election meetings. At the last election the public understood that, in re- 1 spect of any division where there were only two candidates for one seat, their ballot-papers would be formal ilf they placed a cross in front of the name ol the candidate whom they favoured. I am confident that if a dispute should arise over the forthcoming elections, the Court would support the decision given in the Ballarat dispute, when it was properly held that where the intention of the voter was clearly indicated his ballot paper should be regarded as valid. The Judge thus interpreted the common-sense view,, if nob the strict letter, of the law. If we now decide that system may no longer be employed, inr formal votes will, number thousands more than, would, otherwise be the case. One reason .why I advocated postal voting was that I held that every facility should be given to electors. The Government now propose to withdraw a facility. Mr BELL. - We miusfc begin to educate the electors at. some time.",37
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"The moment"" is not appropriate.",38
185,Mr MAXWELL,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"But if electors - are 1 educated to a new system of votinglong before an election takes place, they will have forgotten their lesson when they go to the poll.",38
186,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"I think not. The system of voting in Tasmania is taught children upon school blackboards. Although scone honourable members remarked yesterday that the proportional voting system, if adopted throughout the Commonwealth, would involve an enormous - increase of informal votes, I wan-Tel point out that the percentageof these is lower in Tasmania than in any of the other States. Rightly or wrongly, we have been allowing electors,, when there are only two candidates, to express their preference either by marking a cross as is done in connection with State elections in South Australia, or by marking No. 1 opposite the name of the favoured candidate. Thjis jcl'ause will 'not produce uniformity. What is the use of honourable members saying that they want unif o r m it y in the method of voting for the House of Representatives and the Senate when they have agreed to a system of grouping Senate candidates according to their party adherence, and candidates for the House of Representatives in alphabetical order? I . prophesy that this', differentiation will lead to greater confusion than will the continuance of the cross as an alternative method, to the numeral for signifying the intention of the elector.",38

188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"If there are five or six candidates, representing two or three parties, for a seat in the House of Representatives, there is just as much reason for grouping, themaccordingto the old parties as. there is for. grouping Senate candidates in that way. I know one elec-: - torate in which probably five or six icandidateSj representing ait least three parties, will nominate-. The present system of marking a cross' against the pre+ f'erred candidatehas obtained' for years without creatingany serious disadvantage: The people have been educated i h the belief that they can express their prepresent ference by a cross or by a numeral. Now, on the eve of an election, they are to be tfold that the use of the crossw ill render . their votes inf ormal. - Mr GROOM -'Unde r the present law - the cross can be used only in elections in which there are not more than two candidates. Mr MCWILLIAMS : - A vote should be> accepted as formal if the intention of the elector is clearly indicated. In this, attempt to secure uniformity-which - is. impossible^ because of therecentadoption of the party grouping sysem for' Senate elections^-ther e will be a. very great risk of deprivinga considerable number of electors of their votes. Already there, is difficulty in inducing, people to go to the .poll. In the cities electors will not vote at all unless motor cars are sent to their homes. The number of non-voters and informal votes are sufficiently large already, and this clause will deliberately increase' the number of the latter. We are asked to pay too great a price for so-called uniformity. ' Mr JACKSON (Bass) [5.40] -.Any thing I can do to enforceuniformit y in the method of voting throughout the Commonwealth I shall do. At the present time Tasmania has the preferential and proportional systems, and the voter indicates his preference by writing the numerals 1, 2, 3, &c. Victoria and Western Australia also have the preferential sys'tem. New South Wales operates the preferential and proportional representation systems, whilst Queensland has an optional system. South Australia is the only State in. which, the may indicate his preference only by marking, a cross opposite the name of the candidate. The sooner that State is brought into line with the other States the better. I look forward.'to. the time - when all elections, Federal, State, and - municipal, will be conducted on the preferential and proportional systems. Some lionorable members have stressed the risk, of depriving people of their votes. Any person who cannot understand a ballot paper, or the explanatory cards that are issued by the candidates, is not enticed, to have a vote. Mr Scnixm - Because some people aro not as literate as the honourable member they are to be disfranchised. It is much easier for - them to make a cross than to write numerals. Mr JACKSONi-t-I doubt'very much that it is .more difficult to figure 1 than it is to make a .cross, as the matter .concerns the case 'when only two candidates .are (standing. . is in doubt as to how to vote can .consult the' Returning Officer, and have his vote marked for him in confidence. The argument 'that some persons will be deprived of their votes entirely fails.

190,Mr MCWILLIA MS,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"F r a n k l in) [5.58]. - Notic e of his intention to move the in - sertion of two new clauses was given by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . 'Gregory), who, unfortunately, is pre'vented - by illness from being with us - today. It is not my intention to move the first of those amendments, but I shall ask the Committee to give effect to the second. I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" lc. After section 19 of the principal Act ,the following section is inserted:-'19A . The Distribution Commissioners shall determine which districts in each State are metropolitan districts, and which are country districts, and shall fix the average quota of electorates in country districts at from 20 to 25 per cent, less than the average quota for metropolitan districts.'"" In a sparsely populated country like Australia, those who live in the rural districts, and especially those far away in the back-blocks, are under great disadvantages as compared with the residents of the cities. Among these disadvantages is the difficulty of recording their votes. An 'elector residing in a city electoral division can get easily to a polling booth by paying twopence for a tram ride, or he may be taken there in a motor car, but the case of the country elector is very different. The gathering together of population in the cities is likely to be a source of weakness to Australia. disproportion of city and country population is apparent in every State of the Commonwealth, and even in Tasmania, but it is especially noticeable - in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. In some of the States more than half the population resides in the capitals. This gives city residents an enormous preponderance of political power, and I would therefore desire to have it enacted that in future electoral redistributions an attempt shall be made to equalize the political power of the city and country electors by making a difference of at least one-fifth between the city and country divisional quotas. Although part of my own electorate is suburban, I represent a country area also, and I am well acquainted with the disabilities of country residents, whether they be workers or employers. The city worker is an aristocrat compared with the country worker. In many parts of Tasmania, during more than half the year, the timber-getters are wet through with the first blow of their axe on a tree, and remain wet all day, and other country workers suffer similar discomforts, besides being enormously handicapped in many ways. It is not right, nor in the interests of Australia, that the residents in the cities should have so much political power. But the only way in which we can equalize the political powers of city and country constituencies is to make the quota for country electorates 20 or 25 per cent, lower than that for city electorates. It will be for the Electoral Commissioners to decide which are metropolitan and which are rural electorates.  port the. amendment submitted by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams) on behalf of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). If the Committee takes the matter into reasonable consideration, it wil l see the soundness of the claim that the Distribution Commissioners must discriminate in favour of rural districts as against metropolitan areas to the extent of giving them a quota, margin of 20 or 25 per cent. less. It is physically impossible for the representative of a vast area of country to consult the wishes of his constituents in the way that the member representing a congested metropolitan area is able to do. The people the amendment is sought to The benefit are those whose important function it is to develop Australia,, and as we are asking immigrants to come here and assist in that task, we ought to see that their requirements are fairl y represented in this House. I would rather represent 40,000 in a metropolitan constituency than 30,000 persons distributed over my own electorate.",40
191,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"What does the honourable member regard as metropolitan districts in Western Australia?  mantle electorates are metropolitan districts, and the representative of either division can do all his electioneering business, and attend to the whole of his constituents' requirements, by making use of the train service, whereas I am obliged to travel 3,000 miles to visit townships in my electorate. I have keep in constant communication with varied interests of these numerous townships. The needs of country districts the matter of telephone communication differ widely from those of metropolitan areas. The labouring people in rural districts cannot organize or attend to their needs as can be done by the workers i metropolitan areas. Nor can their ber represent their varied needs as they would wish them, to be made known. To do ordinary justice, discrimination should be shown in the arrangement of electoral boundaries to the extent indicated in the amendment. In fact, those who framed the Constitution really had in their minds the need for.this. I trust that the Afc30 tofrniey-Geneirali (Mr Groom,) will the amendment serious Consideration, and .Commissioners see his way clear to accept it .",40
192,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [6.10] - I cannot see my way clear to accept the amendment. It attempts to fix by Statute an arbitrary dividing line between country and city, as if there are conflicting interests tween the two, whereas they both have interests in common. It also seeks to down the very undesirable principle of applying an arbitrary statutory l i m it to the Commonwealth as a whole, quite oblivious of the varying geographical ditions in the States. For instance, the conditions in Western Australia and tion worse. Queensland differ considerably from those in Victoria. The provision already laid down in the Act , which allows a margin of 20 per cent., is preferable. The tribution Commissioners have already exercised their discretion in this regard in their endeavour to frame constituencies was under consideration. to meet the varying conditions to which have just referred.  nexion with the Wannon electorate?",41
193,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"They have done it connection with the New South Wales electorates, and they also exercised the discretion allowed to them under the when they were drawing up their second Victorian distribution. In any case, Parliament considers that the Commisthe sioners have erred in the exercise of their discretion, it has the right of rejecting their distribution. In fact, it has ready exercised that right. However, the main point is that, in a vast the tinent, with so many varying conditions, to a considerable amount of elasticity must the be allowed to the Distribution Commis-sioners, whereas the amendment would in make the rule too rigid. Under the law as it now stands, i u making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions, the Distribution Commissioners n are obliged to give due consideration to memcommunity or diversity of interests, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of divisions .trad subdivisions, and State electoral boundaries; and they are empowered to depart from the quota to the extent of one-fifth more or one-fifth less. That is to say, they are allowed a margin of per cent., whereas the amendment progive poses, in an arbitrary fashion, that the shall fix the average quota of electors in country districts at from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, less - than the average quota for metropolitan districts, permitting no elasticity to meet - the varying conditions i u the States.  be- - have not been seized with the importance of the provision which gives them lay the right to depart from the quota.",41

DisGroom) said when quite recently the redistribution of the Victorian electorates Because the I Act, as it stands, is capable of being read in a variety of ways, the Distribution .Commissioners in the various States conhave taken a different view of their responsibilities and duties, and, as a. rei r sult, we find that what is asked to he - done by the amendment was actually carried out by the Commissioners in NewAct South Wales, and, to some extent, also in Queensland, Western Australia, and if South Australia, whereas, in Victoria, Commissioners took up the attitude that it was not possible for them to do - just as they pleased in this connection. alCommunity or diversity of interests, means of communication,, physical feacontures, existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions bad no relationship whatever to the electoral boundaries in their scheme of distribution.",41
196,Mr BRENNAN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,There was nothing ito indicate that they acted on any principle which differed from that adopted hy the Commissioners in other States.,42
197,Dr EARLE PAGE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"J n every other State the extra metropolitan or country constituencies contain a very much smaller quota than do ""the' metropolitan constituencies, but in Victoria the electoral division with the largest area was given the largest number of electors. Fortunately this House expressed a very strong opinion upon the matter, and this defect was remedied in the Commissioners' second proposals.",42
198,Mr BELL,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,Whic h indicates that the provision in the Act is quite sufficient in itself.,42
199,Dr EARLE PAGE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,No . The Attorney-General said that we had no right to give any direction to the Commissioners.,42
200,Mr GROOM,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,I said that we had merely the right of rejection. I said that it was wrong for us to attempt to assume the functions of Distribution Commissioners and give a direction. We had merely the power to refer back.,42
201,Dr EARLE PAGE,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"It :is the function of this Parliament to lay down the principle on which it expects a distribution to be carried out, and if there is dence that the Commissioners in one State, have followed lines different from thoso adopted in other States, surely it is the proper function of Parliament to decide the exact verbiage that should be used in making its meaning absolutely clear. It was only after 'honourable members in this House had expressed their views upon the Victorian distribution that the Commissioners' proposals were taken back and carried out on the lines suggested, which the Attorney-General now says are expressly provided for in this section of the Act. If the Minister can suggest anymeans by which the expressed intention of Parliament; can be carried into' effect in every State in the case of a redistribution, the amendment could be withdrawn, but otherwise I think it should be carried to a vote, because the section - of' the Act does nof really carry the margin as far as it is possible to do according to the interpretation placed upon the provision by the New South Wales Distribution Commissioners.",42
202,Mr BRENNAN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"Batman) [6.19] - I do not propose to support the amendmentI quite well remember the discussion that took place upon the inequalities of the Victorian _ distributions. It was pointed out as being rather curious and open to criticism that the electorate which geographically was the largest in Victoria should also have the largest quota of electors. I supported the proposal while it enabled the Commissioners to exercise the discretion they have under the Act, if they so desired, in favour of country districts in particular instances, but I do not propose to 'lay down as a principle any infraction of the - much older and sounder principle of one-vote-'one-. value.",42

205,Mr BRENNAN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"I did.  Mr BRENNAN/- I > explained as well evi- as I could the reasons which moved me to do so. There - were 'very special reasons, and there was no other method of having the Northern Territory effectively represented in, this' Chamber. I was careful to point out, however, 'that I quite realized the very strong abjection that could be raised tan the ground that we were violating the 'principle of onevoteione-value, and that it was a just criticism that we were' proposing to allow a representative to come into'this chamber, who spoke for 1*700 or 1,800 voters, whereas other representatives > spoke for varying numbers over 40,000. , I admitted that that was an inequality, but I .said, and I repeat, that we had to choose the 1 lesser of two evils, and. the,greater evil was to altogether disfranchise those persons. Inequality is wrong-, but total disfranchisement is the greater wrong, .'and I - pressed the argument to the extent of .saying that the enfranchisement was useless if it did not give the representative the right to vote.  than that!",42
206,Mr BRENNAN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"The honourable member's case is a definite and considered attack on the principle of one-vote-onevalue, and I shall not go one inch beyond that measure of flexibility which at present exists in the Act and the Constitution and enablesthe Distributing Commissioners to vary the quota to the extent of one-fifth on principles that are laid down in the Act . does not mean that the Commissioners are invited to say that country districts shall, have greater representation than city interests;, that principle is not affirmed for a moment. But there is a give and take permissible to the Commissioners on the ground of community of interests, and a number of other grounds, which they are entitled to consider. They are not entitled, however, to accept the principle' that we are decentralizing agents,. and entitled to say that, because a district is. a country district', it is, therefore, entitled to more representation in Parliament, than is a metropolitan district. I was one who held that there was a curious-anomaly, m that the Commissioners had used their discretion in a way which resulted in a large tract of country having.a very large number of electorsr by comparison with others. It was the view of some of us that the flexible provisions' of the Act might well have been employed to make the position otherwise. But the point that the honourable member now wishes to make is something quite different, and is objectionable from our point of view. believe in the principle of one-vote-onevalue. Residents in the city have their advantages and their disadvantages. do not accept the view that the people of the country cannot record their votes. They have the advantages of country life, which they go to the country toenjoy, and. they have their facilities of communication.",43

208,Mr BRENNAN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"V e r y often. I need not labour the matter further than to say that to interpret the existing, provisions asfavorably as possible to country in terests is quite different from establishing the principle, as a fixed injunction on the Commissioners, that they are to say that country districts must have more representation than city districts.

No' one can reasonably claim that at present the person living in a distant country electorate has the same That facilities for recording hisvote as has; a person in town. The aim is, as faras possible, to get an equality of value in the franchise. The proposal this afternoon is not a danger from that: point of view, for it. goes no further than does the 1 present Act . Dr. EARLE PAGE - It does not go so far.",43
210,Mr FLEMING,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"It does not go so far;, but it does lay down definitely what is not, perhaps, correct in theory, according to the honourable member for Batman, but is certainly found correct in practice. An y one who has lived, in the country and in. the citv knows, whether headmits it or. not, that the man in the country, or the woman, particularly, has not. anything like the same opportunities for recording the vote as has the man or woman in town. All that we are asking is that the value of the franchise in each case shall be made as nearly equal as possible. If a man is given a - thing he cannot use it is of littl e value, and we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every individual. The votes will still remain at equal value-w e do not propose to interfere in any way with the valueof We the vote, for that is a question which is settled for good and all. We have-agreed that one-vote-one-value is the correct I idea, and in common honesty we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every man and woman in Australia. That is ali the amendment proposes. If honourable members will look at the amendment from a practical, stand-point, instead of harping on thetheoretical side, they will see that, the proposal is abundantly justified.

The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) rathercleverly endeavoured to prove that there was some great principle involved in it ; but such is not the case. The basic principlesof the Act are, one adult one vote. and one-vote-one-value. elastic in the matter of its ijrovision respecting the numbers of electors in a division. The suggested new section would withdraw that elasticity, and make the Act rigid. The honourable member for Robertson, in endeavouring to counter the argument respecting the principle of one-vote-one-value, held that the principle underlying the proposal of the honourable member for Dampier was that it sought to make votes of equal value.",43
212,Mr FLEMING,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"I said, "" to make .the franchise of equal value.""",44
213,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"No one will dispute that greater facilities are provided for voting in metropolitan areas than in country divisions. But if f he matter of difficulty in getting to the poll is to be taken into consideration, it would be logically necessary to instruct the Commissioners, further, to provide a smaller number of electors in Gippsland, for example, than in Corio; for the latter division has far greater facilities for travel. If areas are to be consulted it would be necessary to give to divisions in Queensland and Western Australia ten times fewer electors than to those in Victoria. The honourable member for Robertson said that, under existing facilities for voting, electors in some parts of the country are actually unable to attend a polling booth in order to record their votes. If the proposal under review is embraced in the Act the votes of those people will be given no greater value than they possess today. That is to say, they are of no value whatever, since they are not recorded.",44

215,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"The honourable member said that there were many people who were unable on polling day to record their votes. How can their case be met by instructing the Commissioners to decrease the numbers of electors in country divisions? And in what manner should the Commissioners be instructed in respect of such electorates as Corio, Ballarat, and Bendigo? Are they to be regarded as country, or as city electorates? are some country divisions in which the facilities for votine, over the greater part of their area, at any rate, are similar to those provided in metropolitan divisions. Honourable members on this side have said that where any degree of elasticity may be observed it should be in favour of country divisions; and that, of course, J „ Bill. > The Act is has been recently availed of.

I shall submit a case for searching public inquiry, and a recasting of the law. Tammany's pollution of representative government. The influx of new Labour (members is controlled in New South Wales by the junta at Macdonell House. Sitting members live in perpetual terror of the tyranny of this Tammany junta. - The procedure is that nominations are invited, and they are subject to endorsement by the Tammany junta at its unfettered discretion. Then comes the party selection. The whole machinery for the selection of these candidates in New South Wales is also at the unfettered discretion of this corrupt junta at Macdonell House. The powerful machmery of the .Australian Workers Union Central Branch, its funds, and its organizers are utilized, together with the corrupt practices of hired mercenaries, hangers-on, and professional personators. The whole of this machinery is operated for the purpose of continuously intimidating the public men of the Labour movement. It is almost an impossibility for any Labour member in. New South Wales to obtain a selection in defiance of the corrupt crowd in control at Macdonell House. The enforced silence of Labour's public men in New South Wales in the presence of extensive and thinly veiled criminality is their unspoken acknowledgment of their fear of the power of this junta. The Industrial Section. One of the first acts of the Bailey-Lambert coterie, which controls the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, was to organize a star chamber in Sydney, misnamed the industrial section, an unconstitutional body, which had no standing or authority under the constitution: and rules of the Australian Labour party, and which held the undated resignations of the members of the Central Executive. Before it the Central Executive was carpeted weekly, and had to present their reports and take their instructions. This corrupt assembly set about undermining sitting Labour members of Parliament, and engineering its own members into their places. In 1917 the President of this so-called industrial section was a man named Samuel Rosa, and the secretary, John Mauritius Power, now a member of the Legislative Council, and president of the Macdonell House Australian Labour party in New South Wales. Those two men endeavoured to capBill? Mr J. H. Catts. ture the Eederal seats of East Sydney and West Sydney in circumstances of unparalleled corruption and rottenness, at that time unprecedented in the Labour movement of New South Wales. The Labour movement had not then become accustomed to these corrupt practices. The selection of Rosa was upset, and Con Wallace, whose name was third on the ballot, was given the selection for West Sydney. East Sydney, 1917. Power was the man who defeated John West, the sitting member for East'Sydney, for the selection by the corrupt use of the Australian Workers Union votes in the control of Maltese, who were unable to speak English, and were living in boarding-houses in East Sydney. As I pointed out on a previous occasion in this House, in answer to an interjection by the honourable member, I was instrumental in having this East Sydney selection upset, and saving John West's political life. We brought the Maltese priest to the Australian Labour party executive. He acted as interpreter for the other Maltese, who could not speak English, and it was found that one of Power's agents, the present presiding genius of this Tammany junta, a Mrs Andrews, had gone to Hie Worker office and bought a number of copies of The Worker, in which the official ballot-paper was printed. She had cut out these ballot-papers, and by some means had induced the Maltese, who had Australian Workers Union tickets, to detach the voting slips. She also got them to sign their names on the flaps of envelopes, and marking the ballot-papers herself in favour of Power, they were sent in and counted as postal votes. In that way John Power defeated John West at the Labour selection for East Sydney in 1917. It is fitting that this gentleman, who started his career officially in the Labour movement with a corrupt selection ballot, should be, at this time, when Tammany is at its height, and when no effort is being made to cloak - the corruption which stalks abroad unashamed, the chairman and presiding genius of this rotten corporation.",47
221,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEA MAXLBOATS AND POSITION OF,"What bearing have the honourable member's remarks on the Mr J. H . OATTS - I am moving that the third reading of the Bill be postponed so that the Government may have an opportunity to institute a public in quiry and to frame a new Bill providing for Government control of the selection ballots for the nomination of candidates for seats in Parliament. The 1919 JSTarnoi Selection. In this case the selection was a fraud. It was proved at the 1920 Australian Workers Union Convention that 250 faked Australian Workers Union voting slips were used. A number of these were locked away in the head-office safe of the Australian Workers Union. Convention ordered a criminal investigation/ Although this matter was dealt with in open conference, The Worker newspaper and the official report of the Australian Workers Union were censored so that the rank and file of the movement throughout Australia should not know the rottenness that was going on per medium of the machinery of their organization. The forged slips disappeared from the safe of the head office of the Australian Workers Union. These facts prove the complicity of high officials in the Australian Workers Union, as well as editor Boote, with corruption in the selection ballots. The 1919 Oxley Selection. In this case the local branches selected a young schoolmaster named R. H . Lamb, but Mr Fitzgerald, now member of the Legislative Assembly, who was then secretary of the Timber Workers Union in Sydney, by a manipulation of faked union yotes, overrode the selection of the genuine Australian Labour party branches throughout the electorate. The Oxley electorate covers 14,000 square miles of territory, and it was alleged that 750 members of the Timber Workers Union were scattered over that huge area, yet no fewer than 743 votes were recorded in favour of Fitzgerald, and the young schoolmaster, who had spent years in organizing the Labour movement in the electorate, was turned down. Fitzgerald was returned to Parliament; but it transspired afterwards that there were only 150 members of the Timber Workers Union in the electorate. The 1919 Goulburn Selection. Labour selection by the branches in the country selection was manipulated vide a seat in Parliament for Tarn-, many boss Bailey. . At the time. I Selection. was not acquainted with Bailey and his methods, having only recently met him. Tom A r t h u r , one of Bailey's henchmen, who was in Bailey's office, was appointed returning-officer in Sydney to control the selection for this country seat. He used Bailey's office for the purpose. P. C. Evans, then general secretary of the movement, won the selection; but sufficient corrupt Australian Workers Union votes were used after the returns were into give the selection to Bailey. In this case I have a signed statement from Dick MCDonald, an old - Australian Workers Union organizer, to the effect that Bailey put in 300 crook votes. An other statement from W . Minter, a prominent member of the Clerks Union, is as follows: - . Mr Buckland, an officer of the Central Branch, Australian Workers Union, bad been in the Goulburn electorate during the progress of this selection ballot, and had just returned to the Australian Workers Union office. In the presence of myself iand a number of other persons, Mr Buckland pointed to packages of Australian Workers Union postal votes which had been got ready to be admitted to the .ballot, but which had not been required, and had not been used. He said, ""We have been challenged witih the admission of crook Australian Workers Union votes. As others did that kind of thing, why should we not do the same?"" Mr Bailey, who was present, said to Buckland, ""You are a damn fool. You are practically telling these men that .we did it."" Buckland said, "" You know we did. You know perfectly well. Look at all these voting papers left over that we had no occasion to use."" Bailey swore at Buckland, and wheeled on his heel and walked out of the office. By the way, Buckland is now seeking selection against the sitting member, H . P. Lazzarini, in the same district. This matter came before the Australian. Workers Union convention in 1920. A committee was appointed, and went to the Australian Labour party's office to obtain these ballot-papers-so that the Australian Workers Union convention might make a scrutiny. The selection ballot had only iust been taken, but it was found that the ballot-papers had again disappeared. The general secretary, Mr Carey, professed surprise, but admitted to several persons, myself included, that he had spirited the ballot-papers away, and in This tended to hold them as a weapen over Bailey's head should Bailey try to put to pro- "" the boot in "" at any time. The 1919. Eden-Monaro Labour In this case J. J. Webster won the selection on a vote to of 'the local branches, but manipulated the Australian Workers Union vote in favour of his nominee, a city 'solicitor, H . L . Brown, ' who ""was any totally unknown in the electorate. The in returning officer at ©oonia,' Thompson, 'who was 'authorized to receive the Australian Workers Union postal votes, hut not to count'thena, in a written statement' said that all the 'signatures on the envelopes containing these votes were in the same handwriting, and bore' names of fictitious persons, neither dent in the electorate nor members of the Australian Workers Union.

West Sydney Federal Labour 1921. It will be remembered that Con. Wallace stood down to enable T. J. Ryan - booths. Mr J. E. Cattt. contest this seat. Upon the unfortunate Bailey death of Mr Ryan, and in view of the straitened circumstances of Con. Wallace, due to his sacrifice, had there been humanitarian spirit of Labour evidence, he would have been George given the Labour selection unopposed. But Mr Lambert, who was then the paid secretary of 'the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, a member of the Board of Health at- £2 per week, and the Lord Mayor of Sydney, with .£1,500 a resiyear as an allowance, wanted the seat. Con. Wallace was - defeated in .a corrupt selection, and died almost immediately afterwards. The following statement is Selecmade by :a member of the Municipal "" There were ten motor cars engaged for the'return of W. H . Lambert.as candidate-for West .Sydney selection. One car was engaged running from Bart. Stokes' - hotel in Chalmersstreet. The organizer for this end was AlderThe most man Stokes. They' were running on wharf out labourers' tickets and - water and sewerage ""Another car was plying in charge of J. employed .in the ashpit at the City from Council power-house, bringing men who did not live in the electorate and impersonating people whose names were on the West Sydney"" At Harris-street,i Pyrmont, Alderman Holdsworth was directing persons who were not enrolled how to obtain a vote. "" In Harris-street, "" Pyrmont-Denison "" at MACArthur-street, Alderman Ryan had a team of impersonators, mostly employees of the City '""A' car was running from Wooloomooloo in reprecharge of Mr Cody, with impersonators. Mr. M. Ma-lone,., a Labour League secretary,' had one of .the tally clerks from the'Wheat..Board writing union tickets-timbe r workers, wharf seleclabourers and 'Water and Sewerage Board for union 'cards'-and also supplying names of in > the league who'would not be in the district 'tovote. "" At the 'Coronation Hotel, opposite the Sydney Town. Hall, Mr Tyrell was present with a number of wharf labourers' pence cards, at written out in 'the names of various people livhe ing in this - part of the electorate, also water tickets - written out with .a-piece tape Attached;, giving the. name .and- 'address of of .the person to : be personated. "" Plying all .round was Alderman Davoren with a pair of ponies, and a sociable with, other of persons personating voters at various booths. ""There were-also large numbers of Belmore voters who haid no idea they had a vote. PerSelection sons werevoting for' them under - Rule 6 on faked' pence cards - These votes were polled at MACArthur-street and Allan-street polling "" At the Phillip League ibooth, Clevelandstreet, Mr MoAuley was engaged on the same business. "" The returning officer was Gavin Sutherland."" It may be noted that Wooloomooloo and Chalmers-street, which were supplyinga number' of these "" c r o o k "" voters are"" both outside West Sydney Federal electorate.. The wholecorrupt paraphernalia! of municipal Tammany was working overtime for its "" c h i e f . "" Another statement is to the effect that two men, Moran and Donnelly, had a "" crook "" ballot box which it had. been arranged, should be exchanged for an. original ballot-box. All the ballot-boxes had to be brought from the local districts to the Sydney Town H all after S p.m. In this case the parties in charge of the "" crook"" box, baring become "" merry,"" delivered their charge at the Town H all twenty minutes before the local polling booth was timed to close. These corrupt and criminal' practices explain how theTammany Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman Lambert, defeated Con. Wallace for the Labour selection, and became a member of the Federal Parliament. There has just been another selection in. West Sydney with the same returning officer. Any different result was impossible. It may be noted that this same Gavin Sutherland has now been appointed returning officer for the central branch of the Australian Workers Union. Sydney State Labour Selection, 1922. The further we go the more brazenly corr up t do these Labour selections become. This is the famous selection, in which Gregory MCGirr was a. candidate. He. had as a colleague W . Teen, one of the l . W . W . prisoners recently released from gaol. In the following, statement Joe Warner referred to is the professional leader of the unemployed. Messrs. Eldridge and Taylor were two Government officials from Mr MCGirr's Ministerial office:""My naiine is Harry Pritchard. T am a member of the United Labourers Union, and well known to all the officers of the union. On Saturday* 4th February.. 1922, I was at the Trades Hall looking for work, when I met Joe Warner. He said, 'Go into room 23, there is something doing. Get in with them.' I went into room 23, and found myself oneof about forty men. I do not know the name3 of the men-, but I know ten or twelve by sight, aud could piuk them out. A man named Taylor, who, I think, works in the office of Mr Eldr.idge,. Minister of Health's Building, Macquarie-street,, said, -' Wewant you men to go and. vote in the Sydney selection .baJlot today. It will be worth a good day's pay. I will go up to the Labour Council rooms and fix up the union tickets and your instructions, and then you will go out in the cars and vote.' -'""There was a fleet of seven motor cars in attendance. Later, Mr Taylor came back with a number of union tickets and ""' how to vote' cards, and gave them to those present. The cards to me were-(1 ) Waterside Workers Federation, No: 4240, in the name of E. C. Huxliam, 40 Kutland-strcet, City, attachedhereto and marked with the letter ' a.' (2) Federated Brick, Tile,, and. Pottery Employees Union ticket in. the name of' J. T. Adams, no address attached hereto,, and marked with the letter ' b.' (3) 'How to.vote' cards with names of Labour candidates for selection thereon, and with pencilled crosses opposite the names of Bridges-, Buckley. Holdsworth, MCGirr, and Teen, 'attached' hereto, and marked with the letter ' c ' ""On the back of .the-' how to vote-' card was the name of Adams, Jolm ThomaSj Surry Hills, 004 Crown-street,, and the location of the following polling, booths: Belmore, Go Allbion-strcet. Darlinghurst, S3 Brougham-street. King, 04 Crown-street. Paddington, 45 Oatley-road. Darling Harbor, 147 Princess-street. "" I was instructed by Taylor to vote at each booth on each union ticket during the day, aud in .the ease of Ada-nis to give different addresses each time, and to call back at room 23 at the end of the day for payment. We were supposed to hand back our various tickets when we came back t'o be paid. "" I did not vote during the Sydney selection ballot, nor did I hand back the tickets. There was wrangling forhours at room 23 at night over the money. Taylor wanted to pay only 10s. The men said Taylor promised £3 each. The men then, mobbed-the office, rushed it, and said they were not scabs -. that the least Taylor could do was to pay the basic wage. "" He finally agreed to give the men £1each, and I received £1. "" Taylor asked me for my ticket back, but 1 said, 'No, you don't get them, laddie.' "" I went round the booths during the day and watched what was going on. There were challenges at the various booths, bnt most of the ' crook' voters got through and recorded their votes. ""When polling was over I reported the above facts to Mr George Waitc, assistant secretary United Labourers Union. I was desperately in need of the £1 I received, otherwise 1 would not have taken it. But I wish to see these corrupt practices stopped in the interest of the Labour movement. ""One of the men who was operating last Saturday saw me' this morning, and said that twelve men were wanted for today. In order to get what information T. could T. said, ' I want a ' quid ' as badly as any one. I wil l be back later on.' t intend to look round today to try to sec what is doing. "" (Signed) HARRY "" 11th February, 1922."" Having made his arrangements, Mr. MCGirr, like a. seasoned general, retreated beyond the danger zone to Parkes and put this forward as proof of his innocence. The following is thestatement of a man who went into the matter at the instance of Labour Ministers to obtain evidence of corruption against Mr MCGirr, one of their colleagues, with the determination that they would put an end to it. But they subsided in the face of Tammany's power. Mr Thomas Wells states"" This is an absolutely true version of what occurred in the Trades and Labour Council rooms and elsewhere in connection witli the first selection ballot for Sydney, which took place on 4th February, 1022. I went into the matter at the instance of certain public men in the Labour movement to obtain evidence for Mr MCGirr's expulsion, and my instructions were to do everything I was told in Mir. MCGirr's interest. "" I was engaged on the Friday night to run one of what were known as MCGirr's - motor cars, the next day, 4th February, in Sydney selection. A motor called for me on the Saturday morning, and after picking up several others we proceeded to the Trades Hall, and six of us were seated round a table in the Labour Council rooms. The roll book for each division was placed before us. Gentlemen in charge of the - proceedings were Mr Eldrige and Mr Taylor, the former wearing a returned soldiers' badge. They said, ' Now,, you men need not do this unless you like, and can leave the table if you wish.' "" A f t e r certain instructions were given we wrote names from each division, choosing only labourers and domestics. Certain names on the rolls had crosses marked opposite them. We were instructed to lea.ve these' severely alone. ""The work went on all day. chosen from the rolls and placed on union cards, namely, Storemen and Packers Union, Municipal Employees Union, and Water and Sewerage Employees Union. "" Wc, the impersonators, were taken from the Trades Hail together for our meals, and were watched very closely. At 7.45 p.m., after running all day, we rushed to the Addison polling place, Surry Hills, where we voted for the names given to us on ' how to vote' cards, namely, firidges, Buckley, MCGirr, and Teen. Mr J. H. Cutis. "" I voted in the names of R. Wardman, 37 Denman-street, Surry Hils, as a member of the Water and Sewerage Union. This pence card, No. 404, produced, shows 2s. paid on 19th January, and is initialed by the officer in charge ol the polling .booth. Two others with me refused to vote, but I carried out my mission to the end. PRITOHARD. "" There were fully COO impersonations which came under my notice. We were all paid £1 for the day and supplied with three meals. "" I can give the names of other men, two of whom were running cars. There were special code arrangements for telephone communication with the Trades and Labour Council rooms during the day. "" After trying in other directions to have this matter exposed, I decided to place the facts in the hands of Mr J. H . Catts, M.H.R., this 12th day of A p r i l, 1922. I am prepared to supply any further particulars required. "" (Signed) T. WELLS. "" 2 Endeavour-road, Daceyville."" This ballot was eventually upset, and another ballot was ordered through the parties falling out among themselves. Mr MCGirr came to Sydney from his retirement at Parkes, and then retreated to Wollongong. Pritchard in his statement says he was asked to act again on this second occasion. I did not bother about MCGirr's activities on the second occasion, but investigated from another angle. Second Sydney State Labour Selection, 1922. Here is a statement from W. Minter, Clerks Union, in connection with the second Sydney selection ballot :"" At Alderman Stokes' committee rooms, Elizabeth-street, Redfern, near the Central Railway Station, operations were conducted in connection with the second Sydney selection ballot. Alderman Stokes had four gangs of impersonators operating in connection with this 'ballot, each gang under the charge of a superintendent or ganger. "" Alderman Stokes' brother was in charge of one gang. Teen was in charge of a gang. A lady was part time in charge of a gang, and another man whose name I do not know. The Names were lady in question after lunch obtained a list of those of the League who had not voted at the Belmore booth, and who it was understood did not intend to vote, or were away, and these were impersonated by the gangs. "" One of the candidates attended the funeral of a member of the Belmore League on Thursday prior to the ballot, and then impersonated this dead man .in the ballot on the Saturday, and 'boasted in the committee rooms of having done so. Holdsworth, "" The gangs in question were operating on forged union tickets with the exception of the time they were 'impersonating the residue of the Belmore League members previously referred to. '""' Tliere were 600 Federated Liquor Trade Union tickets, 1,000 municipal employees' tickets, and 1,000 Water and Sewerage Board tickets, and there appeared to be an unlimited quantity of other trade union tickets. ""None of these tickets' had a union label imprint on them. They were obviously forgeries,! and had no printer's imprint. case of the Federated Liquor Trades the colour of the faked union ticket is different to the bona fide union ticket. Mr Bains, organizer for the Liquor Trades Union, signed all the Liquor Trade faked union tickets himself, signing them C. Bains. In some cases Ted. Mooney, managing director, Catholic Insurance Company, signed some of the faked tickets, and other signatures were made by other persons promiscuously in the committee rooms. the cases of these forgeries there were originals of the various signatures and other particulars that were copied. The clerks in the committee rooms supplied each member of the impersonating gang with the name and address of some person from the electoral roll in the district on a slip of paper, and the union ticket or pence-card was made out in the name of the voter to be impersonated. The gangs were sent to operate first on one polling booth, then return to the committee rooms for fresh supplies of tickets and instructions, and then operated on another polling booth, and having gone round the whole of the booths they came back to the committee rooms and commenced the same procedure again. Scouts were sent out from the committee rooms to bring back reports as to the best booths for the operations of duplication and personation. These scouts reported that at the Pyrmont booth :it was an open go, that an unlimited number of votes could be polled there provided a union ticket of any sort could be produced. At the Belmore booth, where Mr Magrath, the secretary, Printing Employees Union, was deputy returning officer in charge, more than 2fi per cent, of the votes were challenged by the scrutineers, and these votes were placed in separate envelopes for investigation after the close of the booth. At the count Mr Magrath said he proposed to treat them all as valid votes, and asked had anybody an}' objection? Nobody objected, with the exception of myself, and I urged that the unchallenged votes be first counted and the challenged votes forwarded to the returning officer, Mr Bates, for his investigation and decision. This demand was disregarded, and the whole, of these votes were admitted without scrutiny. challenged votes been investigated, there is no doubt the fraud would have been exposed. In the ordinary course of events rule 6 voters (the union voters) should have signed their name and address in a book for that purpose when they produced their union ticket to vote. But this procedure was not followed at all in the Belmore booth, so' that once a voter left the polling booth there, waa no record of who he was supposed to be. In the case of the challenges, the name and address of the person supposed to be voting was written, down by the deputy returning officer, Mr Magrath, on the envelope. There were eight dozen dead marines (empty beer bottles) in an adjoining room. The place was clearly a beer saloon all day. The booth was full of drunks at the close of the polling. In the It took over half-an-hour to get them out of the polling-ibooth. The scrutineers left in for counting were in a number of cases in such a state of intoxication that we were engaged on account of this at one booth t ill a quarter past 2 a.m. next morning. At the Belmore booth I ascertained that for every league member who voted there were twenty rule 6 votes. In This evidence of criminality, graft, and corruption is capable of almost indefinite expansion. The Political Labour movement in New South Wales has gone, and its place has been usurped by an unscrupulous Tammany gang ready to sell the interests of the workers aud the community generally to the highest bidder, ancl which seeks to obtain control of Parliaments only that it may extend its bribery and corruption to the Departments of State, including the administration of the Police and Judicial Departments. Boss Bailey actually tried to organize a number of Sydney police into his central branch, Australian Workers Union, but ithe Inspector-General of Police and Mr Dooley, then Chief Secretary, frustrated this bold enterprise of Tammany. It is the duty of the Government to searchingly inquire into all the matters set forth and facts and allegations relevant thereto, in order that our Parliaments and public administrations may not be manipulated by and for a corrupt Tammany organization that would soon reduce our public affairs to the level of the worse days and phases of its notorious prototype in New York. Production of samples of forged union tickets. I now produce and hand to the Clerk of the House, for the inspection of Had these honourable members, samples of some of the forged union tickets used in these criminal selection ballots, of which I have a considerable number:-(1 ) Tramway Union ticket, (2) Water and Sewerage Board Union ticket, (3) Storemen and Packers Union ticket, and (4) Municipal Employees Union ticket. None have a printer's imjpriut. Some are forged ready for use. The Municipal ticket has a false short butt to be torn off to represent it as having come out of a duplicate book.",48

There .was.a. further - charge - of. makdngi a false declaration.. Mr Sherwood,, instructed, by Mr. Niland, appeared for the accused. The accused, at the, opening, of the. case, pleaded not guilty. Mr Sherwood' raised the point that,- under certain sections of the Corporation' Act, aetion could only be takenina .case, ofi this, kind,by the inspector of: nuisances or an iofficer appointed .by. the - council. The police, . however,' had taken action., Counsel therefore sutbmitted . that the Court had no jurisdiction; His Honour,, in overruling- - the objection, remarked' that if the objection were upheld, an inspector of nuisances,: appointed-by alder.men who had been electedby means of impersonation, would hardly .be likely ever, to take action against offenders of Cochrane's type. Counsel then instructed the accused to withdraw his plea of notguilty and to plead guilty. Hisi Honour: What!

This young lad was the sole support of his widowed mother, and an appeal is being made to the Labour aldermen of the Sydney City Council for subscriptions to help to keep the house going while he is in gaol. If the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Lambert), who sits, in front of me, had a spark of manhood in him, he would see that the family is kept until the boy is released, and, further, that he obtained a good position again.

A dozen Nationalists, as 1 well as Labonr members* sitting here - now know thisto be true. Some of his-col1 leagues took-him at has; word, and, on 1 arrival: inMelbourne, the Leader of the 1 Opposition' (Mr ' Charlton) called - the party together. Thinkingthat the honourable member for* WestSydney really wished' for aninquiry;. the' honourable member' forDalley (MtrMahony) moved, and: the honourable member' for Werriwa 1 (Mr Lazzarini) seconded, 'that the Leader of the Opposition, when the House met, should stand, up and ask for a public in vestigation ; but Lambert who had sobered - by that time-:",54
223,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"O E ask the withdrawa l of those words. Mr SPEAKER . (Hon.. Sir E l l i o t Johmson:). - If the honourable member,- for - Cook referred to the honourable member - for West Sydney he is not in order in -'-making - a statement of that' kind, and I - ask' him to withdraw it . Mr JH CATTS' - The honourable member asks that. I shall' withdraw the expression that he had sobered up .again. Very well, sir, I do so. 1 Mr LAMBERT. - I ask. that the honourable member shall be required to withdraw the inference' or imputation contained in the words that "" Lambert had sobered up by that time."" Mr SPEiAKER - Tb e honourable member for Cook will be seized of the impropriety of' casting a reflection upon another honourable member, and, I am sure, will be prepared to withdraw it .",55
224,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Yes , sir. The imputation plainly was, that, the honourable member was drunk; but since it is against the rules of the House for me to suggest such a thing, I withdraw it . To continue, the honourable member for West Sydney sneeringly told the fellow mem-bers of his. party that they could have a public inquiry if they wanted it,, and calling - on the honourable member, for Y a r ra (Mr Scullin)., he bounced out of the room in a temper up to the bar. Whereupon, the cue was taken by those remaining and the motion was withdrawn. July 15th, the Macdonell House Australian Labour party junta issued a reply of its own committee of Tammany tools to my speech in this House. 2nd August, according to a Sun report, it was shown that the reply of the Macdonell House Tammany committee was not acceptable in Labour circles. Mr C. C. Lazzarini, M . L . A . , then gave notice in the New South Wales Labour Caucus of a motion for a public inquiry into the charges of corruption. 7th August the Macdonell House j u n t a threatened the expulsion of members who demanded a public inquiry into Labour corruption. That is borne out by the Evening News report. The Australian Workers Union organ, The Worker, also made a brutal attack on these men -16.8.22 . 9th August the New South Wales Labour Caucus, by twenty votes to five, demanded a searching public inquiry into the corruption charges contained in my speech. The minority were Messrs. Dunn, Wright, Stuart-Robertson, Ratcliffe, and MCLelland, with Messrs. Bailey and MCGirr not voting - Su n report. 9th August a counter-charge made upon ex-State Labour Ministers by the Macdonell House junta that they had received large sums of money for the elections, and demanding that Mr MoKell, the treasurer, should toe the carpet and answerA. From what source was this money received T B. How was the money disposed of? Who received it? C. How much did Labour candidates receive ? D. Why did some Labour candidates receive no money at all? I take that matter from, a report of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. 12th August the Macdonell House junta refused the State Caucus demand for a public inquiry into the corruption charges which I had levelled. That fact is based upon a report of the Sydney Herald. 15th August there was a further counter-charge by the Macdonell House junta that Mr Dooley, the New South Wales Labour leader, had the Australian Labour party's books faked to provide branch membership qualification for Mr J . B . Suttor, M . L . C , who was appointed to the Legislative Council. 17th August the State Caucus, driven into a cul-de-sac by the Mr J. H. Catts. Macdonell House Tammany by countercharges of corruption and the threats of expulsion referred to, met to consider the position, and it resolved by fifteen votes to thirteen to seek a conference with the Macdonell House junta. (Vide Daily Telegraph report.) 17th August the Federal Labour Caucus received a latter from the Parramatta State Labour Council demanding action for a public inquiry into corrupt practices. Messrs. Lavelle and Nicholls, M . ' s H . R . , moved that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) should ask for a Royal Commission of In quiry. They were ruled out of order by Mr Charlton, however, on the ground that the matter was one for the Macdonell House executive. 2nd September a conference between the Macdonell House junta and the State Caucus was held. Mr Lambert accused Messrs. Lazzarini, Mutch, and Loughlin of sowing seeds of discord in branch leagues, and demanded their expulsion. Mr Charlton, who was present, opposed a public inquiry, although the northern miners demanded it. A resultless meeting adjourned was for a week. This is from a report in the Daily M a i l , Paddy Minahan's paper. 9th September a second conference of the Macdonell House junta and State Caucus was held regarding a public inquiry. It was adjourned at 11 p.m. for another week. It proved resultless. 16th September the conference of Macdonell House and the State Caucus was resumed, and Messrs. Dooley and Dunn, with two members of the Macdonell House Tammany, were appointed to issue a statement to the leagues and unions of New South Wales explaining the position - Sydne y Morning Herald report. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton), from his place in this House, Morning read an affidavit. The gentlemen concerned want to say that the whole of my charges have been replied to. That affidavit is a perfectly harmless document. If every word of it were an abominable falsehood no action could be taken against the person making it . It has not been lodged in a court of law. It is not in the hands of anybody who could take action. Some of it s points side-step the Labour charges made .agaj/nst the person concerned. At any rate, this charge was based ou the signed statement of a Bed Cross matron; the charge was not mine. In other instances, the charges were obviously so true that the Australian Labour party and Macdonell House got into a f u r y of impatience to fill up some of the gaps which had been exposed by the statements given to the public. Mr Bailey, M . L . A . , and Alderman Lambert issued denials. Of course! What else could they do? But a carefully prepared affidavit, read in Parliament, is a totally different proposrijbion from putting the Gibbs in the witness-box, from which he could be sent to gaol if deemed' guilty of perjury, and in which he could be cross-examined upon his statements. These vague denials of Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, and other men in volved, go no further than would the denials of any other class of law breakers charged with any other type of offence. That is to say, they would be expected to plead not guilty to the accusations levelled against them.. This fact remains: I am the only public Labour man who is asking for a public inquiry.",55
225,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,Where were you when Brookfield asked for it?,57
226,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,He did not ask for it .,57
227,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"He did, and you know that he did.",57
228,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"On 6th July, I quoted some of Brookfield's statements, to the effect that he intended to go to the 1921 Labour Conference to put up a fight there. was there and then that I put up a fight. I am sorry, indeed, that the f at a l dent occurred to Brookfield on his way to that conference. At any rate, the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) is now pleading in effect that these charges of mine are true.",57
229,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I shall speak for myself when I care to take the opportunity to do so. But I repeat, that when Brookfield was making charges similar to those which you have since made, you gave him no assistance. You tried to hound him out of the Labour movement.",57
230,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,That is not true.,57
231,Mr SPEAKER,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Order ! The honourable member for Cook must ""withdraw those words.",57
232,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I do. I disagreed with Brookfield on his disloyalty, but agreed on the fight against the Tammany curse. The honourable member for Barrier knows that this whole business has been exposed in the Barrier Truth. I know that the honourable member has himself exposed it publicly. What do his interjections now mean ? Is the honourable member now the special apologist for all this corruption?",57
233,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"No , but I want you to take your share of it . man Mr JH CATTS - I am taking my share. I worked for a clean-up within the Labour movement, and only publicly exposed the corruption when there was no alternative left.",57
234,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I am glad that you admit that.,57
235,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,And the reason why I have been putting up a fight to clean this all up,57
236,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,You were campaign director when all this was going on.,57
237,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I was nothing of the sort.,57
238,Mr CONSIDINE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"You said, on the last occasion when you spoke about this business, in the House, that you had accepted the position of campaign director, but that you had stipulated for the unanimous consent of the New South Wales Labour Ministry as well as of the party executive before you would take on the job.",57
239,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I did accept it , not all the time this was going on. When I accepted the position, I stipuIt lated that there should be special provision to deal with moneys coming acci- in, in order to find out the source from which they came, to provide against their coming from any corrupt source, and to insure that, in their distribution, f a ir dealing was exercised. And, furthermore, it was understood we were to clean up the filthy stable as soon as the election was over.",57
240,Mr BRENNAN,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"That is right. Y ou were to get your share, anyhow.",57
241,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,That is a barefaced lie.,57

243,Mr BRENNAN,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I do not raise any objection, Mr Speaker. Mr JH CATTS' - The honourable member for Batman does not raise any objection to being publicly recorded as a liar.",57
244,Mr SPEAKER,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Order! It is not matter-of concern to the-honourable memfound ber for Batman only, but to the-House. The rules of this Chamber require that expressions of thecharacter uttered by honourable member for Cook shall not be used. His remark was particularlyoffensive, and I call upon the honourable meming ber to withdraw the words and apologize.",58
245,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I do so, sir, your request. But. the honourable member uttered some diatribe under hisbreath to in. Macdonell House. the effect-,, apparently, that I wanted cut "" out of this corrupt money. If these thieves and burglars at Macdonell House, and their special henchmen in this Chamand had another try. ber, thought-that one word could be said against me they would go "" hot-foot "" a public inquiry. They know, however, that I can go clean-handed into .any quiry which may be opened. I shall my duty to the workers, despite all lany of the lie factory at Macdonell House. I challenge them to enter into a public inquiry. They can make all the charges that their criminal minds may suggest. The exposures which have been made in this House would not be a circumstance, what would come, to light if a proper, quiry were set. on foot^-a n inquiry which tion were a candidate. witnesses could be compelled to attend and at which they, could be forced undergo cross-examination. Thegentlemen involved in my charges have appointed a. second committeeof their own number to.issue a reply. This was after the fight which. has been cn. with the State Caucus for the six. or seven weeks. This is a public acknowledgment that the reply issued by the first committee has been ridiculed yond repair. But a "" packed"" mittee is in no sense an inquiry. What is required is an investigation word "" incorrect."" before a competent Judge, who can send for books and papers, who can, if necessary, seize books and papers, who can compel the attendance of witnesses and demand answers to questions. If such investigation were launched there would be so wide-spread an exposure of the up and fight this corrupt crowd. uttermost rottenness ever known in political history of this country that Macdonell House Labour movement would be well on the road atlast to a very thorough and urgently necessary clean-up. Because I had insisted on an end being put to all this vdleness, as soon as the a Tammanyclique at Macdonell House that they could rake up a majority 1 of four or five in the executive for my expulsion, one of their chief agents-, a the man named Arthur, moved that expulsion.

247,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,During the whole of the time when I was fighting for a clean-up the honourable member spoke to going me in the party rooms day after day past saying that he wished me success.,58

There was not one word of truth in the statement, and I challenge the honourable member to produce the person who gave him the alleged information. ' Mr J. 'EE. CATTS - I challenge the honourable member to 'produce the party minute-book.",59
262,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"West Sydney) [9.37]. - I second the amendment pro forma. I understand that the honourable member for Cook has been engaged, ever since he made his previous statement in regard to Labour politics in New South 'Wales some fonr or 'five 'weeks ago, in compiling and faking-up information on which to base the 'allegations he has 'made 'to night. 'He has J taken' the 'statements of self-confessed criminals,-and ""has gone to ""unreliable and unscrupulous persons for assistance in compiling a 'mass of evidence that, in some ciTcumstamCes, 'would 'appear 'to contain a 'certain amount of truth. It is The difficult 'to 'follow 'the honourable member in' detail' through the 'whole of his"" statement. He referred to me in anything The but flattering terms. He not only i m pugned my honesty, but 'spoke against my 1 moral character also. He referred in disparaging tercns to persons whom I shall name directly, but in particular to Mr Bailey, reiterating practically all the statements he made on a previous occasion, plus some further allegations. In answering those statements I am'fortified with a Tittle more information ""than I had before, which should enable me to show 'the House what class of man the. honourable member ""for Cook is. The late' John 'Storey, an ex-Premier of New South Wales, said, in the presence of several members of the State Parliamentary Labour party, that the Federal Labour-party-was not worth its salt to allow a man like Catts inside its. ranks after the I disgraceful Divorce Court proceedings and. another law case in which 'the honourable membei - was a party. A learned 1 Judfle, who heard the latter case, rethat the word of Mr ; Catts no man could rely upon. The late Mr . Teesdale Smith has often been referred to by the honourable member for Cook. The deceased gentleman said on one occasion, "" Who is this bounder, Mr Catts""?",59
263,Mr SPEAKER,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,Order ! I remind the honourable member that it is not in order tp quote words used by other persons which the honourable member himself would not be allowed to use in the course of his own speech.,60
264,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I will not quote - exact words used by the late Mr Smith, but they were to this effect: "" Who is this bounder?"" Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",60
265,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,If I am not allowed to read the statements which I desire to put before the House,60
266,Mr SPEAKER,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I do not wish the honourable member to be under any misapprehension. The honourable member may state his case in the strongest language he chooses so long as he does not use expressions which are debarred by the rules of Parliament. Expressions which he would not be allowed to apply to. an honourable member cannot be applied by quotation from somebody outside the Chamber. The honourable member will be perfectly in order in giving the effect of any letters he possesses so long as he does not use unparliamentary expressions, and he may quote documents also, subject to the elimination of objection",60
267,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The late Mr Teesthat dale Smith said, in effect, "" Who is this man who is continually bombarding me and visiting me and assuring me that he has such influence with the State Goreceived vernment of New South Wales that f o a certain consideration, a fair l y sum, he would influence the Government to let certain .profitable contracts to me?""  able member for Cook did not quote that statement!",60
268,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"No ; Mr Catts would not quote that. To show what kind of opinion Mr Catts had of Mr Bailey not very long ago, when he was more in timately associated with him than I even been, let me quote the beginning a letter dated the 26th November, sent by Mr Catts to Mr BaileyDear Jack,-Heart y congratulations upon has your magnificent win. The win referred to was the election of Mr Bailey as member for Goulburn in the Parliament of New South Wales. The remaining part of the letter has no present interest. What I have quoted is the opening sentence. The whole letter is available for inspection by any honourable member who cares to read it . It is signed "" J . H . Catts."" When the honourable member for Cook made an unwarranted and slanderous attack upon Mr . Bailey, abusing the privilege extended to the him as a member of this House, Mr . Bailey forwarded me one ortwo little items about Mr Catts, and said in a covering letterHerewith I enclose some particulars bearing upon Mr J. H. Catts. In addition to those particulars-whe n he, Mr Catts, was prosecuted under the. War Precautions Act, I kept him out of gaol, as no one else would go bondsman for him, and I was responsible for his utterances till the war ended. I think you will get sufficient out of the particulars here enclosed to suit you. I will now-deal with what the honourable member said about faked union ballots and forced tickets. He said that I defeated Con Wallace corruptly in the West Sydney selection ballot of Augxist, 1921. He cannot prove one act of corruption by me or any of my supporters during the taking of that ballot. He made the statement that a dozen or so motor cars were running from one end of the citv to the other carrying corrupt voters and personators. I know nothing of that; but I do not believe the statement. I was not near the electorate on the day the ballot was held, nor had I been there for several previous days. There were five or six other candidates in the field. The voting was preferential, but I an absolute majority of votes on r the first count. The honourable member large made another statement which was absolutely incorrect. He said that the ballot-box was brought to the Town H all . That is not so. The ballot-box was taken, I understand, to the head-office of the Australian Labour party by a respectable and honest citizen who was acting as returning officer; I refer to Mr Gavin Sutherland, who has a much cleaner reputation than that of the honourable mem- ber for Cook. Mr Sutherland has never have been before the Law Courts, and has of never been publicly stigmatized by a 1918, Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, as the honourable member been, as an u n truth f u l and unreliable man. Mr Sutherland was in charge of the counting of the ballot, and every candidate except myself, who had no scrutineer, was present with his scrutineer, watching his own interests. Yet, as I say, I received a majority of thevotes on the first count. That is all I know of that ballot."" As ' to the f aking of tickets to. which the honourable member alluded, I would, remind honourable members that. Mr Catts himself has an interest in. a pretty decent printing, works in Sydney,, and has a very good knowledge, of printing. At one time he was regarded as practically expert. He mentioned a selection ballot for the old Namoi seat, taken in 1916, or thereabouts. It is a fact that some forged voting slips were found to be attached to some of the ballots; but the Returning Officer, who was the agent for the Australian Workers Union at Wee Waa, detected thoseslipSj and brought them under the notice of the union, which impounded them with the intention of having them inspected. I have been told that the honourable member for Cook at one time knew a great deal about locks, and was very efficient in ferreting out things. However, that is no businessof mine. The ballot in question could not be described as corrupt, because the agent of the Australian Workers Union, who was Returning Officer, promptly brought the forged papers under the notice of the union, which took action in regard to them. I have a good idea as to who it was who forged those slips, which could be detected at a glance as forgeries. They were certainly never received as good votes nor counted. The honourable member made many references to MT.. John Bailey, member of the Legislative Assembly, and used words regarding him that,.to my mind, had no application. He spoke of a "" Tammany gang"" and of "" this corrupt gang of burglars."" J would ask if that is parliamentarylanguage? Mr SPEAKER' (Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) - They would be unparliamentary if applied to any member of this House, but the references, I understood',, were to sons outside.",60
269,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The honourable member suggested that Mr John Bailey is a member of such a gang, and that I was also a member of it, and still am. He [99] spoke of me as, though I were practically a burglar, or something of that kind. The honourable member knows a great deal about selection ballots. He has had more experience of them than I have had. I have been concerned in two only, and was chosen on both occasions. The honourable member has been-, concerned in very many. He has beenaccused outside of the most corrupt practices, imaginable in the conduct of those ballots.",61
270,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,That is not true.,61
271,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"In all the selection an ballots in. which he was directly concerned, the honourable member was out supervising, instructing his workers, and attending every polling-booth in his electorate. A few years back, there was a controversy between him. and Mr Stuart Robertson, member of the Legislative Assembly; and I would not like to repeat what the latter said' of the-honourable member's character. Mr J.. H . CATTS.,-Anythin g he might have said about me would carry as much weight as what the honourable member might say.",61
272,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The honourable member for Cook stated that, on the first occasion when Mr John Bailey, niemiber of the Legislative Assembly, was selected for the Goulburn seat, the balloting was corrupt. That, being so* it is a strange thing that the honourable member himself should have travelled all over the Goulburn electorate electioneering for Mr John Bailey, and that he should have written him a congratulatory letter on his election. The honourable member spoke of the corruptness of the Australian Workers Union machinery.. That machinery is not under my control.. It was under my control some time back; but I voluntarily handed over the position that I held in it . He said, too, that the Australian Labour party is controlled by the corrupt machinery of the Australian Workers Union.. He spoke of the tentacles of the Australian Workers Union enfolding it, or something to that effect, and said that it intimidated Labour members, and tried per- to engineer sitting members out of their seats. I did not take the seat of any sitting member, nor did Mr Bailey. Mr. Arthur Blakeley was elected in opposition to a former member; but he wa» quite justified, from the point of view of the party, in opposing that former member. W it h that exception, not one of probably a dozen members of the Australian Workers Union who have been members of this, or other Australian Parliaments, during the past two or three years, 'has taken a parliamentary seat away from a Labour member, and that man had "" r at t e d "" on the Labour party at that time. There is absolute disproof of the honourable member's statement that the Australian Workers Union machinery was operating through the Australian Labour party to engineer sitting men out of their seats, so that they might be occupied by meu controlling the Australian Workers Union. The honourable member seemed rather annoyed because I was Lord Mayor of Sydney, and spoke scathingly of me as the "" Great Lord Mayor."" Indeed, the honourable member was so ruffled that the venom almost oozed out of his mouth when he was uttering his vindictive words. said that, when Mayor of Sydney, I had promised a certain person a good job, or something like that, if he would personate voters for me at the Sydney municipal election. It is what I would like to describe as a lie, but I cannot, as it would not be parliamentary to do so. However, it is an absolutely incorrect statement. It is an unscrupulous and slanderous statement, which only a desperate man could make. I regret that there were certain cases of impersonation in the Sydney municipal elections just as there are cases of impersonation in all parliamentary elections, and yet, because one young fellow was proved guilty of impersonating and was unfortunate enough to receive three months' imprisonment, the honourable member has the audacity to come to this House and make the unscrupulously mendacious statement that I actually arranged with men to personate voters for me.",61
273,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I did not say that.,62
274,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The honourable member went very close to saying it . If he did not say it straight out, he inferred it . Although the young fellow in question was an employee of the Sydney City Council I did not know him. think I would remember him today, although I did see him a little time after he was arrested for the alleged offence.",62
275,Mr GABB,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,If the honourable member had supported the young man's family during his imprisonment it would be an admission of guilt.,62
276,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Fortunately his family were in a position to support themselves. The honourable member would have it that this young man asked me to to put hi m back in his job. It was not a, very good job. It was navvy ing or similar work on the roads of Sydney. In any case, how can the honourable meml>er prove his statement that this man voted for me? Once a ballot-paper goes into the ballot-box I am not likely to know the name of the person for whom the vote has been given. He may, or may not, have voted for me. I shall not mention his name, but from information received, I have been led to believe that his family have never been supporters of the Labour party. In all probability therefore, he did not vote for me or for auy Labour candidate. I am sorry to have to mention these matters. It is getting right down into the gutter. I have never listened to more miserable, contemptible, He and dirty arguments than I have heard to-night from the honourable member. The honourable member has said that the recent Cook ballot was corrupt, but I know nothing about it . I had no more to do with it than the honourable member had"". Mr J. H. CATTS - I did not charge you with that.",62
277,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"But I am defending my organization, which has been slandered by the honourable member. There may have been a certain amount of irregularity in the ballot in question, but the fact that the organization, after investigating the matter, ordered a new ballot does not make the organization itself corrupt. The honourable member says that Mr Tom A r t h u r, whom he describes as being a disciple of Mr Bailey, was to be engineered into the Cook seat, and that the corrupt Australian Workers Union and Australian Labour, party machinery was to be employed for the purpose. As a matter of fact, neither the Australian Workers Union nor the Australian Labour party took any part in the Cook selection, and the man who obtained selection at the first ballot also obtained I do not selection at the second ballot, and the Mr . A r t h u r referred to was defeated. I am not prepared to say that the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) printed the forged tickets he has in his possession. I would not be allowed to say that.",62
278,Mr LISTER,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,The honourable member can say it outside if he believes it .,63
279,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I can easily show who printed them.,63
280,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"There is something very suspicious about these tickets, and it has a very close relation to the honourable member himself. I am not an expert, and cannot say whether the tickets in question were printed on certain machines or uot, but I know that there are some machines in Sydney, although I have not patronized them, on which crooked work can be done. I do not say that the honourable member is a partner in the running of those machines, but I know that he is interested in certain printing works in Sydney, The honourable member criticised Mr . Fitzgerald, M . L . A . , and said that that gentleman got his first selection corruptly. He said that there were 700 timber workers spread over 14,000 miles of country on the north coast. I am a bushman of many year's training, and I have travelled a great deal in Australian States. Therefore, I am aware that there are more than 700 timber workers in the timber belt in the north of New South VVales, and if they voted for their secretary in the selection ballot that is all I know about the matter. However, it is absurd for the honourable member for Cook to come into this House and endeavour to attack the character of a member of the State House who compares much more than favourably with himself. The honourable member also referred to a Mr Dick MACDonald, who is, according to his own statement, a self-confessed criminal and forger. How can the House place any reliance on a statement made by a man of that calibre? I know him, but will say nothing in detriment of his character. I am not dirty enough to come into this House and, under the cloak of privilege, use the slanderous words which the honourable member has chosen to apply to men outside, calculating to do them in j u r y and prevent some of them from earning a living. Mr Dick MACDonald was not an old organizer of the Australian Workers Union in. that sense of the word, but he was in a very bad way in Sydney in 1918, and as he was an acquaintance of mine I used the power that I possessed under the rules of my union to appoint an organizer for a month or two.",63
281,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,He was appointed to organize the police of Sydney.,63
282,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"That would not have been a bad undertaking if the honourable member's statement were correct, which it is not. It is absolutely incorrect. He was appointed to organize miners, rabbit trappers, and bush workers on the south coast, and to do certain other work.",63
283,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,Tamman y wanted to organize the police of Sydney.,63
284,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"That is not'a correct statement, and only serves to show the absurd mind of the honourable member.",63
285,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I can prove it .,63
286,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The honourable member says now that I , along with other gentlemen in Sydney, were going to corrupt the police force in Sydney.",63
287,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,You were going to attempt to do so.,63
288,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The honourable member has also made a very serious statement about Mr Carey, the general secretary of the Australian Labour party m New South Wales. He has said, in effect, that Mr Carey informed him that he stole the ballot-papers in the Goulburn selection ballot, where Mr Jack Bailey was selected and proposed to. hold them over Mr Bailey's head as a weapon if ever that gentleman endeavoured to put the boot into him,. That is also an absolutely incorrect statement, and a cowardly fabrication aimed at the character of a man whom I thoroughly believe to be an honest and decent citizen. The honourable member has made the further statement that Mr Bailey manipulated the Australian Workers' Union ballot in order to get Mr Brown, a Sydney solicitor, selected for the Eden Monaro seat in the Federal Parliament. That also is a statement that is absolutely incorrect and cannot be borne out by facts.",63
289,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I quoted the statement of the Returning Officer.,63
290,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"So far. as the in tegrity and character of Mr Brown are concerned, the honourable member for Cook is not fit to wipe his boots. The honourable member also referred to certain criticisms made by Mr Minahan, M . L . A . , in 1918, in connection with the selection ballot for the New South Wales State election. I admit that Mr Miuahan did make an unsupported statement which could not be proved; but whatever statement he did make was made after he had had a misunderstanding with the controlling body of that organization. That organization did not expel him, simply withdrew his endorsement, because he was not following out the policy that party on a certain question. Hownot ever, his selection was re-endorsed at later date, and he was re-elected. The honourable member for Cook ferred to the Sydney State selection lots for 1921, and it was in connection with those ballots that he produced the tickets alleged to be forged. If the orable member knew all about these hapHis penings, why did he not bring them before the controlling body?",63
291,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"I did so; I brought them before you at the Congress, but ruled me out of order.",64
292,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The ballot was not held u n t i l late in the year honourable member was a member of the Labour party u n t i l after the elections in March last. It will be seen that, although the honourable member was a member the party, he failed to bring these things before the executive.",64
293,Mr JH CATTS,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,I did bring them before the executive.,64
294,Mr LAMBERT,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"The member also referred to my own personal selection ballot in 1922, and described as a corrupt one.

I do know any of the gentlemen to whom a he has referred except by reputation. The honourable member also impugned rethe good name and honour of one who is balan honest man.

However, at the instance of the Labour party, I believe there were close upon 1,000 names off the rolls at the Court. I may that at the Revision Court the antibut Labour people had the aid of a solicitor and barrister, a junior barrister, and or five clerks for three or four weeks, whereas my organization was represented by an ordinary solicitor, with the result, as I have said, that close upon 1,000 names were struck off.

322,Mr BRUCE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [10.52] - I m o v e That this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the measure is to give effect to the proposal indicated in the Budget statement for the removal of the war surcharge upon the land tax. The circumstances in regard to land taxation in Australia in general, and in the Commonwealth in particular, are well known to honourable members. The Commonwealth land tax was first introduced in 1910 for a definite purpose and as a definite act of policy. It was designed to endeavour to break up large estates, and 30 it was not at any time regarded as a 10 revenue measure.",67
323,Mr RILEY,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Who said so? / 20 Mr Bruce - That has been often stated, and was clearly expressed by the AYES. party to which the honourable member bec longs. It was introduced by that party, and had the definite purpose I have mentioned. The tax was increased in 1918, but that increase was a purely revenue-producing impost. The circumstances of the war had placed the Commonwealth finances in such a position that revenue had to be drawn in for national purposes, but when the surcharge was increased in 1920 it was made perfectly clear that it was not added with any in tention of giving effect to a policy of land taxation for the breaking up of large estates, and the promotion of closer settlement, but was intended purely and simply to raise revenue for warpurposes. This charge was placed upon land because it was one of the easiest sources from which revenue could be obtained .",67
324,Mr FLEMING,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,That is the trouble.,68
325,Mr BRUCE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"F o r once, I have a lot of sympathy with the honourable member. Land is an object that cannot be removed, and is certainly an easy victim of taxation. Whilst the circumstances of the moment demanded that a revenue tax should be placed upon land, it is clear, and I think that every party in the House will agree, that it should be removed at the earliest moment. There might, at first sight, be some suggestion of opposition from honourable members of the Labour party, but I have sufficient confidence in their sense of justice to> believe that they do not wish the continuation of a special tax on one class of the community. The surcharge of landtax is an additional income tax, or a capital tax, levied on a particular class of property,, and it is neither just nor proper to impose taxation in this way. Those who say thatproperty should be taxed to a .greater extent than it is are on sound and logical ground if they move for the increasing of taxation on all classes of property; but they are on unsound ground when they say that one particular class of property should bear a burden not imposed on other classes of property. It was stated in the Budget that the repeal of the surcharge would be proposed. Our financial circumstances are not all that we would wish, but they have improved sufficiently to allow us to carry out this promise. We are^doing nothing at this stage to interfere with the land tax,, which-, has been in operation in the Commonwealth for many years as part of a policy designed to achieve a certain result; all we are proposing is the removal of ai surcharge i m posed in pursuance of noother policy than the raising, of additional revenue.. It has been, suggested that this isanother sop to a particular class,, but that is not so.. The proposal, is. based, on. definite principles o£ equity,, and it. is> a measure of relief that is rightly introduced as soon, as our financial circumstances permit of it being put intoeffect.",68
326,Mr ANSTEY,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"Bourke) [11.0] - The Leader of the Opposition (MT . Charlton) is not present, and as fie: would like to say"" something on the Bill I ask for an adjournment of the debate:.",68
327,Mr GREENE,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"-No .  1 the Opposition is sick,",68
328,Mr ANSTEY,WATER SUPPLY ATJD SEWERAGE,"My request for an adjournment was only a f ormaL one,, because I was confident that it would be refused. Do the Government propose to apply the "" gag "" to thediscussion of this measure?. The super tax which it is proposed, to repeal was not imposed by the party with, which I am. connected, but was brought forward by the present Government in 1918. We are-, now asked to discuss a; Bill to amend the Land Tax Act 1910-1918-, and to> repealthe. Land Tax Acts of 1918-1919. and 1920.. Thisw ill bring the law back to where it stood when theAc to f 1'910> became law: That Act was a Labour measure,, designed to bring the lands of the country into fuller use by taking them out of the hands of the few, and putting them into those of the many. It was a wise and beneficial measure, and has brought about great indust r i a l changes. Millions of acres which were in pastoral occupation have since been tilled, and the immense production of wheat, oats and barley that has resulted has increased the revenue obtained by the various Australian Governments through income taxation,, has increased our exp o r t at i o n, thus enabling the State Governments to meet the i r obligations in foreign markets,, and this has in turn increased our importations, and swelled our Customs: revenue-. Since the present Government have been in office there has been a falling off in agricultural production in this country. The present Government in 1918, for reasons which they considered to be just, imposed a super tax.. The Treasurer is now trying, to repeal that measure,, and would give the impression that the super tax. was imposed by a Labour Government.. As a matter of fact: there, was not a Labour Government in poweri n 1918. and the super tax wasreally imposed by the present Government. There are still a number of large estates, which have been untouched by theoperationof the Federal land tax. It seems tome that insteadof the tax being diminished it should be enormously increased, in view of the desire for the land settlement of soldiers with the intention of bringing / properties previously occupied as pastoral - properties into use for agricuitiire. A statement which, - recently appeared in the Argus gives some interesting intennaition relatingto the owmorshap - oif these'estaiee, which was icoatakred in a return - laid cm. the table of the Legislainwe Assembly of Victoria in response to a inquest by Mr. Bailey, the honourable member for Port Fairy. The - return : ah owed that at the 31st Beoember, 1921, these - were (fifteen estates of 20,000 acres and over held, in this State of Victoria alone. Honourable members know that Victoria is the smallest of the States of the mainland - of Australia. New South Wales is about three times the siae of Victoria, Queensland ,albout three times ithe size of 'New South Wales, and Western Australia sontains an :area of - about - one-third of the total area of the Commonwealth.. In addition to the estates of 20,000 acres and over, there are many 'estates in Victoria flf 15„000, 10,060. and 17,00,0 .acres. According to the xe-turn presented, I find that the first estate mentioned is Terricka Estate, of 20,505 acres, in the county af Bendigo, .and the owner is Evelyn L . Atkinson. The next estate mentioned is the Kongbool Estate, of 111,786 acres, in Dundas county, and the owner is J. G. Bobertson. There is the Pulham Estate, of 28,1613 aores, also in Dundas county, which is, according to the return, the owners' settlement of - G. M . Annytage. The Armytages are a very famous family in Victoria, and amongst the earliest of our settlers. 1 believe that the first of the family to settle in AustraliaGeorge Armytage-arrive d in Hew South Wales at a .place called Botany Bay, inabout the year 1832, having a free passage, at the expense of his country. The next estate mentioned is the Glendinning and Melville Forest Estate, of 52,879 acres, in Dundas .county, the .owner of which is R. S. Faliiner, who, I believe, was at one time a member of this House, but thought he could do better - outside. There is next the Koolomext and Kadnook Estate, of 38,504 acres, in Dundas and Low an counties, and the owner is Benjamin Chaffey. Tho Chaffeys cam© originally from America and started schemes in connection with irrigation. Honourable members are aware that as the result of the development .of irrigation we have country now .along the Murray that is a blooming paradise which was previously practically ,& desert. Thane are thousands of lorarage, apple,, ;arad - other frui t trees on these lands. I ask leave to continue any address later. Leave gram-ted; ""debate adjourned. House adjourned at 11.14 p.m.",68
