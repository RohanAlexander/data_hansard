Debate resumed from 4th July (vide page 491), on motion by Mr BENNETTThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. Upon which Mr DEAKIN had movedThat the following words be added to the Address :-""And to inform Your Excellency that the Government merits the censure of the House and the country for its failure to realise its national aud constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of its duty to secure industrial peace and good order, and to uphold the law within the Commonwealth; for its maladministration of public affairs and public departments; for its grossly partisan actions and appointments, and its reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth.""",14
1,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [10.31] - I do not intend to traverse all the paragraphs in the Governor General's Speech; nor shall I , if it can be avoided, repeat what has been ably said by preceding speakers. If repetition could be prevented in this House, much time would be saved to. the country. The Opposition has shown what men will dare whem in dire extremity. Its leader moved an amendment to the Address, believing that he could say something that would injure the Government and its following; but he must now have realizedthat he has only given us the opportunity we desired for stating our position to the people-a n opportunity which otherwise we could not have obtained. The manner in which charge after charge has fallen to the ground is remarkable. The great accusation of the honourable member for Ballarat was that the Government had evaded its responsibility hy postponing the prosecution of the Coal Vend. That bubble burst when pricked with the explanation of the Attorney General, and the charge faded into thin air. We have heard no more since of the wrong doing of the Ministry in that connection ; though we have heard something, whether true or not, of the machinations of the Vend, a section of which, I believe, is withdrawing from the appeal, and thus putting the Vend's case out of Court. The next charge had to do with the Brisbane strike, in regard to which I . shall add nothing to what was so ably said by the honourable member for Brisbane, who, as ar. eye witness, related what he saw and heard. First-hand knowledge is best on a matter of this kind. Hearsay is of no account in comparison with the evidence of the man who followed the actions of both sides of the dispute day by day, and has stated the incidents categorically, so that any one may easily follow the occurrences. His speech is an answer to what has been said about the conduct of the strikers at Brisbane. I deplore the tact that the Oppositioa shows a tendency to revert to the old method of settling disputes with the bludgeon and the club. Its members belong to the age when differences, were always settled with violence, and they would employ means of coercion far more deadly than the club. If they will go back through the history of one or two of their leaders, they will find instances in which those in authority were only too ready to draw the bayonet,' and call in the military to settle disputes in favour of one class; to allay the justifiable uprising of men who were oppressed, and who were protesting against their unjust conditions. The honourable member for Parkes must remember-thoug h he is not in the chamber, so that it is useless to appeal to him- a case that occurred some years ago at Newcastle. He is very seldom here, unless he has a speech to make. The courtesy on which he prides himself is not sufficient to require him to make an audience for any one else. He must remember the occasion on which Sir Henry Parkes sent nordenfeldts to Newcastle. I was not there, but I was one of the jury chosen to try the case of the men charged with riot, after a panel of 242 had been challenged. . As a juryman, I heard the evidence on both, sides, and learned what it was that created the disturbance. The strikers were whiling away their time in the happiest way possible at a picnic at Lambton, at which their wives and children were present. While they were gathered' together, a vehicle came along. It was loaded with vegetables and other provisions for. the soldiers. Some one, it was alleged, had taken the pin out of the axle, and the wheel came off, and legs of mutton, pumpkins, cabbages, &c, to feed the military raced down the incline. The gathering ran to see this wonderful, providential interference; and the military and the colliery manager in charge, instead of recognising that they had a body of - men, women, and children to deal with, making a circle round them, forced their way through, willy nilly, at the risk of tramping on the dear ones of the men on strike. These men, as any others would have done, resented this outrage, and what was called a riot occurred. Who was to blame for the riot? I am proud to say that eventually justice was done; but the case is sufficient to show what is likely to arise if men are threatened with military suppression. threat, in itself, is an incentive to disorder, indicating, as it does, that disorder is expected, or is going to be created, and that all is in readiness to meet it. I have no wish to be unfair to honourable members opposite, but if there is any logic in their reasoning or any basis for this attack on the Labour party, it follows that, had they been in office at the time, they would undoubtedly have sent the military as requested. That being so, what is the use - of all the mock heroics to which the honourable member for Swan treated us last night? That exhibition only indicates that there is something wrong with his 41 innards ""-wit h his inside, or the inside of his party-and they are trying to cover up their own disabilities behind some baseless and futile charge designed to discredit the Government. But honourable members opposite do not realise that during the whole of this debate they have been throwing boomerangs which - have returned to the thrower every time. It has been very interesting to watch course of the debate. The Opposition have do. something more to conquer than this side - a greater trouble than the mere fightis Mr. ing of the Labour party; they have to settle with their own party, inside and outside Parliament, before they can show united front to the enemy. And can any one wonder, when a fusion of the kind is attempted, that the great differences of opinion should prevent assimilation? carry on the business. As has often been said before, we see opoutside posite honourable members representing compatible elements of political opinionTories mainly, with a few mock Liberals, but, so far, I have failed to find any Democrats. But what is to be said of our friend who is so very seldom in the House when he desires to be heard? If this Parliament depended on the presence of honourable members like himself we should more often be without a quorum than otherwise.",14
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There are not many Labour members here this morning!,15
3,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"They are mostly here, and the honourable member knows it. As I have said, there are honourable members opposite who are rarely in the chamber except when they desire to make a speech to suit the purpose they have in view. Such men are not doing their The duty to the country, and it is as well the people of the country should know who does and who does not attend to their interests.",15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The average attendance on this side is better than that of honourable members opposite.,15
5,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am not surprised at anything the honourable member may say after what we heard from him in this debate.,15
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is a "" beggarly array of empty benches"" on the Government side, and yet the honourable member chastises the Opposition !",15
7,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"As the honourable member knows, Friday morning, of all periods in the week, is characterized by the greatest paucity of attendance. What we must pay regard to is the average attendance. The honourable member, to whom I referred a little while ago, is the honourable member for Flinders, who comes in, records his attendance, and then, as a rule, leaves, as many others on his side, the and, possibly, one or two on this may, fair ! FAIRBAIRN - I do not think that",15
8,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not care whea ther the honourable member thinks it fair or not, it is only fair that the people should know the honourable members who merely record their attendance, and leave others to Those men who the House criticise the Labour party inshould have the "" acid"" applied to themselves when they profess to represent the country in this chamber.",15
9,Mr FAIRBAIRK,Unknown,I would sooner have the honourable member for Flinders in the Chamber five minutes than the honourable member except for Gwydir for a whole day 1,15
10,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have no doubt; indeed, the honourable member would, I suppose, rather have the honourable member for Flinders here a minute than have myself for a lifetime, for the simple reason that there is no affinity between us. The honourable member is a cold-blooded mortal all the time, and, as such, cannot find the company of warm-blooded humans congenial.",16
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"To hear this attack on honourable members who are absent, I think we ought to have a quorum.",16
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member can call for a quorum without offering any remarks -[Quoru m formed. ] . Mr Webster - In this call for a quorum we have another example of the venom of the other side. The cry of "" spoils to the victors"" has been raised as a trump card with honourable members opposite. I cannot see, however, that they have succeeded in throwing any reflections on the Labour party, in showing the appointment of some eight officials, alleged to hold the same. political beliefs as those of the Opposition, and two or three other officials, alleged to have Labour proclivities. There is nothing in the facts of which, I think, we need be ashamed, provided that the men appointed are qualified to carry out the duties of their position, a point on which I am not able to speak with authority. Positions of the kind should be allotted in the interests of the country, apart from any other consideration. It would appear that honourable members opposite raise objections simply because we have not boycotted men with Labour views. As a matter of fact, it is remarkable to find a Government so modest in considering their own supporters as to keep the plums of office for those of other political beliefs. Nothing more, I think, need be said on this subject. If the Government have made any mistake in this connection they must shoulder the responsibility. What Government has there ever been that has not made mistakes at times? Have the appointments made by the Public Service Commissioner always turned out well ? He is supposed to be specialy qualified for the selection of officers. He has spent his life in business of that kind - He has a trained staff to help him. Yet he has occasionally admitted that an officer whom he has appointed has not filled the bill. If , however, this Government make a mistake - and I am not. saying that they will not - the y are condemned for it as unworthy to exist. I now have something to say with regard to the honourable member for Flinders. I should prefer to speak in his presence, but one rarely finds him here- This is the thorn in the side of the Opposition. They have more trouble with the honourable member for Flinders than they have with honourable members on this side. Their trouble lies in settling difficulties caused by that erstwhile champion of the capitalistic class.",16
13,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Our troubles 1,16
14,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That is the trouble of honourable members opposite. Their trouble is internal, chronic, and deadly. The honourable member for Flinders is practically the opposite of the honourable member for Ballarat. When the Liberal Conference propounded a beautiful programme, he gave it forth to the country as something which the people should be glad to support. He eulogized it to the :,kies, as he does everything. There is no appropriate word in the dictionary that he left unemployed in praise of that programme. Then comes the honourable member for Flinders, and. immediately the honourable member for Ballarat and those associated with him begin to quiver and to shrink, and to shirk the issue which the honourable member for Flinders raised. He said of their precious programmeAU the bones had been carefully removed, and nothing left but a kind of gelatinous compound, political food for infants and invalids. Has anything been said on this side so injurious to the Opposition as was said by the honourable member for Flinders? Has any honourable member in this party used more scathing terms of ridicule, contempt, and. humiliation than those, towards - the men and women who formulated this so called Liberal programme? When this gentleman spoke of bones which have been carefully removed and of nothing being left but a kind of gelatinous compound, food for infants and invalids, he was quite right, i h my judgment. I have looked through this vaunted programme, and have never met a better description or interpretation of such a production than that delivered by the honourable member for Flinders.",16
15,Mr WEST,Unknown,"He knew what he was talk> ing about. . Mr Webster - Of course, he did , and he knows why he is talking, too'. The Opposition also know why he was talking, though they profess that thej> do not. He proceeded to say that this programme waswarranted not to cause the slightest inconvenience to the weakest digestion. It is a kind of soothing syrup; something to gratify the palates of people outside whom honourable members opposite profess to represent; something calculated to keep up their courage, or, at all events, to ease their pain. VVe might reasonably use the term employed by the honourable member for Flinders, and recommend to Liberal voters in this country a bottle of "" Irvine's Liberal Soothing Syrup - a cure for all ailments that the Liberal party is heir to ! "" The honourable member went on to: say something more imperative, something more in the nature of a commandUnless they arrived at a more clear and definite programmeThat indicated that they had not a clear and definite programme yethe did not know whether it would not be just as well for Australia if the Labour party were <to be victorious at the next election. H a ve the L i be r a l part y altered their form? A r e they going to let the Labour party be victorious at the next election? Parliament. They do not know. They simply "" dunno where they are!""",16
16,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The programme is in the incubator at present.,17
17,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Oh no; it was in ithe incubator for a long time, but it - at length been incubated. As, however, according to the honourable member for destiny. Flinders, it is not yet wholly developed, they have placed it, not in the incubator, but in the refrigerator. That is where it is now. God knows what it will like when it comes out! Judging the amount of brotherly love that prevails - over there, I should think that there is - enough warmth of feeling to thaw the poor thing out before the next election. Here, however, is the Liberal programme, and the honourable member for Ballarat will with his henchman the honourable member for Parramatta-thes e two great leaders - the one who has been leader of a party leader. and the other who has been the leader of many parties-ai e trying now to lead many parties as one. The honourable member ultimately become the sole leader. for Parramatta must feel in a very humithe liated position when, after spending so - much time with the ladies' conventions, .going round to meetings of the Women's National League in Victoria and South Australia, and travelling 3,000 miles bring these people together in the Liberal camp, he finds that all the work has been laid low by one fel l blow from their own side.",17
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That does not even hit the target, because I was never there at all.",17
19,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I will quote something to show that the honourable member thought h? was there, anyway. There is something to admire about the honourable member for Flinders. One can appreciate the manner in which he makes his position clear. One can admire a man who speaks out what is within him. He went on to sayUnless they could arrive at something which the people could grasp and understand as a ' definite, clear, and progressive policy, and not a vague tissue of generalities, it might in the long run be best for Australia if the Labour Party had another three years of office. Evidently the honourable member does not think that the fruit is ripe yet. He thinks that it will take three years longer to ripen. He is not anxious for the honourable member platfor Parramatta and the honourable member for Ballarat to pluck it at the end of this He thinks that if the Labour party stays in office three more years his day may come, and he may be able to pull the fruit which will then be ready for himself alone - There is wisdom in these remarksthe wisdom of the serpent. If honourable members could read the writing on the wall, has they would see that the honourable member for Flinders*, has been shaping his own I say, all credit to him. As far as I am concerned,' I wish to God he could lead the party opposite at the next election. If he postpones his leadership for be three years, we shall continue to sit where from we are, and, if he becomes leader, then it will mean three years more of power for us. not No matter which way it goes, we shall r e main a solid party, and if the honourable member for Flinders survives and controls the party opposite-as I think he will-it be the best thing that can happen to us.",17
20,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,He is their natural,17
21,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Not only that, but when three men are trying to lead, one must After honourable member for Flinders made these strong remarks, the newspapers published leading articles in some of which he was condemned for disloyalty to his party, while in others he was commended to for his outspokenness - Then, the terror of the press having fallen upon the Opposition, they ""crayfished"" one after the other, and told us that, after all, the platform attacked by the honourable member, was only a draft, and had yet to be submitted to the Ltague and another meeting of their party. It would have to pass through three or four processes, they told us, before finally emerging as the fighting platform of the Liberal party. possible, however, to formulate a platform out of the gelatinous compound to which the honourable member for Flinders referred? Could the honourable member for ' Illawarra fight on such a platform?",17
22,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We shall have a fighting platform which the honourable member and his party will not like.,18
23,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Yes ; when the honourable member for Flinders has made one for the party. Then and only then will the Opposition have a fighting, platform'. There is not an ounce of real fighting material in the present leaders of the Opposition. In abuse, misrepresentation , evasion, and misinterpretation of the actions of their opponents, the Opposition leaders of today are agreed; but the only member of their party who has been ready to speak out and tell the country where the Liberals are is the honourable member for Flinders. If the honourable member for Illawarra is prepared to admit that the Opposition are going to bury the platform attacked by the honourable member for Flinders and to ask that honourable member to propound a fighting platform for them, then I can understand his statement ; but I cannot imagine anything like a fighting platform' coming from the present leaders. Even the honourable member tor Flinders, however, has seen fit to ""crayfish."" Following upon his speech at Aspendale, a meeting of his party was held, and subsequently the honourable member addressed a meeting at Camberwell, where he positively "" crayfished "" on what he had said before. He said that he did not recognise the platform that had been prepared as the fighting platform of the party. They were not going to fight with aj platform composed! of the gelatinous materials to which he had previously referred, but a fighting platform would be formulated in due course. That is his dictum. He is the real Leader of the Opposition. He is the man who is moulding the destinies of the Opposition for good or ill .",18
24,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Do not worry about our leader-w e shall see to that matter.,18
25,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member has my sympathy. I appreciate hisdifficulties. I know of the heart-burnings among his party, because there are so many wanting office and so few offices to fill. The position must be difficult when so many exMinisters, so many ambitious men-me n Is it difficult to lead, men who have fought in so many different parties-are hitched up to the same waggon. It seems to me that one half of the Opposition will be sitting in the breeching While the other half will be in the collar, so that between the two their political waggon will make no progressYet the honourable member for Fawkner tellsme not to bother about the question of the Opposition leadership. I have no fear of the honourable member applying the whij> to his party. He might coax them to go slowly, but he would never influence them to put on any pace. The honourable member for Flinders-often - says clearly and unmistakably 1 what he means, but at times he forgets what he has said and falls back into the rut of generalities. Alleged extravagence in the Postal Department is one of the charges made by the Opposition which has not been sustained. In their want of confidence motion they have embodied charges of maladministration, but not one of. them has been proved. They have not been game to follow up their charge. While one honourable member of Opposition; has said that there is extravagence in the Postal Department another has said that the expenditure so condemned was absolutely necessary. And so they go on. The honourable member for Flinders, who, I suppose, is at the present moment earning money by appearing in the Courts instead of being in his place in Parliament, addressed a meeting at Camberwell, at which he said ih regard to the Postal DepartmentOrdinary expenditure and ordinary workingexpenditure, leaving additions and extensions out altogether, had been increased by 23^ pen cent., while the additional income had increased by only io£ per cent. He thus implied that the additional in crease of 13 per cent, in such ex1 penditure over income was extravagant, and ought not to have been incurredLet me remind him that a little while, ago he said that in Australia today conditions had so changed that a sovereign would only buy what could be purchased - for 12s. 6cl. ten years ago. If that is so, - will he deny that some readjustment of --salaries was not absolutely necessary in the Postal Department? Is he going to say that, although the cost of living has increased, the salaries of the postal employees should not be so raised as to bring them up to the level of men employed, by outside firms? If he does hold that this increase is extravagance, then the only escape for him as to say, "" If I and my party get into - power we shall put on the screw and reduce - the wages of the postal employees by 10 or 15 per cent, all round."" - member in effect says that this Government has done wrong; that it has been extravagant, and should be removed from office, because it has increased the expenditure of the Postal Department so as to keep - in step with the changed conditions outside. '.If he speaks what he thinks then he must - say that there shall be retrenchment, and that there must be a repetition of what happened in Victoria when, as Treasurer of this State, he reduced the old-age pen. a ions.",18
26,Mr GORDON,Unknown,The honourable member is always bringing before the House the grievances of the postal servants.,19
27,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is all very well - for the honourable member to make that - statement. Nearly every honourable memifoer opposite who has spoken during this - debate has been loud in his denunciation - of extravagance and maladministration in the Post and Telegraph Department.,19
28,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Who said anything about it ? It is the honourable member who ' has done all the growling about the Post - Office.,19
29,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot turn me aside by his pettifogging interjections. He knows very well what I have done, I have taken action, not as a party politician, but as a representative in the National Parliament interested in the ' improvement of a national service. not try to make a political football of the Post and Telegraph Department, but to do what I believed to be right, in spite of party considerations. The honourable member's insinuation, therefore, is unworthy.",19
30,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I admit that the - orahle member has done all the growling.,19
31,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I did more than - ..growl; I worked. I desire the people of - the country and the employees of the Post _ and Telegraph Department throughout Australia to understand that if the member for Flinders is to be obeyed by the Opposition, as I believe he will be ultimately, his views as to the extravagance in the Post and Telegraph Department can only mean that the wages of the employees should be cut down, as he cut down old-age pensions when he had control of them in Victoria.",19
32,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Flinders spoke for himself, and not for this party at all.",19
33,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I notice that when the honourable member for Flinders spoke the party opposite not only recognised what he The honourable said, but, because of it, withdrew their programme and postponed its publication to some indefinite period. I suppose it will be launched at a time when it will be impossible to further criticise it before the elections take place. I do not wonder at the honourable member for Perth becoming irate when I refer to the honourable member for Flinders. The honourable member for Perth was one of the compilers of the platform. It is his work as well as the work of others.",19
34,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The honourable member does not like it.,19
35,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"All I can say is that if it represents all the honourable member can produce, it serves only to show the condition of mind he is in. He is between two stools. He would like to be where he was before, but since he cannot get there, he would have us believe he is trying to do so. The Liberal platform is what the honourable member for Flinders described it to be- a gelatinous compound without any bones.",19
36,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is of no use for the honourable member to say that, because it has never been considered by us yet.",19
37,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Then I am to understand that the great platform which is to herald the destinies of the Liberal party is not to be drawn up by the leagues and conferences of the party, but is to be submitted to the geniuses of the Opposition in this Parliament. I did Mr FULLER - We do not subordinate our opinions to those of others, as the honourable member is obliged to do.",19
38,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Why this mockery and pretence of permitting the people to have a share in arranging the platform ? honWhy do honourable members opposite profess to be Democratic when' they are acting in such an autocratic way? Of what use was it to call conferences of leagues from every State in Australia to assist in forming a platform? When the delegates to the conferencehave done their work, and given of their best for the guidance of the party, the voice of the honourable member for Flinders is heard, and the platform of the conference is set aside. We learn from honourable members opposite now that they propose to manufacture a platform to suit the exigencies of their position, and not the interests of the people.",19
39,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"We can take a hand in framing our platform, but that is more than the honourable member can do. He has to do what he is told.",20
40,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,""" Where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise."" I can tell the honourable member for Illawarra that I have taken a hand in the formation of very nearly every Labour platform that has been submitted to this country. Even before the beginning of the political Labour movement I had some little to do in the moulding of political platforms in this country. We now know that honourable members opposite do not trust the people, and that their platform is to be so framed as to study the interests of the Federal Opposition, and not upon the decisions of conferences of the party outside. The honourable member for Flinders, in speaking of the extravagance of the Post and Telegraph Department, made it plain that he did not refer to expenditure upon extensions of necessary public facilities, and, therefore, when he proposes to reduce the expenditure upon the Department it is as well that every postal servant in Australia should recognise that there is one person at least who is prepared to reduce their wages. I am satisfied that if the general public are asked whether the servants of the Post and Telegraph Department should not receive the same treatment as people outside the Service there will be only one reply from them. J. suppose that the honourable member for Flinders has the same intention with regard to old-age pensions, because he said I think the system of old-age and invalid sions not only wasteful and extravagant, but it is based on a principle, that is in itself to the core. Here is a man telling the people of Australia that the principle underlying the old-age and invalid pensions of the Commonwealth is rotten to the core. What did the honourable member mean by that? He did not explain at his meeting. If he meant - what he said, then a more severe vote of censure upon the pretensions of the other side could not have been submitted by any one, because they have claimed in season, and out of season, to be the authors of the old-age pensions scheme. Every honourable, member opposite"""" makes that claim, yet one of the prominent members",20
41,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,On e of their leaders.,20
42,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"No ; the honourable member for Flinders does not lead, he dominates the party opposite. The man who dominates them has declared that this legislation, which has received their blessing, is rotten to the core.",20
43,Mr FULLER,Unknown,The honourable member himself contested an election on one occasion in opposition to a Labour candidate.,20
44,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member cannot introduce that chestnut now.,20
45,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"My statement is true, nevertheless ",20
46,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It is true that, twenty-one years ago, I did contest an election in opposition to a Labour candidate, but that was prior to Labour candidates being required to subscribe to any pledge. The statement of the honourable member is an indication of how close I am getting to his venomous heart. I regard my action on the occasion to which he refers as one of the most honourable of my life. I refused to be false to my conscience when it was my duty to obey it, and history has since vindicated the attitude which I then took up. That question has been argued upon the floor of this House time and again, but the honourable member is so much at a loss to make any effective reply to the deadly charges which I have hurled against members of his party that in sheer desperation he falls back upon an incident which happened twenty-one years ago. - May I ask the honourable member for Flinders whether he is prepared to reduce the old-age pensions? Will he put the responsibility of supporting those who are infirm upon the brothers and pensisters, the sons and daughters of this community? Wiil he drag into the courts of rotten the country girls who are struggling with the needle in order to compel them to support in decency a father and mother whom they love? Is he prepared to expose their poverty to the world as he did in Victoria? Will he say to the sons and daughters of our indigent, "" You must come before the court and show how much it costs you tosupport your little children? You must curtail your expenditure on education in order that you may support your father and mother "" ? I cannot go into the history of the heartrending cases which were made public in Victoria during the Irvine regime. But had I time to recite a few typical cases, honourable members would understand the frigi d nature of the honourable member for Flinders. If the Opposition are loyal to him, they must tear from the statute-book the legislation which he has declared to be "" rotten to the core,"" They must repeal our old-age and invalid pensions. Let the honourable member tell us plainly whether the Opposition are behind him in his utterances.",20
47,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,He was cheered when he made them.,21
48,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Yes, he was surrounded by a number of men whom it pays to cheer. He then went om to refer to the maternity grant. He said that Mr. Fisher's dream reminded him of the dream of Pharaoh of old. He wondered whether he had spoken to Joseph of it in caucus, and whether Joseph had said that it was a good dream. If the able member for Flinders himself did not speak of it to Joseph in caucus, he ought to have done. He said that it may mean seven f at years on the Treasury benches for the Labour party.. Let me tell him that it may mean the saving of very valuable human life, the preservation of mothers who otherwise might be carried to that bourne from which no traveller returns. A little assistance at such a critical period may help women who have been sacrificed by poverty in their hour of travail. Yet the honourable member has the hardihood to suggest that this maternity grant is intended as a sop to the women of Australia for the purpose of enabling the Labour party to hang on to the Treasury bench. Apparently the spoils of office are all that honourable members opposite can think of. They seem perfectly obsessed - with that idea. Ever since they quitted these benches for the shades of Opposition they have emitted a long continuous wail. of grown men. 'They are undoubtedly suffering from cruel malady - the malady known as fining Company. """" officeitis."" They are terribly grieved because they cannot fill the positions which binations. they occupied too long in this country. "" Officeitis "" is their trouble-the y are not - concerned with the public weal. The honourable member for Flinders wants the Liberals to stand straight, and to meet the perplexities of our industrial and commercial system. What does that mean? That they are not going straight-that they are following a circuitous route. Would the honourable member for Flinders meet the industrial troubles of this country with the same weapons as he used in the Victorian railway strike? Would he pass a law to coerce and suppress them, instead of a law to regulate them ? Would he do these things if he were again in power? The leopard cannot change his spots, and some politicians cannot belie their nature, no matter what they do. When we look to the history of this great dictator of the Liberal side, this great promulgator of pure politics, we have a right to ask that he be judged by his past. It is combinations and trusts that are supporting the Liberal party, and on which the Liberal party are relying. Without the support of the combinations, rings, and other organizations by which they are now honor- backed up, where would they be? Who would support them if it were not for the influence brought about by the expenditure of money by the great monopolists in this country on their behalf ? Where would they get their money from to pay their army of organizers who today are permeating every electorate in this great continent? Where would they get the money to placate the newspapers? If they had not these monopolies behind them, there would be no Liberal party, and no Fusion party, because they would not be able to fight their battles by means of their own abilities.",21

56,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member has made a statement. W i ll he now show where we get money from any large combination ?,22
57,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,You ought know.,22
58,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member is a coward to say a thing which he is not prepared to follow up.,22
59,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,You have been doing nothing else.,22
60,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the honourable member says that his party does receive money from those sources, that is all right. I simply say that we do not get our money in that way. The honourable member is very smart, but he is not quite smart enough yet. When the honourable member for Boothby says that we get £ 1 0 0 where the Liberal party gets £ 1 0 , he is either a baby in politics, or he is wilfully deceiving himself. I have been through two big elections since the last Federal fight. These were two big contests between parties, and I had a chance of seeing with my own eyes what is being done. I am not talking merely for the sake of defeating or deceiving the Opposition. I am talking of what I know to be true. I went through the second Liverpool Plains election. I had charge of the campaign, and I know what we had to work on. It was mostly the enthusiasm of the people, and very little money, but I know what the other side were working on, because it so happened that the originals of a number of letters came into my possession. In these the writers indicated the amounts they were contributing to the Liberal funds. Nearly all the large land-owners in the district were either mentioned in them, or their names were inferentially indicated as men who would subscribe. For instance, in answer to the appeal of the secretary of the Liberal party in the cam-paign, a letter would be sent saying, "" We are sending you £ 5 0 as a beginning, and if the work proceeds well you can send for more."" Men who could afford to give large sums of money were contributing to the fund in that area. Men who would not give 6d. out of their own purse to relieve the suffering were giving sums of £ 2 0 towards the funds of the Liberal party in that fight. Thousands of pounds were spent in the electorate, and where we spend pounds the other side spend hundreds. They had fifteen or sixteen organizers, who were paid from Monday morning to Sunday night. Some of them were engaged from month to month and year to year. Many were drawing from £ 4 . to £ 6 a week and expenses, and they were travelling all over the place. Will the to honourable member for Boothby tell me that he and others of his party are subscribing to pay these men out of their own pay as members of Parliament?",22
61,Mr GORDON,Unknown,"You r party are paying your organizers in South Australia 50 pec cent, more than we are paying ours.",22
62,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable menv ber is confusing two entirely different matters. He cannot compare industrial organizers with political organizers. The organizers of the Liberal party are purely political. They are not organizing men into unions to protect their own interests What a mockery it is for the honourable member for Flinders to say that he wants the people to fight in unitsand not in. combination! What a satireit is on his intelligence, and what a clearindication ,of his lack of appreciations of the marvellous change that has taken place in our economic conditions during the last ten years. He would allow the man outside to fight the great trusts as a unit.. Here is a statesman who wants to take usback to the conditions of fifty years ago, to do away with all unity, and let peoplefight their own battles on their own account, because, by so doing, says he, they will establish their manhood. When h e speaks like that, he is trying to deceive the people, or to deceive himself. He knows that today the combination of capital must be met by the combination of* labour, and he ought not to be so cruel', as to tell the toilers to meet their difficulties as units instead of entering into combinations to defeat combinations. The other side, in their little platform,.. admit that there are trusts and combines,, and agree that they should be treated in some way when they become injurious to the community. Let me quote what the honourable meinber for Parramatta thinkson the subjectTo control by law the operations of trusts and combinations acting detrimentally to theinterests of the public - Plan k 6 of Liberalplatform. The Liberals of every State were represented,, and the views of people living 3,000 miles apart had to be reconciled.",22
63,Mr RILEY,Unknown,What is the honourable member quoting from?,22
64,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Fro m the paper I am reading-fro m the man who said that he knew nothing about the ladies' meetings.,23
65,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member for Parramatta should be referred to as ""the honourable member.""",23
66,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parramatta professes not to know anything about what was done 3,000 miles away, yet he put it forward as one of the convincing factors that these were the views of people living-"" 3,000 miles apart, which had to be reconciled. Let us see how this fits in with the views of a man like the honourable memberLet us control the trusts, Let us make laws for them, Let us speak much of them upon balconies, Let us make mention of the evil of their ways; For in distrust of trusts is there hope, And we shall have favour of the people. Bring unto us a trust that we may see it, Lo, if there be any such we shall smite it with the jaw; For a trust is an abomination before the Lord, And in our detestation of it there shall be many votes. The people cried aloud. Bread was up, So was meat, So was rent, So were rags; (Also the prophecies of Wragge As a kite), And the people cried aloud and said : "" Who in the name of the profit hath caused all tilings to ascend ? Yea, who the blazes has caused the price of living to increase?"" And a still small voice made answer : ""Th c trusts."" And the men of Belial stood afar off and said with a loud voice, "" Aha ! Brinir ye us a trust that we may see it, Yea, bring us all the trusts that have a name : The Sugar Trust, The Salt Trust, The Beef Trust, The Bread Trust, The Tripe Trust, Yea, even the Beer Trust, that is wet as the dews upon a parched land; For we be Liberals of every State, And our views are the views of those who dwell 3,000 miles apart."" And one ran swiftly and brought a lookingglass, Ancl they that dwelt 3,000 miles apart looked therein and saw The Sugar Trust, The Salt Trust, The Beef Trust, The Bread Trust, The Tripe Trust, Yea, even the Beer Trust that is wet as the dew upon a parched land, And the men of Belial stood afar off and said with a loud voice, "" Aha !"" There we have a parody on the professions of the Liberal party in regard to their love of trusts. They do not believe that there are any trusts, but I have shown that they have seen them as in a looking-glass, and after that exposure I hope we will get no further desire for information from the honourable member for Parramatta. A most remarkable thing is that the Liberal party do not rely upon honourable members only to pull them through. What did the Leader of the Opposition say the other clay? When somebody mentioned the name of Willie Watt the honourable member said, "" He is too many for you. Wait until I get him into the ring, and you will have to clear all right."" Willie Watt is the hope of the Liberal party, the little political bantam who brought down the old Brahma rooster from his perch in another place, ancl has been crowing lately on every Liberal political dunghill as to what he is going to do, condemning the Labour party and denouncing us from head to heel. This bantam appears at all national hen convention meetings in the State, puts himself forward and struts about as though, because he has been made the Premier of a State in which a religious gentleman declared that there are third class politicians, he is the saviour of the Liberal party. Was there ever such a parody on statesmanship ? Apparently, the Liberals cannot manage with two leaders. Most parties can manage with one leader, but ths Liberals cannot manage with even two. They require the curb of the honourable member for Flinders, but not even he is sufficient, because they call upon Willie Watt to come ancl help them-the little political bantam who is strutting about all over the Commonwealth as though he were already cock of the walk. The least said about a party which has to resort to these extremes the soonest mended. Next we had a meeting at St. Kilda, and there we had a speech from the Honourable Agar Wynne, the gentleman who looks so mild and modest here. I hope that he will withdraw this passageThey should not attempt to hold up a town. Children should get milk, and mothers should get bread. That reference is to the Brisbane strike. It is about as cruel a thing as a man can say of a party-to assert that we were trying to prevent children from getting milk and mothers from obtaining bread. I THE CURSE OF MOSES. refer the honourable member to the speech of the honourable member for Brisbane. my judgment, when he speaks in this House, fie ought to withdraw those words, knowing what he does, or should know, concerning the exact position in that lamentable strike. This is the criticism of the men who oppose us. They make these statements not knowing if they are true; they take ex parte allegations, fail to verify them, and quote them as true. repeat these statements on the public platforms, not caring a jot what injury they do, how many minds they poison or how many germs they scatter to pollute the political atmosphere. My objection to these men is that they stoop to use foul tales of that kind to uphold a cause. God help a cause which has to depend on such support 1 Then we had a speech from Senator MCColl, the hero of the three-legged glue pot. He passed judgment on his fellows in this House, the man who fought for the three-legged glue pot, leg by leg, in this assembly. In fact, one would have thought that he had the fate of nations depending upon him when he fought for that pot here. The hero of the three-legged glue pot is now one of the candidates for the Senate on behalf of this beautiful variegated Fusion we see on the other side. This gentleman got on to a public platform tb criticise us. What did he say? did not say much-al l he said wasThe next election would be the turning point in Federation. The Liberal party had to this time. They had to get the wreckers out and and then Walks out again. put the Liberals in. They had three Liberal Bodies, and they could not do without each other.

They have three Liberal bodies inside, too. This is indeed a trinity, tliree in one, and one in three. The honorclava able members for Ballarat, Parramatta, Flinders are the leaders of the three bodies rolled into one representing the so-called Liberal or Fusion party. leagues outside are the People's party, the hen convention, and the great nationaldid ist league led by the honourable member for Ballarat. These three bodies have not yet come together. Senator MCColl Said that it is not time for them to In together, but when they do come together, they will announce a policy. Oh, no, it is not time yet to do that. The time t» announce a policy is the time when there is political turmoil, when nobody can understand it, or has time to dissect it . That is the time for the Liberals to move. Their, ways are, and always have been, dark and devious, and we do not expect They them to depart from their political principles or the shades of Opposition for many years to come. This senator saidThe Liberals must f all into line. The one thing the Labour party was after today was to stay where it was. If some of them got out of office, God knows where they would get to. Except for its embellishments, the speech contains practically nothing more than the prophecy that the Labour party is going out and the Liberals coming in. Then we have the honourable member for Laanecoorie, the infrequence of whose attendance here must be regarded apparently as a qualification for a seat in the Senate. He is very seldom present; indeed, I get a surprise whenever I see him, because he comes only to depart. He spend less time in this chamber than' any other member. No one is so infrequently here.",24

The honourable member for Laanecoorie said at the St. Kilda meetingThe Liberals had against them an insidious themselves. foe, prepared to endeavour to keep itself in office by any dodge and every petty trick. That is pretty strong language. not one who likes to dig the mire of the to past, but when a member uses language of that kind towards his opponents he must be prepared for what he gets. No man whom I have met in my public experience would lend himself to what the honourable member for Laanecoorie has lent himself. No man would do what he did in regard to the Postal CommisConstitution. sion. He hypocritically joined the Comthe mission, hoping to slay it ; and, when time came, sought to lay the axe to its neck. He measures others by his own bushel. I have neve: met a man who would stoop to the level to which he stooped in accepting a. position on the Postal Commission, intending, not to out his duties, but to prevent the Commisof sion from doing its work. Men in houses should not throw stones, and i there was a man living in a glass house it is the honourable member for Laanecoorie. Let him tell the postal officials why tried to k ill the Postal Commission. He said that the Commission would not come to anything, and is disaping pointed - that it was able to complete its investigations. He entered into u conspicial racy to k i ll the Commission before it got far on the road. Let him ""explain that conduct. When he has done so, will be time for the people to consider charge against the Labour party. not wish to cast opprobrium on any I only, criticise those who throw stones the Labour party. The Opposition has miserably failed, and is sorry that this amendment was moved. The debate has shown weakness of its case, and the strength of the Labour party. The newsand papers declare that to be so. counsel the Opposition to cease from wrangling and exposing its ignorance, was pointing out that it must do so if it wants to live; that if it does not cease to do so it must die, as all men must who corrupt their own nests. That is the reward of honourable members opposite moving the amendment. It is marvellous how the Evil One has led them into a trap, and handed them over to their enemies. I have no fear of the Opposition, of its money, or its trusts and combines, or its organizing capacity. It has no policy. Its members admit that I have no fear of any policy that may be propounded by the honourable member for Flinders. Is it his policy to I am reduce the wages of postal officials, abolish the old-age and invalid pension, to refuse the maternity bonus? The only policy honourable members opposite can construct is a negative one. If we are to take the honourable member for Flinders as a guide, the Liberal party ought, in all seriousness, to recommend the people of Australia never to alter the They ought to declare that old-age pension system is rotten to the the core, and should be abolished, and proclaim that, in their opinion, postal officials .are not entitled to common justice as are other - people, but should submit to great reductions in their salaries. They should further declare their belief in trusts, carry and in trusts dominating the politics the country; they should announce glass that, if returned to power, they will f ever repeal the land tax, thus removing the burden of taxation from the shoulders of the rich, and placing it on the he shoulders of the poor; that they will abolish the Commonwealth Bank and recall the Commonwealth note issue, restorthe old condition of affairs when bank notes were within the control of the finaninstitutions which, on many occasions, had have reduced the people to ruin-that they will restore the glorious principle of comi t petition amongst the private banks operathis ing with the savings of the people. Let I do the Liberal party be honest and tell the one; country, as the honourable member for at Flinders indicated, that they will, if possible, repeal all the legislation of the Labour Government. That is the position which should be assumed by honourable the members opposite, as shown by the utterances of the honourable member for Flinders, the actions of the general body of the They party. The honourable member for Flinders need not jeer or sneer at the prospect of the Labour party being in power for three years. I may tell the honourable member, if it is any consolation to caucus ! him., that, while we do what we believe to be right-whil e we uphold the rights of humanity and propound humanitarian laws-w e shall remain here, not for three to attend. years, but for three and twenty years.

But the work of the Government has, in many cases, palpresented examples of maladministration. Their extravagance has been so flagrant, and it is so clear to us that they have not realiztd the responsibility of the offices they hold, that I think it incumbent upon me to add something to the general denunciation. First I may say a little with regard to one of the most important dethat partments under the control of the Cominto monwealth-to my mind the most importhem tant-that of Defence.

When I was drawn off the track by him, I was referring to the Department of Defence, which is one of the most important branches of the Commonwealth service.

There is, at all events, a grave risk of the failure of the scheme because of the lack of administrative ability that is being displayed. It is with great regret that I make this statement. I have used every effort to make the scheme a success. I have never taken into consideration any auestion as. to what party was endeavouring to administer it. The defence of Australia is far too important a matter to allow any petty, paltry, party feeling to interfere with our duty as Australians, and I have done everything in He sub- my power to assist the movement.",28

I have appealed to them to cheerfully put up with any little inconvenience that might result from their lads having to attend drill, and I have exhorted, the lads themselves to do their duty. I find, however, that a great deal of insubordination prevails, and that there is much trouble throughout the country in connection with the scheme.

150,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"That is so. Honourable members, perhaps, do not realise the importance and gravity of the situation which would arise if the Hawkesbury Bridge were blown up. At present there, is absolutely nothing to protect it. Broken Bay is not mined, and there is no fortification there. If the Government would only exercise a little foresight it should be an easy matter to protect the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and the Hawkesbury Bridge. I have examined all the country in the neighbourhood, and I have examined Broken Bay by water and by land. I have ridden across from ""Gordonroad to Kuring-gai Chase, and from there across to West Head. An excellent military road could be made from Gordonroad to West Head, and a couple of guns might be placed at that spot as a protec-' tion to the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and the Hawkesbury Bridge. The matter might be arranged between the Federal and State Governments, but, unfortunately, there does not appear to be anything in common between them. _",30

153,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"It shows that the members opposite are really unable to grasp their responsibilities as a party when we hear one of them refer to a State Labour Government as a set of parochialists. It is a very grave matter to think that we have a city like Sydney, the greatest centre of population in Australia, left absolutely open to a foreign aggressor.",30
154,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We haye a more deadly enemy in the quarantine station close to Sydney.,30
155,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I shall refer to that presently, and I thank the honourable member for reminding me. Let us suppose that a foreign warship blows up the Hawkesbury Bridge, and at the same time there is an attack made in the vicinity of Newcastle. The result would be that a small handful of soldiers would be left alone in the north to meet the attack, whilst the greater proportion of our military, and, practically, all our arms and ammunition, would be on this side of the Hawkesbury River, and absolutely unable to reach the seat of trouble. A worse position even, than that might arise should the enemy adopt a ruse, very common in warfare, of making a demonstration at one spot and their real attack at another. The object, of such a ruse is to draw all the, opposing; forces to the spot at which it is not intended to make the attack in order that it may be made successfully at the placefrom which the forces have been drawn. An enemy might make a demonstration in the vicinity of Newcastle, and to meet thesupposed attack our troops might be immediately rushed across the Hawkesbury Bridgeto the seat of the trouble, whilst the real attack might not be upon the north coast, but upon Sydney, which would have been depleted of defending forces, who would be cut off altogether by the blowing up of the Hawkesbury Bridge.",30
156,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable memberis disclosing secrets to the enemy.,30
157,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"We must discuss these things. I undertake to say that theJapanese, for instance, know of all these defects, and know, perhaps, more about the north coast of New South Wales and.' the Australian coast generally than we do> ourselves. There is no need to fear that I am. giving anything away to them.",30
158,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Hav e we not a MilitaryBoard to advise us?,30
159,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,We have; but it is our duty on this side to criticise the Government,30
160,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Not the Military Board?,30
161,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The Military Board are not above criticism, nor am I afraid tocriticise them. Let me say that I feelfreer now to criticise the Military Board than I was last year. Last session I was; not, perhaps, in a fit position to criticise the Board, because I was on the active list, andhad command of a regiment. This year I am on the unattached list, and I feel that F am, therefore, freer to deal with these matters than I was previously. Going up theeastern coast we come to Thursday Island, where the position of affairs, from a defence point of view, is more than a joke ; it is arw absolute disgrace. I had never visited Thursday Island until recently, and then I had only a little over an hour or an hour and 1 a half to make an inspection of the fort and the different positions on that island. I say that the Government are seriously lacking in foresight when we consider the conditionof affairs at this strategical position. There is certainly a fort at Thursday Island, but. the guns mounted there are obsolete.",30
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They are pop-guns.,31
163,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"They are 6-inch breech-; loaders, but they are not Q.F. . I forget what the mark is, but they are absolutely out of date. They are short-range guns, and their velocity is not sufficient to pierce the armour-plate of a modern vessel. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And no ship need go within 15 miles of them.",31
164,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,That is so; but I point out that the ridiculous nature of the position at Thursday Island is that it is ostensibly fortified for the protection of our naval base in the north.,31
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A coaling station without any coal.,31
166,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"There is a coal hulk there sometimes. This coaling station and naval base is situated between Goode Island and Wie-wier Island, and is certainly dominated by the fort at Thursday Island. But there is absolutely nothing to prevent warships from landing a force at the back of Hammond Island or Friday Island-and there are excellent landing places there-fro m which points they would be able to command the position, dismantle the fort at Thursday Island, and blow out of the water any warship that happened to be at the naval base. Is nothing to be done at Thursday Island? Are we to be saddled with the expenditure of thousands of pounds annually in order that we may keep up a garrison of artillery there? station and naval base covers a very restricted area. It is coral bound.",31
167,Mr WEST,Unknown,No enemy would ever go near it.,31
168,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"But we cannot leave the North absolutely unprotected. nations know just as much about it as we do. I will undertake to say that the Japanese know the state of affairs which exists at Thursday Island. Leaving Goode Island and Friday Island, we pass Prince of Wales Island, Entrance Island, and Horn Island, and then come round to Simpson's Bay on the mainland. I say that that is the place where fortifications should be erected. There is an excellent spot for stores some 2 miles off on Possession Island, the historic place where Captain Cook landed and buried his log, which has never been recovered. I hope that something will be done in the direction which I have suggested. There is some talk of removing the existing fort from Thursday Island to Goode Island. But although that might constitute an improvement, it would not prove satisfactory or effective. One advantage of having a fort erected at Simpson's Bay would be that we should then have the main land at the back of it, and, consequently, there would be some chance of settlement extending there, whereas there is no hope of settlement at Thursday Island, which is practically a barren area. I recognise that the defence of the North is a very difficult problem indeed.",31
169,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A big white population is the best defence we can provide for it.,31
170,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"But the more difficult these problems are the more necessary it is that we should have men of capacity and courage at the helm of the ship of State. The present Government do not appear to be able to grapple with these problems which affect the national safety, and, consequently, the sooner they make room for men who can do so the better. The honourable member for Franklin very truly remarked, just now, that wrapped up, indissolubly with the defence of Australia, is the problem of peopling our great empty spaces. There is no doubt that that is the real solution of the problem which confronts us in the north. Some little time ago I saw a diagram which conveyed a very apt illustration of the relative populations of Australia and China. There was a white square of paper, and upon This coaling this were placed round, black dots, each of which represented a million people. The diagram representing China was dotted thickly all over-so thickly that the dots almost touched each other, whereas, in the portion representing Australia there was Foreign only one dot in this corner, another in that, another here, and still another there. One could not help being struck with the enormous difference between the population of this continent and that of its great eastern neighbour. Australia is practically uninhabited, and, consequently, I say that inextricably bound up with the question of defence is the problem of peopling our vast vacant spaces. What has the Labour party done towards peopling this country ? I recently had the pleasure of accepting an invitation by the Minister of External Affairs to visit the Northern Territory. I was very pleased, indeed, to be afforded an opportunity of learing something about the north of this great continent. I think it is absolutely necessary that honourable members should make themselves familiar withall portions of the Commonwealth which? 0 they are called upon to govern. I wish to say at once that the arrangements made in connection with that visit were absolutely wretched. I do not blame the Minister of External Affairs for that- I rather sympathize with him. I do not say that the fault was his, although he was very complaisant. Indeed he was affability itself. But he did not exert himself sufficiently in an endeavour to make our visit as profitable as it might have been. The defective arrangements were apparent from the very outset. When the party arrived at Brisbane I thought that some provision would have been made for its members to see something of that city and its surroundings, especially as the Minister had arrived there before us. I had never been to Brisbane in my life, nor had some other members of the party. We went to our Liberal rooms in that city and there we were left absolutely to our own devices. Not a soul came near us. The arrangements in connection with the who'e trip were wretched; and I am free to admit that I was very disappointed in seeing so little, and in what I did see. I cannot altogether blame the Minister, because many things combined to make the trip practically a failure from the point of view of our learning anything about the Northern Territory. For instance, Judge Mitchell had just left, and Professor Gilruth had only just arrived.",31
171,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,And the man in charge of the local arrangements was incompetent.,32
172,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am sorry to hear the honourable member for Corio reflect upon one who, in my opinion, was not to blame in the slightest degree. He refers to Mr Francis, against whom he had a private grievance.",32
173,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,I ask that that be withdrawn.,32
174,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"If I have said anything to offend the honourable member, I apologize; but the honourable member is labouring under a misapprehension when he says that Mr Francis was responsible for the arrangements which went wrong in our trip. Mr Francis was managing the railways in the Territory, and was responsible only for the train arrangements. I think the honourable member for Corio will admit that the whole reason why the trip was upset was the failure of private individuals to meet us with a boat on the Daly River. There was no fault in the train arrangements. The honourable member for Corio should know something about them, seeing that a special engine was sent from Darwin to Brock's Creek to bring back Senator MCDougall and himself, so that they might catch the steamer. They were brought back with all speed on the special, and arrived in plenty of time to catch the steamer, and then the honourable member refused to come on board. In a sense the trip was a picnic, and I enjoyed it very much. When we arrived at Darwin, we were met by a number of fine looking gentlemen, with red rosettes in their buttonholes, and a brawny Irishman playing the bagpipes, and we marched slowly up to the town. We visited places of interest in and around Darwin, and were tendered a smoke social, at which some of the members of the party spoke. I could not help taking exception to some of the speeches that were made, especially that of the honourable ""member for Riverina. He praised up the country in and around Darwin, its magnificent grasses and magnificent soil, and told them what lovely stacks of ensilage they could make out of the grasses. I could not stand it. I have been working on the land all my life, and I could not help rising to my feet, and tellin'g the people of Darwin, "" I have not come here to praise and flatter you. I do not care twopence what you think; you have no votes anyhow; and I want to tell you plainly that the country in and around Darwin will not feed a bandicoot."" Nor would it.",32
175,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from i to 2.15 p.m.,32
176,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Before the adjournment for lunch I was dealing with the question of the grasses and the soil in and around Port Darwin. I repeat, in spite of the views held by some members of the party, that it is the most wretched country imaginable, and that, metaphorically speaking, it would not feed a bandicoot. I can say the same thing of the whole of the country which we as a party saw, and that is the country from Darwin to the Katherine River. We went by railway from Darwin to Pine Creek; from Pine Creek we went in buggies and conveyances and oh horseback to the Katherine River; and from the Katherine River we returned by exactly the same route to Darwin. It reminded me of the story of the general who marched his men up the hill and then marched them down again. We practically saw nothing but a lot of the greatest o uubbish of country that ever came under my notice.",32
177,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,There is a bit of good country at the Katherine River.,33
178,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I cannot say that I saw any good country there. I believe that if we had gone.up or down the river we might have seen some good country, but we did not. We went only to the crossing of the river, turned straight round, and came back to Darwin.  down the Katherine River?",33
179,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"That is for those who arranged the trip to say. I was not one of those persons, and I was not in charge of the party. ",33
180,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"They did not go down the Katherine River. There were two members of the party who decided to take the risk of going from Brock's Creek to the Daly River, and perhaps of missing the boat. They left the party at Brock's Creek, went overland, and proceeded to the Daly River. I was not prepared to take the risk, as I could not afford to be away longer than the time specified in the itinerary of the trip. As a party we merely went out to the Katherine River and returned, seeing - nothing but a lot of very wretched country.",33
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Did you somewhere by sea?,33
182,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Yes , on the second part of the trip. The first part of the trip was in a sense pleasurable. We camped out sunder the stars and told stories, as men will when they are camped out together. _ It reminded me of being out on the African veldt. My honourable friend, the member for East Sydney, was one of those who afforded us very much enjoyment by telling entertaining stories, especially the one about "" How he got the pension."" not in a sense blame the Minister of External Affairs for what I term the failure' of the trip as far as its utility in giving honourable members an experience of that part of Australia is concerned. He was the soul of affability, and contributed greatly to our pleasure. member an incident which occurred on his birthday. He was very pleased to ask us to drink his health. We drank his health in bumpers of "" fiz,"" and it may be only fair to the honourable to say that the "" fiz"" was f r u it salts. We had nothing else. . If we wanted anything else we had to go to the doctor, who was provided with medical comforts. We really had to be ill before we could get anything stronger that f r u it salis on die trip. I do not want to tell tales about the Minister, but I think that I must relate the story of his visit to a school in Darwin. He desired to give the children in the school a very great treat, and so he proposed that the master should give them a half-holiday. He thought thai the not go proposal would be greeted with cheers from cue youngsters, but none of them said a word. Then he said, "" Hands up all those who wish to come back to school this afternoon,"" and all hands went up. I sup- „ pose that there was nothing else for them to do in Darwin, and that they preferred to return to school. The Minister thought that they were an exemplary lot of youngsters, and decided to try them in ' another direction. "" We l l , "" he said, "" you are all very good children; I am pleased to see that you are so intent upon pursuing your studies. Now how many of you have taken the pledge, or will take it? "" Not a single hand went up in the whole school. The second part of the trip ended in abso- lute failure. In all seriousness it might have ended very disastrously for the whole party. I am quite satisfied of the risk we ran from what I have heard since my return. We started from Darwin in three not go little craft- a tug, called the Maggie, a lugger, and a launch, called The Don. Honourable members will realise that these were not very large craft when I mention that it took the three to carry a party of twenty odd. We started out to find the mouth of the Daly River. It is almost incredible to think that we were allowed to leaye with not a soul on board possessing a certificate of any description, not even a master-mariner's or engineer's certificate. Luckily the weather was excepI do tionally fine, and there was no serious result, though matters might easily have been worse. During the night we were on the ocean. We were out of sight of land when the incident took place, which we jokingly called the cutting of the rope. It parted, leaving the small launch, in which I re- I was-The Don-adrif t on the open sea. I have ridden some bucking, horses, but I never wish to be at sea again on anything as rough as The Don. I have been twitted with having used strong language regarding, gentleman her performance.

184,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"No . At daylight in morning, when we were supposed to the mouth of the Daly River, we were within 60 or 70 miles of it, and the who was in charge of the launch- Mr Stretton, the harbour-master, a good chap-ha d not even been away fro Darwin in his life.

208,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Where have they been shut out?,36
209,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The honourable member knows that he does not approve of these men being brought here.,36
210,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I know nothing of the kind.,36
211,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The party to which the honourable member belongs knows that it does not approve of their coming.,36
212,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,That is not correct of the party either; it is a slander on the party !,36
213,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Accordin g to honourable members opposite, the labour market of Australia must be kept as a close borough for the trade unionists already here. They desire a monopoly of work in order that they may be able to force their employers to pay them, any exorbitant wages they may ask. That is the sole reason for their opposition to immigration. They desire that trade unionism may be absolutely "" o n top,"" in order that employers, in the face of a scarcity of labour, may be compelled to pay any wages that are asked. In regard to both defence and immigration the Government have absolutely failed to recognise their responsibilities. matters of defence they are not doing what they should to encourage efficiency. For instance, in reference to defence pensions there was a meeting in Sydney between several' honourable members and members of the Military Forces. All the members of the party opposite who attended that deputation, with the exception of one, assured these military men that they were in favour of granting them pensions.",36
214,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Who says so?,36
215,Mr WEST,Unknown,That is a deliberate falsehood.,36
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for East Sydney must withdraw that remark.,36
217,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I regret that I made a statement that I should not have made, but I was aggravated by the observation made by the honourable member for North Sydney, and could not resist the temptation. apologize.",36
218,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am informed that the Labour members on this deputation, with one exception-namely , the honourable member for Robertson, who was honest enough to say straight out that he did not approve of pensions-le d the military men to believe that they were in sympathy with their desire.",36
219,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is not correct. It is like the other statements of the honourable member.,36
220,Mr WEST,Unknown,As k the honourable member for Illawarra; he was there.,36
221,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I am afraid that the honourable member's statement is not correct. I was present at the deputation.,36
222,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I withdraw what I have said if I was mistaken. Am I to take it , then, that the majority of honourable members opposite are opposed to this pensions scheme ?",36
223,Mr CARR,Unknown,I was the only one who agreed to it that day.,36
224,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Macquarie left before the proceedings were over, saying that he agreed with the objects of the deputation; but none of the other honourable members there expressed them- > selves as the honourable member for North Sydney has described.",36
225,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"If they were against the proposal, it would have been straightforward to tell these men that they did not approve of it. The impression left in their minds was that every member on that deputation was with them, except the honourable memI n minor ber for Robertson. They told me so. It would have been candid to have said to the men, "" We will not support a pensions scheme."" Am I to take it that honourable members opposite are opposed to any penopposite sions scheme?",36
226,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,They have not committed themselves at all.,36
227,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Honourable members have been very diplomatic in allowing the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to get up nearly every session and submit a private member's motion in favour of the payment of pensions. But they have not brought forward a scheme backed by the support of their party. If they are in favour of a pensions scheme, why not bring one down?",36
228,Mr WEST,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member bring one down?,36
229,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"After the next general election our party will bring down many I schemes. ' If ""the Caucus chose to instruct the Minister of Defence to bring down a pensions scheme, that would be sufficient. But why put up the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to propose one? I do not say that he is not honest about the ter, but he speaks, merely as a private ber. In his innocence and simplicity he does not see that his party are putting him up as a stalking horse, knowing that the proposal will never reach finality. We shall never have an efficient military force until we give encouragement to the members of the permanent corps. If we wish men to remain in the Army we must offer them inducements. The greatest creating efficiency in the Military Forces is long service. To-day we offer no inducements to non-commissioned officers to remain, and, consequently, we are losing efficiency.",36
230,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Many members of this party are in favour of pensions.,37
231,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Why , then, do not honourable members induce the Government to bring in a scheme?",37
232,Mr CARR,Unknown,We are not the Government.,37
233,Mr WEST,Unknown,The Opposition party have been growling at our expenditure already.,37
234,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Some of us are in favour of an amending Tariff.,37
235,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The Government does even carry out as Parliament intended Tariff that is already the law of the land. It will be remembered that we had battle regarding dextrine. We defeated the Government, and dextrine was placed on the free list. Since then, however, regulations have been issued under which dextrine is charged duty. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that.",37
236,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We are manufacturing good stuff in the country.,37
237,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"But why go behind an Act of Parliament? Parliament declared that dextrine should be free, but the vernment have sneaked in a duty under cover of the regulations.",37
238,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This is the first that I have heard of it.,37
239,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"To come back to the matter of defence; there are many little pinpricks which make officers and men satisfied. Take the regulation affecting the moving of officers from one place to tale. another. There is a most ridiculous regulation which lays it down that an officer shall receive a certain amount to cover cost of moving. Whether he moves 10 miles or 500, the amount received is same. That is absolutely absurd. Another hardship entailed on many officers this: In Sydney, a military officer gets quarters at the barracks, for which a tain is charged £ 3 2 per annum. mat- very good quarters, too, affording any mem- amount of room. But in Melbourne, an officer of the same rank, doing the same duty, and drawing the same pay, gets no quarters, because, I believe, none are available at the barracks. But he has to pay out of his own salary for a house which will cost him at least a year. I say that an officer stationed in Melbourne should be allowed the difference between the £ 3 2 factor in and the £ 8 0 .",37
240,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that an officer in Melbourne can live in a house costing less than £ 8 0 a year?,37
241,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I do not think that an officer of the rank of captain will be able to find a house in Melbourne within reasonable distance of the barracks costing less than £ 8 0 a year.,37
242,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The Minister of Home Affairs is living in a house at a rent of 17s. 6d. a week.,37
243,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Bu the is . wonderful. We do not expect an ordinary man to do not the same as he does. I wish to know the what the Government are doing in regard to the Liverpool manoeuvre area, and also a great the horse-breeding station? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are going to fix up the Liverpool matter immediately.",37
244,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The Minister of Home Affairs seems to be the only man in the Government who can fix up things.,37
245,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I wish to say that no one has entered any such stuff as dextrine upon which duty has been charged.,37
246,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I can only reply that I have a letter from a Sydney firm, Messrs. GoSalkeld and Wallace, who say that, although dextrine is upon the free list",37
247,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And is free today.,37
248,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"They tell m that the e dextrine which they import, because they import it in paste form, and because it is dissaid that there is some borax in it",37
249,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This is quite a different,37
250,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The statement that because this dextrine came in as a paste it the had to pay duty is a mere subterfuge on the part of honourable members opposite to the get behind the back of Parliament.,37
251,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Dextrin e is free, and any is person who has paid duty on it can obtain a refund. If , however, dextrine is capbrought in as borax, then duty must be They are paid upon it as borax.",37
252,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I dislike repetition, and since members of my party have dealt fully with the main questions involved in the amendment there is little for me to add. I should like, however, to make some reference to the Brisbane strike. In the first place, I object to honourable members, on either side of the House, making out that the unionists are heroes. I object to the laudation of these genial unionists. They are no better than other men. I have had to do with unionists all my life, and I recognise that there are good and bad among all sections of the community. While some unionists are good men, others are the greatest scoundrels and ruffians that ever walked. There are any number of such men in the unions. What is the good of all this slobbering over unionists that has been indulged in ? So far as they are concerned I share the view expressed by the honourable member for Brisbane, who, in the course of his speech last week, said that there were some very undesirable characters among the unionists. He agrees with me.",38
253,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,No ; I emphatically dissent. I said nothing of the kind.,38
254,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Will the honourable member deny that in the course of his speech in this House last week he made use of these wordsWhile we had fliem in processions we could control them, but there was danger from having zo,ooo men idle under those circumstances. of them were not particularly choice characters. Is that right?",38
255,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It is.,38
256,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The honourable member went on to sayThey were true men and good unionists, but many of them were men accustomed, in their ordinary avocations, to a bit of rough tumble. The honourable member said that they "" were not particularly choice characters.""",38
257,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I did j but that is not what the honourable member has said of them.,38
258,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"What other construction could be placed upon those words than that which I have given them. I do not think any stronger accusation could brought against a man than that he is by not "" a particularly choice character."" is idle for the honourable member to bandy words about this matter. Let any one either side of the House say of an honorstrong able member that he is not '' a particularly choice character"" and see what would happen. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that in the unions there are some of the greatest ruffians to be found anywhere. The honourable member dealt with the Brisbane strike from Alpha to Omega, from Genesis to Revelations, and concluded with the Lord's Prayer. I nearly always find that gentlemen who indulge in this preaching business- I do not wish to use the word "" ranters "" ",38
259,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I shall not even say "" wowsers "" ; but I nearly always find that these gentlemen who indulge in the preaching business have a happy knack- I shall not say of perverting the truth",38
260,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Of speaking the truth.,38
261,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Of handling the truth very awkwardly. The honourable member came along with a cock-and-bull story about a lady who had written to him saying that she could prove that the notorious shot fired during the Brisbane strike was fired, by an inspector of police.",38
262,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Does the honourable member know that it really was not a shot but the bursting of a paper bag that caused the report that was heard?,38
263,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Her e is yet another tale. The honourable member for Brisbane has also told us some silly little tales that he might have told school children about talSome low candles and "" hard soft-soap "" being thrown on the tramway lines, and being mistaken for dynamite. Such stories might go down with some people, but I do not think that intelligent members of this House would take them very seriously. I think they will believe the evidence given by the Government Analyst to the effect and that the stuff found on the tramway line and examined by him was dynamite.",38
264,Mr WEST,Unknown,The parcels were picked up twelve days before the strike.,38
265,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"And some of them were found on the tramway lines after the strike. These little stories are quite beside the mark. What would the honourable member for Brisbane say if I told him that I had received a letter from a lady stating that she be could prove that the shot was fired, not an inspector of police, but by one of the It strikers? He could say what he pleased, and I could back my lady against his. on Thank God, however, that we had some men in Brisbane on the occasion of the strike-that we had there men like Mr Denham and Major Cahill, the head of the police force, who were determined that the '.small gang-this small minority of - workers, these unionists-shoul d not be - allowed to take possession of the city; that unionists. they should not throw the city into idleness - and let people starve for want of bread, or - children in the hospitals go without milk.

275,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Paltry ?,39
276,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Yes . I can quote for the honourable member the words used by a the honourable member for Hindmarsh on his own side, who characterized it as "" a I suppose the honourable member is one of the fiercest Socialists on the other side. He looks as fierce as it is possible for a man to look, and he characterized the .trouble at BrisAt the time this trouble was going on in Brisbane, did we find the Prime Minister and members of the Federal Government got acting up to their ideals as Socialists? There are a number of good Socialists on the other side who advocate the division of all the great wealth we hear so much VVe have the Prime Minister, the lay Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, 'and the"" honourable member for Maranoa amongst them, and I should like to be about when their possessions are being divided up. Where was the Prime when all this trouble was going on in Brisbane, when little children were being practically starved for want of food and milk, when, as the honourable member for Brisbane has said, the city was on the The right honour the able gentleman, with other Ministers, was besitting in the front of the grand-stand at not the Melbourne Cricket Ground watching I the Englishmen playing cricket, leaning and laughing to their hearts' content, in when the people of Brisbane were in the These are the good Socialists who are so much concerned were about the interests of the poor man. Even the Bulletin, which is almost the Bible of at honourable members opposite, turned upon them and published a cartoon on this very subject. What did they do to alleviate the sufferings caused in Brisbane by this attempt on the part of a small minority of workers to take possession of the city, to unto themselves the powers of go to overthrow the civil authority, and run the place on their own ? Much sufwas caused by the Brisbane strike to a great many people who took no part in it, but instead of the Prime Minister and his being there during the trouble alleviate the suffering, and stop the strike, they sat in a grand-stand at Melbourne and watched a game of cricket. The less said about the Brisbane strike the better for honourable members opposite. We know what they are after. They wish to get hold of some cry with which they can go to the country. They feel that their power is slipping away from them. They are like a man who gets hold of the moon with his hands greased. The power to create fat billets for themselves and their friends is going from them. The writing is on the wall, and they know that at the next elections the verdict of the people will be that they have been tried in the balance and found wanting. They are like a drowning man grabbing at every straw they can see. They hope to discover some battlecry with which they can go to the country. They want blood. They want to be able to go to the country and say that honourable members on this side desired to see the streets of Brisbane running rivers of blood. They will do it, too. They will get on hundreds of platforms, and say that we, on this side, were determined to send soldiers to Brisbane to shoot down the unfortunate strikers, though they know in their hearts that it is false. They know that no man on this side would send soldiers to shoot any citizen. They know that we would do, as the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and almost every other man who has spoken on the other side have admitted they would do. They have said that if things went to the last extremity, and they found it absolutely necessary to prevent bloodshed, they would do their duty, and see that law and order were preserved. That is all that I , or any other honourable member on this side, would do. But no; honourable members opposite want some election cry.",39
277,Mr WEST,Unknown,Would the honourable member have sent the military?,40
278,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The honourable member should cease asking that question. He, no doubt, considers that he is very smart, but I defy any' honourable member opposite to deny my statement when I say that, as a matter of fact, there was no request made for the military. The request was to know whether the Prime Minister, if things came to the worse, and the situation became most grave, would be behind the authorities in Brisbane, and would preserve law and order. But the right honourable gentleman would not give them an answer, and, in refusing to do so, I think he seriously neglected to do his duty.",40
279,Mr FENTON,Unknown,If honourable members opposite' vote for the censure motion what are we to say?,40
280,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"B y voting for the motion we shall say that the Prime Minister did not realise the responsibilities of his high office in giving an absolute refusal to the request of the Governor of Queensland before he knew anything about the circumstances. We shall say that he neglected his duty in failing to give an assurance to the authorities in Brisbane, that he, as the Prime Minister, was behind them, and would see that law and order were preserved. That is the assurance that was wanted from him.  able member is on the retired list.",40

282,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order' ! I again appeal to honourable members not to continue their interjections.,40
283,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself to say such a thing to me. ,40
284,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The honourable member is old enough to know better. If he were not so old I should take some other steps. I say that it is a disgraceful thing for the honourable member to say to me.,40
285,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did not catch what the honourable member for Grey said across the chamber, but if it was anything offensive I am sure the honourable member will withdraw it. In any case, it is not in order for the honourable member for North Sydney to continue in ihe way he is now speaking.",40
286,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Then I find that unionists, who are such noble heroes, are to be granted a preference in the matter of employment over every other man in the community, and even in the Public Service of the country. The Postmaster-General is going to provide billets for the men who were displaced as the. result of their own action in connection with the Brisbane strike. I find, too, that the Minister of Home Affairs has issued instructions that preference must be given to unionists, and if dismissals are necessary, the non-unionist must go first. I presume that other Ministers are adopting the same course. This Cr overnor-General's Speech: means that no man in Australia will be able to work in our Public Service unless he holds a union ticket. If the general public choose to endorse that sort of conduct, well and good. But I think that honourable members opposite will get their answer at the next general election.",40
287,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The electors knew all about it at Werriwa.,41
288,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"And the Labour candidate polled 1,500 votes less than he did at the previous election.",41
289,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If honourable members persist in carrying on a continual conversation across the chamber, I will take action to prevent it.",41
290,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I have merely to add that I blame the Prime Minister very much for not having taken some steps,41
291,Mr FENTON,Unknown,What steps?,41
292,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"He might have endeavoured to relieve the tension which existed, instead of spending his time at a cricket match. There is one other matter in which I think that he might have taken up a firm stand, but in respect of which he has remained absolutely dumb in public. I do not know what he may have done by way of correspondence, but in public he has remained absolutely silent. I refer to the action of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Holman-rebe l Holman - in taking away the residence of the Governor General in Sydney. The Prime Minister should have made some public protest against his action.",41
293,Mr WEST,Unknown,He is endeavouring to settle the matter now.,41
294,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Why does he not bring this man Holman to book?,41
295,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,It is time that the expenditure upon Vice-Regal residences was reduced. One establishment ought to be sufficient.,41
296,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"If the Prime Minister will not see that the King's representative has a residence in the chief city of the Commonwealth, to whom shall we look? If he will not bring to book those who are casting this indignity on the Governor General, he is lacking in his duty. He cannot afford to play fast and loose in.a matter of this sort, because there is a suspicion in the minds of the great body of the people of Australia that lie does not ring true on the question of loyalty. prepared to accept, and I did accept, his denial of the accuracy of the report of the interview which he had with Mr Stead. But he cannot afford [5 JULY, 1912.] to trifle with this matter. By so doing he is giving rise to the old suspicion. We do not want men here who are suspected of disloyalty. Upon the other side of the chamber there are honourable members who have shown themselves absolutely disloyal. I will give one instance- I am sorry the honourable member is not here1 refer to the honourable member for Dalley. He has shown that he is not a loyal subject of the King, and I will prove my statement.",41
297,Mr RILEY,Unknown,It does not matter.,41
298,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I suppose that many honourable members opposite think it does not matter whether they have a rebel upon their side or not- a man who will not stand,41
299,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I would point out that the language which the honourable member is using is far beyond that which he ought to use. I must ask him to withdraw the statements which he has made.,41
300,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I withdraw any language which I have used that is not parliamentary, and I withdraw the expression ""rebel."" But I have proof of the disloyalty of the honourable member for Dalley, because, on two occasions. I saw him deliberately refuse to rise when "" God Save the King "" was being played at little functions, notwithstanding that everybody else rose. Yet the moment that "" Auld Lang Syne"" was struck up he jumped to his feet. These are facts, ancl I was very sorrv to see a representative of the people in this National Parliament behave m that way. ,",41
301,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I do not think that the mention of this matter here does the honourable member any credit.,41
302,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Where else should it be mentioned? This Parliament is charged with moulding the destinies of Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that the action of the honourable member for Dalley is a disgrace to his constituents who sent him here.",41
303,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I would point out to the honourable member that he is imputing dishonourable motives to another honourable member which he has no right to do. I must ask him to discontinue the trend of. his remarks.,41
304,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The honourable member for Hunter takes exception to my mentionI was ing the matter here.,41
305,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I merely say that it does the honourable member no credit.,41
306,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"It does me every credit to bring the matter before' the people, ancl let the honourable member's constituents know that he refuses to get upon his feet when the National Anthem is played or sung, or when the toast of the King is honoured.",41
307,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It is a personal matter.,42
308,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"It is not so at all. When a public man at public functions refuses to honour the toast of the King, I , as a representative of the people, have every right to mention it in the House. Why did the honourable member .take the oath of allegiance to the King?",42
309,Mr CANN,Unknown,That does not compel him to sing every time you want him to.,42
310,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I do not want the honourable member to sing; he could not sing, and I should not like to hear him if he tried. There is another very important matter with which I should like to .deal. It vitally affects the health of the people, of which I think I can show that the present Government have been absolutely neglectful. In fact, in their proceedings under the Quarantine Act, they have deliberately endangered the health of the people. They have practically put Sydney on the brink of a volcano. The Minister of Customs has promised to make an explanation, but I think it will take him all his time to explain away the facts. It is some time since quarantine was taken.over by the Federal Parliament, and the members of the present Government have had two years to put the matter in order. I understood from the Minister of Trade and Customs the other day that they had not taken over the quarantine station at Magnetic Island, near Townsville, from the State of Queensland.",42
311,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I did not say that.,42
312,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Then I understand that the Government have taken over the quaranWales tine station at Magnetic Island. I underin stood that when it was taken over it was costing £2,780 in upkeep. When Quarantine Bill was before Parliament on the :16th July, 1907, the honourable member for Hume said the estimated value of land and buildings of the quarantine stations in New South Wales was £123,000, and in Victoria £63,000, and* that in Queensl and he understood it was £66,000. member is mistaken. I. take it that the Queensland figures cluded the station at Magnetic Island.",42
313,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They also included Thursday Island and Peel Island, but the Queensland Government took away Peel only a sub-station. Island before they agreed at the Premiers' Conference, with the honourable member for Kooyong, what places tliey would handt over to the Commonwealth.",42
314,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The Constitution providesThe Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, givtr preference to one State or any part thereof, and I hold that preference has been given to the State of Queensland, to the disada vantage of New South Wales, in this matter. About the beginning of October last the steamship Eastern came to the north of Australia from the East. When in the vicinity of Thursday Island a coloured passenger died of what the doctors said was small-pox. Application was made for the other Malay or Kanaka passengers to be landed on Friday Island, near Thursday Island, and kept in quarantine there. Th»r PearWfishers Association guaranteed to supply accommodation and food, and keep the men there, but the Federal Government declined to allow this to be done, and the Minister of Customs gave instructions that the vessel should proceed to Sydney, the most populous centre in the whole of Australia. Those people who were supposed to be infected with the germs of small-pox were brought 2,000 miles along the coast, past the quarantine station at Magnetic Island, and deposited near Sydney. That constituted a very grave menace to the health, not only of Sydney, but of the whole Commonwealth. Do honourable members realise what - an outbreak of small-pox in Sydney would mean? It would be a calamity. There would be a panic. People would fly in all directions, and the dread disease would be spread throughout the length and breadth of this fair land. Any Government who will take such risks, and act so unfairly to the State of New South as the present Government have done this matter, are very seriously to blame. If the station at Magnetic Island is not the capable of accommodating people from a steamer, there is something wrong, because, according to the honourable member for the Hume, when it was taken over it and the station at Thursday Island were worth",42
315,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think the honourable The main station inwas at Peel Island, near Brisbane, and that was taken away by the Queensland Government before the transfer to - the Commonwealth took place. Magnetic Island was",42
316,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I accept the word of the Minister. I will content myself with saying that no matter what the arrangements were, if there is no provision for quarantining a ship north of Sydney, the Government are very seriously to blame. It is the vessels coming along our northern coast from"" the Eastern world which are most liable to carry this disease to Australia, and if there is no provision for quarantining a vessel north of Sydney, it is culpable negligence, if not worse, on the part of the authorities. They display absolute indifference to the health, I might say at once to the lives, of the people of Australia. In support of my statement that the giving of preference is contrary to the Constitution, I may perhaps be permitted to quote from the commentary of Quick and Garran on this sectionThe object of this prohibition is to prevent Federal favouritism and partiality' in commercial and other kindred regulations. A preference is a discrimination considered in relation to the person or State in whose favour such discrimination is. In the case of preference by the States, there is merely a power given to the Parliament to forbid such preferences as are undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; in the case of the Commonwealth, every prefeience whatever is forbidden by the Constitution itself, irrespective of injustice or unreasonableness. If a difference of treatment is arbitrary, or if its purpose is to advantage or prejudice a locality, it is undue and unreasonable, and is accordingly a preference. The intent and the effect must both be looked to, in order to decide whether a preference exists; and in neither inquiry can reasonableness be ignored. I repeat that preference was given to the State of Queensland. I think that the Federal Government should take immediate steps to have the Sydney quarantine station removed from the populous centre in which it is located. It is adjacent to one of the greatest pleasure resorts in Australia: it is divided from Manly by a 7-ft. fence. Any suspect-that is any person who is quarantined-can , without difficulty, if he can evade the vigilance of those who are supposed to keep watch, and I do not think the vigilance is very great, leap or climb over the fence and mingle with the people in a populous centre. It is a grave menace to the people of Australia that this state of things should exist. Remembering that not more than i per cent, of the people in Sydney or New South Wales are vaccinated, what would an outbreak of smallpox mean there? Moreover there is not lymph enough in Sydney to vaccinate a fourth of its people.",42
317,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Why did you not bring this matter up in the State Parliament? [21],43
318,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,We had to deal with our own affairs.,43
319,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Vaccinatio n is a State matter.,43
320,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,l t is not compulsory in New South Wales.,43
321,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,But it is a State matter as to whether it should be compulsory or not.,43
322,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"Quite so. I am no* blaming the Federal authorities because these people are not vaccinated. I am only quoting the fact to show the seriousness of the position should there be an outbreak there of small-pox. We know, of course, that the Federal authorities are not responsible for the people of Sydney not being vaccinated. The position is serious, and I hope that the Minister will take into consideration the question of removing the quarantine station. It is an urgent matter, and one which will not brook of much delay. Unless the station be removed there may be very serious consequences at any moment. We may again have a shipload of people brought 2,000 miles along our coast and dumped down at this station where there are no conveniences.",43
323,Mr WEST,Unknown,It is the best-built quarantine station in Australia.,43
324,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I would advise my honourable friend to consult the honourable member for Melbourne.,43
325,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He is wrong. The Victorian station is the best equipped one, because the State did not starve it .",43
326,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am informed that the second-class passengers on the Yawata Maru, on which there were several members' of this Parliament, never had a bath for nine days ; that it was impossible for them to have a bath at the station. Imagine people who have been in close contact on board ships in the crowded second-class and steerage quarters being congregated together on shore, and not being able to have a bath for nine days. I would not care to have very much to do with them. It is not a desirable stafe of affairs.",43
327,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"You r statement does not happen to be correct; but that does not matter, perhaps.",43
328,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I am quite open to correction.,43
329,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for Lang will not endorse that statement Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member for Melbourne knows more about the matter.,43
330,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am credibly informed that it was possible for these persons to have a cold bath, but that as they had all been vaccinated, and, of course, had a temperature, they were forbidden by the doctors to have a cold bath. There was only a hot bath available about a quarter of a mile away, but the second-class and steerage passengers were not allowed to go there. If they were forbidden to have a cold bath, and could not get a hot bath, I think I was nearly right in stating that they were unable to have a bath for nine days.",44
331,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Arrangement s were made last year to put in twenty hot baths. There were no baths at the station while it was under the State.,44
332,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I read something in the press about a wire from the honourable member for Melbourne to the' Minister asking about these baths, and I think he took some exception to the "" rubber-stamp "" reply sent by the Minister. He said that he did not want any more of the Minister's nonsense or something of that sort.",44
333,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He has not said that here. He offered to send back a denial of the press report, but I told him that I took no notice of press reports.",44
334,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am informed that the methods employed at this quarantine station for fumigating clothes, and so on, are most crude, that even the English doctor who visited the patients did not carry out his duties in a manner calculated to prevent the spread of this disease. I am given to understand, and I am ashamed to have to think that it is true, that the Japanese doctor who attended the patients at the station, adopted very much better methods than did our doctor; he was absolutely up to date.",44
335,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Whic h doctor do you plain about?,44
336,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I complain about the European doctor. I do not know his name.,44
337,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,You might just as well tion. give the name. . Mr RYRIE - But I do not know name.,44
338,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"You charge a man who is not here to defend himself with practically being the means of conveying disease, and you have a right to give his name. This is a cowardly way to complain about a ma» who cannot defend himself here.",44
339,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,44
340,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am not charging the doctor at all, nor do I know his name. He may be an excellent doctor. I am blaming the Government. It should have framed regulations which would have made it possible for the doctor to attend to these patients without risk. The methods adopted by the Japanese doctor were very much better. The following note from the honourable member fpr New England has just been handed to meMCDougall requests me to tell you that he did not receive any money from the A . W . U. during his campaign or in aid of it . I accept that assurance from Senator MCDougall, and unreservedly withdraw my statement on the subject. In conclusion, I have a word to say regarding the partisan appointments of the Government. Ministers have been guilty of appointing friends and supporters to many fat billets. One appointment to which I take exception is that of Mr Ryland to the position of Administrator of Lands in the Northern Territory. I understand that his age is fifty-eight. If that be so, he is too old to be sent to that climate to fill a position whose duties will be arduous, because the land laws cannot be successfully administered . unless the Administrator travels throughout the country and makes himself acquainted with it. I do not know why he was appointed, unless it was to reward a supporter and defeated candidate. The policy of the Labour party is the same in both the Federal and the State sphere. Mr. Treflis, the Secretary for Agriculture in New South Wales, has had .his brother appointed to the Land Board at Temora, while his partner has been made coroner there.",44
341,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The Minister has explained that neither he nor the Government had anything to do with these appointments. comHis brother's position is honorary.,44
342,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The members of the Land Boards receive good emoluments, and a coroner does not occupy an honorary posi the how is this Government to blame?",44
343,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I am showing that the Labour party everywhere is giving good fat billets to supporters. How many members of this House have applied for positions as the honourable member for New England applied for the position of Administrator of the Northern Territory ? I wonder what his constituents will think of him when they know that if he could have got a nice fat billet he would have been glad to skip away and leave them? The Labour party, in addition to making partisan appointments, has been guilty of gross extravagance and maladministration. It has abused the trust placed in it by the people in response to its oft-repeated request to give it a chance. Honourable members opposite have been tried and found wanting. The only conclusion to which'the people can come is that they' are unworthy of the trust which has been reposed in them, and should no longer hold the reins of power. I am prepared to leave them to the people. You can fool some of the people all the time, all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. - Mr OZANNE (Corio) [3.52] - I listened to the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney with pain, and am sure that, in his calmer moments, he will regret many of his statements, particularly his cruel reference to the unionists of Brisbane. We heard a great deal about his loyalty. He may express lip-loyalty; but Australians desire to show their loyalty in a practical manner by making themselves a nation powerful enough to assist the Old Country when she.requires support. I am second to none in my loyalty, but the honourable member's denunciation of men who have fought to build up the. nation was in keeping with the action of the Opposition in moving this amendment of want of confidence. . When the honourable member was speaking of the trip to the Northern Territory, I interjected that the man responsible for the inconvenience which we suffered was Mr Francis, and I repeat the statement. When we took the trip to the Katherine River, even the donkeys in our party knew that we should be back on the Monday night. Yet this gentleman, who was in charge of the party, wired to Pine Creek to say, "" Party returning Tuesday night,"" and had not Senator Blakey and myself been riding two or three hours ahead of the main body, it would probably not have got any tea. On another occasion, when we were going round the harbour of Port Darwin, and had arranged to be on the jetty at 10 in the morning, Mr Francis did not put in an appearance until half-past eleven. [21]- 2 The result was that the trip had to re abandoned. Then, again, when we reached Brock's Creek, we were told that it would be impossible to go to Daly Kiver-that we should have to wade waist high,. with grass over our heads, and so forth-and honourable members who could not afford the time decided not to go. Senator MCDougall and myself made the trip, and we found that the statements made by Mr, Francis were absolutely incorrect. The other members of the party went around by sea, and were supposed to meet US there; but, although we waited at the place appointed, they did not appearThat is the reason why the special train was sent, and not for our personal convenience. When the honourable member stated that he and others had seen practically nothing, I refused to travel all th* way to the Northern Territory in order to ride in a train or on a horse; I wished to see the country, realizing that we shall be called upon to authorize the expenditure of millions of pounds on its development. I agree with the honourable member that around Port Darwin and the Katherine River there is very little prospect' of H return from any expenditure. But'I shall discussthese matters when the opportunity presents itself later on. There is no doubt as to the inadequacy of the defence provided at Thursday Island; and two years agp, when I visited there, I pointed out - the fact. The garrison at the fort, in order to prevent hostile vessels from going down the passage, would, under present, arrangements, have to fire over hills. With the armaments of the present day, ships could stand well out at sea and do much damage, or they could land forces behind any one of the mountains, and do exactly what ..the Japanese did at Port Arthur, which was supposed to be impregnable. At the same time, there is another channel between Prince of Wales Island and the mainland ' through which hostile vessels could go - without any possibility of harm from the forts. If we establish a fort at Simpson^' Bay, the populace will be behind, it, and there will be no fear of the garrison b^ing cut off from communication or provisions. At this hour I ask leave to continue my speech on Tuesday. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 4 p.m.",44
