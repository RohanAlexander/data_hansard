2,Mr FOWLER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the report in today's newspapers of a prosecution directed against an official of the Navy Office, which of information. makes it appear that documents of tremendous and vital importance, to Australia, hut to the whole Empire, are as accessible to subordinate officials as a lot of old newspapers might bet Will the honourable gentleman see Uiat the individuals responsible for this state of affairs are prosecuted, as well aa the man who has taken advantage of it i",20
3,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"I have not had time to read closely the report in today's newspapers, hut I am acquainted with the main circumstances of the case, and, without prejudice to the trial, which I think is still proceeding, I may say that the Government regards the matter very seriously indeed, and will take the proper steps to prevent a' repetition of this un: fortunate occurrence. SHIPBUILDING.",20
4,Mr CORSER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"I wish to know from the Minister acting for the Minister for the Navy how many tenders have been accepted and contraots made for the building of ships since the honourable member's last announcement on the subject, with whom they have heen made, and how many ships have been allotted to each firm?  .been made,' eaoh for the construction of four ships, one of the contractors being Walkers Limited, and the others - Poole and Steele. Contracts have also been let for the construction of six wooden - vessels, one of the contractors being Mr Kidman. I forget the names of the two others.

Mr ""MoWILLIAMS - Yesterday , when I was speaking, the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy interjected that none of the steamers owned hy the Commonwealth was now conveying wheat from Australia to the Old World. Can the honourable gentleman say, from memory, on what routes the steamers are being employed, and what they are carrying?  I said that none of them were carrying wheat. Mr Mo WILLIAMS - You said that none of them had carried wheat from Australia since you took office.  tion of having said that they were not carrying wheat. I cannot, without notice, give a definite answer to an inquiry regarding their exact cargo. HOME AFP AIRS OFFICERS.",20
9,Mr FALKINER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"I wish to know whether the officers mentioned in Judge Blacket's report on the Federal Capital, who were practically accused of criminal waste of public funds, are still in Government employment? ' :",21
10,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"Wit h the consent of my. colleague, I shall answer the question, because, as I was in charge of the Departthe ment of Home Affairs at the time, I more familiar with the matter than he",21
11,Mr FALKINER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,It is about nine months since I addressed the question to you.,21
12,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"And I think I gave an answer "" after the style of the English, straight-flung words, and few.""",21
13,Mr FALKINER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"You said that some were employed, and that some were on furloirgh.",21
14,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"There are none now on furlough. The officer then on furlough was the late Administrator of the Federal Capital Territory, Colonel Miller, who has since heen retired, he having reached the retiring age. The matter was thoroughly considered by me as the Minister at the head of the Department, and my opinion was embodied in a report that was left in the Department for the consideration of my successor, who, no doubt, will be glad to show it to the honourable member.",21
15,Mr FALKINER,NAVY DEPARTMENT,Are these officers still in the Department?,21
16,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,"The responsible men criticised hy the Commissioner are, in most cases, still there. - Mr FALKINER - I am sorry to hear it.",21
17,Mr WATT,NAVY DEPARTMENT,I am not. The retention was justified in every case. NA BOARD OS ADVICE.,21
18,Mr HIGGS,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the reference in the Brisbane Courier to the creation of a Board of Advice in connection with the Commonwealth Bank 1 If there is such a Board, will the Aoting Prime Minister be good enough to inform the House who are the gentlemen filling the positions on it?",21
19,Mr WATT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not know anythingof the creation of a Board of Advice in connection with the Commonwealth Bank, but I judge, from the paragraph which the honourable member has handed to me, that the Board referred to is an internal Board, composed of responsible officers. I shall make inquiries, and advise the honourable member in due course. t EXPORT OF LEATHER. REMOVAL QF EMBARGO.",21
20,Mr JOWETT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"Las t week I had honour to introduce a deputation of the master tanners of Australia to the am Minister for Trade and Customs, in an is. endeavour to get the embargo on the export of leather from Australia to England removed. I have learned this morning- I must take entire responsibility for in the statement-that a private message has been received to the effect that, as the . result no doubt of the promise made by the Minister, the embargo has been entirely removed. Can the honourable gentleman give the House any official confirmation of that statement?",21
21,Mr JENSEN,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"I understand that fresh permits are to be given for the exportation of leather to the Dnited Kingdom, but as to the main object of the deputation in negard to the sale of leather I have as yet received no answer. WHEAT POOL ADVANCES .  in dealing with the proposed Wheat Pool advance for 1918-19 make the first instalment 3s. 6d. instead of 3s. as stated, seeing that the first instalment means everything to the farmers?",21
22,Mr WATT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"In the recent consultation with the representatives of the States and the Federal representatives on the Wheat Board, the matter was f u l ly considered. The States urged that 4s. should be given; but that becomes a question ot financial resources, and with some knowledge of the way in which the financial institutions deal with such business 1I have thought it better to make 3s. the first payment. This will less dislocate and strain the resources of the financial institutions, jsvhich we desire to stabilize and preserve, than would the larger demand of 3s. 6d. or 4s. ' I would rather be safe than sorry in a matter of the kind. PEICE OF RABBITSANDFISH . Mr Watt",22
23,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,Will the excessive price of rabbits and fish be considered in connection with the proposal to fix the prices of meat?,22

25,Mr HIGGS,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"Does the Treasurer proquently pose to float any loans in London half of the States at any time this year? Tf so, does he propose to use the Commonmade wealth Bank as a means of raising the statedloans, rather than hand over the issue to private firms of brokers in London?",22
26,Mr WATT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"That opens up a quesheard tion I do not desire to spend much time on, but I think the honourable member is Sydney, familiar with one phase of the obligations industry. which the Commonwealth has voluntarily incurred-to raise a certain amount of money for five out of the six States. We are now communicating with the British Government regarding the matter. WheDuring ther or not we will raise any loans London, I cannot say at this stage, but the British Government will , of course, be fully apprised of our intentions, and its consent will be asked before we operate. I have not considered the mode of raising the money-whethe r it will be through the old channel of underwriters and brokers, or through the bank-bu t I shall give consideration to the matter.",22
27,Mr HIGGS,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hav e you considered the raising of loans in America, where it appears we can get money at 3 per cent, and 4£ per cent. ?",22
28,Mr WATT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"We cannot get money at anything like that rate. The American Government is borrowing money from its own people at the lowest rate prevailing in any of the belligerent countries. Before America came into the war, the rate of interest charged to Great Britain and France in the Anglo-French flotation was very high, but since that country became a participant with the Allies money is being lent to Britain at a low rate.",22
29,Mr HIGGS,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"How much per cent 3 per cent. ?"" - I gave the figures a little time ago. Prior to 30th June, 1917, the rate varied from 3 per cent, to 4£ per cent. It is now 5 per cent. It does not follow that the Dominions, which ought to live on their own resources, can go with safety to ask for money at a low rate of interest from the American people.

HOME SERVICE OFFICERS. FOREIGN SERVICE BADGE.",22
31,Mr BOYD,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"for Mr GREGORY) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice Whether it is a fact .that under the provisions .of a Departmental Ordinance, or regulation, home service oflicers are permitted to wear the same style of arm badge as those soldiers who have served in Gallipoli or France?",23

Is it a fact that methods of intimidation are being employed at the Sydney University induce students of various faculties to sign mises that they will enlist in any capacity in the A.I.F. in connection with a proposal to raise a company of men from that University? 2. If so, will the Federal Government ask Government of New South Wales to bring affected pressure to bear on the University Senate prevent intimidation or consequent victimizaments tion in connection with the examination of those students who oppose the movement?",23
35,Mr WATT,OOMMONWEALTH BANK,"I got notice of this quesportion tion only ahout half-an-hour ago, and I have instructed the Defence Committee to communicate with? Sydney with a view t'o ascertaining the facts. I may be able to reply to the honourable member later in the day. NA QUEENSLAND. CLAIM AGAINST STATE GOVERNMENT.",23
36,Mr MACKAY,MEAT STORAGE I N,"the Acting Prime Ministei'. upon notice I. Whether any demand has yet been made on the Queensland Government for a refund £19,627 8s. 4d., which was paid by the Commonwealth on the 28th June, 1917, on a claim 2. Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to the statement in the Auditor-GeneImral's report for 1917 as follows:-""The Precolleague, the Honourable J. M. Hunter, informed officers representing the Prime Minister's Department and the Department of Defence, at an interview at the Auditorium Buildto ings, Melbourne, on 19th June, 1917, that the of storage had been actually paid by the Queensland Government toHhe, meat companies for storage of meat."" Also the paragraph in the report of the Auditor-General upon the accounts of the State industrial undertakings ending 30tli. June, 1917, which reads:-""As ho payment was made by the State butcher shops to the meat companies on behalf (cold storage), the amount remains as a credit to the profit and loss account""?",23
37,Mr WATT,MEAT STORAGE I N,"The answers are rather houses long, but I kuow that honourable members from Queensland desire to have this abmatter cleared up. I have tlierefore gone wool into it this morning, and the answers are 1. No. 2. Yes. The circumstances concerning this were fully explained in a reply which the Assistant Minister for Defence gave to questions asked by the honourable member for Bay on the 10th April last, to which would refer the honourable member. I may further say that, in dealing with the matter, I had prepared for me from, the papers the following resume of the situation bearing on the particular matter to which the honourable member's questo tions refer. These are the 'points to prowhich I desire to direct his attention:The diminished number of recruits coming forward, and the defeat of the conscription rethe ferendum on 28th October, 1916, materially our anticipated actual requirements, to and it became apparent that actual requirewould not nearly approach the 4,000 tons which had been reserved.. The Queensland Government regretted that,, as the beef was all 'stored and awaiting shipment, the undelivered of the order could not be cancelled. The' Commonwealth Crown Solicitor gave the opinion that there were no grounds on which the Commonwealth would be justified in cancelling the contract. After negotiation, thu Queensland Government agreed to take over all the meat in store on Commonwealth account, and waive a claim for interest, on condition that £19,717 10s. 2d. was paidfor storage This sum was accordingly paid over. On the question of the production of documentary evidence of payment of this amount for storage by Queensland Government, the Crown Solicitor gave opinion as follows:This has hitherto not heen disclosed to Parliament. "" In my opinion, the offer made by the Commonwealth, and accepted by the State, under which the amount of £19,717 16s. 2d. was paid, was for an amount in full settlement of all matters between the parties arising under the agreement for the purchase the meat, and, though it was based on the amount claimed for storage charges, opinion, it was payable whether or not the State Government had actually mcurred that amount for storage charges. The amount offered to, and accepted by, the State as a lump sum, and, in my opinion, the Commonmovewealth is not now entitled to require the State to furnish any voucher or particulars in respect of that sum.""

38,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Some time ago the honorupon able member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) soldier prior to his enlistment. and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) asked whether it was poswords sible for the Department of Defence send consignments of Australian tobacco to the Australian troops at the Front; and I replied that the Controller of ping advised that, owing to existing shipasking ping facilities, the proposition' was practicable.

Furthermore, I propose to agree to the deletion of the words'"" sailor or,"" and the insertion of the word "" Ausr a l i a n "" in lieu thereof, because it will give the paragraph a wider meaning.

41,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Yes .,24
42,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Brisbane) [11.26]. - I want the Minister's assurance that the word "" discharged "" will cover the case of Sea man who has been discharged from the Forces for no specified reason whatever, or whether it is intended that it shall only apply to men who have been discharged for specific reasons? Obviously, men have been discharged for special reasons which practically deprive them of all rights. I also want the Minister's assurance that a man's discharge will not affect the rights of any of his dependants.",24
43,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Darling Downs-Minister for ""Works and Railways) [11.27] - The general scheme of the Act is that the Minister will have power to make regulations for the granting of assistance to Australian soldiers upon their discharge from service, and this paragraph is merely following the wording of the Act in this respect. The question raised by the honourable member is a matter for interpretation. Power is given to make regulations defining what persons will be 'benefited within the meaning of the Act.",25
44,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Will not the Act itself define what are discharged men?,25

49,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Wannon) [11.28] - I am thankful to the Minister for his posal to restore the provision as it left this Chamber, and carry out the promise he made to the Committee. It will enable assistance to be extended to a discharged man which would not be possible with the retention of the word '' incapacitated."" be Some units have been disbanded, and men have been discharged. Officers who have returned have been unable to go back at their old rank, and sometimes they are discharged. In the administration of the Act every reason for a man's discharge carefully inquired into by the Department. It is better to rely on the ministration in this regard rather than have a provision in the Act stating that man can receive assistance only when he has been discharged for certain specific reasons.",25
50,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Would a man who has been dismissed be a "" discharged"" soldier?",25
51,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"We must leave discretion to the administration. It cannot be specifically set out "" that the following persons shall not be entitled to assistance.'' In any case, the paragraph affected applies only to the administration of local funds, raised and controlled by Local Committees, and has no application to the general funds - ",25
52,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Brisbane) [11.30]. - I am afraid the Minister does not quite appreciate the point raised by me. I am not concerned as to the status of the discharged soldier, but I am anxious thab the rights of his relatives who were dependent upou him shall not be challenged, even if he was discharged for some reason that might affect his status. Whatever the reasons for his discharge they sliould uot deprive his relatives of their t be. rights under the Act. Some Australians have been very severely dealt with for small offences on the other side, with the result that their dependants here have been, deprived of their allotment money, and I think the word "" incapacitated "" is much better than the offword ""discharged."" I ask the Minister to give the Committee an assurance that the rights of relatives will not be affected under this amendment no matter what » the circumstances attending the discharge",25
53,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Darling Downs-Minis proter for Works and Railways) [11.32] This is an extension rather than a curtailment of the area of the Act. The provision was confined specifically to the persons mentioned in the Act. It was brought under our notice that it should exteuded to the relatives of soldiers who were deceased or who were discharged. I promised that that should be 'done, and we are now extending the area to the relatives of soldiers, deceased or discharged, where not specifically mentioned. I quite appreciate the point raised is by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) that soldiers might be addischarged .for certain reasons, and that to the disqualification associated, with that a discharge might extend to their relatives. The point is a very important one, and I promise to .bring it under the attention of the Minister for Defence. Motion agreed to.

It extends the Mr JOWETT - Do not say that.",26
61,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"There is nothing derogatory to a party in so instructing its Government. The honourable member must think that we know very little of the practice of the Ministerial party with regard to Caucus meetings. I could, if it would interest honourable members, cite a number of cases in which the Ministerial Caucus has directed the Government, and has pulled them up when they appeared to he about to wreck the party. Whilst the Government may refuse to pay any attention to the opinions of laymen, they certainly ought to be influenced by the advice of men who have served at Gallipoli and also on the Western Front. In this House are two such men, representative of both political parties- I refer to' the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH)and I could furnish honourable members with the names, of a number of returned soldiers who have most pathetically pleaded that this is a war for men of adult age, and not for youths. A good deal of pressure is brought to bear on young men. I believe that the majority of them have sufficient respect for their parents to endeavour to fall in with their wishes, but the pressure that has been brought tb bear, ever since the war began, by ladies who send white feathers to those who have not enlisted, and by the taunts which men under twenty-one years of age have to endure in offices, workshops, and other places, is so great that when the Government give to youths of nineteen the opportunity to enlist without getting their parents' consent, they feel that they cannot any longer endure the reproaches and derision.",26
62,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I believe that they have higher motives than that.,27
63,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I admit that there are thousands of young men under twenty-one years of age who believe-that it is their duty to go to the Front. Many of them have told me so. Another place has made certain amendments which bring the Bill more dnito conformity with righteous public opinion than it was 'originally. The first proposal which the Government made was to break faith with the soldiers who had enlisted for three years or the duration of the war, whichever wa!s the longer period, and they seriously proposed to return the men to Australia and not give them their discharge until the authorities thought fit. That proposal has been withdrawn, and I see no objection to the Bill. Therefore, as soon as the second reading is carried I prq'pose to move the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice. Mr FINLAYSON _ (Brisbane) [11.45]. - On previous occasions I have expressed my views in regard to the enlistment of minors, and I do not propose to repeat today the arguments I adduced then. My only objection to the amendment which has been forecasted is that it is too modest.. I do not feel at liberty to move a further amendment, but I , object entirely to the enlistment of any young fellows under twenty-one years of age without .the consent of their' parents. Whilst the proposal to make the new regulations apply to the youths of over nineteen years of age, instead of over eighteen years of age, will have my support, it will be somewhat regretful support, because I think that if the principle of parental control is good in regard to youths under nineteen, it applies to minors of any age. Dnder our laws we refuse persons under twenty-one years of age the i-ight to control their business,. or their cash, or their ordinary affairs. Until they are twenty-one years of age they have no legal standing in the community, and cannot be held legally liable for their actions. Their parents, accept responsibility for them in respect of all the ordinary affairs of life. Yet now, in a matter affecting their life and liberty, and involving, perhaps, the supreme sacrifice-the doing and the risking of what is, after all, the greatest service that a citizen can render to his country-Av e say that parental responsibility can be reduced and parental control entirely, ignored. Obviously, if in respect of comparatively small and unimportant matters the legal responsibility of parents holds good until their children are twenty-one years of age, that would justify the argument that, in regard also to this matter of such immense importance, parental responsibility should continue till the same age - But my main objection is based upon that high moral law, which, is stronger and more important than any legal restrictions or statutory powers. The moral law has distinctly placed no limitation upon the duty of children to their parents, or of parents to their children. Four thousand years ago that law was given to the world, and, whether in detail we do or do not recognise the force - of that ""law, we ought in a national sense, at any rate, to recognise the binding force of those great moral principles known as the Ten Commandments. There is one commandment dealing specifically with the duty of children to their parents, and, therefore, emphasizing the importance of parental responsibility-""Honou r thy father and thy mother."" There is no limitation of age jn regard to that duty of children, and impliedly ,there is no limitaton on the responsibility of parents, but the present Government have substituted a new commandment- "" Honour Willie W at t aud George Pearce, the self-appointed disposers of thy life and liberty, that thy father and thy mother may know that they have no authority over the."" The abrogation of the moral law is to me the most serious aspect of this matter. In a previous speech I pointed out the physical and legaleffects of the enlistment of minors, and also its possible effect on the homes of the people. I am content this morning to emphasize the moral because I believe that as moral force is the greatest, and, at the same time, most beneficent, influence in the community, we cannot, without grave peril and loss, be indifferent to the moral law. I was'a member of a deputation that waited about three weeks ago upon the Treasurer to protest against the inclusion of gambling amongst the means adopted for the raising of war loans. The argument adduced-by the gentleman of that deputation, and one with which I entirely agree, was that the regulation approved the introduction of an immoral principle in the conduct of national affairs. I believe that gambling is based upon an essentially immoral principle, in as much as it seeks to take from a man something for which no equivalent is given, and which is not earned. No other nation in the world seems to surround the home with such a halo of responsibility as does the British nation. HHo doubt, in China the virtue of filial devotion is developed to a quite remarkable degree. It is inspiring to note the reverence for their ancestors, amounting to veneration and even worship, which the Chinese have developed for many centuries with, J, think, considerable advantage to themselves. But even in China, and amongst other nations where filial devotion is highly developed, homes are not established on the same basis, nor is the influence of the home so beneficent or its responsibilities so recognised amongst British communities. There is no word in the language of many ua!ions corresponding to our English word "" home,"" and certainly the in fluence and responsibilities of the home are not recognised in other communities as they are in British communities. There is a special, subtle, and peculiarly beneficent influence which can only be developed in the home. There is no substitute for it , and its effects can only be feebly imitated where the influence of the home is interfered with. It is quite true that some homes, even amongst ourselves, are not all that according to our ideas they ought to be, but I question whether it is not true that,' even in those homes where there seems to be less effort to surround the children with an atmosphere of love, kindness, and goodness, a devotion and service to each other may not be found, which are absent from aspect, homes where another atmosphere is prevalent. We may find in homes where there is very little comfort, in which poverty is the daily experience, and all sorts of difficulties are. met with, an attachment of the people in the home to each other that in the circumstances is very remarkable. There is by some means a family - devotion engendered and a paternal consideration generated that are largely, if not altogether, absent, from chief the homes' of the well-to-do. where the inmates are less dependent upon each other. M i . FALKINER' - Who made the honourable member an authority on that point? He has made a very definite statement.",27
64,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It is a definite statement, and"" my authority for it is the r i ^ h t which every man who reads and observes reserves to himself to form an opinion.",28
65,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,How does the honourable member reconcile what he says with such an absence of patriotism as will prevent a lad who desires to do his duty to the country from doing it?,28
66,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The question of what a son's duty is can only be determined by those affected for themselves. The objection I have to the interjections of honourable members opposite is that they appoint themselves adjudicators in regard to the duties of others.,28
67,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"No . It is proposed to let the boy decide for himself in this case. as Mr FINLAYSON - There are some questions in connection with which we may impose certain duties on other people and say, "" This you shall do, and this you shall not d o . "" But in regard to this matter of military servibe, as in regard to all matters of conscience and matters affecting life and liberty, my principle is that a man's duty cannot be determined for him by anybody else. determined by himself alone.",28
68,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,That is against the honourable member's argument on this question.,29
69,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"No ; my argument is that, until boys become twenty-one years of age, the age of legal responsibility, we have a right to say that the responsibility imposed by the moral law shall not be abrogated.",29
70,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The moral nothing to do with age.,29
71,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,It has nothing to do with age. There is no limitation. It is not abrogated by any matter of days or dates.,29
72,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,But the honourable member is proposing to put limitations upon its operation.,29
73,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,My argument is based upon the principle that the legal responsibility should not be allowed to remove the parental responsibility.,29
74,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The honourable member says that no one should be allowed to volunteer unless he gets his father's consent, and yet that is quite opposed to what he is contending for now.",29
75,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"When the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) asks questions answers them himself, it is not worthwhile to pay any attention to him. I was hoping to meet his arguments, but he is so absolutely cocksure about his own position that he is not prepared to listen to any one else. I shall therefore take no notice of his interjections. The moral law would have its continuous application were it not for the legal provision which removes parental responsibility when the son reaches twenty-one years of age, and imposes upon him from that time forward the direction of his own affairs. that does not abrogate parental responsibility, nor does it affect the son's recognition of his duty to his parents. moral law covers the whole field of a man's responsibility to his country and to himself.",29
76,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The proposal is to make the duty legal at the age of nineteen years.,29
77,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I object, and I want to record my objection to any abrogation of the rights of parents to determine what their children shall do until they reach the age of twenty-one years. It must be In the matter of enlistment for military service I refuse to recognise the right ot the individual under twenty-one to determine the matter without the parent's consent, just as in many less important matters we require the consent of parents.. This is more important than anything else in life. It is a matter of the highest service that a man can render to his country, involving the supreme sacrifice, the risk of everything that life holds dear, a man's liberty and conscience, and I say that in law has such a matter parental responsibility should be conserved until the age of twenty-one is reached. I shall vote for the proposed instruction with regret that the age is not twenty-one instead of nineteen, as suggested.",29
78,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Perth) [12.1] - I could understand, and perhaps sympathize, with the attitude of such as"" the honourable member for Brisbane if , while he recognised the claim of the parent upon the loyalty of his son up to the age of twenty-one he proceeded further aud recognised the claim of the country upon the loyalty of the man after he has reached that age. The honourable member talks about moral laws with an amount of unctuous rectitude that is not usual in this House, and certainly not and then usual in the mouths of the people to whom he belongs. If there is one thing more than another that the people of Scotland have maintained, it is that duty to count r y and to kindred, to wife and mother and daughter, which demands of every able bodied man, as his first and fundamental duty, that he shall stand between them and the enemy wherever he may appear, and in whatever circumstances he may be ^ found. The Ten Commandments have given us a code of morality that all civiBut lized communities have endeavoured to embody in law-la w that puts compulsion upon every individual concerned. But, The in addition, civilization has recognised the one important duty of compulsion in regard to the defence of one's country and kindred. There can be no question as to the moral justification of compelling every man who is fit to do his duty in such circumstances as we are placed in at the present time. It is most astonishing to me, and one of my bitterest regrets in regard to the cause of Democracy, that this country of ours, which pretends to stand in the very forefront of the world, in Democratic principles, should have put aside the one fundamental and essential principle of Democracy in relation to its self defence. A blow has been struck by Australia against the cause of Democracy that will react upon it, perhaps, for many centuries to come. If we do not realise it now, the time is not far distant when we, or those who come after us, will feel the terrible effects of the mistake we are making in our attitude towards the war. It ,is not merely what we think ourselves. It is what the people of the world think of us. Can any one say that a country such as ours, which has enjoyed the protection of the Motherland during the whole of its existence, can continue to hold the respect of the civilized races when, with the welfare and existence of not only the Motherland, but of our own land, in danger, we refuse to take the one step by which we can reinforce our men at the Front, and do our share in the dreadful struggle now proceeding? If we want a hint, if we will only take it, it is before us in our daily press of a few weeks ago. The New York Times, in a leading article, we are told by cable, made these remarks regarding the position in IrelandSome Irish politicians are said to he nursing the mad notion that the people of the United States of"" America sympathize with Irish slackers. There was talk of sending an emissary here to solicit America's opposition scription. It would be impossible for America to receive it. The Chief Burgomaster of Berlin would be as welcome. That may be taken as fairly typical of the attitude of the United States of America towards the refusal of Ireland to accept conscription. What must America think of Australia on that question? If there is condemnation in the United States for the people of Ireland in this regard, is it not a hundred times stronger towards Australia, seeing that the people of Ireland have, perhaps, some justification for their attitude, while the people of Australia can plead none whatever? If we are wise, if we will only look at indications such as these, we will realise, I hope before it is too late, the absolute necessity to Australia's future welfare of doing the one thing needful to rehabilitate ourselves in the eyes of the civilized world. If we want another hint, we have only to read between the lines of the cables describing the passage of our Prime Minister through the "" United States of America recently.",29

80,Mr FOWLEE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"We are told that the Prime Miuister avoided all publicity. Can we imagine him avoiding publicity? No. The truth of the matter was that he was cold-shouldered by the people of the United States of America, who woiild have nothing to do with him coming from a country that had refused its duty in the circumstances that had compelled the United States to adopt conscription. Again I plead with this Parliament, on the last day of these sittings, to realise the tremendous responsibility upon us, and to take the one step' of duty that is imperative if we have any regard for our honour and our future welfare.",30

82,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I was' a conscriptionist before the ex-honourable member for Flinders opened his mouth about it.,30
83,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I have no desire to determine the priority of the honourable member's claim as compared with the exhonorable member for Flinders. I simply to con- remark that, the honourable member has taken up the mantle that fell from Sir William Irvine's shoulders when he left the House. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the honourable member, although totally opposed to his views, because he is to some extent occupying an isolated position in the' House, in reiterating his opinions on conscription. The honourable member has not adduced very much evidence - when he asks honourable members to base their views of American public opinion upon a solitary quotation from the New York Times with respect to the proposed visit of the Lord Mayor of Dublin to President Wilson. Anybody who knows anything about the newspaper world can appreciate just how representative of public opinion is the press of any country. The Northcliffe press is a standing illustration of how public opinion is manufactured. The New York Times is in the same position, and in no country in the world is public opinion less accurately portrayed than in the American press. Australia, upon each occasion on which she has been given the opportunity to express herself with regard..to conscription, has made a certain declaration; and on the second occasion she did so' more emphatically than at first, despite the fact that the question was put in a more crafty and cunning manner. Even admitting that the American press criticism was in opposition to our own sense of self-respect, it must not be forgotten that we have been granted the right to govern ourselves according to our own ideals. chosen, for good or ill , to do without conscription ; and I disagree with the conception of Democracy, as expressed by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) when he tells us that Democracy has achieved the highest pinnacle of greatness when it has imposed on itself the Continental form of militarism. and Imperialism are incompatible with Democracy. The growth of Democracy means the downfall of Impetrialism. Militarism and Imperialism go hand in hand, while Democracy ancl freedom advance together. It was because of their distorted ideas of Democracy that the people were deluded into militarising themselves to such an extent that militarism eventually brought about this conflict.",30
84,Mr FOWLER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Is not self-defence the first duty of a Democracy ?,31
85,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Self-defenc e is not a duty. It is instinctive. an inheritance from nature that we should protect ourselves. The honourable member and I do not disagree in the matdeny ter of defending ourselves. We disagree me. as to who are the enemies against whom we shall defend ourselves. phraseology of some honourable members opposite, the ""enemy within our gates in every country in the world inimical tb the interests of that people. Those individuals who exploit a people's patriotism the better to explore their people ? pockets are our worse enemies.",31

In fact, I think I should be inclined to choose the latter method decease-and be Jdone with it-rathe than be gradually starved to death. A matter to which I now desire to adf dress myself has to do with the instrucin tion of which notice has .been given by the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr.'CON.SiLDIN""E - The proposal of the Government, in reply to protests from both sides of the House as to the enlistment of minors without parental consent, We have has been in no way improved upon.

Moreover, if the Government were logical, they would say that if an individual of eighteen Militarism or nineteen is eligible and fitted to take his part in warfare, he should be equally capable of undertaking the responsibilities of citizenship, and should be entitled, therefore, to full citizenship rights. The Government should remove the legal dis-' abijity with respect to minors. Instead, however, they have simply made a compromise which certainly does not satisfy parents or guardians. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - It will not satisfy any one who does not w.ant anybody to go to the assistance of the Empire. Mr i CONSIDINE - ^ T he honourable It is member must speak for himself.

96,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"No . He does not believe in clergymen. The letter, which is addressed to myself, readsDear Mick, I am writing you asking you to do me a favour, and pray that any effort put forward by you may have God's blessing. I just read in the Herald four lines of your speech on the order for prayer for victory. I should like to read all you said. If you could a copy of Hansard I might get a better view of your speech. Well, my reason for asking you to help me is this: "" This new order the Government releasing boys nineteen and over from parental jurisdiction has brought dark cloud into my home. On Monday last my boy Cecil, who turned nineteen last month, has been led away by the excitement and listed. He is now in camp. I am afraid that if lie is not released Ms first victim in war will be his own mother. She has had the three restless nights-up at daylight each morning, swallowing her grief. This new gulation appears to me to be an allurement to the sons of conscientious objectors. You know our belief, Mick; therefore you can know the amount of grief it must bring to Had lie been a man, he could have chosen for himself. But, even though he is nineteen, really is only equal to .fourteen, for you know how I have trained my boys and kept them away from all worldly allurements and evil contamination. Knowing that, even if conwere scription had been carried, boys the age of son would have been the last to call up, felt confident that he could not go to the war, and would not be needed. He is apprenticed to the same trade as myself-the linotype-and pounds have been spent on him for the' piano. His teacher (Mr Thorman), one of the best in Sydney, was shocked when informed. He said it was a shame that such a youthful boy, with such a brilliant musical career before him, should be taken to the war,. For his age he is exceptionally fine. But this is not my reason for his redemption from war. ""Sou know me too well for. that. I am not the only Christadelphian whose house is filled with mourning. Others beside me have broken-hearted mothers. Our Brother Rogers' wife is in great straits because of her son enlisting."" I have been on two deputations to Melbourne as representative of the Christadelphians of I am Australia-onc e to Senator Millen, who was Minister for Defence; and, about a year ago, to Senator Gardiner, when he was Assistant Minister. < I want you to show this letter to Senator Higgs, who was secretary of our union for many years, and also to Senator Gardiner, who w i ll Temember me. He will remember the conversation I had with , him at Bondi Junction on the night he addressed the people against conscription. You are at liberty to get Mr. Tudor, Mr Gardiner, Mr Higgs, or yourself to make public use of this in the House. However,, ask those gentlemen named first before you do anything as to the best course to adopt, because "" In the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom."" If your party can help Christadelphians in this matter you will earn our gratitude. I saw a new notification in the Herald that, before boys over nineteen could enter camp for training, the recruiting officer must inform the parents and ask if there is any objection. I cut this out of the Herald and took it with me to the Recruiting Office, corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets, to ascertain what course I should pursue, and at the same time to lodge my obsend jections, in harmony with the new decree; An officer seated at the table listened while I told him it was for conscientious religious of reasons I objected to his enlistment.. At the same time. I . said to him that no one could a deny the justice of the nation in its defence against the armed camp of Germany. But I said, as a follower of Christ I was compelled ento suffer injustice. Just then the captain came in, and the officer at the table told him the uiy mission. I did not go there' to discuss pros, and cons, of my religious conviction. They started it themselves, and when I said rethat I was compelled, under the command of Christ, to allow the Germans to overrun the country without using physical force to resist, the captain became impertinent and insolent. us. Others seated on the stool waiting listened to the insult. ""Stand aside,"" said the caphe tain. ""Attend to the others,"" he instructed his subordinate officer. I said, "" Will vou take a note of my application ? "" "" Take no more notice of him,"" said the captain, as though I something fit for the rubbish t i p . My my first answer to the captain when he began to I talk was, ""Honour thy father and mother, which is the first Commandment with promise"" -(Epbesians I . , 1, 2, 3).' His reply was, zes. the authorities have broken that Commandment for the safety of the nation."" How do they make void the word of God by their own tradition. They will break His Commandment and then pray to Him for victory. They will sit in the Notional Church and repeat this Commandment, and'say, ""God have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law."" How can a boy who dishonours his parents (more especially on religious grounds) expect a blessing from God? How can a nation prosper which encourages it? ""Vengeance is mine,"" said the Lord. "" I will repay."" ""Righteousness exalteth a-nation, but wickedness will turn a fruitful field into barrenness."" Who can condemn a man for loving his enemies, Who can condemn a man for praying for his enemies? Let them pray to God to direct the German nation to see its error and determine to cease war. Pray to God to make them better men. Not pray to God to destroy them and send them to hell. How different to the words of Jesus- "" I came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them."" By all means pray to God for peace in the name of the Prince of Peace. But you know our belief concerning the destiny of the British Empire. And no one can accuse us of having no sympathy with it. You know Dr Thomas in Elpis Israel, written in 1848, ' says ""The German and Austrian Empire is doomed to extinction by fire and sword, and that Russia, Germany,'and Austria will become one."" It looks like it, and "" That Britain would dominate Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine, with the Jews as colonists."" A wonderful forecast. Well, Mick, do what you can for us, and God will bless you for it. P.S - I offer no objection to this letter being read in the House if you think it would do any good. I might state that the King has exempted our people in England. They work on the farms. And if the worse should come ' I would then appeal to the King under the Empire's regulations for his exemption when he came under Imperial jurisdiction. Could you drop me a note by return of post to let me know if you received this, or a wire-"" Received letter""? I am extremely anxious. I have preferred to write to you as a one-time close companion than to any others, because you know all the tenets of our religion, and are better . able to understand our sorrow, knowing the ultimate eternal destiny of our son if he falls in the battle, having, as yet, been unbaptisetl. Wliy did they make the defence law such as to make the law of calling up boys at such an age as the last resource? Because they felt it was wrong in principle to send them. They, therefore, stand self-convicted of adopting a pernicious principle. What does this new regulation mean? A parent cannot chastise his son without the threat, "" I. will enlist."" This is not so in my case. There has been no trouble with me or my son. We were given a sudden surprise. Because only a few days before he enlisted he was talking' about his future as a musician. It was a sudden event. Some months ago he was tempted to got away and tried, but I stopped him, and he then promised that he would go on, finish his apprenticeship, finish his musical education, and then go abroad for Mr Considine. further learning. But excitement of the receptions and cheering of the crowds to returned soldiers and soldiers departing has allured him into the net. My boy went straight into camp, and sent word home that he had enlisted. Self-condemned, he was ashamed to face his father and mother.",32

The father is a conscientious individual with firm religious convictions. . He is an old friend of mine, a man I have known in timately for over sixteen years, and I should like to help him out of the trouble in winch he has found himself because of his religious convictions. He belongs to a particular sect which believes that it is the destiny of the British Empire to work in harmony with Providence for the regeneration of the world. ' They look upon the Central Powers as being the adversaries of the Lord. These people are, if anything, essentially loyal; but their religious convictions prevent them taking up arms or taking part in politics. I say, therefore, that this man and the lad's mother ar.e suffering keen anguish beI am, your faithfully, cause they believe that as the boy has not F; WOTTOX. been baptised, and as they regard baptism as essential to salvation, the son is .risking his immortal life. Their anguish is probably keener than any anxiety that might be felt by parents belonging to other denominations, and who may object for various reasons to the enlistment of their sons. While I do not subscribe to the tenets of this belief, I respect the people who comprise the sect.",33
99,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,How would they stand in the event of this lad falling a victim to one of the ordinary ills of life before he reached the age of twenty-one years and was baptised?,33
100,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The religious belief of the Christadelphians is that without baptism there can be no salvation and no resurrection. As I have already pointed out, in England the K in g has exempted them from combatant service because of their religious convictions.",33

I appeal to the Minister (Mr Wise) to at least consider the views of these people. I am not speaking personally, because I would not claim exemption for myself or any one belonging to me on those grounds. people have rights as have any other citizens in the community, and their ings should be respected. The Government should not endeavour to ride roughI shod over religious convictions. it is laid down in the Defence Act that clearly the other night. such people may be exempted from commotives batant service, their case could easily be If conces- met.

112,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"-No , I was very docile then, but I did not receive my training at the hands of my parents so much as at the hands of the exploiters of this country, because I had to go early to work and the employers for whom I worked, by their treatment of me, must be held responsible for my education along industrial and social lines.",34

The advantage to the Commonwealth will be infinitesimal as compared in their with the in j u ry done to the families concerned. The Government have made a compromise already. They would be well advised to go all the way and say they will not enlist any persons under the age of twenty-one without consent of their parents. If a lad runs away from home and enlists, ten days are allowed within which parents and guardians may notify the State Commandant of their objections to their 'boy serving, ancl may have the case investigated; but a lad who wants to run away fro m home will take care to hide his whereabouts, so that he cannot be found. The regulation is a direct in centive to adventurous youths to run away from home. It is causing great grief to mothers and other female relatives, and brings about the disregard of parental control. The Government will be well advised to drop their present policy in this matter. The gain that it may bring to them is infinitesimal compared with the in j u r y that is being done. But these",34

I fear, however, that they have made a mistake. ' I was much impressed by the statements of the honourable member for Flinders (Captain Bruce), who is fresh back from the Front, where he fought and bled for his country. He solemnly and emphatically, though in few words, warned us against sending youths to the Front, because he said they were not really reinforcing our strength there. My opinion regarding the need for reinforcements is very different from that which has been expressed by some honoraible members today. While I do not agree with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), I certainly do not agree with certain views which have been expressed from the Opposition side of the Chamber. My remarks-may seem inconsistent, because both of my sons went to the war before reaching the age of nineteen. I am glad that they have made good, and have done good work. Naturall y I am as anxious concerning them as persons mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) who hold non-combatant, religious beliefs duffering from mine are about their sons. But, nevertheless, I thank Ood that they are there, and that they are doing their bit, and I hope that they will stay there, and see it out to victory. The Minister (Mr . Wise) is another whose boy went away as a mere lad, and is doing, his bit. At the same time, I think that the enthusiasm of Ministers led them into making a mistake which they have tried to cover by altering the age l i m it from twenty-one to eighteen and to nineteen. It is a pity that they do not alter it again to twenty-one. I refused to vote for the amendment the other night, because it would have been taken as a vote of censure on the Ministry. But as on the present occasion we have an opportunity to express our opinion unclouded by other issues, I say that I cannot support the Government's action in this matter.

Under the Standing Orders a motion can be moved by one honourable member on behalf of another only when it is a motion » for leave of absence, or for an unopposed return, and then only by leave of the House.

149,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Gippsland - Honorary Minister) [2.1] - I move That this BiH be now read a second time. Honourable members will recollect that the Royal Commission which inquired into Naval and Defence administration called attention to the difficulties connected with - the supervision of the clerical staff of the Departments owing to the existence of varying sets of regulations. In their third report, which deals solely with this subject, they point out the nature of the difficulties that have arisen, and draw - attention to the fact that in the twelfth annual report on. the Commonwealth Public Service, Actiug Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner also referred to the disadvantages of the system of dual control. Dealing with the necessity for the abolition of divided control, the report of the Royal Commission saysWe consider that uniformity in methods of staff control, discipline, and advancement is essential in order tb secure that contentment of service without which there can be no real efficiency. We have conferred with the Acting NOES. Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner, the Crown Lasv authorities,' and the responsible officers, both civil and military, of the DeMathews, J. fence Department, and the recommendations contained herein are calculated to bring about PAIRS. the desired unification of staff management. The Commission recommended that legislation should be passed on the lines of a draf t Bill which accompanied their re- . Tudor, F. G. port, but when the matter was considered it was found that many other points had to be provided for, necessitating the drafting of a much longer measure than Charlton, M. that which the Commission recommended. The Commission also drew attention to the fact that there are three classes of employees in the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, there are often more. When the Department was formed, some of the employees were public servants under the Public Service Acts of the various States, who had been taken over with all the rights given to them by the different State Acts. In some' States certain employees of the Department were not public servants, but had been appointed under State Defence Acts, although previously they had frequently held clerical positions in the State Defence Departments. Then there was another class, semi-military, which had been appointed under the various State BILL. Defence Acts. As the result of the transfer of State officers and other .appointments to the Defence Department, there are on the civil side of' the Department no less than three different classes of employees. This Bill is introduced to overcome that difficulty. It is not an amendment of the Defence Act ; it is a separate measure dealing with a special subject, and it w i ll come into force by proclamation, and continue in force for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards. Its object is to abolish divided control, and to bring under one set of regulations all persons employed in a civil capacity in the Defence Department. When the Act expires twelve months after the war no officer's rights will be affected. Length the of service under this measure will stand to the credit of the officer just as if he had all through been employed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and each officer whose services are no longer required by the Defence Department will go back to his former position.",38
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Will they carry their military rank with them?,38
151,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,They will have preserved to them all the rights they possessed at the time they came under the provisions of this Bill . No one will suffer by reason of coming under them.,38
152,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Capricornia) [2.6] It has always seemed to me an anomaly bhat the employees in the Public Service should be under separate control. Public Service Act was passed in order to make it impossible for members of Parliament or Ministers to place their supporters in positions in the Commonwealth Service, the desire being to remove political influence as far as possible from the making of appointments to the Service. Certain examinations are provided for, which, I suppose, are a very good test of ability. We all agree, probably, that it is a good thing that it is not possible for a member of parliament to get his friends or supporters into the Public Service. Some of us are rather pleased to be relieved of - the many applications which came to us before the Public Service Act was passed.",39
153,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Member s of Parliament might as well use the influence as head officials.,39
154,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I was coming to that point. The whole position in regard to Commonwealth employees in the Public Service or in the Defence Department is unsatisfactory, and some Government should evolve a better method of testing the efficiency of applicants. I do not know that we can substitute anything that will absolutely do away' with the educational tests. At present we demand that an applicant for employment shall pass some literary examination, be able to write in a legible hand, and work certain sums in arithmetic, and know the*history of the British Empire from the eighteenth century to the present time, more especially with regard to Australia. do not think it can be held that it is the best test that could be devised. It might be supplemented in some way. We have all had experience of people possessing most remarkable memories; persons who can memorise dates and facts; but at the same time they may have absolutely no initiative. That is why it seems to me that something is required to supplement the educational test. We might have something like the test which is applied in regard to students who wish to enter the Naval College. In addition to an educational test there, they are also compelled to go before a committee, which has a conversation with them. Mr MCWILLI|AMS - That is the old English system.",39
155,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I know that many lads fail in literary - examinations through nervousness. Their brains seem to stop working^through the fear that they may The not pass. We ought to avoid tests of that character. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has mentioned a serious matter. We have abolished political influence in regard to appointments to the Commonwealth Public Service. Mv. MCWILLIAMS - Hav e we?,39
156,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I believe that we have done it to a large extent. But has there not grown up a social influence which takes the place of political in fluence? I do not wish to make any lengthy criticism of the Public Service.,39
157,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,It is too big a question to discuss at this stage. ',39
158,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It is.. Therefore I will not go into the matter. At some other time we sbould discuss the whole question of the Civil Service, because it is growing to enormous proportions, and there are many difficulties in connection with administering it .",39
159,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Melbourne Ports) [2.11] - In my opinion, the wearing of military uniforms by men holding clerical positions in the Defence Department should cease. It is a farce. We have heard the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) speaking in reference to the hundreds of civilians being employed at Horseferry-road who are posing as soldiers when they are not; but if we go to the Victoria Barracks we°.can see there also a large ' staff of clerks wearing military uniforms. If it were not for the seriousness of the I military situation, it would be a matter for ridicule. There are men employed at the barracks who cannot even do the goose-step, and know nothing whatever about military matters, yet they are lieutenants, captains, majors, and colonels. The Government ought to consider that question.",39
160,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Yes , I shall go into that matter.",39
161,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I can quite under-, stand a returned soldier who is given a position in the Defence Department being allowed to wear his uniform ; but when others who are not really soldiers are permitted to wear uniforms the whole position is likely to become one for ridicule. Perhaps the matter appeals to me more than it may appeal to others, but I was - reared in the A r m y, and I know that when I was in the Old Country civilian clerks there did not wear uniforms. I am pleased to see the reforms that the Bill proposes to bring about, but I wish to enlarge upon the matter referred to by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). No one can claim that the present system of Public Service examinations is perfect. In my opinion, it is very imperfect. I did not get much chance of securing an education, seeing that I commenced work when I was eleven years and four months old, but I have no nerves, and before I left school I beat boys in examinations wno were miles ahead of me in knowledge. I have seen the same thing right throughout life. 1, knew one man who had passed his third year i u medicine, bu t was unable to pass his fourth. Y e the was able to coach others through their degrees. men who studied under him recognised the great talents that he possessed, and they could not understand how it was that he 'should fai l to get his degree; bu t the trouble was absolutely nervousness on his part. Then there is the matter of luck. By a peculiar set of circumstances a man may during the course of an examination be called upon to supply answers to the very matters upon which he has concentrated his studies. I think that an examiner should be allowed to pick up a candidate's papers, and, irrespective of the errors in them, judge whether they display ability or not. The honourable member for Capricornia has said that there are people who can memorise anything, but they only memorise for the time being.",39
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,M o s t of the exadopted. aminers give consideration nowadays to what they call general knowledge.,40
163,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I do not think that pare they are permitted to do so. I brought forward this question when I first entered this House twelve years ago. Another a first time. point worthy of consideration is as to the unwisdom of allotting marks for handwriting in connection with an examination. A candidate's handwriting should' either be passed or failed. Handwriting is largely a matter of personal judgment of the examiner. On one occasion Adelaide University Professor who was acting as examiner clearly adopted a cerexplained tain style as being the best, although another examiner might have adopted a totally different style as worthy of the maximum number of marks. During the last thirty years I have known many young men and women to fail at an examination owing to sheer nervousness. I hope the Government will take these two points into consideration-that they will do away with the wearing of military uniforms by military clerks and improve the examination system so that it will result in the selection of the best qualified candidates.

I wish to supplement my previous statement by informing the House that the evaporation of apples is being carried on, not only in Tasmania, but in other States. There are three evaporating establishments in Tasmania, three in South Australia, and five in Victoria. The hounty is to he given, the bounty? not to the evaporators, but to the growers who supply the fruit to them, and the Bill provides for a total payment of £12,000 in respect of the whole Commonwealth. That amount represents practically a bonus of 10 per cent, on 300 tons of evaporated apples, at 7d. per lb., which the Imperial Government have purchased from the Commonwealth.",40
166,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Capricornia) [2.24] Our experience of some of the bounties granted by the Commonwealth has not been a very happy one. The bounty on wool tops, for instance, has not had the effect we believed it would have. employees in that industry seem to have derived no benefit from it. They are expected to work long hours, to work at night .time, and, in some cases, seven days a week. I do not think, however, that our unhappy experience in connection with the bounty on wool tops is a good reason why we should oppose the proposal to pay a bounty in this case ",41
167,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Labou r conditions are provided for in this case.,41
168,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I shall not oppose the payment of this bounty as such, but I take exception to the method by which it is proposed to be administered. All who have regard for the man on the land must sympathize with the orchardist. I have frequently known of cases where the whole .results of a fruit-grower's labour have* been swept away ih a single night. A terrific storm may destroy all his crop; his prospects may be ruined by too heavy a rainfall, or he may suffer because of an inadequate rainfall. Those of us who desire to do justice throughout the Commonwealth must sympathize with the fruit-grower, and endeavour to make his lot as pleasant as it is possible for legisafter year. lation to make it. That being so, I do not oppose this bounty as a bounty. When this question was previously under consideration, however, I asked the Minister whether the fruit-growers themselves would receive the bounty.",41
169,Mr JENSEX,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,They will.,41
170,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"If they do, will a proportionate reduction be made in the price paid to growers for the apples?",41

172,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Co-operatio n will alone. secure what is desired.,41
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Some of the evaporating factories are owned by orehardists.,41
174,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Co-operation , to my mind, affords the best way of helping the man on the land. I would go so far as to say that, where necessary, fruit growers should be assisted by the Government to find the requisite capital for the erection of the evaporation plants and machinery.",41
175,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Eac h State Govern The ment ought to do that.,41
176,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Eithe r the Commonwealth or the State Governments should subsidize fruit-growers where they are too poor to find the capital to establish evaporating works for themselves Miv FALKINER - The honourable member's Government granted a bonus to middlemen to make wool tops ,41
177,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The honourable member could not have been present when I said that our experience in that regard had been most unhappy. It is true that our Government agreed to the payment of a bounty on wool tops, but we were induced to do so upon the representations of certain people. We were led to believe, that the payment of the bounty would give employment to a large number of skilled operatives; .but, after the bounty had become law, we found that all the employees required in the indus in his prospectus, a few girls to work machinery that was so nearly automatic that it would almost work itself.",41
178,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,But the Labour Government continued the bounty year,41
179,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Tim e will not permit of my going into that inatter this afternoon. Granted that we did pay the bounty for years, the honourable member will also admit that Ave stopped it in 1915, when the Inter-State Commission recommended that it should not be continued. Our experience in that regard should make us careful. If ever the man on the land and the general public are to remove the extraordinary discrepancies now prevailing in society, they will have to adopt, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has said, some for m of co-operation. The co-operation which has proved very successful in the dairying industry and made it permanent materializes in a number of butter factories in which the dairy farmers themselves are interested. In those places in Queensland in which the sugar grower is also the shareholder in the sugar mill, the results of his labours are far higher than where the grower has to sell the product of his labour to a private companyowned mill. I understand that the capital for one of the principal evaporators is to be supplied by Mr Henry Jones, a very clever and far-seeing business man.",41
180,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,He has only one out of the eight or nine evaporators in Australia.,42
181,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I understand that he is one of the prime movers in this matter, and we know that he is not in business for pleasure, but to make money.",42
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,That 9ome guarantee that the industry will be a success.,42
183,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It may be. We should not take any exception to any man aspiring to manage a large business and get control of a vast amount oE capital, but we should insure that in doing so he has not the assistance of the Government. We should not grant a bounty which will find its way mainly into the pockets of Mr . Henry Jones.",42
184,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The bounty is only for the growers, and will last only during the current year.",42
185,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Minister has said that, but I propose to show that that is not so.",42
186,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Look at clause 7.,42
187,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I observe that clause 7 says that no person shall obtain payment of any bounty by means of any false or misleading statement. But that will not protect the grower and insure that the bounty will go only to growers. I do not think there will be any advantage to the fruit-growers of Tasmania .or any other State, except in a very remote degree, if the principles of the Bill in its present form are made law.",42
188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,This bounty will be the salvation of' scores of small growers. [225],42
189,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Nobod y will get the bounty from me unless he is a grower.,42
190,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I shall be interested if the Minister can prove that the Bill insures that that will be the destination of the bounty.,42
191,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The price is very .low, and the man who picks the, apples will get all this money.",42
192,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Bill means that the grower will receive for his apples ls. 9d. per bushel, plus the bounty, and it will simply enable scores of them to , carry on t ill next year.",42
193,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Minister has handed me a letter received by him, and has suggested that I should read it to the CommitteeNorthern Evaporating Co. Ltd., Town Point, Launceston, 27th March, 1918. I note that this is a limited company, the liability of the shareholders being limited to the amount of their shares. Who are the shareholders? A r e they growers or are they capitalists who have may be invested in evaporators ?",42
194,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I cannot say. That is the letter received by me as a grower.,42
195,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The letter reads Dear Sir,-Owing to the British Government's decision not to pay for their evaporated fruit until two months after consignments have been landed in England-and the uncertainty of when it may be possible to obtain shipping space-the Federal Government have agreed to advance a portion of the money to finance the scheme, for which they will charge 6 per cent, interest. The obligation to pay this interest for an indefinite period compels the exaporating factories to modify their scheme of payment to the growersThat indicates that the growers are not the shareholdersand they submit the following three alternatives, and 1"" shall be glad if you will state, nt your earliest convenience, upon which terms you desire to be paid(n) A payment of ls. ,9d. per bushel of 50 lbs. on delivery, or when the tickets are presented, plus bonus to be paid when received; or (b) A payment of 2s. per bushel of 50 lbs. on delivery, or when tickets are presented, bonus to"" be retained by the factory; or (c) Sixty-five per cent, of 2s., and the bnlnnce when the money has beeu paid over, less grower's share of expenses. Yours faithfully, C. G"" BUKCHAM, Manager.",42
196,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,That letter shows that the scheme is on a genuine basis.,42
197,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It does not meet my contention that the bounty is not positively certain to go into the pockets of the growers. The bounty may be paid to the evaporator, who may not be a grower, but merely a capitalist who has invested money in evaporating plant.",43
198,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The Bill says that the bounty shall be payable to - the grower only.,43
199,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"""When the Miuister was moving the second reading of the Bill, I asked him if the growers would get the bounty, and he replied that the whole of it would go to 'the growers in the States interested, and not to the evaporators.",43
200,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I say that again.,43
201,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Clause 5 providesThe owner, occupier, or lessee of any land on which the apples were grown, or factory which they were evaporated, or in which they , have undergone any process, shall, unless the Minister in writing otherwise directs, be deemed to be employed in the growing ' or evaporation of the apples. The evaporator need not have an orchard at ali, but, unless the Minister otherwise directs, he shall be deemed to be a grower.",43
202,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Every grower, before he gets .the bounty, must make a declaration, and I must be satisfied that he is a jjenuine grower.",43
203,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Then why does the Minister ask for power, in clause 5, to declare the evaporator a grower?",43
204,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"In many cases these apples have been evaporated, and considerable advances have been made upon them by the evaporating companies. Fruit could not be kept till now before being evaporated, and, therefore, a great portion of the work is already done.",43
205,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Nearly all evaporators have shut down by now.,43
206,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Then the bounty is to be given to the evaporators. vernment cannot shut their eyes to the experience in connection with the bounty for the sugar industry in Queensland. This Parliament had to make a law that the signature of. the _ grower should be given before the bounty was paid, because the money was finding its way into the pockets of people whom Parliament never intended to benefit.",43
207,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,That is correct.,43
208,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The same thing will happen in regard to the apple bounty less we demand that the grower shall get the money and that his signature must be received before the bounty is paid.,43
209,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,r-The letter which the honourable member has read shows that the evaporating company is prepared to pay the bonus to the grower in advance.,43
210,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"That may be; but in the case of the sugar .bounty .we know that the.money was intercepted, and that the grower never received it.",43
211,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Neithe r did the dairy farmer get the Victorian butter bonus. The middleman received it.,43
212,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Government ought to see that sub-clause 2 of clause 3 means what it says, namely, that "" The bounty shall be payable to the growers of the apples only."" If we agree to clause 5, which gives the Minister power to hand in the bounty over to Henry Jones, or .to some other evaporator, effect will not be given to the intention of Parliament ",43
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The evaporating plants are almost entirely owned by small men or little companies of the growers.,43
214,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I heard that He n r y Jones was interested, and the Minister has said that he is interested in only one evaporating plant.",43
215,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,".That is right; he is interested in one plant. Supposing that the evaporating firm advances the 10 per cent, to a grower who is very much in need of money. If that grower makes a declaration that he has already received the bonus from the factory, there can be no harm in my paying the bo'unty to the factory if I am satisfied that the grower has already received it in advance.",43
216,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"If the evaporator produces documentary evidence that he has the paid the bounty to the fruit-grower, that may be satisfactory.",43
217,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I assure the hon The Go- orable member that he is no more anxious to protect the grower than I am.,43
218,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"We know from past experience that the only way to protect the grower is to pay the bounty direct to him, and to get his signature before the money is paid, otherwise the bonus may be diverted - to persons interested in evaporaitors, who may not' be growers at all, but have taken advantage of the unfortunate condition of the fruit-growers. According to the statement of the Minunister in moving the second reading, the fruit-growers are to receive ls. 6d. pei"" bushel for their apples. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has informed me that the average weight of a bushel of apples is about 40 lbs. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - It taikes 56 lbs. of apples to produce 6J lbs. of evaporated fruit, for which 7d. per lb. is to be given.",43
219,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It is proposed to give orehardists ls. 6d. for 40 lbs. of apples. Yet we hope to encourage fruit-growing, and to settle returned soldiers cm the land to, make homes for themselves and rear their families on the produce of orchards.",44
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"/The reason for the bounty is the lack of shipping facilities for the exportation of apples to Great Britain and to Sydney, in consequence of which the fruit is a drug on the Tasmanian market. Mr HUGGiS - Althoug h the growers will get less than $d. per lb. for the apples, these apples are sold in Melbourne for 4d. per lb., or a!bout 13s. 4d. per bushel. You will never have peace while such discrepancies exist.",44
221,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"T- A case of apples can be bought in Melbourne for 5s., delivered at the door.",44
222,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,iTh e wife of the average worker cannot afford to buy apples by the ease. Her wage-earner gets only about £3 per week.,44
223,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,About £2 week is the average wage of a worker.,44
224,Mr HIGGIS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,".The wife of the average worker cannot afford 5s. to lay out on a case of apples, and, if she did it, she would find that a case went too soon. I have three children, and it is surprising how soon a. case of apples disappears in my household. Consequently the ordinary housewife has to buy in small quantities at 4d. per lb. apples for which the grower gets less than ^d. per lb.",44
225,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The apples that will be evaporated will be nearly all second class apples. For first class apples the orchardist gets from 43. to 4s. 6d. per case.,44
226,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"On one occasion the late Sir Thomas Bent won his election at Brighton because, in appealing to his constituents, he said, "" Y o u talk about pensions in Victoria-pensions , and 200,000 to 300,000 Jonathan apples goiug at a couple of shillings the case!"" According to the Melbourne Age, the best Jonathans were recently selling here at 2s. 6d. per case, and were being put into cold - stores, to be sold later at 14s. per case. We wish to help the man on the land, but the fruit-growing industry will not prosper while growers get such small rates as are provided for in the Bill.",44
227,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"They cannot get more, because the Imperial Government will not give more than 7d. per lb. for evaporated apples.",44
228,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Then let us see, at least, that the bounty goes direct to the growers.",44
229,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"No evaporator wiho is not a grower will get any. bounty from me. ' Mr HIGGS - In that case, the Minister cannot object to the striking out of clause 5. ' Mr JENSEN - iTh e Acting Attorney General tells me that clause 5 must be read in conjunction with clause 4.",44
230,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"When a Judge is dealing with a case, it is useless for an advocate to quote the speeches of members of Parliament, or even of Ministers, as evidence of the intention of Parliament. The Judge will declare that it is the words of the Actbeautiful that must prevail. In the Bill as it stands it is provided that the bounty must bo paid to the grower; but another clause allows the Minister to pay it to the in a vestor.",44
231,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"iTh e Bill follows the form of all our bounty Acts. 12s. per Mr HIGGS-Then the Minister should not object to a clause or regulation requiring that before the bounty is paid, the grower shall sign, with his own signature, a receipt for it.",44
232,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I could not accept an amendment to that effect.,44
233,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I will riot oppose the giving of a bounty to fruit-growers to help to keep men on the land,- but I object to the payment of bounties to men who are merely investors. - Mr SINCLAIR (Moreton) [2.55] On two points the Bill is not satisfactory to me. We should be particularly careful in the matter of granting bounties. Almost invariably our bounties have been paid to the wrong people, and there is a good deal in the contention of the hon 1 orable member who has last spoken that the grower should be protected by the Bill. I hope that in Committee we may arrange for that. I regret that the Bill was not circulated a few days ago, so that we might have looked through it carefully - I took exception to the proposed bounty on wool tops,, on the score that it applied only to tops manufactured for export, pointing out that if we could build up the top industry in Australia, it would assist our local manufactures. have already expressed my approval of. the American advice in regard to food-. stuffs, "" E at what you Can, and can what you can't."" But our first consideration should be to our own people. no reason why the bounty should be confined to apples evaporated for export. Last year a deputation waited on the Minister asking him to permit the importation of 100,000' cases of apples. ""1 should think that evaporated apples would meet the requirements of persons in the. interior in places to which it is said the Australian apple will not carry.",44
234,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Why give the bounty only for the production of evaporated apples? Why not help the growers who cannot take advantage of evaporation methods ?,45
235,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,This is all that growers have asked for.,45
236,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"No doubt, the growers will sell as much ripe f r u i they can. In the large cities, where cost of distribution is not much, apples forma cheap and wholesome diet within the reach of the masses. Only .the other day I bought half a case for 2s. good seasons there is bound to be a large surplus, and we should be ready to assist in the disposal of this surplus.",45
237,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,I am ^prepared to sider the giving of a bounty for all evaporated apples; but the fruit-growers have not asked for such a bounty. This bounty is to haye effect for one year only.,45

The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) porating charges. has referred to the encouragement of cooperation amongst the growers; and our legislation we should keep that end steadily in view. Co-operation has been a great success in the case of butter, sulting in a steady supply, with benefit to both consumer and producer. operation in marketing would give 1 raliah people cheap f r u it aud insure ter prices to the producer. The economic apples quite suitable for the process. loss in the distribution of f r u it through waste and the middleman's charges, is something enormous, there being a difference of something like 200 per cent, between the return to the producer and I the price paid by the consumer. I do not know whether the arrangement in regard to theevaporation of apples will permit of co-operation being furthered by means of the Bill , but I hope that co-operative There is companies wall be encouraged in preference to those formed privately.",45

Through force of circumstances I am compelled to vote for this bonus, although my own belief is that, unless the grower is also the evaporator, he will not get the benefitof it.",45

241,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Minister may Jiave the best intentions, and the honour the able gentleman at present in charge knows as much about* the business as anybody i u Australia; but we must remember t as that business men adopt most peculiar the methods. In Victoria the grower is at the mercy of' everybody, and when evaporating companies come into existence he will be at their mercy. We may make In all sorts of arrangements as to the price to be paid to the grower, but we know that evaporating and other companies have a custom bf making advances, conand the interest charges will be so managed that not much of the bonus will reach the man on the land.",45
242,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,There will be no evaporation at all unless there is this bonus to make the business profitable.,45

Some time ago I was staying at a boardCoinghouse at Yarra Junction, and the Ausground all round a dozen apple trees betin the garden there was covered with I ask again, What inducement is offered to the evaporator other than ordinary business profits?",45

A large section of the men on the land are at the mercy of the storekeepers, ancl I am afraid that something of the kind may happen in the case of the fruit-growers and the evaporati n g companies. Of course, I know that the fruit-grower in a large way is well ab.le to look after himself; but, unfortunately, a large majority of those engaged iii growing fruit live from hand to mouth; indeed, that is one - of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.",46

But, as I say, all business men, whether German, British, Irish, or Scotch, are without conscience in business affairs, and insist on their pound of flesh. We must make sure that they get none of this bonus. Mr MCWir.i.iAsrs - Thos e who have induced the Government to introduce this Bill have done so wholly in the interests of the grower.",46
250,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Clause 5 of - the Bill affords sufficient ground for the apprehension I have expressed. That clause provides that the owner, occupier, or lessee Of any land on which the apples were grown, or the factory in which they were evaporated or have undergone any process, shall be deemed to be employed in the growing or evaporation of apples, unless the Minister, in writing, otherwise directs. In other words, a factory shall be deemed to be employed in the growing of apples.",46

On that I shall insist, and claim a vote, if necessary.",46
254,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Is there no provision in the Bill for that?,46
255,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Not to satisfy me. The arbitration proceedings may be protracted, and in the meantime the employers may pay what wages they like. We have had experience of this in connection with other bonuses, such as the iron bonus. At that time the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs, and provision was made in the Bill for a certain living wage; but this was declared by the High Court to be ultra vires. The Bill was held up pending some assurance in the matter of wages, and I remember that Mr Hoskins brought five representatives of the union to Melbourne, who urged us to pass the Bill, saying that they were strong enough to extract from the iron masters the wages and conditions desired. In our. innocence we passed the Bill ; and, when trouble arose in the industry, those same unionists asked the - Minister not to pay the bonus, because the iron was' being turned out with "" scab "" labour. As a matter of fact, the employers had outwitted the men, and they succeeded in obtaining the bonus, irrespective of any labour conditions. It will be seen, therefore, how necessary it is to take every precaution in the present case.",46
256,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The whole of the labour covered by this Bill has already been provided for.,46
257,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Then it is a retrospective Bill, and we are going to pay a bonus irrespective of what wages have been paid.",46
258,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,Nearl y every grower does his own work.,46
259,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"In Victoria there are hundreds of men who go fruit-picking. I know very well that the fruitgrower, as a rule, is not able to pay big wages, and I look to this bonus to assist him in that direction. We also know that amongst fruit-growers are a number of grasping individuals who always pay as little as possible to the meu they employ. The great fruit-growers of Renmark and Mildura had to be forced by the Courts to pay a fair wage, though theirs is one of the most highly protected industries in Australia. I admit that this Bill involves only the comparatively small amount of £12,000.",46
260,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"It is only for one year, and the lahour is all gone now. The evaporators are closing down.",47
261,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I cannot make out why the Government have delayed so long with a measure of so much imwould portance. We are now right into winter, and I , in an interjection, asked the Minister whether he really thought could pass the Bill today.. I can quite understand his anxiety to do so, because the work it covers has already been done.. My great desire is that the grower shall get the bonus, because I believe that, to the present, certain men, who are dong the evaporating work, have adcent, vanced money to those on the land, and for that will charge them through nose.",47
262,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"Many of the evaporators have only paid the growers for the fruit, and have nothing to do with the bonus.",47
263,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,But clause 5 provision vides that evaporators shall be regarded as growers under the Bill.,47
264,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,The Attorney-General advises me that that clause is necessary because of the Sugar Bounty Act. You must read clause 5 in conjuuctiou with clause 4. I assure the honourable member able upon(1) bhat the bounty will be given to the grower only under my hand.,47
265,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I am willing to August, give the fruit growers of Australia this £12,000,- because I think they deserve this year; but, at the same time, it is my duty to point out the difficulties presented movein the Bill. It will be no use asking me next year to vote for a re-enactment of the bonus, unless wages conditions attached. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title). Mr .JENSEN (Bass-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.14] - Next _ year, if, as is the case this year, there* is shipping space provided, for fruit to land, it will be necessary to re-enact this measure. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has waited on me, and pointed out the necessity there is for a bounty on dried vegetables. I am prepared to consider that, and also agree with the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) that we should endeavour to make provision for evaporating frui t and vegetables for inland consumption, obviating the necessity for importing frui t from America during several months of the year. It is a matter which I am prepared to take into consideration next year/ However, I like to have this Bill passed as it the is printed. It is only to operate for twelve months, and the evaporating for he the year is now nearly completed. When the fruit-growers, who were deprived of their export market, waited on th* Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), he promised to consider whether assistance up could not be given to bhem by the payment of a small bonus of 10. per on 300 tons of evaporated apples, purchased by England. I hope that the the Committee will not adopt wiiat is proposed by the honourable member for Capricornia and Melbourne Ports, because the Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom) has assured me that the proin clause 5 is absolutely necessary. In every instance the growers will get the bounty. Clause agreed to. Clause 2 agreed to. Clause 3The bounty under this Act sball be paythe export from Australia of apples grown and evaporated in Australia and sold to the Imperial Government for delivery between the 1st day of April and the 31st day of 1918.

There are two dangers in connection with the export of evaporated apples. If we. cannot get the fruit away the bounty will lapse, and this may, perhaps, put the grower in a worse position than if no we allowed the bounty to apply to AusEngtralian consumed evauorated apples also.",47
267,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"I submit that the amendment is not in order, because the appropriation agreed to is for a bounty on the export of evaporated apples.",47

I protest against the Government bringing down this Bill at such a late stage and expecting it to be passed simply with, their assurance that it is all right. It is not all right.",48
272,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,It was f u l ly explained last week.,48
273,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"But it was not accurately explained^. The Minister told me that the grower only was to get the bounty, but now he produces a Bill by which he will be enabled to pay it to the evaporator.",48

275,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FOR,"The Minister is a good business m a n; he understands business and the English language; he knows what a grower is, and he knows what an evaporator is. The Acting Attorney-General has just drawn my attention to section 4 of the Sugar Bounty Act 1905-10, which contains the following provision: The occupier and the lessee of any plantation on which any sugar-cane or beet is produced shall be deemed to have been employed in the production of all sugar-cane or beet produced thereon. The clause I propose to amend will exactly follow the lines of that provision.

There is no reference in the Sugar Bounty Act to the owner of any factory in which sugar cane is turned into sugar receiving a bounty. If there were a jprovision in that Act providing that the owners of a raw sugar mill should get a proportion of the sugar bounty, the honourable member might be right in contending that the clause in this Bill is a similar provision to that to which he has drawn my attention in the Sugar Bounty Act ; but the two provisions differ, because in the* clause of this Bill we have words introduced enabling the bonus to be extended to the evaporator or any other person who owns it in next a factory in which apples are evaporated, or in which they have undergone any process. We are most anxious to help the fruit-grower of Tasmania or of any other part of Australia. The attitude of honourable members on this side of the chamber supports that contention, but we are not prepared to [provide the Government with money so that they may present it to a gentleman - whose interest it has been to spend some of his capital in these evaporating plants and who pays the f r u it growers ls. 6d. per bushel for the apples which they grow in their orchards.",48

I am rather surprised that he should have done so in to the view of his intimate knowledge of the Bounty Act. Clause 3 declares that the bounty is to be payable to the growers of apples only. In the Sugar Bounty Aet it is declared that the bounty is to be paid to every grower of 'whitegrown cane or beet, and in clause 4 of thisB ill it is set out that this bounty shall be payable only in inspect of evaporated 'apples which "" have been grown and evaporated by white labour only."" If the honourable member's amendment be agreed to, the white-labour conditions of the clause will be destroyed. All previous measures of the kind contain a clause the same as that to which the honourable member is now taking exception.",48

The Assistant Attorney-General (Mr Groom) declares that the clause is necessary as it stands, and that since it is stated in clause 2 that the bounty shall be payable only to the grower of the apples, clause 5 is not in any way contradictory. I would point out to. him what he, as a lawyer, must know-that , although clause 2 provides that the grower alone shall receive the bounty, if a subsequent clause declares, as this does, that an evaporator shall be considered to be a grower, then such a person may claim the money.

I again take the opportunity of thanking honourable members foT their hearty cooperation during the past week. The Government felt that it was advisable to close the session at this time, because of the problems that are pressing for solution. As honourable members on both sides are well aware, Ministers are severely handicapped in administrative work when the House is sitting continuously. The course we have adopted was not prompted by any desire to escape into recess, as some honourable members have implied, for there is no holiday ahead of Ministers. The Government desire, as far as the administrative work will permit, to co-operate with honourable members of the House in recruiting work throughout the various constituencies during the early part of recess. As far as they are able to do so, Ministers will visit different portions of the Commonwealth, because the news we are getting every day justifies the belief that Australia must do its duty in the war till the very end. Apparently,, the German offensive is still making progress. No encouragement is derived from a study of the military outlook, but we feel that the heart of Australia is just as sound today, if it perly appealed to, as when we first entered the war. Happily, we have 'been able during the last few weeks to banish some of the asperities from the political arena, and I pay my due tribute to honourable members opposite because of that. The Governmenit have tried to encourage a better spirit than, unfortunately, has prevailed during the last eighteen months, and I hope that when we meet again we shall be able to promote harmony to a still further degree. We have tried to show in spirit, as far as was possible, the consideration promised by the Prime Minister and his colleagues at the Governor General's Conference, and in that spirit we go into recess, hoping that the cooperation which has been established in the House will continue outside in connection ROMAN with recruiting and the other important national work that calls for attention.",51
294,Mr BAMFORD,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Herbert) [4.40] The Acting Prime Minister, in referring to the sale of our wool to the Imperial Government, said that possibly some of the wool would reach other destinations than England. The inference is that some of it may go to Japan or other Eastern countries. Some time ago the Chamber of Commerce at Townsville, acting in behalf of the wool-growers in the hinterland, appealed to the Government to make that port a place of appraisement. Townsville is the fourth port of the Commonwealth in respect to the yalue of its exports, and the people' there think that ships travelling to the Orient from that port might take wool, and save the grower the expense of sending it to some other place of appraisement, such as Brisbane or Sydney, and then shipping it to the East. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to take the matter into consideration, and to suggest to the Wool Committee that wool be shipped direct from Townsville to the Eaist, thus saving' a double journey and freights.",51
295,Mr SINCLAIR,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Moreton) [4.42] - I congratulate the Government on slipping so easily into recess. I had fully made up my mind to test the feeling of the House in regard to the matter of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors by moving an amendment on the motion for the special adjournment. As, however, fully half of the honourable members of be prothe Chamber had already left for their homes, it was futile for me to do so. But I assure the Government that I shall take the earliest opportunity of asking the House to vote on that subject. It is our duty to do all we can to get reinforcements for the men at the Front, and, even at personal sacrifice, to insure that when they are recruited we shall get the most efficient service from the men, and also safeguard their interests when they return.",51
296,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Capricornia) [4.44] - I never found greater difficulty in speaking to a motion tlian I do now, because the Leader or Acting Leader of the Opposition is liable to be misunderstood if he responds to the amiable expressions of the Leader of the Government. The duty of an Opposition Leader is to endeavour to destroy the Government, in the belief that the Government cannot possibly do any good; that no good can come out of Nazareth. I find myself in a difficulty. If I agree with the Acting Prime M i nister, and accept his compliments for liaving endeavoured to create harmony where discord formerly prevailed, the Opposition may lose votes from two quarters. When we appeal to the electors they may ask, "" Why should we make a change, when you have such a good opinion of the Government?"" and our more enthusiastic supporters may say, "" You cannot be sincere, because you have not attacked the Government on every possible occasion, giving them no quarter."" MrBRENNAN - A member's natural amiability must be allowed for by the constituencies.",51
297,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"A speech like that of the Acting Prime Minister is in the nature"" of the hand-shake, which is the preliminary to a boxing 'contest, and means, I suppose, that the men intend to - fight fairly, and bear each other no personal malice.",52
298,Mr BAMFORD,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,I have seen boxers kiss in the ring.,52
299,Mr HIGGS,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"The country would be amused, and possibly edified, if the Acting Prime Minister and myself were to f all on each other's necks and kiss. However, I reciprocate the sentiments that he , has uttered. Greater harmony has prevailed. I do not think that there was any occasion for the discord that preceded it . The Government has not done what we think it should have done. I say that without desiring to create angry feeling. It is not the duty of an Opposition to instruct Ministers as to what they should do. Our duty is to tell the"" Government what it should not do. But in the goodness of heart which characterizes those on this side, we are prepared to give the Government a few hints. I agree with the Acting Prime Minister that there is no recess for Ministers: they work nearly as hard when Parliament is not sitting as when it is sitting. That is especially true of' the Treasurer, upon whose shoulders a tremendously heavy burden will sit during the continuance of the war. In his dual capacity of Acting Prime M in ister and Treasurer, the honourable member for Balaclava will have a very great deal to do, and he is entitled to the fairest criticism from opponents. I am of opinion that the Government are making a mistake i u regard to the fixing of the prices of meat. Ministers must endeavour to reduce the cost of living to the consumers, beariug in mind their duty to the dependants of the soldiers. It is for the Government also to make the rich bear their due share of taxation. I might enlarge on these matters, but if the Acting Prime Minister wishes for further advice, and will drop me a line, I shall be happy to reply to him freely. On behalf of t i e Opposition, I thank the honourable gentleman for his amiable expressions, and I hope .that honourable members opposite, as well as those on this' side, may live long and die happy.  mending the Government for their advance to the farmers, I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister, however, to take into consideration the advisability of making the first instalment larger. The proposal is to pay 3s. now, and to keep back ls. indefinitely; possibly for.on e year, possibly for three. The instalment of 3s. will all be needed to pay expenses; it is the last shilling that will go to the farmer himself. Therefore I urge the Acting Prime Minister during the recess to consider whether, to meet the case of the necessitous farmer and the man who is farming on the share system, a scheme cannot be devised whereby negotiable certificates may be issued for the second payment. A needy man could then go to the Commonwealth Bank and discount his certificates, while a wealthy man would put them in his safe until the payment which they represented became due. This arrangement would not cost the country much, and would relieve many farmers considerably. At a conference of farmers which I attended, at which there were about 500 representatives, the conclusion was come to that the cost of producing a bushel of wheat, was, at the present time, from 3s. lOd. tq 4s. a' bushel. I know that the Acting Prime Minister will do what I ask, if it can be done, and I'hope that he will'be able to treat the suggestion favourably.",52
300,Mr BRENNAN,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Batman) [4.53] The Leader of the Labour party having replied to the Leader of the Goveniment, and the Leader of the Country party haying also contributed to the debate, it may not be unbecoming for the unworthy but. aspiring Leader of the Peacemakers to supplement the discussion. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider a inatter . that has been brought under, my notice within the last few days. testants. I am glad to hear that within the last few weeks the censorship has been administrance tered with more wisdom and moderation than characterized it formerly. learned a day or two ago that a raid had been made on the office of the Labour Call- I think on Friday night of last termsweek-durin g which the premises had been searched and certain papers and have printed pamphlets taken away. raiders were not content to take copies these pamphlets, but in many cases took knew the sole remaining copy from the editor's table, the use of which he claimed for his special purposes and protection. pamphlet which the military officer and similar the civil police were particularly eager to truth. obtain was a peace pamphlet circulated during the recent Flinders election camsioners paign. I have the pamphlet here, but do but not intend to read it for reproduction i Hansard. If the raid and seizure of the pamphlet are intended as the preliminary to a prosecution, I urge the Acting on Prime Minister, in all fairness, to rememcomed; ber that the election is a thing of the past ; that the candidate of his party was returned by a handsome majority; and passed that the pamphlet can no longer have any influence. I hope that this sudden attack - this ex post facto raid on the Labour CaU-doe s not mean that during recess there will be a recrudescence of what we consider the unfair administrawrote tion of the censorship. I hope, too, that the Acting Prime Minister, in his enas deavour to be just, will try also to be generous. W it h some reluctance-bu t I say quite been made known to some. candidly-fro m a sense of duty, I desire it to bring another matter before the House. In courtesy I informed the honourable  afternoon that I proposed to speak on this partment subject on the motion for the adjournwere ment, but he replied that he regretted found that he could not wait to hear my reof marks, because he was anxious'to catch of his train. I refer to the matter to do justice, to. a large section, of the comcurious, Ur. Brett-nan. munity in which. I , for reasons well known to honourable members, take a personal interest. It was reported in the Argus of 26th March, 1918, that Mr . Palmer had said at a public meeting thatUnderhand methods were being employed by which Roman Catholic lads found entrance tb the Public Service over the heads of ProThere should be an inquiry as to whether the questions to be answered in enexaminations were made known previously to auy section of the candidates. But I Next day a letter from an anonymous correspondent, signing himself "" B .

The onus is undoubtedly him, and if he can make out a good prima facie case an inquiry would be ardently weleven if it only disproved such attacks on those public servants who are Catholics, and who by no other means than their ability the entrance examination for the Pub and having made a public statement affecting: public interests, it would become him to either point to a single instance in which his statethe ment is correct or withdraw it.  on the 27th MarchSir,- "" B.H."" is quite justified in asking me a public man to substantiate my statement that an unfair advantage is given to some candidates for admission to the Civil Service over others, inasmuch as the actual questions have In t.he speech made by me nt South Melbourne I referred to not as a fact, but as a'rumour, so generally believed that' it justified an inquiry ns to ijs truth. I will now go further and' justify my by referring to an incident which happened a few months ago in the Defence Deat Melbourne. Clerical examinations being held by that Department. It waft on examining results thnt. the students one college, the principal of which is one the party to which I referred, obtained nn extremely high percentage of marks. It so surprised: the examiners that they became as to the possibility of the question* having been divulged. At the next examination the precaution was taken' immediately before it to alter some of the questions. result was that the candidates from the particular college referred to failed miserably in the amended questions, but as heretofore easily and correctly answered the original questions. These statements struck me as so serious in their character as to demand some investigation by a member of this Parliament, affecting, as they do, part of our examinationsystem, and reflecting in the gravest manner on a certain educational institution. That institution may, perhaps, not be known individually to honourable members, but, nevertheless, it is well knoAvn, and was referred to by Mr. Palmer and a large number of persons outside. In those circumstances, I addressed a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence (Mr. Wise) as follows:' 1. Is it a fact that in the course of clerical examinations held by the Defence Department within the last few months it was found that the students of one college in particular obtained an extremely high percentage of marks ? 2. Is it a fact that at the next or other subsequent examination precaution was taken immediately before it to alter some of the ? uestions, with the result that the candidates rom the particular college referred to failed in the amended questions, but as theretofore easily and correctly answered the original questions ? That question was asked on Thursday, 11th April, and an answer was submitted me to the effect-^ An examination of candidates for - appointment as Military Staff Clerks was held on the 7th, 8th, and Oth March, 1918, the complete results - of which have not yet been received from the examiners. Can further particulars be made available to enable the matter to be investigated ? Is u b m it t e d another question in s i m i l a r t e r m sHas the Minister any knowledge or corroboration of the following statement referring to the Defence Department, and made by a correspondent in the Melbourne Argus of the 28th March last? Then I quoted the terms of the speech reported to have been delivered by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Palmer). The Assistant Minister has, I believe, set about, in a perfectly candid spirit, to have inquiry made, but, nevertheless, on Thursday, 3rd May, I was constrained to ask him- ' When may I expect some information about the important matter of the alleged improper practice in connection with the examination [227 ] for the Federal Public Service, about which I asked a question, without notice, a week ago? The The reply was",52
301,Mr WISE,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"I shall endeavour to get the information by Wednesday next. A l it t l e later on I received the answerThe matter received immediate attention, and is at present the subject of inquiry. In quiries are not yet complete, but a reply will be given to the honourable member as soon as I am in a position to do so. This shows that I was determined to pursue this inquiry until I obtained a satisfactory answer. It shows, also, that the Minister busied himself to obtain all the information he possibly could on the subject. On Thursday. 23rd May, I saidAbout three weeks ago I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence a question relating to Public Service examinations. Seeing that the question involves the honour of a member of this House, as well as the purity of the examination system, will the honourable gentleman, without further delay, supply an answer?",54
302,Mr WISE,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Inquiries are being made, and I told the honourable member yesterday that I thought I would be in a position to give a reply today. I shall obtain the information as quickly as possible. The answer-if not in due time-cam e eventuallyInquiry has been made by a special officer. deputed by the Minister, but no corroboration of the statements referred to in the press has been obtained. The only thing at all bearing on the matter has reference to a simple departmental educational test of candidates for casual employment, in which, however, no educational college or institution is in any way involved. In regard to this test, it was thought that the continued use. of the same papers would lead to applicants acquiring a knowledge of the questions put, and the questions were suddenly changed, with the result that one applicant showed he must have had prior knowledge of them, probably derived from one who had already undergone the test. The passing of this test did not insure employment in the Department, but merely served to give some indication as to whether the applicant had any educational qualifications to warrant consideration for employment. It is understood that another Department has held an examination at a business college recently, and the Minister has referred the papers showing the result of his inquiry to that Department for their information. It would appear from this that the statements made by the honourable member for Echuca, on the face of them, from the knowledge we have of our examination system, and for other reasons scarcely credible, have now been proved to be wholly unfounded This is a finding upon which I think honourable members on both sides of the House may well congratulate themselves. I can scarcely conceive of any honourable member subscribing to the view that an unf a i r advantage is given to any sectio.i of the community in the examinations for the Public Service, and certainly that any unfair advantage is given to any persons by reason of their religion. I thought it, d e to the persons involved in these damaging statements that the matter should be cleared up as far as possible. I am glad, therefore, to place on record a complete answer by the Minister showing that there is not a vestige or tittl e of t r u th in the allegation reflecting on a large section of the community and on a well-known educational institution. honourable member should now withdraw his charges, or attempt to make them good.",54
303,Mr CONSIDINE,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"Barrier) [5.5] This morning I asked the Acting Prime Minister a question as to whether undue influence was being used on the students in the Sydney University who refused to sign a statement that they would join a company that is being formed in connection with the Australian Imperial Porce. The question was in the following terms: 1. Is it a fact that methods of intimidation are being employed at the Sydney University to induce student's of various faculties to sign promises that they will enlist in any capacity in the A.I.F. in connection with a proposal to raise a company of men from that University? 2. If so, will the Federal Government ask the Government of New South Wales to bring pressure to bear on the University Senate to prevent intimidation or consequent victimization in connection with the examination of those students who oppose the movement? The Acting Prime Minister was then unable to answer the question, but he has since courteously communicated with Sydney, and has now handed me the following:The Minister for Defence has no knowledge of the employment of any methods of intimidation to induce students at the"" Sydney University to sign promises that they will enlist in the A.I.F. The Department for Defence has very recently been in touch with the authorities of the Sydney University in connection with the matter of the enlistment of medical students in the A.I.F., and the Minister is convinced that any such action would have been brought to his knowledge during the discussion of these - matters. It appears to me that the Acting Prime ""Minister, perhaps not intentionally, has - failed to answer the-second portion of the - question, namely, whether this was taking place, if not with the knowledge of the M i nister, with the knowledge of the University Senate.. I have been very credibly in formed that certain people are trying to induce some of the students to promise that they will j o in this company if it is formed. Those who have not done so have reason to believe that their refusal to sign will militate against them in the forthcoming examination; and I should like the Acting Prime Minister to consider that phase of the matter. He will himself know the best way to dissipate these fears of the students.",55

I shall take steps to have the attention of the New South Wales Government drawn to the matter, as they are the proper authority. As to the observations of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), I am not specially interested in the production of evidence concerning the allegations of my honourable friend the honourable mem the first I have heard of a raid oh the Labour Call office. I know nothing of the object of such a r a i d; probably it was in the discharge of the duties of the censorship. I can assure my honourable friend that in the recess, if we can call it a recess, there will be no recrudescence such as he referred to ; no action will be taken except what the Government feels is necessary for the maintenance of our war aims and the preservation of the country. As I told the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) in a recent letter, we cannot yield on things that seem vital to us in that respect; that will be the guiding principle actuating us throughout. The honourable member for Calare (Mr . Pigott) has asked the Government to reconsider the question of the wheat advance on the next crop. I have already given the remarks of the honourable member a good deal of consideration, and I do not see that the cure he suggests will remove the difficulties which face the Treasury. It would be very easy to issue 3s. and gave a certificate for the balance, which would be hypothecable at any bank; but that, of course, would mean financial stress on the bank or banks which do the business. It is far better for us to spread the liability .in our nary financial arrangements. If w felt that the needs.of the farming community required, and the capacity and resources of .the -'financial institutions would permit  would ask for the advance.",55
305,Mr WATT,HOUSING SCHEME FOR WORKMEN AND,"I know a great, number of farmers, and most of them think they are necessitous, and if money is'obtainable, they get it .  not pay the discount.",56
