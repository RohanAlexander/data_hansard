Mr DEAKIN - In continuation of pertain cablegrams, relating to the approaching visit of the American fleet, that I have already read to' the House, I now have pleasure in reading the material - parts of two others received and' one sent by x& in order that honourable members may be informed of the exact position at the present time. The first cablegram, dated 21st March, readsFleet will leave San Francisco 6th July, and sail for Melbourne vid Hawaii and Samoa', arriving about ist September. After stay of ten days fleet will proceed to Sydney, and'stay ten days. That was not made public before because, as I have stated, the proposed visit to Japan, and afterwards to New Zealand, was-mentioned after the receipt-of this message, and it appeared possible that these dates might be changed. It was undesirable to mention them until we were sure that no alteration would be made. A further cablegram has just been received from the Secretary of State for . the Colonies, stating that-*Arrival ut United States Fleet in Australia will not be affected by' visit to Japan. Armoured .cruisers will not-cross Pacific, but entire fleet, consisting probably of sixteen battle-ships, will visit Australia, probably divided into squadrons of eight each.

6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to give me of notice of his question, the answer to which On reading the statement referred to, I immediately cabled to London for precise information, and received ' a reply stating that it was considered the report was exaggerated, and that the re-shipment of meats referred to stocks withdrawn by the Admiralty. I have since heard from a reliable source that the re-shipment of the canned meats was caused by the British Government having resold surplus old stock at .a low price. The facts do not disclose PAPERS. any additional opening for Australian preserved meats*. NA - LONDON .

TELEPHONES : NOTICE OF DISCONTINU ANCE : ESSENDON TO KEIL OR LINEALLOWANCES TO QUEENSLAND RAIL NA POSTMASTERS. Mr JOSE PH COOK asked the Postmaster-General, upon.notice I. Has a new regulation been recently' issued requiring telephone subscribers to give three THOMSON) months' notice of their intention to discontinue the service? 2. Does this regulation say that in the. ab- "" sence of such notice three months' rental shall be paid? 3. Seeing that at least six months' rental must be paid in advance, does he not think it unfair to require this long notice of discontinuance ? 4. Is he aware that already this regulation is causing great trouble, annoyance, and loss - to subscribers ?",16
23,Mr MAUGER,WAY STATIONMASTERS ACTING AS,"The answers to the . enhonorable member's questions are as f o l low-:1. Not recently. The regulation referred to was issued in February, 1907. 2. No ; but this is implied. 3. No, because after a line has been rented for one year notice can be given at any time during the six months for which rent has. been paid, and if the period of notice expires before the end of the six months the difference in rental is refunded, rent being only charged up to the date of expiration of notice of discontinuance. 4. No. This is really extending the privilege and not curtailing it .  the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether a promise to erect a telephone line from Essendon to Keilor was made as far back as June, 1907? 2. Whether all the moneys required under the guarantee, & c , were paid on 16th September, 1907? 3. Whether in January, 1908, the Deputy , Postmaster-General, Melbourne, promised that the telephone would be completed in one week? 4. Is it a fact that the line has not yet been commenced ?. . Mr Mauger - Inquiries are being made, and 'answers will be furnished as early as possible.",17
24,Mr BOWD EN,WAY STATIONMASTERS ACTING AS,"for Colonel FOXTON) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that an allowance is made to Railway Station-masters in Queensland for the performance of the duties of Postmaster when' that office is held by them, and that such 'allowance is supposed to be paid half-yearly? 2. Is he aware that such allowances are considerably in arrear, and, if so, can he state the reason why and when such allowances will be paid? . Mr Mauger - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Payment for the duties referred to is - made by the Postmaster-General's Department to the Railways Commissioners. 2. I am not aware of any payment in this respect being in arrear, but am having inquiries made. NA - CADE T ENCAMPMENT : COMPLAINTS RE FOOD - EASTER ENCAMPMENT : PAYMENTS TO MILITIA.",17
25,Mr MALONEY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticeRe Bombardier Shergold: Has'the Defence Department yet paid him his compensation for accident in. the Field Artillery manoeuvres?",18
26,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"No recommendation has been made by the Commandant, and I was not aware that any claim had been received from Bombardier Shergold. I have obtained the papers from the Commandant's Office, and will give instructions for the matter to receive further immediate consideration.",18
27,Mr SALMON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is he aware that serious complaints have been made regarding the food supplied to the Cadets at the encampment last week? a. W i ll he make inquiry, and also submit diet quality, and variety. scale and amount of money allowed contractor per head to provide same?",18
28,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I noticed in the press two references to' some complaint having been made, but I know nothing officially. When I saw the press references I asked the Commandant for a report, and his reply contains the information desired by the honourable member. It is as follows: There were, no complaints with respect to rations. * The first meal was issued to the Cadets on arrival in camp on Monday night {23rd ultimo). The Cadet boys from various centres began to arrive at 6.30 p.m., the last into camp were from Horsham and Ballarat, and intervening towns. This body, consisting of about 300 cadets, arrived in camp at 11.30 p.m. All were provided with a meal before retiring. The lateness of this meal, and the fact that only four of the officers attending the camp had any previous experience of camp work, caused some slight confusion, and consequent dissatisfaction, over the issue of breakfast on Tuesday morning.; this was immediately adjusted. The daily scale of ration's wasi i lbs. of bread. lb. meat, f lb. mixed vegetables. ^ lb. potatoes. '3 ozs. sugar.1 i oz. salt. £ oz. tea. 4 lb. jam. i lb. treacle. J lb pudding. J lb. rice or oatmeal. Total weight of ration, 4lbs. 3foz. The total amount issued to members of the. Militia - Forces in camp is 4 lbs. 8 17-32 ozs. per day, and to members of the Permanent Forces in quarters 4 lbs. 5-6 oz. per head per diem. It will be DEFENCE. seen, therefore, that the daily ration was very liberal for boys between the ages of twelve and fourteen years. The contract price was 8£-d. per head per diem. This includes cooks, fuel, and transport. The contract price in the case of the Militia Forces is 9d. per head per day. The Militia scale allows i i - lbs. of meat daily. It will be seen that the allowance of meat was ^ lb. per head daily. Instead of a heavy meat ration, which is unsuitable for boys, one meal daily, consisting partly of meat, was considered quite sufficient, the medical officer of the camp f u l ly concurred in this. Breakfast consisted of porridge and treacle, bread and jam, and tea. Rice was substituted for porridge on alternate days. There was a plentiful supply of bread, the amount provided was the same as that al(lowed to the adult forces, viz., i£ lbs. per day. The tea was good, and was always tested prior to issue. When any shortage occurred in the first issue of rations, additional quantities were immediately forthcoming. The officers supervised the meals of the Cadets under their own charge on all occasions. There was an entire absence of dissatisfaction in regard to the amount and quality of food supplied. The distribution of the rations was submitted to the Medical Officer daily. He expressed himself as being entirely satisfied with the quantity, The apportionment of food to messes was supervised by a Staff Officer at every meal. I visited the camp on Tuesday, the 24th instant., arriving .at 1.45 p.m. I at once assembled the Commanding Officers, Head-quarters Staff and Medical Officer, and went caref u l l y into the matter of food-supplies and sanitation generally, and directed an alteration in the daily allotment. I made further inquiries of Officers and Cadets-mor e than half the entire number-take n at haphazard from the various companies, and found that all were well satisfied with the food supplies. The' health of the camp was excellent throughout.  Minister of Defence, upon noticer. As the two extra days at the teoming Easter camp were unexpected and exceptional, and, until recently, unannounced, can-he see his . way to pay such militiamen as have already served the necessary time under the regulations to earn the £ 6 8s. annually granted them for such two extra days if they serve them? 2. W i ll payment be made in Victoria this' year, as in other States, immediately on completion of camp?",18
29,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1.. Action of the kind suggested would have . to be uniform all over Australia. On inquiry it appears that the militia, in Victoria already put in so many parades' and drills that four days in camp - will make up ""the 16 days' training for 'which pay is provided. If volunteers would also have a strong claim to - be paid. The total liability would amount to approximately ,£14,000, and no provision has been ""made for such a large sum. The Governhave ment will provide rations and expenses two extra days' training, but I am unable to suggest payment for the two extra days, incurclosed ring so large an expenditure. 2. Departmentally, there is no objection. Commanding Officers give 'notice - immediately, such could be done.. SECRET DRUGS, CURES, AND MR. BEALE'S REPORT.",18
30,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"the Prime Minister,' upon notice I. Have any payments of any kind been to Mr Beale in connection with his Commission relating to Secret Drugs, &c. ? 2. If so, what is, the amount of ments, and for what purpose has such money been paid? 3. What is the cost of printing, & c , to date, in connection with the report? 4. Is the report complete; if not, what is the estimated cost of .the complete report? 5. Before any further money is printing the report, will the Government see that it is properly edited and any objectionable matter eliminated therefrom ?",19
31,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The answers honourable member's questions are as follow : 1 and 2. No payments have been made to Mr. Bea-le for his services. The sum of £ 6 8 5s. 4d. was reimbursed to Mr Beale on the submission by him of a voucher showing thaf he had paid that sum to Messrs. W. T. Baker and Company for making blocks for illustrations. 3. The account for printing has not yet been submitted, but on the title-page of the report there is a statement that the approximate cost of printing was £477 8s. Freight charges amounting t 0 J£*3 have been paid. 4. The report is described by Mr Beale as a progress report; but it is. understood that any supplement will be very brief. 5. No further money is proposed to be expended upon the present report.",19
32,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The answer to the first question is very indefinite.,19
33,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I think the answer the question is most definite; not a penny has been paid to Mr Beale.,19
34,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,For his services.,19
35,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"O r for anything else. ""The only payment made was a payment through ' Mr 'Beale to Messrs. Baker and .Company. have JAM MANUFACTURERS COMBINE.",19
36,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"the Minister granted, of Trades and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is true, as stated by the Age, that the principal Victorian Jam Manufacturers formed a "" combine"" and now dictate for the prices to the fruit-growers? 2. Has not the combine in question already a competing jam factory at Richmond by unfair undercutting in the selling price of If a certain class of preserve ? 3. Is it not a fact that prior to the coming into existence of the Jam Combine, fruit-growers could buy the wooden buckets used in marketing raspberries at prices ranging from 12s. to 18s. a dozen? 4. Is it true that the Jam Combine recently FOODS. bought a shipment of raspberry buckets before such buckets were landed, and put the selling price of them to the fruit-growers up to 24s. a dozen ? 5. If the allegations against the Jam Combine are true, will the Minister take prompt steps to prevent the fruit-growers' from being .further made fleeced in the. directions indicated?",19
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Ful l insuch payquiries will be made into the matter. PAPUAN LAND SCANDALS.,19
38,Mr JH CATTS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"the Minister of expended in External Affairs, upon notice I. Referring to the rumoured land scandals in Papua, is he aware that serious charges have been made against certain Government officials to the to the following effect :"" The representative of a Melbourne company recently made application for an area of 1,200 acres for rubber planting at Manu Manu. He applied personally at the Crown Lands Office .for information as to what lands were already taken up in the locality. The Acting Government Surveyor (Mr Drummond) put him off on the plea that he was then *' too busy."" The agent then applied officially in writing for the information but received no reply. He called again at the Lands Office, when he received a rough tracing of the lands already taken up, whereupon he started for Manu Manu. Meanwhile Drummond, and another lands official named Pinney, put in an application for the pick of the identical block which the agent was on his - way to inspect ? 2. Is it correct that the Papuan Land Board (consisting of the aforesaid Mr Drummond, ' and the Director of Mines and Agriculture, to Hon. Staniforth Smith), passed Drummond and Pinney's applications, and that when they came before the Administrator of the Territory, he refused to give his assent to them? 3. Did a junior clerk in the Treasury then 1 apply for this identical land on behalf of a syndicate, which included Drummond, Pinney, and Champion, the latter being acting Treasurer; and was not the application lodged at 9 a.m.. on 2nd January, immediately, after the office opened' after the holidays, and two hours before the agent of the Melbourne company was able to put in his application? 4. In view of the foregoing, will the Government request the Administrator of Papua to hold an inquiry into the allegations, and also into matters involving the Director of Mines and Agriculture-statement s having been publicly made about him by a late Magistrate of the Territory to the following effect :(«) That he (the Director) was personally. interested in Drummond's securing the land in question? (J) That he (the Director) is virtually an agent for a Melbourne company promoter named Bloomfield, and has personally engaged managers for several of Bloomfield's companies in Papua; and {c) That forms of application for land, signed by Bloomfield, or. others on his behalf, but otherwise blank, have been filled up and lodged by some person in the Crown Lands Department, under the authority of the said Director?",19
39,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1, 2, 3. The papers laid on the table yesterday answer these questions with full detail. Mr Champion's name nowhere appears in connection with the syndicate. 4. The allegations regarding Messrs. Drummond and Pinney have already been inquired into. Allegations 1 and 2 concerning the Director of Agriculture are not warranted by any evidence given at the inquiry. It is known that application forms signed by Mr Bloomfield were left with the Director of Agriculture, but it does not appear that any of these have been lodged. NORFOLK ISLAND.",20

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed frorh.3ist March, vide page 9891): DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. Division 30 (The Treasury), ,£9,603. Mr DUGALD THOMSON Sydney) [2.51] - In dealing with these Estimates of the Department of the Treaargument sury, I ' should like to draw attention to very considerable increases of expenditure, both in these Estimates themselves and, incidentally, in the Estimates for the other Departments. I wish to deal with not merely the administration of the Department of the Treasury, but also the Treasurer's administration of the finances of the Commonwealth. I am not going to make my statement a lengthy one, but I think I can show that there have been considerable increases of expenditure which seem to be committing us to extravagance, unless, of course, explanations by the Treasurer can show the contrary. I think that it would be unfortunate if , merely because so much of the financial year has elapsed, we were to accept these Estimates as being of little interest to the Committee, and not to . submit them to the-careful examination which other Estimates have received. Hitherto the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not deserved the accusation of extravagance that has been so freely made in connection with it. .The members of this Chamber, and also the' members of another place, have examined with a very proper care, and have criticised with a keen appreciation of the public interest, the accounts that have been submitted by various Treasurers. I am afraid, however, that on this occasion that criticism is considerably blunted, and that that examination is not in evidence. Possibly, the partial cause is that we have been passing Supply Bills month by month. The usual tendency of living by Supply Bills is to encourage excessive .expenditure in Departments, and to make Parliament less eager and less careful to examine the Estimates, owing to the fact that the money has practically been all spent.",20
42,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Parliamen t has surrento the dered its effective power. MT. DUGALD THOMSON - Yes . It is a very dangerous system. Under almost it, Parliament surrenders its functions; a)nd unless it hais the strength of do come before it, though its criticism may ESTIMATES. be of very little use as to the expenditure of the current year-unles s then, I say, it has the strength of mind and the determination to see to it that the expenditure is not unduly increased-it means that the year that is neglected becomes a steppingstone to a higher level of expenditure in (North future years.",20
43,Mr FISHER,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The honourable member's means that we should tackle tha Estimates immediately they are laid upon the table.,20
44,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"We ought to tackle them-to use the honourable ber's word-at the earliest possible ment, and do with as few Supply Bills as can possibly be arranged.",21
45,Mr FISHER,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,That is not possible i are going to sit all the year round.,21
46,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"We know expenditure, that there are difficulties, created by extension of the length of the session. course, the excuse this time is that been dealing with the Tariff. But,- nevertheless, I do, say that it is possible to bring in the Estimates earlier than they are usually brought in, and not to require the constant granting of supply forunchecked expenditure.",21
47,Mr FISHER,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I cannot see that. must have Supply Bills, because this House would not allow the Appropriation Bill become law long before Parliament rose.",21
48,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,We can consider the Estimates at an early date in the session. What we do with the Apministration propriation Bill is quite another thing. . Mr FISHER - We must - pass Supply Bills if we sit all the year round.,21
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If we have considered the Estimates that not matter. If Supply Bills are based separately. upon Estimates which we have considered, there is not the same objection to What I am really objecting to is the passing, of Supply Bill after Supply Bill withmention out having considered the Estimates,, or having approved of them.",21
50,Mr FISHER,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Base d on the old Estinise mates ?,21
51,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Yes .,21
52,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"That would applv to the Works Estimates rather than to these Estimates, which consist mainly of salaries.",21
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have classes. taken some figures out of these Estimates, and in doing so I may state that . I am not merely dealing with the Treasurer's administration of his own Department. That is a minor duty, so far as he is conwould cerned. I am dealing with his adminisservice, tration of the finances generally. I find, from a rough examination of the Estimates - of course one has to go through a. many figures to obtain these particularsthat there has been an increase practically in all the Departments under the different headings to which I will refer. In salaries and temporary assistance, the total crease is £61,318- In postage and grams, the increase is £2,120, spread over all Departments. In printing, the increase is £ -33r> spread over all Departments, 2 memexcept one. In travelling expenses, the moincrease is £2,715, spread over all Departments except one. In office requisites, account books, and so on, the increase is f we £6,957, spread over all. Departments ex-, cept one.

55,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"As compared with the appropriation of last year. A proportion of the increases in salaries are increases due to our Public Service Act. I quite recognise that, as the members of this We Committee must recognise it.",21
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Do the honourable to. member's figures relate to all - Departments ?,21
57,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I am quoting thesefiguresas evidence of the. adof the finances of the Commonwealth.,21
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The figures are not confined to the Treasury?,21
59,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Oh , no. does I Gan give them for the Departments Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I have not conthem. trol over the other Departments.",21
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I will the particulars for the Treasurer's information; but will' first conclude what 1 . I have to say on this point. We all recogthat if not one additional employee were added to the Commonwealth service, there must be, under the provisions of our Public Service Act, increases of expenditure, by the movement of officers from grade to grade, and through increases within the The increases must be earned, by merit and service, but, given these, .they come automatically. Consequently, if there were not an increase in the number of public servants in any'- one' year, there still be an increase in the cost of the and this will continue to be the case - until the retirements balance the increases, an equilibrium which is not likely good to be reached for many years. The increases to which.I have referred, 'however, are due largely to additions to the service. It must not be thought that I have tried to be too criticail. I have not taken into acincount new Departments, or Departments telewhich! have not been in existence for two years. I have not reckoned in the Metereological and Statistical Departments; the increase in the Printing Office, which, being largely for material and wages, may be due to an increase of work j the increases in the Defence Department, except so far as the central administration is concerned ; nor the large increases in the Postmaster-General's Department in connection with the climatic allowance of an additional 5 per cent, to certain officers in Western Australia and elsewhere, and certain allowances to postmasters. I have dealt only with the Departments and the routine work they have been doing for a number of years. the Department of External Affairs the increases aniount to '^T5857.",21
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have no wish to prevent the criticism of my administration, but, as I fear that the honourable member's remarks may lead to a second Budget debate, if he is permitted to discuss expenditure not coming under the Department of the Treasury, I ask whether he is in order ?",22
62,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"My allusion to other Departments has been only incidental, and the elaboration which I was about to makewas asked for by the Minister. I am criticising his administration, not merely of the Treasury, but of the finances generally, and it is customary, in financial debates elsewhere, .to criticise the administration of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or a State Treasurer, not only in regard to his own Department, but in regard to'the finances generally. f h e CHAIRMAN - It has been customary, in dealing' with .Estimates, to allow a general Departmental debate on the first item of each - Department, and I understood the honourable member for North. Sydney to refer only incidentally to the expenditure of other Departments, Therefore, he was riot out of order, but he must not deal, in detail, with the expenditure of any other Department than the Treasury.",22
63,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I bow to your ruling, sir, and merely point out that the Minister asked for the figures which I was about to give, and then, when I proceeded to comply with his request, took the point of order.",22
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I merely asked whether the figures given by the honourable weight than I imagined. member referred to one Department or all the Departments. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - There are large increases of expenditure in Treasury.,22
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If the honourable member refers to page 36, he will see that the total increase is only £ 9 1 . Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - The total increase may be £ 9 1 ; but, in comparing the tdtal expenditure, of a Department during two years, it must be remembered that some items in one year do not occur the next. For instance, last year we voted £ 4 6 , 0 0 0 extra for electoral expenditure, which we are not' asked to vote this year, because no elections are to take place. In the Department of the Treasury . there is an increase of £ 5 , 1 4 3 in salaries In and temporary assistance, of £ 2 7 0 in postage and telegrams, of £ 2 0 in printing- °f £ 5 in - travelling expenses, of 2 2 £ 2 3 5 in office requisites, and of- £ 7 5 in incidental expenses and petty cash, making al total of £ 5 , 9 6 8 . The; greater part of these increases occur in> connection with the Auditor-Gefneral's Department. The increases there of salaries come to nearly £ 5 , 0 0 0 , which is equal to almost 50 per cent, on the expenditure of last year. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That is accounted for by the transfer of certain officials from the Department of Trade and 'Customs.",22
66,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"That may be a good answer, but I can show that, notwithstanding that transfer, there is a large increasein the expenditure of the . Department of Trade and ' Customs. I do not see - what good reason there .can be for these increases throughout all the Departments, in connection with the items which I have enumerated. If we are not prepared, or have not an opportunity, to give to these Estimates the close scrutiny they require, in order that each of the items to which I have referred may be tested, we ought, at least, to indicate that in passing them we desire that they shall not be regarded as a proper basis.for future Estimates. ' They ought not to be accepted as a basis for * further increases next year and thereafter.",22
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I have had a big fight in mv efforts to keep down expenditure.,22

69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I could not have paid more attention to them.,23
70,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The Treasurer, at all events, ought to take care that, in the absence of good reason for so doing, future Estimates are not framed on the basis of those now before I have not - included in my figures the memember refers. teorological and statistical branches of the Department for Home Affairs. The items relating to those branches of the service are not quite new, but I have not endeagard voured to take any advantage of the creases relating to them or in any new vice. An examination discloses that items relating to the routine work of the-old partments have increased to such an extent that, in passing these Estimates, we should indicate by motion our sense of the necesresponsible. sity for some reduction in future Estisurer mates.",23
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,And so pass a vote of censure on the Treasurer?,23

As a matthere ter of fact, the increased use of the telein the salaries-that graph wires by the various Departments the Commonwealth means an increased deexplainable mand on telegraph operators and telegraph may be, from the Customs wires, and often results, in general business being blocked. I should like to that this increase in respect was due to increased departmental activity. That would be a rather surprisbeen ing development; but I am afraid that .true explanation is 'that many officers consider that' it is less troublesome to a telegram than to write a letter. In these Estimates the cost of telegrams is not rated from the cost of postage, but there must ment'. have been a considerable increase in the telegraphic messages sent by the Departments, .for the large increase shown under that heading would hot be due only to addi-tional postage. ' We have always devoted .very serious attention to' the expenditure of the several Governments' that have been iir power since the establishment of Federation. Honourable members on both sides of the House have been ready to consider any legitimate criticism of the Estimates, and even Government supporters have criticised any proposals that seemed to suggest Federal extravagance. I am afraid, however, that we are departing from that stand. Owing to circumstances which are rather extraordinary, we have allowed a series of Supply Bills to be passed with, I fear, the usual result.

Unless the Minister can show that this increase is justified, not merely in his, but in other Departments, or will otherwise satisfy me, I must enter a protest in the least offensive way, of indicating that Parliament does not accept these Estimates as the proper basis of future Estimates, but will require, in the future, evidence of the need for considerable increases in . the items to which I have referred.",24
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Hume-.Trea surer) [3.30] - I - desire to take the present case opportunity to say a few words on' 'the criticism that has been offered by die honourable member for North Sydney. In the first place, I have to say.that, while I have I been Treasurer, I have tried my best to keep down expenditure, especially in one or 'two of the Departments. First of all, however, I was met with the objection that I had no right to interfere. I know what my rights are as Treasurer, and, though there might be some question raised as to interference in 'the expenditure of money authorized by Parliament, I take it that I have a right to the fullest information when it is sought to have additfonal expenditure in any one of the Departments - Mr. Every proposal for additional expenditure has been criticised by me' most keenly. That has been so, not only in regard to salaries, which are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, but in cases where I have been requisitioned to supply the funds to enable the number of employees to be increased. These requests have . in some cases almost frightened me, and I have done my best to keep 'the expansion within bounds. In some Departments I have refused any advance of money except on the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner, who I know has taken a very great interest in this ter. All along the line, however, it is urged upon me that the Departments have hitherto been undermanned, more especially in the case of the Department of Trade and Customs and the Post and Telegraph Department. I have interviewed both Ministers and heads of Departments, in order to ascertain whether it is really necessary to temporarily, at any rate, make the fresh appointments desired, and I conceive that 'this is the duty of a Treasurer who desires to keep the Estimates - within reasonable limits - T fear that' unless. a firm grip is taken, we may, in a year or two, find ourselves in such a position that there will be an outcry for retrenchment. I am met with statements to the effect that certain Departments .are earning much more than in the past, and that the expansion of business makes additional assistance necessary ; and, again- I am referring more particularly to the Department of Trade and Customs and the Post and Telegraph Departments- I was advised by one of the principal heads of the Customs Department that in Sydney the business could not be'carried , on unless more assistance was given-that everything was checked owing to undermanning.",24
93,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The widening of the duties may, of course, account for that in the Customs Department, but the increases I refer to are in every Department. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - The statement to me is that every Department has been undermanned, and I have asked one member of the proposed Committee of the Cabinet to look into this very question, and see whether it is really necessary to make the additional appointments which have been asked for. MCWILLIAMS - The' honourable gentleman is on a good wicket this time.",25
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I generally am; but I may say that T have had to bear a great deal- I shall not say abuse-bu t of odium, because I would not grant the money asked for. I have no desire, of course, to curb reproductive expenditure, but only to check any undue expansion in the administrative Departments. I cannot go into the details now, but I hope to have the Additional Estimates on the table tomorrow or the next day, when honourable members will be able to judge how this expansion has progressed - I do not blame mat- any one, and the expansion may be absolutely necessary and inevitable; but I am not going any further until Parliament votes the money which has been asked for. This, in my opinion, is a very serious matter, and one for the House fo deal with. I hope, however, that there will be nothing in the shape of a vote of censure.",25
95,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,There is no vote of censure' contemplated.,25

Those officers have' been transferred to the Auditor-General, and their of salaries are now debited to his Departto ment.

Time after time, some excuse was made for introducsuch measures-eithe r that the Government wanted to get on with some other or that the public servants were to be paid, or that the Treasurer wanted for some other reason to get ' the Bill through. It is to be hoped himthat next session we shall be able to deal with the Estimates early in the year, so that our control over the expenditure will not be merely a myth. .1 should like to draw attention to the enormous growth of expenditure, bearing out what the Treafor surer has admitted.

If honourable members look the abstract of expenditure, they will that increases in all Departments, special appropriations, ordinary votes, and expenmake diture on new works, amount to £980,691 for the year 1907-8.

I know, however, that Parliamentsisting is not inclined to pay much attention these matters at the present time. Honorwisely able members say that the money has all been spent, and the mere recital of the penditure is not sufficient to attract tention of the Committee. If the Treathe surer desires to make his control over the finances effective, he is doing the right thing in inviting criticism. The criticism which he has received shows that honourable members appreciate the work that he doing in keeping a tight grip over diture. In the early days of Federation, we had, as Treasurer of the Commonshould wealth, Sir George Turner, who made name for himself in Victoria during her days of trouble by his careful control the finances, which enabled him to pull State out of the mud. Any Treasurer who follows in Sir George Turner's footsteps, even if he errs on the side of parsimony, is a far more useful Treasurer to the monwealth thah would be a spendthrift or one who neglected his duty.",28
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I am no spendelectorates, thrift, except with my own monev.",28
127,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The other day, I said that the Treasurer was a miser in regard to public expenditure. But, after all, it extravagant expenditure. is the duty of a Treasurer to be careful with the public funds. I can quite stand a Treasurer making a good excuse increased expenditure, and saying that for every needful development of the Post may and Telegraph Department and the Customs Department we get additional receipts. If we can, by spending £ 1 , get increased return of 25s., that is busiat ness. But when we see so large an infind crease of expenditure over that for the year 1906-7, it is only right that we should our protest. The honourable member for North Sydney has shown the growth of the Departments in detail. If honourable members look at the Estimates, they will find that there have been increases in every Department. On the ordinary votes, the increase is practically £340,000; the increase for additional works is £347,000. Now we are told that in a .day or two the got Treasurer intends to dump down on the table Additional Estimates that will stagapger us. He feaTs that if we go on in this way there will, in - a few years, be a call retrenchment. We do not want to live in a fool's paradise. It is far better to of keep a careful control over the finances now than to have to cut down expenditure few years hence. My contention in reSupply Bills all along has been, to not that the Government would not use the money voted, but that Parliament was surrendering its control over pubexlic expenditure. In my view, it is the duty the atof a public, man to keep his finger upon expenditure of the country, and to see that care is exercised in the administration of every Department. He tells the electors that he will do so when he offers himself as a candidate. One of his highest is functions as a public man is to exerexpencise control over the publicfunds. If we are to surrender this right, why we go through the farce of discussa ing Estimates? I understand the Treasurer's dilemma. He says that it is all very of well for honourable members to complain his that he has not proper control"" of the public expenditure, but he adds that he himself has cause for complaint, under the circumstances, in regard to their attitude Comtowards the expenditure of the Postalor some other Department. Honourable members advocate large expenditure in their own and yet find fault with him for not having proper control over the finances. An honourable member cannot properly urge economy on the Treasurer, and then ask for His attitude , should be consistent in regard to all the underDepartments. The Treasurer has told us that he has been informed by other Ministers that their Departments are unworkable because undermanned. Of course, they rely upon the statements of their officials.. But are we to be content with such statements? Are we going to leave matters entirely to the officials ? . I support the criticism of the orable member for North Sydney, and trust that in the f uture he 'will strongly oppose the introductioni of Supply Bills. I have suggested that, instead of having a prorogation, we should have a short adjournment very soon, so that we may do the financial work of next year at the proper time. The abstract on page 5 of these Estimates shows that the yearly .expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing tremendously. This year there is an increase of about 30 per cent, on the expenditure"" of last year. The Commonweailth cannot stand increases like this. voting money by passing Supply Bills, Parliament loses itscontrol of the purse. I hope that honourable members will feel that a close examination of the Estimates is necessary, and, to be effective, it should be the first work of the session. I have heard it said by many a Treasurer on the introduction of a Supply B i ll that it is to be the last. I believe the Treasurer said that about the last Supply Bill . I hope, however, since there have been so many lasts, thafHt will be the final last. Mr THOMAS BROW N (Calare) [4.0]. - I regret that the Treasurer replied to directions. the criticism of the honourable member for North Sydney before the other side of the case had been put. I give place to none in advocacy of economy; but what is office, called economy is often merely sitting hard on. the Treasury chest, and refusing to make provision for needed and useful public works, sometimes with the result bringing about increased expenditure in the future. The expenditure of the few months disposes me to criticise adbureau. versely the. action of the Treasurer in starving the Department?.",28
128,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I dealt, not with the expenditure for general purposes, but with departmental expenditure.",29
129,Mr THOMASBROWN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have not retirement looked very closely into the departmental expenditure, because I took it for granted that the parsimony which has characterized the Treasurer in regard to country works must have led to economy in departmental administration. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I excluded increases on public works.",29
130,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"My attention will be confined to the administration of the Treasurer during the past few months in regard to necessary public works, which h is been so parsimonious as to reflect no :redit on him. Calare is a country electoral hon- division embracing a considerable area, where the population, although scattered among small centres, is increasing steadily, and consequently requires increased facilities in the way of mail service, post-office accommodation, and the extension of telegraph and telephone lines. The Department of the Postmaster-General' has of late years done yeoman service in. try ing to meet the growing needs of settlement, and in no waycan we better commend ourselves 10 the people than by providing them with facilities for communication. But during But, by the past few months work has been practically stopped, because the Treasurer has refused to grant the necessary funds. As an instance of this, I may say that, when a few months ago I visited Molong, a very old township in the middle of a well-settled district in my electorate, I found that the mails were still being conveyed from the railway station to the post-office by the letter-carrier. At one time, he could do this easily, carrying the sack on his back, but of late he has had to provide a hand cart, and the work has increased so much that the public are deprived of his services in other I represented the matter to' the authorities, with the result that tenders were called for the conveyance of mails between the railway station and the postand a suitable tender was accepted. But, on passing through the town the other day, I found the letter-carrier still en- gaged in the work, because the Treasurer of has refused to provide the money necessary to pay the contractor. The people of last that town also petitioned for a telephone They obtained the requisite number of subscribers, and complied with all the departmental rules, their applicationbeing finally approved. But, for want of means, nothing has yet been done by the Department. In another instance, after the of a non-official postmaster, the people' in the locality petitioned for the re-establishment of the office.. That was approved of, and another officer nominated, at a fixed salary. ' But the Department has since had to make it known that the appointment cannot be made until funds are available. I have received a communication from one of the leading residents of the district, and one of the chief movers in the matter, in which he tells me that the run ' down. people there seriously think of subscribing, or - obtaining in' some other way, money carry out this service until the Department can supply the necessary funds. Similar occurrences are taking place in other parts of my electorate, and in other electorates, and no criticism by the press and polithat ticians of .Sydney can do more to bring Federation into popular contempt than parsimony of the Treasurer in regard important and much-needed public works, complaints of sweating. We experience great difficulty in obtainceed ing postal and telegraphic facilities that are urgently needed. It must be shown that a service asked for will pav practisponsible. callv from the start, and in some cases guarantees have to be given. The people cannot understand why, after all these liminaries have been disposed of, such big Department should have to explain that it has not available the funds necessary provide for such services, and that they must wait until the necessary provision has been made by the Treasury. This tion may seem unimportant to some people, but it i's of vital concern to those directly interested, and the continuance of the sent state of affairs will do more to bring the Federation into disrepute than will criticism hurled at it by the Sydney press or by the Governments of the States. The parsimony displayed by the Treasurer not in the interests of the people whom we are here to serve, nor will it promote the interests of the Federation'. I have cited only a few of the causes for commates, plaint against the Commonwealth which exist in New South Wales, and I daresay that the position is the same in the other States. Throughout the press of South Wales complaints of the' undermanDeputyPostmaster-General ning of the Post and Telegraph DepartStates, ment are made from time to time, and we are told of a condition of affairs that ought not to obtain under the regime Government which professes to be taking the lead in the humanitarian movement.' Men in the Postmaster-General's Departrecommendations ment who produce doctors' certificates showing that their health will be vitally affected by their remaining on duty often compelled to stand by their posts cause the Department has not a proper lieving staff - For the same reason the whole system of annual leave is practically at a dead stop. Honourable members will readily understand that men who have' served for years in the heat of the country need to be relieved when they get Under present conditions, however, they are relieved only under theto most extreme pressure. Those acquainted with the development of New South Wales know that its postal, telegraphic, and telephonic work, has increased by leaps and bounds during the last few years, and there has not been a proportionate increase in the staff of the Department. "" the The consequence is that we have men to working at high pressure, and numerous When we proto investigate the matter, we ''are led first of all to suppose that the DeputyPostmaster-General and his staff are reA brief inquiry is sufficient to show, however, that they have made years ago the necessary representations as preto the need for meeting the growing dea mands on the service. Then we are told that the Public Service Commissioner, with to a desire for economy, has refused to endorse the recommendations of his responsible officers, but finally, as the result of quesquestions put to Ministers in this House, we discover that the Commissioner has made recommendations for a large increase prein the service, and that the stumbling block in the way of such an increase is to any be found on the door-step of the Treasury, I understand that the Commissioner last year recommended something like 1,000 new is appointments to the Public Service, and that although that recommendation was submitted to the Cabinet for consideration in connection with the framing of these Esti- no provision has been made to give effect to it. Such a state of affairs ought not to be tolerated. If any one ought to be familiar with the needs of the Post and New Telegraph Department, it should be the ih each of the and the Public Service Commissioner,. who has to look after the strength and efficiency of the service. If we are tc of a pe it the Treasurer, in the name of rm economy-falsel y so-called-to frustrate the efforts of those officers-to over-ride the of the responsible men in a Department-w e might as well let him take sole control of the affairs of the Comare monwealth, and run them at his own sweet bewill. Whilst he refuses to grant the supreplies necessary to carry on urgent works, he practically controls the whole Federal machine, and denies to responsible .officers the opportunity to carry on the service on lines which experience leads them to back believe are the soundest to adopt. The post-card craze has largely increased the work of the Post and Telegraph Department, .and last Christmas/a great deal of friction and dissatisfaction was created in Sydney owing' to its inability to deal with the great rush of work so caused. That inabilitywas due, not to want of foresight on the part of the responsible officers, but to the refusal of the Treasurer to provide them . with the means to avoid it . In order that there might be no block of business, the Deputy Postmaster-General was obliged to employ a number of temporary hands. In that way the pressure, was relieved, but these unfortunate men, who had served the 'Commonwealth well, were told when they should have received their wages that no money was available, and they had to go without any pay during the holiday season; After pressure had been brought to bear upon the Treasurer, the necessary funds were made available.",29
131,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD, I think that the honourable member is now going beyond a reasonable discussion of the Treasurer's Estimates. He is entering too full y into details ing to the Department of the Postmaster General.,31
132,Mr THOMASBROWN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I am conscious that in directing this criticism to the . Postmaster-General and his responsible officers, -I shall not be hitting at those who should be rightly blamed for the trouble. It is for the purpose of addressing my remarks to the Minister primarily responsible that on these Estimates I have gone into details in connection with the working of the Post and Telegraph Department. The Treasurer should not consider that the only charge against which he has to guard is one of wasteful expenditure. There is a true and a false economv. and in connection with the matters to which I have referred, the honourable gentleman has indulged in a false economy which will tend to bring, not only his Government, but the whole Federal machine, into disrepute. that the folly of the parsimony - displayed by the Treasurer will be brought home to him so strongly that he will make provision for the proper equipment and efficiency of the Public Service. What becomes of everv penny which, by this process of squeezing, is saved? It goes to enrich the State Treasuries, and yet members of the Parliament of New South Wales have complained to me of the parsimony of the Federal Government in failing to make provision for postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities for small centres of population, as well as in the other directions which I have indicated. Such a condition of affairs is certainly unhealthy, and I trust that the Treasurer will recognise that bybeing over-zealous in his desire to keep down expenditure, he is doing an iniustice to himself, to the Postmaster-General's Department, to the Commonwealth, and especially to the people primarily affected.",31

192,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Would the honourable though member call antique eggs artistic?,36
193,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If the honourable member of had the artistic temperament, he would not ask the question. When we have a Commonwealth printing office in the ComSeat of Government, it will be parochial to ask that any printing which could be done there should be done iri a State office. It was not the Premier of New South Wales, but an earnest and ardent Labourite representing B'layney, who brought up this matter in the State Parforliament last night'. He complained that artisans in the Sydney Government Printis the ing Office were losing their employment, and asked that they should not be. suddenly deprived of their means of earning with a livelihood. But the honourable member for Boothby has gone back upon his fellow Labourite. So far as I am. awarevot one of these men who earn their livelihood in the Government Printing Office of New South Wales resides in my electorate. The Treasurer says that it will take twelve I months to put the new plant in position.",36

197,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,But the honourable member has thought a lot.,37
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I ' have only thought that the Commonwealth should deal with the question without favoring any State. If the Government find that the work which they require can be done, or the material they desire can be obtained more economically in one State than in another, they have a right to choose accordingly.",37
199,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,That asked for.,37
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"When I held office I acted upon that principle in dealing with my own State as well as with others. It is unfair that one State should be given a considerable' advantage in respect of prices paid for work done for the Commonwealth ; but in dealing with such matters the responsible Minister should take care that the estimates in all cases are in respect of the same, article, and that such article' is the best for the purpose. I wish now to refer to the . reply made by the Treasurer - to the observations which I made earlier in the debate. There seems to be some misapprehension, especially on the part of the .honourable member for Qalare as to what my objections were. I in no way objected to the increased expenditure that is necessitated by new works, new enterprises, or the growth of business, nor did I make amy reference - to an increased , ture of £ 8 2 6 , 0 0 0 in connection . with new enterprises or - developments for which the Estimates provide. shall 1 be able to deal with the items relating to that expenditure when we reach them. I merely touched upon increases in respect of seven of the ordinary items of departmental expenditure, namely, salaries, temporary assistance, postage and telegrams, printing, travelling expenses, office requisites, and incidental and petty cash. I made no reference to the expenditure of the new Departments nor to the expenditure of about £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 in the administration of the Commerce Act.",37
201,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I would remind the honourable' member that we are now dealing with an item relating only to printing.,37
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I had overlooked that fact. I did not object in any way to increasedexpenditure due to I have increased work and an increased revenue, nor did I take into account increased expenditure in respect of printing. By way of illustration I would point out that when a Railway Department increases its revenue by £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , there must necessarily be a proportionate increase in its expenditure. As a rule, its expenditure is increased by 50 or 60 per cent. No one has ever objected to an increase in such circumstances, but a Parliament would very properly object to the increased revenue of that Department being completely swallowed by increased expenditure. That seems is all I have to be the position in relation to some of the items I have criticised. I had intended to move that these Estimates be reduced by £ 1 as an indication of the feel. ing of the Committee that they should not be made the basis of future expenditure, but after the remarks made by the Treasurer I shall not do so. The honourable gentleman has practically agreed with the tenor of my criticism, and ought' really to come over to this side of the House. In moving such a motion, I should not have been actuated by a desire to attribute to the Treasurer the responsibility for the increase. In the remarks which I offered I had no desire to reflect on the central office of the Treasury. The Treasury itself is free from the objection which I raised. My experience leads me to. believe that it is excellently managed. H ad the Treasurer refused to take notice of the points that I wished to emphasize, I would expendi- have moved the reduction I have indicated ; but since he has said that he se'eks, and will seek, to prevent the mere swelling We of expenditure without cause-suc h as, I infer, from the appearance of these Estimates, has been taking place- I shall not do so. It is highly desirable that whilst providing for new enterprises and developments, we should set our face sternly against that which has occurred in all Departments that have lacked thorough supervision-the unnecessary growth of expenpersonally or upon your office. diture to the consequent injury of the cornrnunitv.",37

217,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have just shown that the fact that these reports were printed in Sydney necessitated a large payment .for freight, which might - have been avoided. I find that the report prepared by Mr. Beale was printed in Sydney on the 8th August, 1907, and that the forwarding of the copies to Melbourne necessitated, as I have said, a payment of ,£13. Consequently I feel that, on the Estimates before us, I am entitled to ask why the Government authorized the printing of this document, in view of the promise of the Prime Minister, to which I must refer in order to prove my contention.",39
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I may inform the honourable member that this expenditure is. not provided for in these Estimates, but is provided for in the Additional Estimates of the Department of External Affairs.

219,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The Minister will now see the difficulty'to which I previously referred. In the first place, we were told that this particular matter was not dealt with in the Estimates for the Treasury, and now we are told that it is not in the Estimates at all. I think that, on the question of printing; the honourable member for Wentworth is in order provided he does not discuss the report itself.",39
220,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I do not propose to discuss the report itself, but merely to refer to it from the point of"" view of the promise of the Prime Minister that no expense would be incurred- a promise which I take to cover printing.",39
221,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I do not think it is fair for the honourable member to .refer to any promises in the way he is doing. honourable member is referring to two different matters at once. Mr KELLY,- I can understand the desire of the Treasurer not to have this question debated, but I am .sure that the Prime Minister will be the first to welcome a discussion. Mr Beale, when he was seeking to be appointed a Royal Commission, wrote on the 19th July, 1905I am willing, if your Government will give me an authoritative commission, to obtain at my own expensethe subject-matter of this report. To that the reply was sentIt is, of course, understood _ that your investimission gations will not entail any cost on Government funds.",39
222,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Neithe r did they.,39
223,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Then Mr Beale replied as followsThe work will not entail any cost on the Commonwealth. The first knowledge the House had of the appointment of Mr Beale as a Royal Commission was on the 29th August, 1905, when the honourable member for Hunter 'asked a question in reference to a. paragraph in the Melbourne Age, which stated thatHe (Mr Beale) is proceeding to Europe at his own expense, and will fulfil his commission without cost to the Federal Government and Parliament. The Prime Minister has given Mr. Beale an official letter of introduction. In answer to that question, the Prime Minister' emphasized the factHe (Mr Beale) has undertaken this very usef u l work without cost to the Commonwealth. I venture to say that the appointment of Mr Beale, however qualified 'that gentleman may be",39
224,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The honourable member cannot go into the question of the appointment of Mr Beale, although he will be quite in order in referring to the cost of printing.",39
225,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I auite agree with that view, and I was only incidentally making reference to the undoubted fact that, had it not been for the promise of the Prime Minister- a promise which covered the cost of printing-the House would not have endorsed the appointment of an unqualified Commissioner.' After Mr Beale returned to this country, we heard nothing of any proposal to reimburse any expenses in connection with the Commission. We know now, f rom the papers, that the Commission was of an unusual nature, because the Prime Minister wroteThe It may be explained that it is not the practice of the Government to issue Commissions in a case of this kind.",39
226,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"It appears to me that the honourable member is endeavouring to discuss the appointment of Mr Beale as a Royal Commission. ' If the honourable member will confine his remarks to the cost of the printing, he will be in order, but, if he goes beyond that, he will be distinctly out of order.",39
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I should like to know whether it would not be permissible - for the honourable member for' Wentworth to refer to the appointment of this Comas a pretext on the part of the Government for going to the expense of printing .this report ?,39
228,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have already ruled that the honourable member for Wentworth is in order in dealing with the cost of Tne printing of the report; but that, if he goes on to deal with the appointment of Mr Beale, he will be distinctly out of order. ' Mr KELLY - I quite agree with the Chairman on that point; and I made the quotation merely in order to show that the appointment of the Royal Commission-a n appointment which authorized the expenditure of money, including the cost of printing-wa s of an - unusual nature.",40

However, that is by the way. The promise was made to this House that the Commission would entail no expense on ths Commonwealth; and, in-.view of that absolute statement, the House permitted the Commission to go on its way. I now ask the Treasurer how he can just if y the payment of any sum of money in connection with the expense of printing the report. It strikes me, having regard to the answers given by the Prime Minister today, that this Commission may have been deliberately appointed in order to en-' able the expense incurred by Mr Beale to be shouldered on to the Commonwealth. I can come to no other conclusion.",40
230,Mr STORRER,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The honourable member for Wentworth has been ruled out .of order by one Chairman, on attempting to discuss this question earlier today.

231,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"It is the custom , for the Chairman of' Committees to uphold the ruling of the Deputy Chairman. But, so far as I can gather from the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth, he is showing cause why this report should not have been printed. I have stopped the honourable member from going beyond that subject, and I shall see that he does not deal with more than the question of the printing.",40

I point out, however, that-1I have not pre viously addressed myself to that subject on the items before us, so that the point of order is scarcely valid. In reply to a question today, the Prime Minister' said that no payment had been made to Mr. Beale for his services, and, of course, that fact is obvious. But the Prime Minister went on to say that a sum of £ 6 8 odd was reimbursed to Mr Beale on the submission by '.him of a voucher showing that he had paid that amount to Messrs. Baker and Company for making blocks for illustrations. We find, as I have already said, that the report was printed in Sydney, and were the a large cost incurred in conveying the copies to Melbourne'. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Was that out of the Treasurer's advance?",40
233,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I do not know; but. unfortunately, the method adopted has led us into somewhat unusual paths.",40
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,This is - the Neild business over again.,40
235,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Yes ; it seems to me to be on all-fours with the Neild case. However, I am now asking for information; and I hope that the Government have no objectionable facts to conceal, however anxious they may appear now, by raising points of order, to prevent me pursuing my remarks. I ask the Treasurer whether this account with Messrs. Baker and Companywas incurred before or after Mr Beale was made Commissioner?",40
236,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,A f t e r ; long after.,40

The moment the report of a Royal Commission is sent in, the Government may print it or not,, as they choose, with the permission qf the House; but they have no right to delegate the power to any one, however important a political entity he may be. To give Mr. Beale, or any one else, the right to incur expense on the part of the Commonwealth is a bad practice, which I hope I shall not see repeated. I think that I have submitted - wit h great difficultly owing to the constant interruptions- a case which requires a certain answer from the Government. I certainly think that it is "" up to them "" to explain why they have gone back on their promise to this House, and have done something which-the Treasurer only a few years ago in New South Wales turned a Government out of office for doing.",40

Our contention is .that, to get an excuse for in this expenditure in the preparation why and printing of this report, Mr Beale was a Commissioner, and that the matter should have been' re-submitted to this House. That is the point which I",41
264,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"As long as the honourable confines himself to that will be in order j but if he is to discuss the rights and wrongs of ' appointment of Mr Beale, he will be out of order.. , I must ask him not to that course. The task is quite difenough to deal .with the Estimates, and to confine honourable members to the matters under discussion. I can only do that with the assistance of the Committee",41
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The point which we wish to bring out is that the Government declared to this House that no. in. expenditure would be incurred by Mr. Beale in the preparation of the report.,41
266,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"No ; in the .preparation of "" a "" report. No expenditure was incurred in the preparation of the report to which reference was then made - As 1I have said before, that report was never printed. This is another report, made after Mr Beale .was appointed a Royal Commissioner. I have already explained that.",42
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Then we are to understand that Mr Beale received two appointments from the Government-on e under which no expenditure was to be incurred, and another under which the expenditure of a Royal Commissioner was to be incurred? '- Mr DEAKIN - No ; no expenditure, except that which was incurred in connection with the printing, and we paid for every penny of that ourselves. Except for this one account having been paid for , that purpose-and on our being satisfied that it was a proper expenditure to incur, it was paid by us- Mr Beale. has never received a penny on account of his report ",42
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Will the Prime Minister state for the information of the Committee why these two different arrangements were made with Mr Beale? ' The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is out of order in discussing that point.,42
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Perhaps we had' better wait until we get the Additional Estimates before us. We are getting the information in driblets. Later on, I hope, we shall get the whole of it . Mr DEAKIN ' (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [5.46] - May I be allowed to say that we have just had an example of the privilege which every honourable member enjoys in connection with the discussion of Supply; but that, in my opinion, the opportunity has been used mainly for mischievous purposes?",42
270,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Is that remark in order?,42
271,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I hope thai the Prime Minister will withdraw the remark.,42
272,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If you desire it , sir, certainly.",42
273,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,It was absolutely unjustifiable.,42
274,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The manner in which the affair has been discussed, shows that it was lightly picked up for the time being to make some amusement in the Committee. But, if the honourable member for Parramatta really wishes more information",42
275,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,-Does the Prime Minister really believe what he has said?',42
276,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"A f t e r I had given the information twice, a demand .for it was made a third time, and I pointed to. the papers as containing the answer.",42
277,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The Prime Minister pointed to the papers, .but his reply does not satisfy me. I will give him my opinion as to the action of the Government in appointing Mr Beale a Royal Commissioner.",42
278,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I do not mind the honourable member's opinion, and am not attempting to satisfy him. I am satisfying the Committee, and am pointing out that, although all very well in its way, this kind of conduct can be pushed too far. The honourable member, having asked to be put right upon the facts of the case for the fourth or fifth time, I again directed attention to the papers themselves. A glance at them will show that Mr Beale received a letter of introduction. It was clearly stated that there was to be no expenditure incurred in connection with his first inquiries. No expenditure was incurred up to the date when he was appointed a Royal Commissioner.",42
279,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,A f t e r he had collected the information ?,42
280,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"On the second' occasion Mr Beale, who had visited the Continent of Europe, a number of cities in Great Britain, and the United States of America, where he placed himself in touch with the highest authorities on the question into which he was inquiring, prepared hrs matter. He included in his report no opinions of his own on any subject, but simplycollected and collated the opinions of all these authorities. The only expense incurred by us in this connection is in relation to.the printing and publishing of the report. The whole amount is that paid to the printer in Sydney, the £ 1 3 for carriage, and the one account for certain blocks that, I think, could only be obtained in London. Mr Beale paid two visits. That is the - sum and substance of it all. I must say, also, that I do not know of any Royal Commission in any State, or in any part of Australia, that has been conducted in this economical fashion. I do not know any other Commissioner who, at his own cost, has travelled at an expense of hundreds of pounds, who has collected expert information, and paid the whole of his expenses out of his own pocket, and given all that to the Commonwealth, receiving not one penny himself. This is not - like the other case mentioned, where a Royal Commissioner received a sum of money for expenses in New South Wales. .",42
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Not at all.,43
282,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"W as it expenditure out of pocket? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - No , certainly not. It was expenditure incurred for making translations.",43
283,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,It will be out of order to go into a matter of that kind.,43
284,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I do not propose to dwell upon it further, except to say that no expenses of any kind have been charged by Mr Beale. Any outlay there was he paid. As to - his qualifications and the value of his report, perhaps I should be out of order in discussing it.",43
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,That Question now. ' Mr DEAKIN - We have in Mr. Beale's report a document which had involved him in many months of travelling and many months of . labour.,43
286,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Surely this is out of order.,43
287,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If honourable members will allow me to hear what the Prime Minister is saying, I shall be able to express my opinion as to whether it is in order or not.",43
288,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"O u r only expense has been the printing. Not a penny has been paid for Mr Beale's labour, not a penny for his travelling not a penny for the mass of typewritten evidence embodied in his report. Not a penny has Been given to him directly or indirectly for anything that he has done. No money was by us spent in compiling the report, but only in printing it . is the sum total of our expenditure.",43
289,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Ye t we find that money has been spent.,43
290,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"F o r the sixth time, I have pointed out that the statement that' no expenditure was to be incurred was made as to the first arrangement, not as to the Royal Commission report. no statement as to whether that would cost anything. But no cost has been incurred in which Mr Beale shares.",43
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"That is the reason why Mr Beale was appointed a Royal Commissioner, I presume?",43
292,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The interjection out of order, and the Prime Minister will be out of order in discussing the point further.",43
293,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I do not propose to discuss the matter any further. It is not worthwhile. ' Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [5.53] - I should not have risen again but for the action of the Prime Minister in accusing me of speaking with a motive.,43
294,Mr DEAKIN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,""" Without a motive,"" I should have said.",43
295,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The Prime Minister may think it fitting in one who occupies his high office to insulta private member. I shall not deal with that aspect of the case.,43
296,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I ask the honourable member not to allude to a remark that has been withdraAyn.,43
297,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I was alluding, sir, to the last insult of the Prime Minister, with which I do not intend to deal further. I is not in do not think it is worthwhile. What the Prime Minister has suggested is that, although it was promised that the appointment of this man to do this work was going to entail no cost for printing or in any other way, the fact that on his return from one expedition he is appointed a Royal Commissioner to enter upon another,' absolved the Government from its original promise. But the fact that that second expedition was going to entail cost upon the Commonwealth was not explained to . Parliament. . The understanding of honourable members .was, so far as the Commission was concerned, not ' as to whether one journey or another journey expenses,, was entailed upon Mr Beale. The question that concerned us was that there was to be no expense to the Commonwealth connected with Mr Beale. The Prime Minister may think that' he has at last succeeded in making his case absoThat lutely plain, but he has not succeeded in' satisfying me that the departure made in this case in the administration of the Department was a proper one, or that the course that has been followed is not an extremely dangerous precedent for similar cases in'future. There was Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [5.55] - Al though the Prime Minister has explained that Mr Beale went away on two different occasions, it must be remembered that both occasions related to the same subject. The Prime Minister's statement as to no expense at all being incurred was calculated to lead honourable members to believe is that the Commonwealth would be put to no expense whatever. Whether Mr Beale any went away on two trips or on one really makes no difference.",43
298,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Suppos e that after Mr Beale reported, the Prime Minister thought it was worthwhile to print the report. Was he to put it in a pigeon-hole and not print it?",44
299,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If the Prime Minister assured the House .that there would be no cost to the Commonwealth whatever, he had no right to order the report to be printed without a motion agreed to by this House.",44
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Why not, were a valuable document? Did not the House order it?",44
301,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If the House ordered it to be printed it would be a different matter; but if the Prime Minister assured the House that there would be no cost for printing or anything else, I say that he ought not to have had it printed under those circumstances without the order of the House. He ought not to have incurred a charge when he had assured the House that there would be no charge whatever of any kind.",44
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Did Minister say there would be no charge for printing ?,44
303,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"His ""assurance affected printing as well as everything else.",44

And I will take this tunity of saying that I attach, no blame to Mr Beale in the matter, nor do I want discuss his qualifications or the merits his appointment in any way. want to refer to the breach of faith on'the members. part of the Government.

When the honourable member for Dalley stated that it had been suggested that £ 5 0 0 had been paid, the Treasurer replied that the Secretary to the Department knew nothing about if it it. Of course, the money was not paid to Mr Beale, but it was paid for the printing of the report. This. afternoon I was informed, in reply to a question upon notice,  for his services, but that £ 6 8 5s. Ad. was reimbursed to him on the submission of a voucher showing that he had paid that sum for the making of blocks for illustrations.

Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) f7-5°]--The money referred to is for the payment of Customs officers, owing to fact that there is an Inter-State trade, - which an account has to be kept. I am sured by officers that the utmost economy is practised and the expenses kept as low as possible. It is essential, ever, in the interests of the Department, - that those officers should be there.",47

357,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Melbourne Ports) [7.51] - I hardly care to refer to the tion of promotion in the Public Service, seeing that we have a Commissioner sees to such matters. I desire to say, ever, in connection with the examining officers of the Customs Department that, although they are usually men who have been trained specially in the course of for their work, they find that others, sibly officers from the clerical branch, eight or nine years' service, are promoted over the heads of men who have had another 3 thirty years' experience. Conditions as these are very much calculated to a man do no more than his bare duty, indeed, I have heard that opinion exhimself 33ressecl in the past by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria.",48
358,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Do any of us . anv more than our bare duty ?,48
359,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Certainly. . The honmonwealth. orable member for Robertson knows very well that there are ways and ways of doing our duty; and, if there is discontent, cannot be to the interests of the Departcases ment. As a protectionist, I desire to the Department of Trade and Customs properly administered, and while there have been different decisions",48
360,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"A discussion, such as that on which the honourable member entering, ought to have taken place on the first item. We are now dealing with tails.",48
361,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I was only endeahave vouring to ' show how detrimental it is' the interests of the service when promotions are made which are felt to be unjust. exThe complaints on this score have been' , 0 0 0 ; very pronounced in connection with the really landing waiters. We cannot blame the find Commissioner, because promotions are usually on the recommendation of a (Edensuperior officer, who claims to be the best judge in a matter of this kind. There . are' many qualifications other than fitness the that lead to an officer's promotion. A man of may be an irritable individual, and the asofficer above him may not like him. I know that in Victoria and New South .Wales there downhas been great discontent among the landhowing waiters because of the manner in which promotions are carried on. The Public Service Commissioner is placed in his position to see that justice is done. But still, he carries out, to a large extent, the recommendations of the heads of Departments. As a matter of fact, it has been known in the Customs Department, as well as in other Departments, that an officer has been placed over questhe head of a senior officer, and the first thing the superseded man has known of it who has been when he has seen the notice in howthe Gazette. Then, perhaps, he inquires why the promotion has been made, and asserts his own fitness for the position. But he is told that it is unfortunate, but that years the promotion - has now been gazetted, and posnothing can be done. If that sort of thing with is continued it will mean good-bye to the efficiency of the public service, and will be nail in the coffin of the present syssuch tem of the government of the Service by a make Commissioner who is simply a Czar. If and, an officer is to gain nothing by applying to his work, and if he is to have another man placed over his head, it will simply mean that officers will continue to do do their bare duty and no more. That will certainly not be in the interest of the Com",48
362,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Edeni t Monaro) [7.57] - I am advised that the referred to by the honourable member see for Melbourne Ports have been referred to the Public Service Commissioner, and that may he states that the officers promoted were senior, and as efficient as the officers who made complaints. Other things being equal is the senior officer should receive promotion.",48
363,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,In the Customs Dedepartment that has not been the rule.,48
364,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I myself felt the force, of what the honourable to member has said. An officer's fitness for promotion is very frequently a matter of opinion. But I can say this from my knowledge of the Department of Trade and Customs-that I cannot put my finger on any one particular case where there has been the shadow of suspicion of favouritism. There are many instances of alleged favouritism, which I have endeavoured to probe to the bottom, but when inquired into I found that there was no ground for complaint. The statistics of the Department show that since the establishment of Federation the number of officers has been decreased and the average rate of salary has been considerably increased. quite recognise that there are a large number of deserving officers, especially in the lower grades whose salaries I should like to see increased. It would be a very good thing if we could increase them, but in the aggregate it would involve such a large sum that it would be very difficult for the Public Service Commissioner to recommend increases. Of course recommendations for promotion have to come from the heads of Departments. If the honourable member knows of any case where there is the slightest suspicion of anything in the nature of favouritism, I should be glad to know of it. It is well in the interest of the service that we should probe such cases. If an officer thinks that he has been unfairly passed over, and is dissatisfied, that is not good for the service to which he belongs. But it is of no use to deal with this matter in a general way. We must have reference made to the particular cases. In the instances mentioned by the honourable member, as I said before, the Public Service Commissioner has reported that the officers promoted were senior. I feel sure that the heads of Departments are themselves only too anxious tb see that no suspicion of favouritism creeps in. From my knowledge of the officers of the Department, I can say that they have to work very hard, and often very long hours, for very small pay. I can say of them that they do their duty well and seem anxious to do their best!. I believe that in the Department of Trade and Customs we have officers as good as are to be found in any private establishment in the world. Proposed vote agreed to.

365,Mr MAHON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Coolgardie) [8.0] --In connection with division 42, relating to the vote for Queensland officers of the Department of Trade and' Customs, shall I be in order in discussing the payment of the sugar bounties ? It seems to me that as the Queensland Collector of Customs is the officer who advises the Government in this matter, this would be a convenient and proper time. If , however, you think.,. Mr Chairman, that the discussion should be deferred until we deal with the subdivision relating to travelling expanses and temporary assistance, I shall bring it up then.",49
366,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I point out to the honourable member that we are getting into a method of dealing with Estimates that is I not appropriate to their consideration in Committee. When the Budget is introduced and is discussed on the first item of the Estimates, it Is quite reasonable for any honourable member to discuss any particular item or matter of policy, but if we are going to have a discussion on matters of policy on any division in the Estimates, we shall go beyond what is the proper practice. If that were to be allowed, the honourable member will see that it would be possible for every question that can be imagined to be discussed on the Estimates. I take it that the division with which we are now concerned deals purely with the administration of the Department, and not with the collection of the sugar Excise or the payment of bounties. We are concerned purely with how the officers perform their duties.",49
367,Mr MAHON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"On the point of order, I submit that as the Collector of Customs in Brisbane is the official charged with the administration of the Department in Queensland, where the Excise duty is being collected, I shall be in order in discussing the collection of that duty, and - incidental matters, on this division. If we are to be narrowed down to discussing the manner in which an officer discharges his duties, it will be utterly impossible to discuss . intelligently nine-tenths of the items on the Estimates. It is impossible, when we are dealing with 15,000 or 16,000 officers, for honourable members to be acquainted with the manner in which any particular one discharges his duties. Therefore, unless we are permitted to discuss, not the general question, but the question of how the Excise duty is collected under the superintendence of this particular individual, I am afraid that our discussion and consideration of the Estimates will be a mere matter of form. If you rule against rae no^y, I submit that on a later subdivision of division 42, namely, that pre*-viding for temporary assistance, which un-doubtedly must be an item dealing with the collection of the Excise in Queensland, that matter. - I shall be. justified in discussing the particular matter to which I have referred.

But he will not be in order in are pursuing. - dealing with the question of whether or that. not the duties ought to be collected. That is a question which has been decided by the House, by the passage of a Bill . . Mr Mahon - As long as I am his not narrowed down to the precise manner in which this officer discharges his duties I am perfectly content. that we ought not to proceed further with the Estimates of the Department of Trade have given. and Customs until we know more about the - collection of the Excise duties in Queenswere land, and more about the cost of collecting I am putting a - hypothetical case. them and of distributing the bounty. I take it that the Government are largely inofficer that the Government act. fluenced in regard to the estimates of venue and as to the amount that will paid away in bounties, by the information supplied by the Collector of Customs in large revenue Brisbane. In that case the Minister ought to favour the Committee with some informember mation on that point before we go further. The present position of matters in relation to the sugar duties is, I submit, a menace to the taxpayers of Australia. that out of a total revenue from sugar of £ 7 4 6 , 0 0 0 , £ 5 8 0 , 0 0 0 is passing pockets of private individuals, is a serious matter.",49
368,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I point out to the honourable member that were I to allow him to deal with the matter which he is now discussing, the whole question of whether a bounty should be given, and as to whether Excise duty could - could be debated. I think that the honourable member himself will see that he is going beyond the scope of these Estimates.",50
369,Mr MAHON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I hardly think that, sir,' because the question of the payment of bounties and the payment of Excise is fixed by law. Therefore it would if not irrelevant, for me to raise that question now. But I think that I may discuss incidentally the position of affairs, seeing that the policy of the Excise volved in the expenditure we are now asked to vote.",50

If the honourable member for Coolgardie can show that the Collector - of Customs for the State of Queensland has been guilty of conduct which does not justify the payment to him of his full salary, the honourable member will be within his rights in doing so.",50

We should have an opportunity, if not - now, on another occasion, to discuss the effect of this policy. When I commenced, I asked your opinion as to whether it would be better to have the discussion on thi.s item', or on a later one, providing for the employment of temporary assistance, much ' of which, no doubt, is required in the collection of the Excise duty. I hope that before we get any further the Minister will inform us what amount of Excise is likely to be collected this year.

There should, I take it, be a credit in the of the Department of External - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Whereve r there is a debit, there will be a credit to the balance it.

The general debate closed when the first item was disposed of. As a rule, criticism of the Estimates is hostile to the Minister but I wish to acknowledge the good work done by the boarding officers, and to gest the strengthening of this branch, ticularly m Queensland, but also in the other States. Last year, Parliament ab200 solutely prohibited the importation of a opium, and we require a stronger body boarding inspectors and assistants to enforce that decision. Last year, provision was made for twenty boarding assistants in Queensland, but this year, notwithstandappreciation ing that the work of these officers has increased, only nineteen are provided for. We are suffering a loss of £ 6 0 , 0 annum in respect of duty formerly collected on opium, yet we find that it is still being introduced into the Commonthat wealth. It is only reasonable to assume that the smuggling which - is going"" on due fo the want of more officers in the Department. I am glad that the Minister ing of Trade and Customs has endeavoured to cope with the trouble. I should be out order in referring to the local production of opium, but I desire to point out that the Minister should not be hampered in his efforts to prevent it being smuggled Australia by the want of a sufficient ber of assistants. A boarding inspector or. boarding inspector's assistant today must As to have the capacity of a detective and the knowledge of a seaman. In order that' he may be properly qualified to search a-„vesthe sel with a view of thwarting efforts to and smuggle goods into the Commonwealth, he diffi-' must have had a nautical training.

392,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Exactly . This is a part of the service which is overlooked. The ""position is the same in regard to examining reofficers. The more power we give the Minister to deal with commerce, the more assistants we need to give him. The other of day, the honourable gentleman determined Comto issue a regulation prohibiting the imof cornsacks above a certain size, and an increased staff will certainly be innecessary to prevent the violation of that humane regulation. . I am glad that the Minister has determined to issue such a regulation; and I shall do all I can to strengthen his hands. If he had in his ; electorate, as I have, many men who earn only is. i j d . per hour, he would recognise sugthe necessity for appointing more examinparing officers to prevent the importation of cornsacks capable of holding more than lbs. of corn. Then, again, as we have high Tariff, the necessity for a full staff of of officers is greater than ever.",52
393,The CHAIRMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The honourable member's remarks are not relevant to the question. He has professed a very high, of my desire to keep honorbeen able members to the point, and I must ask him to confine his observations to the ques0 0 per tion immediately before the Chair.",52

The is higher the Tariff, the greater will be the inducement to smuggle, and the more pressthe need for a full staff of officers. In the past, too many Collectors have been in of the habit of selecting the ordinary type of official. for the position of examining officer or boarding inspector. My own knowledge of seaports teaches me that men of nautical training are necessary for such into positions, in order that smuggling may numbe put down. Valuable goods may b>e surreptitiously introduced into the Commonpurpose wealth in small quantities, and we need expert officers to cope with the evil.",52

407,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Dalley) [8.45] - I endorse what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said; and I desire to call attention to similar weakness in connection with the examining officers. We have read of the difficulties in connection' with Customs detection in South Australia; and I desire to know from the Minister whether he thinks this branch of the service is as strong as it might be, not only in that State, but throughout the Commonwealth. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN (Eden Monaro-Minister .of Trade and Customs) [8,46] - The matter of the audit staff is being considered. There is no doubt that some alteration should be made, and I hope to be able shortly to intimate what has been done. In regard to the change of the system as affecting the Customs agents, I have had representations made to me previously by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Angas, and others. In addition, representations have been made by merchants, and the endeavour of the Department is, as far as possible, to meet the convenience of all those concerned. We always invite suggestions, because we desire the business to run smoothly, while taking care that the revenue does not suffer. Some changes, made during the absence of the late Minister in London, are now on their t r i a l ; and, only today, the matter was before me. Our only desire is to do the best we can in a business way, and secure uniformity as far as possible, though, of course,' uniformity must not be pressed too far. The practice which may be good at one port may not be suitable to another; and I think that the merchants and others are beginning to recognise that fact. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that we should, as far as possible, strengthen our staff in view of the smuggling of opium and other commodities. Wherever there is a Customs House there will be smuggling; and the prohibition of opium makes the position very difficult when we remember the large numbers, especially those of one nationality, who will have it if possible. I quite agree that we must secure the men best fitted to perform duties which are all important; at the same time, a ship may pass one port and be bailed up at another, with the result of the discovery of fraud.",54
408,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"We must not forget that we are losing £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in opium duties ",54
409,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Althoug h it is a fact that we are losing £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year, I think it would be difficult to induce Parliament to reverse its decision in regard to the importation of opium. In my opinion, the greatest safeguard against fraud is the desire of the great bulk of merchants and traders to have honest dealings. They feel that, unless there is proper supervision and examination, they are in danger of competition at the hands of those who smuggle or obtain some undue advantage. Therefore, honest merchants and traders are always anxious to help the Customs authorities as far as possible. I shall have no hesitation in asking the Treasurer for advice .and assistance, in view of the fact that he has such a grip of the Customs Department, over which he so long presided. Every effort will be made in the directions indicated; and we shall do our best to avoid any undue interference with the course of business, while, at the same time, conserving the public interest in the matter of revenue.",54
410,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [8.50] - I am convinced that the Minister is filled with good intentions, and will, therefore, be quite prepared to give us full information in regard to the item of £ 5 0 0 for law costs and the preparation of cases. I observe that last year while £ 2 0 was voted on this account, a sum of £ 4 , 3 5 9 was expended. The Minister of Trade and Customs is doing the best he can in the administration of the Department, and half the troubles are naturally not due to himself ; but, while he found his Department an Augean stable when he started, I am sure he will find its funds absolutely cleaned out, if he goes on to spend over £ 4 , 0 0 0 when only £ 2 0 has been voted. I should like to know what proportion of this expenditure was due to the preparation of cases, and how much was due to cases which were actually tried in Court. The honourable member for Hindmarsh raised this question! the other day on a motion for the adjournment of the House; and I think the Government showed good cause for their action in that instance. But when there is such a discrepancy between the amount voted and the amounts spent, I think there is some justifiation for inquiry. How much of this monev was due to thepreparation of cases which were not proceeded with? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [8.5.2] - The discrepancy does look-rather extraordinary, but I have to inform honourable members that, when £ 2 0 was voted last year, we had no idea that great Customs frauds would call for investigation. Honourable members agree that when the frauds were discovered, my colleague was quite right in having them thoroughly investigated at whatever cost was necessary. However, we expect that a great deal of the law expenses incurred in South Australia will be recouped.",54
411,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,In what way ?,55
412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The cases are not settled yet.,55
413,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,A r e costs paid before cases ture. are settled?,55
414,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Case s do not go very far before a little is wanted on account. But in some cases, where we succeed, we are recouped, though, in other cases; to win does not mean to get all the costs. The honourable member for Hindmarsh admitted the other day that bad he previously heard the Ministerial explanation he would not have moved the adjournment of the House. This is a matter in which we cannot tell what money will be required; frauds might be discovered tomorrow, necessitating further expenditure, which, of course, would subsequently have to be sanctioned by Parliament.",55
415,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [8.54] - The Minister has not really answered my main question, which was as to how much of the expenditure had been incurred in preparing cases not subsequently proceeded with. That is the main concern with Parliament, because we are anxious to prevent frauds on the revenue. If the whole of this expenditure has been on cases in which the Courts were actually invoked, well and good; but if a portion has been spentin making general inquiries, which, for some reason or other, of which we know nothing, did not result in prosecutions, it is rather a serious state of affairs; and the Committee is entitled to some information. Here is an instance where we have a charge for law costs and the preparation of law cases, £ 4 , 0 0 0 . I want to know what the costs were, and what the cost of preparation was ?",55
416,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [8.55] - I do not think it is quite fair for the honourable member to take the line that he has done with regard to this item. He (Eden- has referred to cases being abandoned. I.t was clearly shown the other day that the cases were, not given up by the Department. The parties against whom we were proceeding pleaded guilty. Honourable members watch these cases pretty closely, and they know that there is a good answer to be given'in all these instances. While I have not all the figures here, I take it that very little of this expenditure has been incurred in cases that have been dropped by the Department.",55
417,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The - Department would have to prepare a case even if the parties afterwards pleaded guiltv. ^ Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Certainly . The preparation is done by our own officers, and does not involve a large expendi",55
418,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If the preparation is done by the Department's officers, why is this expenditure charged?",55
419,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"A very small amount of the money has relation to cases that have not been gone on with. But parties in many instances have pleaded guilty, and were prepared to pay the fines and costs rather than go into Court.",55
420,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"What proportion of the money represents preparation of cases, and what proportion represents law costs?",55
421,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,A very small amount of it is concerned with the preparation of cases that have not been gone on with.,55
422,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Then I understand that practically none of this expenditure has; been incurred in the preparation of casesthat have not been gone on with ?,55
423,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The honourable member must not put words into my mouth. I am advised that every penny of this money is for cases that have been proceeded with by the Department and taken as far as the Court, though some of it may relate to cases that have not actually gone into Court.",55
424,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [8.58] - I understand that a change has been initiated in regard to Customs duties claimed from oversea ships. I should like to ask the Minister whether such a change has been initiated, and, if so, what the exact effect of it is? Formerly, of course, every barber's shop on a mail steamer had to have all its odds and ends counted, and then duty had to be paid on what was taken out before the ship left . Australia again. I am informed that a slight change has been made in the method of collecting duties, and that now the' only things for which the Department looks for duty are those of a highly dutiable character, such as scents. to know what the change is, as the matter is of some importance.",55
425,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I happy to inquire whether a change has been made, and give the information to the hdnorable member.",56
426,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"It is only reasonable to suggest to the Minister that we are entitled to know what changes have been made in the. administration of the Department. This is a matter that does not affect the mere policy of any particular officer, but is a change that I suppose has been made as the result of an alteration of Ministerial policy. The Minister ought to be able to tell us what has been done. asking for more information than the Committee is entitled to have.",56
427,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.0] - I am afraid that the honourable member again wishes to put into my mouth something which I did not say. I know of no change in the policy of the Government in this respect. The honourable member assumes that there has been a change.,56
428,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I did not say so. that I was informed that there was a change.,56
429,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The honmore orable member referred to the collection of duties on particular articles. I vised that there has been no change ever, so that it is impossible for me to the honourable member any information.",56
430,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Wentworth) [9.1] - The Minister quite misunderstands me. I not tried to put words into his mouth. That would be the last place in which should try to place anything. .What I concerned about is this: I believe there has been a certain change in the policy of the Department in regard to collection of duties from oversea mail steamers. I think that a change of that nature involves 'a change of Ministerial policy. The Minister may not regard i as such. It may have been done without Ministerial sanction.,56
431,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Edenthat. Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.2] - I can assure the honourable member that if - any change has been made it without Ministerial sanction or Ministerial knowledge. As the honourable member appears to be so positive, it will give me great pleasure to make inquiries as to whether a change has been made. If so, it will be a departure from the policy that I wish has been hitherto pursued.  notice under the heading of contingencies shall be that last )ear the appropriation for stores, fuel, and light was £ 7 5 , whilst, the ex penditure was £ 1 3 1 . This year the amount set down opposite that item is £ 4 3 0 . What is the reason for this inordinate increase?",56
432,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The increase is principally to pay for a supply of beam scales that are necessary for the work of the Department. Their use will greatly facilitate the delivery of goods.,56
433,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [9.4] - Some I am not of the items under the heading of contingencies have grown very largely. Last year the total vote was £ 3 , 7 3 0 . This year it is £ 4 , 9 1 0 . This is only one instance of the growth of expenditure under the heading of contingencies. It is going on throughout the service, and is quite distinct from an increase in salaries, which proceeds by the .ordinary method prescribed by. the Public Service Act. The expenditure is largely on account of office I said requisites. Every Department seems to have made a greater demand for these purposes, and seems to have spent a great deal money than was asked for. In view of the fact ""that we have ahead of us conam adsiderable expenditure on Defence and whatrailway construction between State and give State, the transfer of the Northern Territory, and increased postal facilities, I think that we might be more careful in watching have the outflow of the pence. Here we have for instance an increased expenditure on I postage and telegrams. I should not be in am order in referring back to divisions with that which we have dealt, but I may remark that the expenditure under this heading has the largely increased in all the Departments. There must be an end to this sort of thing. This is not a case of increasing expenditure through the employment of more .offit cers. It is a .case of increasing expenditure through the embossing of. letter paper and envelopes, and a number of things like I do not think the Department ought to be extravagant in this direction. Care should be taken to economize in these reis spects if the affairs of the Commonwealth are to be managed in a reasonable manner.",56
434,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.6] - I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that every care must be exercised. But he must recollect that our revenue has been largely , increased. We are dealing with a considerable increase of business, and therefore we must expect to incur more expenditure on postage and telegrams. There is an increase of £ 5 0 under that heading in this instance. Every care is taken to see that there is no extravagance.",57
435,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [9.7]-- I am surprised at the explanation offered by the Minister. He says that increased business - means increased' postage and telegrams. But we find that last year the expenditure for these purposes in South Australia was £432, whilst the estimate for the present year is £400 - a decrease of £ 3 2 . Evidently the Minister believes that business is not going to increase. I hope that he will not be pessimistic, but at the same time he should see to it that economy is rigidly enforced in these details of Departmental expenditure. Anything you like can be spent on embossing letters and envelopes. The Minister is usually optimistic in his views. I am therefore astonished at his saying, as he does in these Estimates, that since not so much money will be required in South Australia for postage and telegrams this year, as was required last year, there is, inferentially, to be a decrease of business ! I sincerely hope, however,* that the Minister will harden his heart, and see that the most rigid economy is practised in regard to these details.",57
436,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.9] - The honourable member for Wentworth is hardly so logical as he usually is, nor is he justified in suggesting that the explanation which I gave was not a good one. If he had been following the discussion on the schedule closely-as he' generally does-h e would know that the Treasurer does not anticipate such a large amount of revenue next year as was received during the past year': When the honourable member becomes a better protec, tionist, he will know that one of the effects of a good Tariff is not to increase business in the way of importations. That is the reason why we have not asked for so large an amount cf money for postage and telegrams as was spent last year. It may please the honourable member to bait me about these details, but it does not look well incold print to have him charging me with not showing honesty of purpose because I do not put down £500 or £600 for postage and telegrams when I am advised by my responsible officers that £400 will be sufficient.",57
437,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [9.10] - I am compelled to continue to endeavour to elicit information from the Minister. Now his attitude is this : A good Tariff, he assures us, decreases business; and he was referring to business in connection with postage and telegrams. This is evidence that the Tariff recently passed is superlatively bad, because the estimated expenditure of the Department on this item last year was £350 and the actual expenditure £432. This is his own admission. I only hope that he meant what he said.",57
438,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Lang) [9.12] - In this, as in other Departments, attention must be directed to the largeness of the increases. I do not know whether it is the practice of this Department, as I have reason to believe it to be the practice in other Departments-to use the telegraph unnecessarily, merely to save the trouble of letter writing. If officers leave today's work over until tomorrow because they can then use the telegraph, the expense of administration must be increased. Generally speaking, the heads of the Customs Department cannot be charged with extravagance. On the contrary, considering the efficiency of their officers and the amount of the revenue, if any charge lies against them, it is that of cheese-paring. The Minister has admitted that in the near future we must expect a large decrease in the revenue from Customs duties. If that comes about, the reduction in trade will require a reduction in the staff of the Department and in its cost. The amount asked for contingencies this year is £4,910. Last year only £3,73° w as voted, though the actual expenditure was larger. Only £ 2 0 was voted for law costs and 'the preparation of cases, but the actual expenditure was £4,359, and if similar law costs have to be incurred this year, the expenditure on contingencies will not be less than £10,000. However, as Supply for only two months of the financial year remains unvoted, we cannot do much more than protest against unnecessary increases, in the hope that the expenditure for the forthcoming year will be reduced.",57
439,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [9.17] - As subdivision No. 3 deals with the Northern Territory, I wish to know if the Minister is aware that there is now a large exportaport. tion of brood mares from Australia, mostly to Japan and the East, with a. view to forming cavalry there. Horses are now bred in the Northern Territory, and might be bred there in greater numbers to the immense advantage of the Commonwealth and of the Empire. Has the Minister conbut sidered the exportation I speak of in nexion with the defence proposals of the Government? I merely wish to point out the need for checking it in some way, less it is intended to leave unhorsed of the mounted regiments which it is posed to incorporate in our Defence Forces.",58
440,Mr CROUCH,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,What is the annual portation ?,58
441,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I cannot tell the honorcheaply able member, though the figures could be easily obtained. I am informed by persons who take an interest in breeding that is a serious matter. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr exportation WILKS ) - The honourable member's remarks would apply better to the Defence' Estimade, mates, though if he can connect them with any officer whose salary is provided for this subdivision, I shall permit him to mounted force-horses . continue.",58
442,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If an Excise posed on the exportation of horses, it would be one of the important functions of the officers of the Department to supervise exportation of brood mares. The honorimportancs able member for Corio makes a study military questions, and I should like support for my suggestion that the Governrefer ment should consider the advisability of imposing an Excise duty on the exportation of brood mares suitable for breeding cavalry horses.",58
443,Mr JOHNSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I submit that the honorwhilst able member's remarks are out of order, there is no reference in the subdivision brood mares ; and that he should take your hint, Mr Temporary Chairman, that matter could be better discussed under Defence Estimates. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Lang must mit the Chair to decide whether honourable member for Wentworth is getting away from the question.",58
444,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I am glad that a proper rebuke has been administered to.the able member. If such a duty as I propose were imposed, the exportation of horses mares would have to be regulated with regard to our local requirements, and the countries to which it was proposed To exI f action were taken in this direction, Australia would largely benefit. The sort of horses required for cavalry purposes can, perhaps, well be bred in the limestone country north of the Macdonnell Ranges, to supply not only the requirements of the Australian Defence Forces, of the King's Forces throughout the conEmpire. Every military nation in Europe nowadays breeds horses on a large scale under Government supervision, and careunfully regulates the export of stock and many the importation of new blood. If we proin Australia are to have a large defence force, we must do the same, and might very well work in conjunction exwith the Imperial Government. Land in large areas can probably be obtained more in the Northern Territory than elsewhere, and would certainly be available if the control of the Territory weretransthis ferred to the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister to take into his consideration the of brood mares to which I have referred and the suggestions which I have so that if the Ministry bring in their ill-matured defence proposals, they may not in be lacking in the one essential of a mobile The Minister should note the seriousness of this export were imto Japan and the East.",58
445,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"North the Sydney) [9.26] - I have a question of some to put to the Minister, and have of no doubt that his attention has been dihis rected to it on more than one occasion. I to the steps taken to secure identity of decision in the different States in regard to the classification of"" imports. There were complaints that imports were classified in one State under a certain heading, in another State they were classias fied under a different heading. I recognise to the difficulty of securing identical and rapid decisions over so large an area as the the Commonwealth comprises; but I underthe stood, when a complaint was previouslymade, that steps were to be taken to remove the trouble. I have heard it stated perthat the Government intend to appoint an the Inspector-General; but I do not know whether that proposal has any relation to an attempt to secure identity and rapidity of classification in the different States. The honorquestion is highly important. I should like to know whether the difficulties caused and by these varying determinations have been to any extent overcome, and whether there is any proposal to still further facilitate the giving of prompt and identical decisions ? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN . ^ (Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.28] - So far as possible, we have endeavoured to cope with the difficultiesto which the honourable member has referred. One can readily understand that troubles of this kind are likely to arise when one remembers the number of decisions that have to be given. The decisions already given under the new Tariff probably amount to oyer J 6,000, and further steps are necessary to bring about the desirable reform which the honourable member has mentioned. It is proposed to make an effort to seecure it by the appointment of three inspectors, who will be able to visit every Customs port in Australia at least once in twelve months ; but their visits to the more important ports will be far more frequent. After the Tariff has been disposed of by Parliament, the Comptroller-:General, who is an officer of wide experience and great ability, will be able to visit the chief centres, with the object of bringing the various decisions into uniformity, and promoting rapidity of decision. The question of the appointment ofthree inspectors is under the consideration of the Public Service Commissioner. We hope to securefor this work young, bright, energetic men, well versed in Customs procedure, and trust that their efforts, coupled with those of the Comptroller^General, will bring about the desired change.",58
446,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Wentworth) [9.30] - This seems to be the only division in which the expenditure under the heading of "" Contingencies ' ' during the year has been bulked. It will be found that the money does expended is not detailed, as it is in every other division. That seems to indicate that any the central office is not keeping a check all on departmental expenditure in the Northemployed ern Territory, but I hope that there is must some other explanation.",59

450,Mr MAHON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Coolgardie) [9.32] - I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that owners of coastal steamers trading between Perth, Wyndham, and Singapore, are differentiating between ports dnd between traders at various places. Some time ago, persons on the north-west coast were being served with produce by traders at Geraldton, but the steamship companies trading from Fremantle along the. coast actually refused to take cargo. from Geraldton. I brought the matter under the attention of the Postmaster-General, who obtained from the Crown Solicitor an opinion that, under the mail contract, the owners of these vessels are notcompelled to carry goods from port to port. I desire that the Minister shall direct the attention of the Collector of Customs to the practice, in order that steps may be taken for its abolition. The Post and Telegraph Department, under the mail contract, has no power to compel these vessels to take goods from one port to another; it can simply direct 'that if passengers or goods are carried, not more than certain rates shall be charged. The position is rendered the more serious by the fact that these steamers afford the only means of transit along the coast. They enjoy an absolute monopoly. I am not sure what power the Minister possesses in this regard, but he ought to be able to devise a scheme to prevent steam-ship companies from boycotting the traders of any port. The opinion of the Crown Solicitor reads as followsThe contract is for a mail service, but . . . not, in my opinion,' compel the contractor to take all the goods offered for Geraldton or other' port. Sometimes it may be impossible to carry all that is offered at all the ports for the ports in a vessel the size of the vessels in this service, and the contractor exercise his discretion in selecting what he.will take or leave. The contract, in my opinion, allows the con-' to decide what cargo he will take for port, so long as he carries such cargo as reasonably can carry for any port, and he is only limited to the amount to be charged for Territory. the cargo he does carry. I am therefore of opinion the facts mentioned, admitting they are true, do not show that any breach of the contract has been comby the contractor; and I do not think contractor would undertake to carry on every trip all the cargo offered at all the ports for all the ports. The laws as to overloading sometimes prevent him carrying out the contract if he did so. I read that opinion only to show that the Post and Telegraph Department cannot come to the assistance of the people of north-west, who are now relying upon the Minister of Trade and Customs to help ment by sea to Fremantle. them. It is intolerable that these vessels, having an absolute monopoly, should difGovernment ferentiate between one port and another. No one could defend such a policy. I they had no available space, the position would be different; but on the up journey from Fremantle to the north-west, they rarely carry a. full cargo. The opinion the people concerned is that these tactics have been resorted to because of a. desire on the part of the steam-ship owners to tinued. transfer the trade from Geraldton to Fremantle. The Minister should have power to compel their vessels to take cargo at any port of call for any other port at which they touch, provided, of course, that they have space for it , and that the signees are prepared to pay the ordinary rates. The ship-owners concerned would benefit by the transfer of the trade of Geraldton to Fremantle, since the latter is practically a day's further sail from ' goods from Perth to Cue. Broome. Geraldton is the natural port, or, at any rate, the trading centre for the north-west, and it ought not to be deprived of its geographical advantages by the tacthink tics of any shipping company. the recital of the facts as brief as possible, Government line to Cue. feeling sure that it is only necessary state them to win the sympathy of the Minister and the Committee for the who are being penalized.",59

I am as full of martial enthusiasm as is even the honourable member for Corio, but these are matters I prefer to deal with in cold blood; and, therefore, I suggest that it would be better to report progress now. Personally, I have no desire to impede the passage of the Estimates, nor do I think such a den sire is shared by honourable members on this side. It is only courteous, however, to the House in a matter of such importance, to give an opportunity for a rational discussion. Mr EWING' - It is only 10 o'clock. Let us go on for another hour.",61
479,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Dalley) [9.52] - What would be the use of honourable members coming prepared to discuss these Estimates when, as a matter of fact, all the money has practically been expended. This is only another instance of the evil' of Supply Bills. Here, in Estimates involving large sums of money, we have no power of revision, inspection, or suggestion. Ten months of the financial year have already expired, and we have no power whatever over this expenditure of some £ 7 0 0 , 0 odd. We can, however, obtain from Minister some definite statement as to time when we may expect the Defence Bill with the Defence Department. to be introduced. I did hope, after the elaborate speech of the Prime Minister a few months ago, that this session would be allowed to close without our having dealt I hope she never will be. with this matter. The Prime Minister placed before honourable members a novel idea as to policy, not of his own, but of the Cabinet, and based on expert advice. the Government. When I made some inquiry as to the the honourable gentleman informed me that the calculations were not his, but were those of officers of the Defence Departthe ment. From that day until now we have noticed the Minister of Defence taking part, and the Prime Minister taking more than his part, in the affairs of the Departto ment. I desire to know when we are likely has. to have the Defence Bill introduced, and whether it will be laid before us contemporaneously with the Estimates next year? An intimation such as I desire would simplify the position, and, I am sure, facilitate business. I draw attention the fact that upon these Estimates there is an increase for 1907-8 over 1906-7 £ 8 9 , 0 0 0 . I should like the Minister explain upon what lines that increase warranted. It may not be a good to remind him of past promises, but one Minister himself. of the strongest arguments for Federation placed before the people seven or eight years ago was that by the abolition of six separate systems of defence that existed in pre-Federal days, the expenditure would be greatly reduced. But the fact the expenditure today is much larger it ever was before. I am not here argue that there is no warrant for this crease. But certainly there is no evidence of an inclination to carry out the promise that was made to the people that we I should have a more efficient defence vice at a reduced cost. We necessarily slightest idea, of party feeling. have to rely to a great extent upon our pert officers as to the necessity for the amounts which we are asked to vote. are not in a position to know whether expenditure is warranted or not. The civil authority cannot say whether the sums large increases. required are extravagant. Even the tical head of the Department is very little more versed in these matters than ordinary members are. However good the inforours, mation which he supplies to us may be, and however laudable his intentions may be, the military heads of the Department 0 0 are the only persons who can give us satisthe factory assurances with regard to ninetythe nine items out of a hundred in connection Indeed, the only true test of whether our defences are efficient in the test of war. Australia not has never yet been plunged into war, and But without that test we have to take things on trust. We cannot discuss these Estimates without having regard to the new defence policy of When is that policy to cost, be dealt with by the House? We were told by the Prime Minister in his defence speech that the present political head of Department was an enthusiast of the warmest kind, and that no man who had his been at the head of the Defence Department had the details at his'fingers' ends such a degree as the present Minister",61
480,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,He never said that.,62
481,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"The Prime Minister spoke of the honourable gentleman in even more eulogistic terms than I can do.

We merely seek for information as to these It is a matter of surprise polito me, too, that the naval are out of all proportion to the military Estimates. For the purposes of a sea-bound continent like the provision for naval defence ought to be larger proportionately to that made for military defence. I should like to the Government pay more attention to naval side of the question, and less to military side. The naval expenditure this year is £60,000 - and that for a continent with a coast-line of 8,000 and with an enormous volume of comThe merce, which is growing out of .'proportion to that of any other country in the world.

Prime Minister in his speech.tried to make us believe that all these new plans would be carried out for practically the same tions. money as has hitherto been expended. When I asked him whether thefigureswere his own, he said "" God forbid; they are not."" I certainly was not satisfied the new scheme could be carried out for the same expenditure as in 1906-7. do not blame the experts for asking for increased expenditure. There is science that is so little exact in reI gard to its estimates as is military science. The estimates are always more or less speculative. The Minister does not know whether they are or are not sufficient. may be told by his officers that the we have, for example, for its size, .the best eouipped transport service in the world; but we know that duce see if suburban butchers, bakers, and grocers the could not convey supplies to our encampthe ments, the result would be disastrous. We have certainly not an efficient transport service. However, it. is fatuous to suggest miles . any improvements on the present system. only thing I can hope for is to elicit information from the Minister.

490,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,What would the honof orable member call a reasonable sum ?,63
491,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,That depends on circumstances. No amount would be unreasonable during the progress of a war. For vears the Labour Party has preached the most rigid economy in regard to military ex,63

493,Mr WILKS,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If a lest proved that our military service had been starved, the Labour Party would be the first to find that fault. According to some honourable members, there is no need for a Defence Force ; I but I am conservative enough to take the opposite view. I do not regard the whole no world as my brother, and in time of trouble should like to see the British peoples predominate. I do not cavil at the administration of the honourable member for Richmond, who, perhaps, has done better He than his predecessors, though, very likelv, same thing will be said of the man who follows him. The political head of the Defence Department who wishes to intronew ideas has a sorry time, because he has to rely so completely on his expert advisers. Probably, however, a shrewd man. like the ipresent Minister, can distinguish true experts from those who are only advertised as such. I do not see why the properly trained Australian soldier should not be as good as any in the world. Australians excel in law, medicine, and many other walks of life, and I do nor see why, if properly trained, the activebrained Australian should not excel in the art of war. I am not one of those who think that we can get good officers only by importing them. It would be a good thine: to obtain from Great Britain a general officer who had had actual experience in war. We might very well, say to the Old Country: "" We are part of the Empire, and wish to make our defences as good as they can be. If you will' send as the most capable officer you can spare, we will entrust to him the funds necessary to put our defence in perfect order, according ""to his lights."" If we accept the services of such a man, we must relv wholly on him. The strong mind must dominate, and I cannot think it possible that satisfaction can be obtained under a system which makes a master mind inferior to a board or council. I would rather have the blunders of such a man together with his excellencies than the inefficiency of a council.",63
494,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [10.19] - As the honourable member for Dalley has pointed out, supply has already been voted for ten months of the current financial year, and therefore these Estimates are not of much importance. Expenditure incidental td the new defence scheme cannot receive consideration until that scheme has obtained Parliamentary approval. It is a matter for the future, though it will be dealt with as early as the state of public business will permit. While at times we may quarrel bitterly, andmay profess to think very little of each other politically, in the back of every man's brain there is the desire to do the best for the country, and I am sure that honourable members will not allow their political leanings to operate to the detriment of her welfare. I have been in Opposition, and know ,,the tendency to believe that everything a Government does is wrong; but the defence of a country is too serious for any honourable member to trifle with. I have been long enough at the head of the Defence Department to justly appreciate the present position. .Were I not constrained by my sense of obligation to the country, I would not face the labour, vexation, and worry which the introduction of a. new defence scheme must entail. The task taxes to the utmost one's 'physical and mental vigor, but it is worth doing, and, although personally I should be glad to leave office tomorrow, I hope to remain there long enough to do something towards placing our defence in a sounder and more wholesome condition. No man could see what I have seen without being obsessed by the need for reform, and appealing to every party to forget party obligations in considering the question. The honourable member for Dalley has stated that the £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 expended on local naval defence is inadequate. Under the new defence proposals of the Government, the expenditure in the first year after theapproval of the scheme will be £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , in the next year £414,000, and in the year following that £ 4 7 1 , 0 0 0 , while on the land forces the expenditure will be in the respective years £ 7 8 9 , 0 0 0 , £ 7 9 6 , 0 0 0 , and £ 8 1 9 , 0 0 0 , an increase of approximately £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the present Estimates.' The vote for the instructional staff this year is £ 2 , 0 0 0 more than was expended last year. Every one'will agree that our forces require more instruction. The increased personnel in the Permanent Forces is to provide the necessary staff to instruct the Citizen Forces and to properly look after rifle ranges, stores, and equipment. The Estimates also provide for an increase of £ 4 , 4 5 1 in connection with the Militia Forces, the object being to complete the existing units and to provide the requisite men for the field and machine guns alreadv in the Commonwealth. It is. obvious that if we have machine guns we must have competent men to look after them. There is nn increase of £ 4 3 1 - in respect of the Volunteer Forces, and an increase of £ 6 , 1 6 0 in respect of camps and schools of instruction. This increase is to provide for the largely-increased number of men attending camp, and I am sure that honourable members general lv are desirous of our camps of training being more largely availed of. In respect of the maintenance of existing arms and equipment there is an increase of £ 4 , 8 9 8 , and an increase °f £ ' 3 3 6 in the item relating to artillery 2 ammunition. We have a magnificent arm in the iSi-pounder, and it is imperative that our men should receive more training in its handling.",64
495,Mr CROUCH,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,Does the honourable member think that field artillery can be efficiently worked by a citizen soldiery?,65
496,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"That is a question that might well be asked. The modern i pounder is a very fine weapon. Generally speaking, experts; if questioned on the subject, declare that it takes years to make a gunner. Whether that is so or not I am satisfied that our gunners need more opportunities for training than they have had. The honourable member for Corio, like myself, has doubtless known members of the militia to excel our permanent men in field practice.",65
497,Mr CROUCH,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,There are no permanent men in the Australian field forces.,65
498,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,I have in mind what took place in an artillery contest in the days in New South Wales.,65
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The honourable gentleman says that there must be increased training; is that why he is providing for less than we have had?,65
500,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The honourable member is now speaking of the new scheme. The Prime Minister has already stated that more than three weeks' training must be provided for the special arms of the service.,65
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,The Prime Minister's speech was only the millinery in the shop window. We want to know what the Government have on the shelves.,65
502,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"If a man, instead of making a good display in his front window, keeps all his goods in a cellar, he is not likely to do much trade. To return again to the review of the Estimates, it will be found that there is a decrease of £ 1 9 in respect of small arm ammunition, whilst there is an increase of £1,310 in regard to general contingencies, that increase being necessary to provide for expansion of forces. The items relating to railway and steamer fares and freight show an increase of £1,205, to provide for increased personnel and a greater number of inspections, as well as for additional training. Then, again, it will be noted that there is an increase of £20,055 under the heading of Cadet Corps. The Prime Minister has already stated that for the next three years an additional sum of £20,000 will be spent upon the Cadet Forces.",65
503,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,How many days' increased training is it proposed to give the field artillery?,65
504,Mr CROUCH,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,At present sixteen days are allowed.,65
505,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Representations were made that the field artillery, if the opporm - tunity offered, would certainly put in a few more days' training, and the Government readily agreed to provide the additional ammunition necessary.",65
506,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,It will require more than sixteen days to make men efficient for that arm.,65
507,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Certainly . My own opinion is that six weeks per annum would be a limited time to allow, for such training.",65
508,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,In Switzerland eightyfour days are allowed.,65
509,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"My reading leads me to old believe-and we laymen arrive at our conclusions by reading - the views of experts on these questions-that the two great factors in modern warfare will be artillery and infantry. Such a belief may be somewhat opposed to Australian ideas on the subject, but Ian Hamilton, in dealing with the great Russo-Japanese campaign, appears to so regard it. Mr 'CROUCH - He 1 is an artilleryman, and other experts doubt his conclusions.",65
510,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"That may be. It cannot be denied that the modern iSj-pounders are good guns, but our expenditure upon them is comparatively useless unless we have good men behind them.",65
511,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,That was proved during the war to which the honourable member has referred.,65
512,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Absolutely . There must be longer training for the artillery. In Australia people generally have much regard for the mounted infantry. The horse, however, is valuable only as a means of rapidly transferring the infantry from one point to another. Ian Hamilton declares that the cavalry in the Russo-Japanese war - I am not referring to mounted infantry - were valuable frequently-because they got to a given point before 'the infantry, and were able to prepare meals for them.",65
513,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"But the cavalry in that war were not mounted infantry. The strategical conditions of Australia, where the country is flar. and adaptable to the use of horses, are slightly different from those of Manchuria.",65
514,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Quite so, and after Mukden had been passed the cavalry, apparently, began to do better work. - Mr MATHEWS - The British Intelligence Department thought that mounted men would be useless in South Africa, but they made a mistake.",65
515,Mr EWING,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"I have endeavoured to ascertain why the British War Office authorities made such a singular mistake as to refuse in the first instance the offer of Australian mounted infantry, but have been unable to obtain any satisfactory information on the point. The artillery will play an important part in future wars, and unless we have first-class men behind our guns, we might almost as well be without, them. The next necessity is a considerable auguraentation of our infantry.",66
516,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,IIo w are the Government going to obtain more infantry? . .,66

518,Mr KELLY,COMPENSATION TO BOMBARDIER SHERGOLD,"Judgin g from the reports of experts, what is quite as essential as infantry and artillery is the equipment necessary to make the army a fighting machine. Mr EWING Unquestionably. The Government has taken very definite action in regard not only to obtaining equipment, but in providing for i'ts local production, as well as for the local manufacture of cordite - Our policy is to establish arifle factory and also a cordite factory in Australia, and, having regard to our. remoteness from trie great producing countries of the old world, the establishment of such factories here is eminently desirable. I do not know that it is necessary for me to offer any further, observations at the present stage. These Estimates are really Dead Sea fruit, since the financial year to which they relate has almost expired. Before any change is proposed by the Government honourable members will have so ample an opportunity of discussing it that I am sure they will be satisfied that the Ministry has dealt fairly with them. In these circumstances,' I had hoped that the Estimates of the Department would be passed to-night. - .Progressreported. .House adjourned at 10.37 P m",66
