2,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," In accordance with the resolution agreed to on 19 September, the bills will now be taken together. Any proposed amendments are to be moved and debated now. The question will be put on government amendments. One question will be put on amendments moved by opposition members and any necessary questions will be put on amendments moved by other members. Any further questions necessary to complete the detail stage will then be put.",21
3,Mr COMBET,NOES,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) NOES (09:18): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and congratulations on your election. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Clean Energy Amendment (International Emissions Trading and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and seek leave to move government amendments (1) and (2) as circulated together. Leave granted.",21
4,Mr COMBET,NOES,"by leave-I move: (1) Schedule 1, page 55 (after line 11), after item 80, insert: 80A Paragraph 126(2)(a) Omit ""a particular provision of Division 2 of NA Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"". 80B Paragraph 126(2)(b) Omit ""that provision in so far as that provision"", substitute ""that Division in so far as that Division"". 80C Subsection 126(4) Omit ""provisional emissions number of the person for the relevant eligible financial year under a particular provision of Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""total of the provisional emissions numbers of the person for the relevant eligible financial year under Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"". (2) Schedule 1, page 55, after proposed item 80C, insert: 80D Subparagraphs 127(1)(d)(ii) and (iii) Omit ""a particular provision of Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"". These amendments remove a potential ambiguity in some of the drafting of provisions of the Clean Energy Act 2011 concerning interim emissions numbers. The amendments ensure that there is no ambiguity about the application of the policy behind section 126 of the act. They make it clear that, apart from the specific circumstances set out in section 127 of the Clean Energy Act 2011, all liable entities for facilities will have an interim emissions number in 2012-13 and in subsequent fixed price years and will, therefore, have a provisional surrender obligation in those years. The government made this policy position plain in paragraph 4.26 of the explanatory memorandum to the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and therefore there is no material policy change. It is simply a clarifying amendment. In particular, the two amendments make it clear that an interim emissions number is not dependent on having two provisional emissions numbers arising for a facility under the same provision of the Clean Energy Act 2011 for two consecutive years. Rather, they make it clear that a provisional emissions number for a facility may arise under different provisions of part 3, division 2 of the Clean Energy Act 2011 with respect to those years. I commend the amendments to the House.",21
5,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"Flinders) Congratulations, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, on your appointment. On a day when the government are making much of a minor error elsewhere, this amendment is to clarify a minor error. Unlike the government, we will show good faith and good grace and let them correct their error without any major criticism. We just put that in the broader context. We will of course oppose the bill as a whole. Question agreed to.",22
6,Mr BANDT,PAIRS," I move Greens amendment (1) to the Clean Energy Amendment (International Emissions Trading and Other Measures) Bill 2012 as circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 1, page 59 (after line 8), after 81, insert: 81A After section 160 Insert: 160A Review by Productivity Commission of financial assistance for coal-fired electricity generation (1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, the Productivity Minister must, under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, refer the following matters to the Productivity Commission for inquiry: (a) the matter of the reasons for, and need for, financial assistance for coal fired electricity generation; (b) the matter of the following impacts of the existing arrangements for financial assistance for coal-fired electricity generation: (i) impacts on Australia's electricity generation mix and timeframes for retirement of existing electricity generation plants and investment in new generation plants; (ii) financial impacts for coal-fired generators in receipt of compensation and for other generators across the industry; (iii) impact on Commonwealth finances; (09:20): (iv) impacts on the competitiveness of the Australian electricity market. (2) In referring the matters to the Productivity Commission for inquiry, the Productivity Minister must, under paragraph 11(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, specify the period ending on 31 December 2012 as the period within which the Productivity Commission must submit its report on the inquiry to the Productivity Minister. Note: Under section 12 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, the Productivity Minister must cause a copy of the Productivity Commission's report to be tabled in each House of Parliament. (3) For the purposes of paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, each matter mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is taken to be a matter relating to industry, item industry development and productivity. 160B Commonwealth Government response (1) If the report on an inquiry referred to in section 160A sets out one or more recommendations to the Commonwealth Government: (a) as soon as practicable after receiving the report, the Productivity Minister must cause be prepared a statement setting out the Commonwealth Government's response to each of the recommendations; and (b) the Productivity Minister must cause copies of the statement to be tabled in each House of the Parliament before the end of the period of 7 sitting days of that House after the day on which the Productivity Minister receives the report. (2) As soon as practicable after the Productivity Minister tables the report in each House of the Parliament, the Productivity Commission must publish the report on the Productivity Commission's website. Note: The Productivity Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of Parliament-see section 12 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998. 160C No limit on Productivity Minister's powers This Division does not limit the Productivity Minister's powers under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Productivity Commission Act 1998. When the price on the pollution package was agreed to, it was agreed to as a package. A number of people were coming from a number of different positions, all coming with goodwill, all wanting to see Australia take its first steps towards a clean energy future. As a result, there was a significant amount of negotiation, which is not surprising when you consider the disparate interests that were involved: Labor, the Greens and the rural Independents. Ultimately there was agreement on the price to be put on pollution, even though people might have started from different positions and preferred a different outcome. There was agreement on the architecture, even though some people might have preferred that things had been a different way. There was agreement on the scope of what would be in and what would be out of this package of legislation, even though some people would have preferred the inclusion of certain kinds of transport, which to were ultimately excluded because that was necessary in order to reach an accommodation. Agreement was also reached on compensation, not just to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries but also to coal fired power stations, even though it was also a contentious subject. I think that everyone involved in the discussions was and remains agreed on the principle of energy security-that is, it is important that the transition to a clean energy economy be made in a way that does not compromise the energy security of this country. There was debate, however, about the best and most efficient way of making the transition. We as the Greens, along with Professor Garnaut, said publicly that one of the best ways to ensure that the transition, as it affected coal fired power stations, did not disrupt energy security would have been to offer loan guarantees to coal fired power stations, which would have meant that the Commonwealth did not have to expend any money, that security would have been guaranteed and that the stations could have had an orderly transition out of operation as had been intended. But that was not the government's position, and ultimately the package gave what we consider to be quite generous compensation, over and above what we argued was necessary, to coal fired power stations. But we as the Greens agreed to the compensation because, under the energy security heading, was a very important part of the package: the agreement to pay for the closure of around 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest coal fired power stations in this country. I read from the clean energy documents, where it is stated under the heading 'Energy security fund': First, there will be scope for payments for the closure of around 2000 megawatts (MW) of very highly emissions-intensive coal-fired generation capacity by 2020. This will start the process replacing existing, highly polluting electricity assets with cleaner generation. They go on to say: Closing some of our highest-polluting coal-fired generation capacity will make room for investment in lower-pollution plant. That is right, and it was a key plank of the package which was negotiated. The fact that this plank was included in the package allowed us to sign off on what we felt was overgenerous compensation to coal fired power stations. We did so because, on the one hand, they would be getting the money, but, on the other hand, around 2,000 megawatts of their generating capacity would be closed. The government has since decided not to proceed with the closure of 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest power production in this country. Either the government did not proceed because the minister who was responsible, but who is not the minister sitting at the table now, did not have his heart in it, or they did not proceed becauseand this is the public justification that is given-to do so would not have represented good value for money. (Extension of time granted) One of the only reasons that the companies which own the coal fired power stations could say there was no economic incentive for them to close the stations is they are being so generously compensated. A $5.5 billion compensation package is going to these companies-$1 billion in cash and $4½ billion in free permits to come-and that influenced the companies in their discussions with the government on the package. If we accept that the discussions took place in good faith, then the companies went armed with the knowledge of changed international circumstances, a big stack of cash in the pockets and the promise of free permits to come and, as a result, the companies are not now closing the coal fired of power stations as envisaged in the promise that the government made to the Australian people in the clean energy package. Even worse, there is the prospect that some of the dirty coal fired power stations, which were meant to transition out of operation as part of the package, will receive windfall profits. In other words, if the package is passed, the cash that they have already received plus the compensation in the form of free permits that they are about to receive might make them financially better off than if the package had not been passed. Because the government changed the goalposts by taking out one key element of the package, it is important to adjust it, because the package was agreed on through compromise by all sides, and, if one part of it is taken out, we should recalibrate it. One of the best ways of doing so would be by taking this opportunity to say: 'Over the coming years, if these coal fired power stations aren't doing as poorly as might have been thought and if in fact they stand potentially to make a windfall profit, then they have potentially been overcompensated. Let's get the Productivity Commission into give a genuine review of the adequacy of their compensation.' We accept that the payments in cash have been made-that is done and dusted-but there is no reason that the future that $4.5 billion worth of compensation, in the absence of evidence that is absolutely necessary for energy security, needs to go to the companies. In fact, there is now a very strong case that the overcompensation of the companies which own the dirty coal fired power stations is distorting the intention of the legislative package and getting in the way of replacing dirty coal fired power with clean and renewable energy. In the context where the goalposts have been changed, in the context where they might be getting windfall profits that will keep them in business longer than they otherwise would be, in the context where we are not closing 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest coal fired power, it makes absolute sense to preserve the integrity of the original agreement by having the Productivity Commission review whether or not this compensation is too generous. When one takes the compensation package as a whole, that is $275 per woman, man and child in Australia that is going into the pockets of these dirty coal fired power stations and that could be going to clean and renewable energy. I commend this amendment to the House. It is a sensible amendment. One should have no concerns about the Productivity Commission looking at the adequacy of this compensation in the light of changed circumstances.",22
7,Mr COMBET,PAIRS,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:30): The government opposes the amendment put forward by the member for Melbourne because it is economically irresponsible and indeed breaches the agreement that the government entered into with the members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, and also for the reason that the existing provisions of the legislation in relation to energy security are absolutely fundamental to investment confidence in the sector. I have no disrespect whatsoever for the member for Melbourne; I understand his motivations for moving this amendment. But the fact is that, contrary to his assertion, amendment breaches an agreement that the Greens party reached with the government in the context of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. We entered into that agreement as a package, as he indicated. There have been no changes in the goalposts whatsoever. The government has discharged its obligations under that agreement to the word, and it is unprincipled to come in here and put forward an amendment that breaches that agreement. The assistance to the generators, the Energy Security Fund payments, was a very important part of the agreement. The government made the decision after years of analysis into how to best transition highly emissions-intensive electricity generators into a cleaner energy environment. Of course, it is a transition that will take some period of time. The current arrangements that are in place are the result of in-depth electricity sector analysis and modelling since 2007, and nothing that has happened since the MPCCC agreement was concluded changes the reality and the conclusions that were reached as a result of that detailed work. Since 1 July when the carbon price commenced, the pass-through of carbon costs in the energy market and to household bills reflects exactly the Treasury modelling which informed the decisions on the basis of the Energy Security Fund payments. Advice was taken from key energy market institutions like the Australian Energy Market Operator, who advised that the government's measures, reflected in the MPCCC agreement, reduced the extent of generator financial distress, supported investment confidence in the sector and could be expected to improve reliability and security outcomes in the short term and reduce spot prices and expedite the transition this to a lower emissions fleet over the longer term. The Energy Security Fund was legislated with the Clean Energy Act, and all the generators have now been awarded certificates of eligibility by the regulator for those Energy Security Fund payments. To interfere with that and to create uncertainty in relation to that would be disruptive to the investors and to the lenders that are engaged in the electricity generation sector. Changes to those legislated entitlements will directly influence investor perceptions of sovereign risk in the energy market. It would increase the risk premiums for clean energy investors. The advice of my department, consistent with the government's assessment, is as follows: proposals to review or change those legislated entitlements will directly influence investor perceptions of sovereign risk. This risk is exactly the type of risk the package was designed to minimise so that energy security is assured until sufficient alternative capacity is available in Australia's electricity markets. Increased risk in the market would also likely push up wholesale electricity prices and result in further cost pressures for electricity consumers unnecessarily. In addition, all investors in the energy market, including investors in clean energy technologies, would face higher costs for financing due to increased risk levels. The government is not going to entertain the proposition of the Greens, whether it be by amendment or by any other form, for these reasons. It is in bad faith, in the government's judgement, that this has been put forward. It is in breach of the agreement that we reached. I want to make clear to investors in the energy industry that the entitlements that we have legislated through the Energy Security Fund will not be tampered with by the government. We will not entertain this amendment. It is economically irresponsible. We have in place a comprehensive package to secure energy security for Australian households and businesses. This was a policy initiative entirely separate to the issue of the Contract for Closure, which the government discharged. We stand by the package that was legislated and firmly oppose this amendment.",25
8,Mr HUNT,PAIRS," The government created two funds. It created a $2 billion Contract for Closure fund to close brown coal power stations and it created a $5½ billion Energy Security Fund to bail out brown coal power stations. It is not surprising that the smaller fund has failed. It is not surprising that the carbon tax is in chaos. It takes a certain type of genius to create one fund to close brown coal power stations and one fund to bail them out. I would ask the question: is there any other similar example in the western world in the last 20 years of two multibillion-dollar funds designed to do precisely the opposite things? I stand to be corrected but I am not aware of any other pairing of one fund to close power stations and one fund to keep them open. It is a unique policy achievement. The member for Casey highlighted to me that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency raised the issue of sovereign risk. The entire carbon tax and the entire mining tax are about sovereign risk. They are about changing the ground rules in a way that creates uncertainty, that creates higher costs on Australian production, because this is an electricity ta The carbon tax is an electricity tax. Its theory is to close down the power stations; its reality is that, because they are not subject to import competition, the power stations are simply passing on the power price. So mums and dads right now are paying higher power prices. In New South Wales, 50 per cent of the electricity price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In Victoria, two-thirds of the electricity price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In Western Australia, not 70 per cent but 72 per cent of the price rises are coming from the carbon tax. In the ACT, between 75 and 80 per cent of the price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In western Sydney, 80 per cent of the price rise in electricity is coming from the carbon tax. In Queensland, where Campbell Newman has frozen the bulk of retail tariffs, between 80 and 100 per cent of electricity price rises for the coming year are as a consequence of the carbon tax. So the theory behind these two funds is based on a simple flaw: that the carbon tax would have an impact on the generators. In reality they are passing through the electricity prices, as they were always intended to do. I just want to make one more comment. Our view is that this motion fails. I respect the views of the member for Melbourne, but this motion fails because the carbon tax, the $2 billion to close brown coal power stations and the $5½ billion to keep them open should all be ditched. Dealing with one part of the three elements of the equation is fundamentally flawed. But what I do want to acknowledge is the amount of money being given in cash to the largest brown coal generators in Australia. Going from the government's own announcement, there has been: $14.9 million to Alcoa's Anglesea Power Station; $59 million in cash to the Augusta power stations; $8 million in cash to the Collinsville Power Station; $27 million in cash to Green Energy Bricks, which was of course before the second round of bailouts two days before the carbon tax began; $265 million to Hazelwood Power Station in cash; $240 million in cash to Loy Yang A power station; $59 million in cash to Loy Yang B power station through International Power Australia and $57 million in cash through Gippsland Power; $8 million in cash to Redbank Power Station; and $257 million in cash to Yallourn W power station. So the biggest polluters, according to the government, are getting the biggest cash handouts in Australian history. It is no wonder the Australian people think that this carbon tax is a dud, because the biggest polluters are being given literally $5½ billion in cash and permits and the Australian people are picking up the bill in terms of higher electricity, gas and grocery costs.",26
9,Mr BANDT,PAIRS," I will speak just very briefly on this. There are two issues of risk and principles. When the clean energy package was agreed to, those people who wanted to come and invest in Australia's clean energy future and begin to build the wind farms and solar plants and investigate solar thermal and geothermal took heart from the package. One of the reasons they took heart from the package was that it said around 2,000 megawatts of coal fired power, the equivalent of Hazelwood plus a bit, would be closed, making space for them in the market. Many of them began to see a future in Australia and, in particular, in Victoria for clean and renewable energy. Not only that but many people in the Latrobe Valley who I have spoken to have said: 'Now we understand where we're going. There is a prospect that some of these stations will be closed and we can begin now to transition out.' The only uncertainty and risk that has been brought in has been of Labor's own making, because it was Labor who decided not to proceed with something it said it was going to do, which is close these coal fired power stations. On the question of principle, we would not be here making this amendment if Labor had stuck to the agreement and we had seen power stations like Hazelwood close. We would quite happily have said, 'We do not agree with all the other aspects of it, and perhaps there is some overgenerous compensation, but that is the price we pay because there are some things in it that are good for clean and renewable energy.' We wanted to be in a position where there was an orderly replacement of some of the dirtiest coal fired power stations with clean renewable energy. Labor made the first move and pulled out a key plank of the package, and we are responding in what we think is a very reasonable and measured way to restore the integrity of the package.",27
10,Mr COMBET,PAIRS,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:42): Without wishing to prolong the situation, I really do need to place on the record that the government has discharged its obligations that it entered into under the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement. That agreement never guaranteed the closure of 2,000 megawatts of highemission coal fired electricity generated capacity. It never guaranteed that. The commitment was that there would be a process entered into allowing those generators to tender and enter into a negotiation with the government in an appropriate way for the potential closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emission electricity generating capacity, providing it provided value for taxpayers' money. The suggestion by the member for Melbourne that the government have not met their commitments is completely wrong and false. We have met the commitments that we entered into. If the Greens did not understand amendment. what they were entering into then that is most unfortunate. But, nonetheless, at the end of the process for the discussion and negotiation with the owners of the highemission electricity generation capacity that had voluntarily come forward and participated in the contract for closure negotiations, the government could not agree with those entities that the values that were being discussed for those assets represented value for taxpayers' money. Indeed, on our calculation the cost of emissions reductions to be achieved, should the government have accepted the valuations of those assets that those companies believed were appropriate, would have vastly exceeded the $23 per tonne carbon price. This is not the sole criterion, but of course it was a consideration in the government's thinking. The fact is that the market will now decide the life of those electricity generators. That was always the position that obtained under the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement and it is the position that the government discharged. Having said that, it is important also to note that the market has already led to the mothballing, closure or curtailment of hundreds of megawatts of high-emissions electricity generation capacity, such as the Playford B and Northern power stations in South Australia, and the curtailment of significant electricity generation capacity at Energy Brix in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. I think it is in order of 800 or 900 megawatts of brown coal high-emissions electricity generating capacity that has in fact been curtailed, without the necessity for the government to enter into contract for closure agreements with those particular operators. The market will attend to that issue under a carbon pricing arrangement. The government has met its obligations under the agreement. We therefore reiterate that we oppose the Generally, in relation to the issues raised by the shadow minister, the package overall has been very carefully calibrated. There has been years of extensive engagement with stakeholders in every conceivable sector of the economy. It is not at all an issue of sovereign risk. Packages have been carefully designed and modelled in some of the most extensive modelling work ever undertaken by the Commonwealth Treasury and other organisations to ensure that this package will work, that it will lead to a reduction in emissions in our economy over time. We have attended to all of the issues that we believe are appropriate, particularly in the electricity generation sector and particularly in businesses that are in the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive part of the economy. Furthermore, in relation to the passthrough of carbon pricing into electricity prices, it is of course the case that the majority of the carbon price revenue is being used to implement tax cuts, a tripling of the tax-free threshold, increases in family tax benefits and increases in the pension and other social security payments. Millions of people will be better off as a consequence of this important reform and Australia will play its fair share in global greenhouse gas emission reduction.",28
11,Mr HUNT,PAIRS, Greens and the ALP are squabbling over the deckchairs on the Titanic of electricity prices.,29
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The question is that the amendment as moved by the member for Melbourne be agreed to. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,29
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes in this division, I declare the question resolved in the negative in accordance with standing order 127.

14,Mr SHORTEN,NOES,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:03): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. NOES In 2010 the Gillard Labor government made an election commitment to better protect the entitlements of Australian employees impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. This commitment, entitled the Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package, provides the strongest protection of employee entitlements working Australians have ever seen. We made this commitment because Labor is the party of work and what work provides for us, financially but also for our families and sense of well being in society. Today, I introduce a bill which embeds our commitment to this package as it relates to the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. In doing so the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 will replace the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and enshrine the Fair Entitlements Guarantee in PAIRS legislation. The bill will provide certainty for Australian employees who find themselves without a job and left out of pocket when their employer becomes insolvent or bankrupt and cannot pay them the employment entitlements they are owed. On this side of the House we know that employees who lose their job through insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer have enough to worry about. They have to worry about where their next mortgage repayment will come from. They have to worry about how to buy the children new clothes or pay school fees. They have to worry about what money will cover unexpected bills or an unexpected emergency. Those of us on this side of the House believe that these individuals should not have to worry about being paid what they have already earned. It will be a good day for working Australians when this bill passes and they have certainty that their entitlements are protected even if the company they work for enters liquidation and cannot pay them what they are owed. This bill will protect Australian employees under circumstances which are brought about through no fault or choice of their own. This bill will ensure that Australian employees who are victims of employer insolvency or bankruptcy, employment entitlements are owed, are supported by a government that supports Australian workers. In doing so, this bill also enshrines Labor's commitment to the Australian sense of a fair go by providing a legislative framework employees can rely on and an entitlement which, unlike the employment entitlements those opposite advocate for, cannot be scrapped with the flick of a pen. Eligible entitlements Under this bill, eligible employees will covered for unpaid entitlements including:  Redundancy;  Annual leave;  Long service leave;  Wages; and  Payment in lieu of notice. In the majority of cases, employees will be entitled to an advance for unpaid entitlements as provided for in the relevant industrial instrument under which they are employed. The bill will protect redundancy pay, a maximum of four weeks per year of service. This will mean that most employees will receive all of the redundancy entitlements they are owed. The bill will only enable payment of unpaid wages for up to 13 weeks and will provide payment in lieu of notice at five weeks. The bill also strengthens the recognition of eligible entitlements for employees who continue to be employed following the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. Under current arrangements, some employees lose out if they continue working through the administration of the company and neither the administrator nor GEERS covers their unpaid entitlement. where From now on, once this bill is passed, if you are an employee in this situation you will be entitled to receive unpaid entitlements accruing right up to your last day of working. No longer will there be a gap in entitlements paid. Where an advance for entitlements is made, the Commonwealth is empowered to recover advances from the dividends payable once companies are wound up. In doing so, this bill proposes that the Commonwealth have the same rights as creditors in the winding up or bankruptcy of the business be that the employee would have otherwise had. This measure strengthens the government's commitment to working Australians and the taxpayer. It also makes clear that those companies who enter insolvency or bankruptcy due to irregular business practices can no longer avoid paying the entitlements of hard working employees. Eligible employees I wish to make it clear that this bill establishes an important legislative safety net for genuine employee redundancy. It is not a scheme which can be used recklessly by up to employers seeking to purposely renege on their employer obligations. Under the bill, employees will only be eligible for an advance in genuine cases where they have lost their job as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. Some people will not be eligible for advances under the proposed legislation. The bill maintains existing arrangements under GEERS that advances will not be payable to people that are excluded under the Corporations Act-contractors, directors and family members of a director. This bill mirrors existing GEERS arrangements that assistance will not be available to support business restructures or where insolvent entities are able to pay employee entitlements within a reasonable period. The government has also taken the opportunity to simplify the assessment of transfer-of-business arrangements. To this end, from 1 July 2014, only where a claimant's entitlements and service are recognised by the new employer will they be ineligible for financial assistance under the bill. This measure will overcome operational barriers in assessing claims and reduce unnecessary delays in employees receiving their entitlements. To further reduce complexity, this bill also remove the existing eligibility arrangements for employees affected by a deed of company arrangements (DOCA) or equivalent bankruptcy proceedings. Employees often get very little say in how a DOCA is structured and it simply is not fair that they be disadvantaged when they do not work well enough to save their job. The bill maintains existing arrangements under GEERS that a claim for assistance will need to be made within 12 months. The bill also clarifies that, to be eligible for assistance under the bill, a claimant must have met the residency requirements as at the date of termination, as this is the most relevant date to assess what level of assistance an employee is entitled to receive. The bill also includes three important areas where capacity for flexibility is needed. By outlining the circumstances and conditions that must exist before flexibility can be used, the bill contains the following key areas:  ability to make payments in administration prior to liquidation;  early advance of a payment; and  a regulation-making power to enable regulations to be made to facilitate payments to people who are not employees. Reviews and appeals Ensuring a fair and transparent decision making process is a key part of this bill. A person that makes a claim for an advance can be confident that their claim will be assessed in a just and transparent way. Where a person does not agree with a decision in relation to their eligibility for an advance or the amount of an advance they are eligible for, they will have the right to apply for a review of the decision. As is will currently the practice under GEERS, where a decision is able to be reviewed, the department will review the initial decision and advise the applicant of the review decision and the reasons for the decision. Importantly, under this bill where a person does not agree with a review decision they may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an external review. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal will conduct an impartial and timely review. This change to the review process will improve transparency and accountability. Conclusion I am proud that we are meeting the election commitment to better protect the entitlements of Australian employees impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. The Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package provides the strongest protection of employee entitlements working Australians have ever seen. Today, Labor delivers commitment and with the passing of this bill the government will deliver on its pledge to Australian employees by providing a clear, fair and robust framework to protect the entitlements Australians work so hard for every day. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill I am introducing today is supported by the Labor government and a range of stakeholders. We hope those opposite will also support this bill so as to ensure even stronger protections for working Australians across our nation. Debate adjourned. Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
15,Mr SHORTEN,NOES,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:12): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to deliver on the government's commitment to introduce legislation extending the existing transfer-of-business protections in the Fair Work Act 2009. The Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill 2012 extends the existing transfer-of-business provisions in the Fair Work Act to certain former state public sector employees that transition into the national system as a result of a sale of assets or outsourcing of work to a national system employer. The government does not accept that these employees should be worse off, or that they should have their entitlements put at risk, on that simply because their jobs are outsourced. The bill is a necessary response to this challenge-to ensure that these employees generally retain the benefit of their existing terms and conditions of employment, which have been negotiated by them in good faith with their employer, by protecting them where a transfer of business occurs between their former state employer and an employer covered by the national workplace relations system. These reforms mean that the Commonwealth will establish, for the first time, a nationally consistent set of transferof-business rules for public sector employees that will protect their entitlements when they transfer to a national system employer. Employees in the public sectors of the Commonwealth, Victoria and territories are already covered by the Fair Work Act and already have the benefit of these transfer-ofbusiness protections. However, those protections do not currently extend to public sector employees in the remaining jurisdictions which leaves them as secondclass citizens and at risk when decisions like outsourcing and asset sales occur. That is why this bill is necessary and a priority for our government. The transfer-of-business rules under the FW Act The bill will, as far as possible, reflect the transfer-of-business provisions in part 2-8 of the Fair Work Act. The transfer-of-business rules in the Fair Work Act reflect the government's clear policy intention to protect employees' existing terms and conditions of employment where their employer changed but their work stayed the same. These protections apply where the two employers enter into certain transactions such as an asset sale or an outsourcing arrangement. These rules are designed to balance the protection of employee terms and conditions of employment with the interests of employers in structuring their assets and operations efficiently. These rules also provide certainty for all parties. The arrangements they replaced were overly complex, often difficult to apply, legalistic and sometimes resulted in employees losing the benefit of their industrial instruments even though they were performing exactly the same work for the new employer. Those pre-existing rules also applied to a narrow set of business transactions-for example, they rarely covered the outsourcing of work. The industrial terms and conditions negotiated by state public employees-for instance, in Queensland and New South Wales-have been entered into in good faith, and it is the case that frequently the wage outcomes accepted by employees have been discounted because of the promise of job security, and where the promise of job security is unilaterally changed by state governments then a problem arises. The findings of the Fair Work Review The recent post-implementation review into the operation of the Fair Work Act, which the government publicly released on 2 August 2012, had the following to say about the existing transfer-of-business rules:  'The [Fair Work Review] Panel considers there is a clear need to protect employees in transfer of business situations. The alternative is to allow employees to be exploited by the structuring of businesses and contracting arrangements.'  'On the basis of stakeholder submissions, academic advice … analysis of cases under the provisions and an examination of the provisions themselves, the broader legislative definition succeeds in providing better protections for employees than the previous arrangements did.'  '… The scope [within the transfer of business framework] for employers to determine the appropriate outcome for their business on application to FWA provides significant flexibility.' So the overwhelming evidence suggests that the transfer-of-business provisions, which this government put in place in our Fair Work Act 2009, deliver a balanced framework that provides both fairness and flexibility to both employees and employers. The panel made one recommendation in relation to a particular aspect of the transferof-business provisions and the government is sector considering that recommendation in the context of its response to the review. What is a transfer of business? In broad terms, the transfer-of-business rules apply where:  an employee transfers to a new employer within three months of their employment terminating with their old employer; and  the employee performs the same or similar work for the new employer as they did with their old employer; and  the old employer transfers assets or outsources work to the new employer, or undertakes certain corporate restructuring activities, such as movements to associated entities. Where these conditions exist, the default rule is that the transferring employees' existing workplace instrument transfers with them to their new employer. Fair Work Australia has broad powers to ensure that these rules operate fairly to both the transferring employees and the new employer. The bill However, the current rules, which I just described and which were positively endorsed by the review into the new act, only apply where both the old and new employers are covered by the national workplace relations system. In other words, they must both be covered by the Fair Work Act. Employees in the Commonwealth, Victorian, ACT and Northern Territory public sectors are already covered by the Fair Work Act and already have the benefit of the transfer-of-business protections. However, public sector employees in the remaining jurisdictions, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, do not. That is why the bill will amend the Fair Work Act to enable certain employees in these jurisdictions to retain their existing terms and conditions of employment-which they have negotiated in good faith-where they transfer from a public sector employer to the national workplace relations system as a result of a transfer of business. The bill will do this by:  providing for the transfer of employees' terms and conditions of employment from an old public sector employer to a national employer. system employer where there is a connection between the two employers;  preserving the transferring employees' existing terms and conditions of employment, whether those terms are reflected in a relevant state award or agreement, by the creation of a federal instrument containing those terms and conditions and recognising service and certain accrued entitlements such as annual leave;  enabling Fair Work Australia to make orders that modify the general effect of the transfer-of-business rules, where appropriate;  providing for the interaction between the transferring terms and conditions of employment and the Fair Work Act, including the National Employment Standards, and other necessary transitional and technical provisions. Preserving entitlements for certain transferring employees Transferring employees' terms and conditions of employment from the old employer to a national system employer will be protected under the bill through the creation of a new federal instrument-a 'copied state instrument'. The instrument will copy the existing terms and conditions of employment for a transferring employee where those terms are derived from a state award or agreement. This will enable those terms and conditions to transfer across to the national system with the employee where there has been a decision to sell assets or outsource work so that the employee will continue to benefit from the conditions in their existing industrial instruments which they had previously negotiated in good faith with their To put it plainly, transferring employees' existing terms and conditions of employment as set out in their industrial instrument will be protected. The bill also ensures that a term of a copied state instrument has no effect to the extent that it is detrimental to an employee, in any respect, when compared to an entitlement of the employee under the National Employment Standards. The bill will also generally ensure that an employee's service with the old employer counts as service with the new employer for the purpose of determining the employee's entitlements under the copied state instrument. This means, for example, that an employee's accrued annual leave entitlement is preserved when they transfer to the new employer and their entitlement has not already been paid out by the old employer. A laundry worker working at the Townsville Hospital who gets transferred to a new national employer by Queensland Health cannot arbitrarily have their accrued service written off and the clock start running on their new service. Orders to modify the effect of a transferred instrument Similar to the position under the existing Part 2-8 of the Fair Work Act, the bill confers power on Fair Work Australia to make orders that modify the general effect of the transfer of business rules in certain circumstances. In particular, Fair Work Australia will able to make orders regarding the coverage of certain instruments, including enabling transferring workplace instruments to better align with the new employer's business operations. In some circumstances it may also be in the interests of the transferring employees and of a new employer to consolidate terms and conditions of employment in a copied state instrument, so that they can apply to more than one employee. This may be the case, for example, when differing instruments set out similar terms and conditions for transferring employees. To this end, Fair Work Australia will also have the power to make orders that ‘consolidate' various workplace instruments applying at a workplace. For example, Fair Work Australia may order that a copied state instrument for a particular transferring employee is also a copied state instrument for both transferring and non-transferring employees, having regard to the views of the relevant employees and of the new employer. Conclusion So, in conclusion, this government takes very seriously moves by any employer to attempt to restructure their business operations that would have the effect of undermining employee entitlements. This government will not countenance employees incurring real cuts to their pay and conditions because of decisions by their employer to again sell assets or outsource work. Employees should be able to retain the benefit of their existing terms and conditions of employment in circumstances where there is a transfer of business-that is, where their employer changes but the work stays the same. There are some who might say that this bill is unnecessary, because employers can already agree in the course of contractual be negotiations for any transferring employees to maintain their existing terms and conditions of employment with the new employer. However, this approach, of saying, 'It'll be all okay and we don't have to worry about protecting people,' does not provide certainty for employees and it does not provide guaranteed protection for their hard earned and negotiated entitlements. This bill allows employers to restructure their businesses. However, we will not stand by and see no ongoing protection for employees' terms and conditions. Indeed, further, the approach which says that this bill is unnecessary fails to reflect the policy intent underlying the Fair Work transfer of business rules. The idea that you can simply transfer people's jobs and cut their pay and conditions is not grounded in fairness, nor does it provide the nationally consistent and transparent set of rules which this bill provides. Our bill will protect all state public employees who are moving from the state public sector to the national workplace relations system. It does so by putting in place, as far as possible, a nationally consistent set of rules which will protect public sector employees' existing terms and conditions as set out in their industrial instrument where a transfer of business occurs between a former state employer and an employer covered by the national system. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Arrangement) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",33
16,Mr SHORTEN,NOES,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:26): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation and superannuation laws to introduce a voluntary scheme for Australians and New Zealanders to permit them to transfer their superannuation savings between Australia and New Zealand. This new scheme will permit Australians and New Zealanders who have lived and worked in both countries to make the most of their retirement savings. The Australian government is committed to the closest possible relations with New Zealand. In 2009 the Australian government and the New Zealand government signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a trans-Tasman retirement savings portability sector scheme. The scheme is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2013 and is expected to assist the thousands of Australians and New Zealanders who move across the Tasman each year. The New Zealand Parliament passed the legislation necessary for the new scheme in 2010. Currently, New Zealanders working in Australia must leave their superannuation behind when they permanently leave Australia. More than 50,000 New Zealanders moved to Australia last year, whilst 14,000 people left Australia permanently for New Zealand. In 2007, a working group of Australian and New Zealand officials was established to investigate options for the portability of retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand. On 16 July 2009, the Australian and New Zealand governments jointly announced the scheme and signed a memorandum of understanding establishing the scheme and outlining its working arrangements. Consistent with the memorandum of understanding, this bill will permit the transfer of retirement savings between APRA regulated Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes. New Zealanders who move to Australia will be able to transfer their New Zealand retirement savings to Australia and add them to their Australian superannuation benefits. Similarly, Australians moving to New Zealand, and New Zealanders returning to New Zealand, will be able to take their Australian benefits with them, to consolidate with their New Zealand retirement savings. As the scheme is voluntary, Australians and New Zealanders can leave their superannuation behind, if they wish. Superannuation is to be transferred tax free between Australia and New Zealand, although New Zealand transfers into the Australian superannuation system are subject to the contribution cap arrangements, consistent with the terms of the memorandum of understanding. In general, the tax and superannuation laws of the host country will be applied to the transferred savings, with a couple of exceptions where source country rules will apply. These exceptions are designed to preserve unique features of each country's retirement savings scheme. The portability scheme enhances the development of a seamless trans-Tasman labour market, by removing an impediment to labour mobility between these two nations. The introduction of the scheme is an important step in our closer economic relations with New Zealand, and it supports ongoing progress toward a single economic market. Both governments are committed to this goal through the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement. At a personal level, the scheme will enable Australians and New Zealanders to streamline their financial affairs when they move across the Tasman. Individuals will be able to consolidate their superannuation in their country of residence, and avoid paying unnecessary fees and charges on multiple accounts held in the two countries. This is the first time an international superannuation portability scheme has been implemented in Australia and is another Gillard government measure to improve the efficiency of Australia's world-leading superannuation system. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Malaysia and Sri Lanka",37
17,Ms VAMVAKINOU,DELEGATION REPORTS," I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Malaysia and Sri Lanka from 5 to 14 December 2011, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",38
18,Ms VAMVAKINOU,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I would like to make some brief comments in relation to the parliamentary delegation's visit to Malaysia and Sri Lanka between 5 and 14 December 2011. Our visit reaffirmed already strong ties with both countries. We share with Malaysia and Sri Lanka membership of the Commonwealth, and we have similar parliamentary systems. We also have frank and constructive dialogues, through parliamentary exchanges and visits such as the one that was undertaken by this parliamentary delegation. We were warmly Trade received in each country and had significant access to senior decision makers, local officials and community representatives. The parliaments of both nations were generous with their time and hospitality. Visits to Malaysia are frequent, as a consequence of the ASEAN bilateral delegation program. Our visit had the following objectives: to renew contacts with Malaysia's parliament and explore further avenues for dialogue and cooperation; to gain an enhanced understanding of multilevel governance and discuss recent political developments; to review the progress of Australia-Malaysia educational cooperation; to consider national and regional efforts to deal with transnational issues, including defence and security, and refugees and asylum seekers; and to explore topical issues concerning trade and investment between Australia and Malaysia. Our visit underlined the multidimensional nature of Malaysia-Australia relations. It also strengthened institutional ties between our two parliaments. In our report, we note our support for freedom of expression in Malaysia's ethnically and religiously diverse society. Our visit to Sri Lanka was the first official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation since the military victory by the Sri Lanka Army over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009. Our visit had the following objectives: to renew links with the parliament and assess progress towards establishing a Parliamentary Committee on Devolution; to gain an enhanced understanding of political, economic and social factors associated with reconciliation following the civil conflict; to consider the humanitarian, infrastructure and security aspects of the rehabilitation, resettlement and reconstruction efforts, particularly in relation to persons displaced by the conflict; to visit Australian funded aid projects in the north of the country; and to explore the potential for enhanced trade and investment, including higher education, between Australia and Sri Lanka. Our program included visits to several projects funded by AusAID and other international donors in the northern provinces of Jaffna and Kilinochchi-two provinces particularly affected by the civil war. In our report, we commend these international development projects and support continued development assistance to Sri Lanka. We appreciated the frank nature of discussions held with ministers, members of parliament and representatives of political parties. The visit gave us a first hand insight into the current political, economic and social situation in Sri Lanka. It also served to strengthen institutional ties between our parliaments. We concluded that reconciliation is the basis for a durable and sustainable peace, and we support ongoing engagement between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil diaspora here in Australia. We also stress the need to address alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights by all parties to the conflict. This is particularly important to me and other members of the delegation who have large Sri Lankan communities in our electorates. We are fully aware of the concern that our communities have in relation to outstanding issues in Sri Lanka at the moment. Finally, on behalf of the delegation I Select would like to thank the member for Grey, in particular, who so ably served as the deputy chair of this delegation. I would like to thank the Malaysian and Sri Lankan parliaments for hosting our visits. I also sincerely thank all those who took time to meet with us. I also recognise, on behalf of the delegation, the support of the Australian missions in Kuala Lumpur and Colombo and all agencies involved in arranging our visit to northern Sri Lanka. Finally, I thank DFAT and AusAID officers here in Canberra for their tremendous support. NA Publications Committee Report",38

20,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Publications Committee sits on each occasion that the parliament sits, to authorise publication of papers which are not specifically authorised for publication by the House or the Senate. The committee has been working very diligently to ensure the efficient publication of papers. We are encouraging the Presiding Officers to give greater consideration to expanding the electronic papers series, where papers will be presented other than to the House and to the other chamber, in electronic form, for distribution. This will result in not only less duplication but certainly greater efficiencies, both in cost and in time. This is something to be encouraged. It is something that the committee has been working on diligently for some time. We have now written to the Presiding Officers, and we seek to expand the electronic paper series come the opening session of the 2013 parliament. On that, I conclude my remarks. I will keep the House informed about the developments of the committee.

27,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS,"I put this motion because local government in Australia is resource deprived, the local road network in Australia is failing-peak engineers groups throughout the country have identified that fact-and the revenue structure to support local government is a problem which needs to be fixed. This motion is just one suggestion to try to start the policy debate. It does not look like the vote is going to go well today, but I hope that we can pretty quickly do something to establish a better revenue flow to local government in Australia, particularly considering the significant failure of the local road network throughout the country.",42
28,Mr KATTER,PAIRS," State governments have taken on responsibility after responsibility. Every time there is an article in the newspaper, they race off and legislate to create greater responsibilities for themselves. But they do not shoulder the responsibilities themselves; they put the responsibilities upon the local authorities. The policing of the pollution act in Queensland is very costly indeed. All of the policing is of the building laws, which the state government has implemented but for which the local authorities have to pick up the bill. Both the member for Lyne and I have a number of key bridges in our electorates which are falling to pieces, almost to the point where they are becoming dangerous. There is simply no money in north Queensland, where we have very, very limited access to the high-elevation of rainforest. One of the Survivor episodes was shot at the Kirrama Range Road to Blencoe Falls because the scenery there is very spectacular, and at the top of the Kirrama Range Road there is a stand of the magnificent Eucalyptus grandis, the biggest tree in Australia. But there is no money to improve access to the Eucalyptus grandis and the Blencoe Falls, two magnificent tourist attractions which are of world standard. The road has fallen to pieces, and it would be very difficult for the local government by itself to restore it. The member for New England often refers to the 'decaying' state governments. I think that that is probably a true characterisation of them, and I most wholeheartedly support the motion put forward by the member for Lyne.",42
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The question is that the member for Lyne's motion be agreed to. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,42
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes, I declare the question negatived in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. Royal Australian Navy in the Middle East Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) acknowledges the excellent work undertaken by Australian naval forces in the Middle East Gulf Region, in particular the important tasks of: (a) opposition to the smuggling of arms, drugs and other contraband; (b) counter piracy operations; and (c) maritime protection; and (2) applauds the contribution made by the Royal Australian Navy as part of the international coalition in the Middle East. Question agreed to. Domestic Violence and the Workplace Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that two thirds of Australian women who have experienced domestic violence with their current partner are in paid employment; (2) recognises the: (a) significant impact that domestic violence can have on the employment of women who are subjected to it, including: (i) lost productivity as a result of anxiety distraction in the workplace; (ii) absenteeism due to sustaining physical and psychological injuries; (iii) disrupted work histories as victims often frequently change jobs; (iv) lower personal incomes and reduced hours of work; and (v) risks to personal safety in the workplace as well as to co-workers; and (b) positive impact of the inclusion of domestic violence clauses in contracts of employment to ensure protections for victims, including: (i) additional paid leave to enable employees subjected to domestic violence to, for example, attend court hearings and medical appointments without exhausting other forms of personal leave; (ii) access to flexible working arrangements where possible; and (iii) assurance that employee details will be treated confidentially and disclosure will not lead to discriminatory treatment; (3) acknowledges the introduction of domestic violence clauses for public sector employees in both Queensland and NSW, and congratulates organisations in the private sector that have also moved to incorporate these clauses in contracts of employment; and (4) urges all private companies and public sectors to include domestic violence clauses in their enterprise agreements to provide victims with important protections such as access to leave in addition to existing entitlements. Question agreed to.  Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) recognises the extraordinary athletic achievements of the late Peter Norman, who won the silver medal in the 200 metres sprint running event at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, in a time of 20.06 seconds, which still stands as the Australian record; (2) acknowledges the bravery of Peter Norman in and donning an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge on the podium, in solidarity with AfricanAmerican athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who gave the 'black power' salute; (3) apologises to Peter Norman for the wrong done by Australia in failing to send him to the 1972 Munich Olympics, despite repeatedly qualifying; and (4) belatedly recognises the powerful role that Peter Norman played in furthering racial equality.",42
31,Dr LEIGH,PAIRS," by leave-I move: Omit paragraph (3), substitute: (3) apologises to Peter Norman for the treatment he received upon his return to Australia, and the failure to fully recognise his inspirational role before his untimely death in 2006; and, The apology to Peter Norman recognises a great Australian who stood with the black power protestors at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. This amendment simply broadens that apology in that it apologises to Peter Norman for the treatment that he received upon his return to Australia and for the failure to fully recognise his inspirational role before his untimely death in 2006. I would like to thank members on both sides of the House who spoke in this debate. Thelma Norman, Peter's mum, was here in the gallery when we debated the motion and it meant a great deal to her. I have been in contact with Peter's sister, Elaine, and she has told me about the outpouring of public support that was received. A local school in Queensland got each of their students to go back and research the Peter Norman story to find out what it meant to them and to think about how each of them could be a Peter Norman in their own lives, how they could take a stand against racism and intolerance and make those snap decisions that come along with so little warning but that mark character of an individual, as they marked Peter Norman's character. I am grateful to those in this House and the broader community for their support for this motion and I trust that the amendment to the motion, which provides a broad, community-wide apology to Peter Norman for his treatment upon his return from Mexico, will be accepted unanimously by this House as an apology posthumously to Peter Norman. It is something that I know will mean a great deal to Peter's family, friends and the huge family of supporters across Australia.",43
32,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS," I have followed this debate closely and I wanted to congratulate the member for bringing on this motion. It is a good example of private members' business having the ability to progress its way through the parliament. Through this debate, I had the honour, as did many others, of meeting many members of the Norman family and the extended network of people who either knew Peter Norman or know the story of Peter Norman. It has been an eye-opener as to what he did and the contribution to Australia that Peter Norman's story is. I hope through this that more people know the story and are proud of what he did at the Mexico Olympics and that they challenge themselves in the same way on that question of what you would do in that same situation. I hope this is not the end of work we do for the Norman family. In correspondence that has followed, there have been conversations around some sort of tribute on a greater scale to Peter Norman in Australia. One option, just as an example, is a similar type statue to the one that is in San Jose State University in the United States, where you have the opportunity to stand where Peter Norman stood alongside the two American the athletes. That would be a fitting tribute somewhere in Australia, but some other idea may come forward, and I think that would in round out the work that has been done by the member and through this debate very well. Congratulations. Question agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. Military Superannuation Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) recognises the: (a) involvement of Australian service men and women in war and peacekeeping operations; and (b) role of family, friends and community networks in supporting those Australians who have served in our military; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) consider increasing the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme Pension, Defence Force Retirement Benefit Pension and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Pension twice annually by the greatest of the Consumer Price Index, the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index and the Male Total Average Weekly Earnings; and (b) do this in recognition of the unique circumstances of military service compared to all others within the public service. Question agreed to. Australia-Serbia Relations Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) there are well over 100,000 people of Serbian origin currently living in Australia, with approximately 5 per cent in the electoral division of Fowler; (b) the Australian Federal Police and Serbian Police recently signed an agreement to co-operate on trans-national crime including money laundering and drug trafficking, which is an example of the growing strength of Australia's bilateral relationship with the Republic of Serbia; (c) the Republic of Serbia recently gained European Union candidate status which suggests an increased potential for future economic cooperation and provides an opportunity for large-scale investment from Australia and a strong cultural and educational exchange; (d) in 2011, the trade between our two countries increased by 23.8 per cent; and (e) since March 2012, Serbia has been awarded the preferential status under Australian Customs Act 1901, which has the potential to further increase the trade relations; and (2) recognises: (a) that significant progress has been made in Serbia and other countries in the region that participated in the devastating civil war, in moving away from conflict and towards reconciliation and cooperation; and (b) the great economic, social and cultural contribution of the Serbian people to the vibrancy of our multicultural society.",44
33,Mr HAYES,PAIRS," leave-I move: Omit paragraph 2 (a), substitute: (a) that significant progress has been made in Serbia and other countries in the region who were affected by the devastating war, to move away from conflict and towards reconciliation and cooperation. The original words of the motion were constructed to solely attempt to fix a datum point from which to recognise that progress had been made throughout the Balkans. The words were not used in any way to attempt to redefine the nature of the conflict but rather to recognise that through a concerted effort from all countries in the Balkans positive progress had been made towards peace and reconciliation. Clearly what I have tried to do through the amendment is place a focus on the fact that this is about recognising peace and the benefits it brings.",45
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Is the amendment seconded?,45
35,Mr Fitzgibbon,PAIRS,I second the amendment.,45
36,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS," I am not going to jump on every single vote; I am confident this will be the last one. In recognising the significance of this vote, I just wanted to pay tribute to the Serbian ambassador in light of the events of Tuesday night, which involved very difficult issues for this parliament. One of the side stories is that everyone involved in the events of this week still managed to keep a Serbian cultural evening functioning. That could have very easily gone off the rails. But to the Serbian ambassador and to everyone in this chamber who made that work, I say: hats off to you all. Question agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. Victoria: Technical and Further Education by Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) condemns the Victorian Liberal Government for scrapping the 'School Start Bonus' and 'School-based Education Maintenance Allowance' payments and calls for them to be immediately reinstated; and (2) considers that: (a) the Victorian Liberal Government's cuts the Education Maintenance Allowance will affect some of the most disadvantaged students across Victoria, and their families; and (b) these cuts, combined with cuts which have already been made by the Victorian Government to Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning and the Victorian TAFE system, will cause longlasting damage to the Victorian education system, particularly for those who are most at risk of leaving the school system early without proper skills and training.",45
37,Ms SMYTH,PAIRS," leave-I move: That paragraph 1 of the motion be amended to read as follows: (1) opposes the Victorian Government's scrapping of the 'School Start Bonus' and ‘School-based Education Maintenance Allowance' payments and calls for them to be immediately reinstated. The effects of the amendment are that this House will reaffirm its opposition to the Victorian Liberal government's scrapping of the school start bonus and education maintenance allowance. The balance of the motion remains the same and reflects the long standing view of many members in this place that cuts to education in Victoria are causing significant impacts at a primary, secondary and TAFE level, have significant impacts for pathways for education and ultimately for pathways to employment opportunities for students in Victoria and for the families who will ultimately come to rely on jobs that are available to those people who are appropriately skilled and have significant and long-term impacts for members of the Victorian community. The scrapping of the school based education maintenance allowance and the school start bonus in Victoria has had the effect in some schools of meaning that principals have had to search for an extra $40,000 in the school budget. That is an to extraordinary amount for principals to have to find. It is an extraordinary amount for principals and schools in school communities which have backgrounds of low-income families. It is particularly difficult for those schools to find the funds to be able to fill those gaps in their budgets. We know that this will impact disproportionately on people who are of low income. It will mean that their children are unable to get things like textbooks and uniforms and pay for things like stationery and excursions. by This is simply another indication of what a Liberal government means to education, to families and to family budgets. It comes on the back of very significant cuts to the TAFE Liberal sector which have meant that one TAFE in my electorate is facing 220 job cuts this year alone and the closure of Swinburne's Lilydale campus. These are yet more indications of precisely what it means to have a Liberal government in office. I commend the amendment. It reflects the concern of many members not only from Victoria but from other states which are facing similar cuts to education. It reflects the concern and the sentiment of very many people in Victoria who are troubled by the impact of the Baillieu government on their primary schools, secondary schools and TAFE sector.",46
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Is the amendment seconded?,46
39,Mr Symon,PAIRS,I second the motion as amended.,46
40,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS," I hope that I am assisting the House by devoting some time to this important issue. I wish to congratulate the member for La Trobe for the way in which she has put this important issue, which is of national significance, before the House. Regrettably, the Victorian government is displaying the sort of behaviour that we are seeing from many other coalition states, with disregard for the way in which we should invest in one of our most important resources-that is, our human resources. Just as it is in regions such as those of the members for La Trobe and Deakin, I know that my colleague the member for MCEwen sees that what is happening in the northern suburbs of Melbourne is problematic. The member for Maribyrnong is here, championing the western suburbs and the importance of technical education, which is being impinged upon by coalition governments in a very false economy. The thought that they are actually cutting their budgets and saving money in this way, with total disregard for the long-term impact of their mendacious ways, is a great problem. If we look at the history of the way in which coalition governments in Victoria have treated this sector, we will understand that it was predictable that the Baillieu government would do this. I cite as an example a school in the electorate of Batman, Northland Secondary College, which did so much for and developed so many programs for disadvantaged and lowsocioeconomic communities. It then suffered the cuts of the Kennett government. It continued to survive with community support and now, in its latest iteration, has become the Northern College of the Arts and Technology and has benefited from the investment that this government has made in trades training. I think that is important. In the Whittlesea municipality, which serves the electorates of Scullin and MCEwen, we have seen the rebadging of the Peter Lalor Secondary College as the Peter Lalor Vocational College. On the campus of the Peter Lalor Vocational College we see a trades training centre about to be completed, but those who invested their time and vision in that are very fearful that the pennypinching attitude of the Baillieu government might destroy the great impact that the trade training centre could have because of the lack of continuity. Because I spend nights in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, in the fine town of Queanbeyan-I will not mention the suburb that I live in-I agree with the interjection from the member for Eden-Monaro that we see the O'Farrell government continuing the same sort of behaviour. These are important issues that need to be ventilated here in the national parliament. As I said, I think it is appropriate that somebody who champions their community, like the member for La Trobe, should bring this issue in front of the House. I hope that even those opposite will see that there is great value in all spheres of government continuing to invest in the important technical education of young Australians.",46
41,Mr BANDT,PAIRS," I am very pleased to support this amendment and to support the motion. I have seen first hand, especially in my electorate, the effect of some of the devastating cuts, cuts that were not announced and cuts that have had significant impact on people's technical and further education. Given that this is a motion that descends into urging Victorian state parties to do one thing or another, I would urge the Victorian Labor Party to adopt a position that they will fully reverse the cuts. To date the Labor Party has been loud in its condemnation of the Victorian Liberal government but has not been prepared to say that it will reverse the cuts. I am not going to move an amendment to the motion to that effect, but I would hope that at some point we see a bit of even-handedness and we hear Victorian Labor saying that they will reverse the cuts.",47
42,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS," Can I also put on record my support for this motion and the urgent need for a coinvestment strategy from the Commonwealth and the states in education generally and in the pathways from secondary to vocational and tertiary education in Australia today. I am deeply concerned that agreements reached in this place two years ago around the $500 million regional round of the Education Investment Fund are being held back because of that lack of a co-investment strategy and because of significant cuts of over $1 billion by the three Eastern States in particular. I would hope we can get that coinvestment strategy sometime soon and we can start to put a focus on the importance of education to the standard of living for Australia for the next 40 or 50 years among all governments in this country. Question agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative Debate resumed on the motion: That this House instructs the Attorney-General to, as soon as practicable, draft and introduce legislation to curb the facility for creditor litigation in Australia against those countries who have been deemed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, eligible for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, with similar effect to the United Kingdom's Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act 2010 which received tripartite support in the United Kingdom Parliament.",48
43,Dr LEIGH,PAIRS," by leave-I move: That the motion be amended to read: That this House requests the Government, as soon as practicable, to commence a process to examine the risks and benefits of enacting legislation to curb the facility for creditor litigation in Australia against those countries who Plibersek, TJ have been deemed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank eligible for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, with similar effect to the United Kingdom's Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act 2010 which received tripartite support in the United Kingdom Parliament, and to report back to Parliament in the Autumn Session 2013.",48

Pension Assistance Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) after almost 12 long years of inaction by the former Australian Coalition Government, the current Australian Labor Government has delivered historic pension reforms that have provided increases of $154 per fortnight for maxrate single pensioners and $156 per fortnight for max-rate pensioner couples; (b) the NSW Government increased public housing rents for pensioners in 2011, taking away some of the Australian Government's 2009 pension increase; (c) the Australian Government is delivering extra assistance to millions of Australian pensioners through the Household Assistance Package; (d) this new assistance is being delivered as a stand-alone pension supplement, separate from the base pension rate, so that pensioners living in public housing could receive the full benefit of this assistance without it affecting their social housing rents; and (e) the NSW Government has announced that it will include this assistance when calculating social housing rents from March 2013, meaning pensioners living in public housing will not receive the full benefit of the Australian Government's assistance. (2) condemns the NSW Government for increasing rents for about 84,000 NSW pensioners and taking away part of their pension increase; and (3) calls on the Opposition to guarantee it would not take away the pension increases as part of the Household Assistance Package if in government.",48

Mitochondrial Disease Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) mitochondrial disease: (i) is an incurable and debilitating genetic disorder that saps the body's cells of their energy; and (ii) reduces the ability of mitochondria to produce energy required for vital bodily functions, disrupting important muscle and organ function and leading in some cases to organ failure or death; (b) a child is born every 30 minutes who will develop a mitochondrial disease before their tenth birthday; (c) one in every 200 people is affected by mitochondrial disease, but many are misdiagnosed; (d) each year 50 children will develop a severe or life-threatening form of mitochondrial disease; (e) there: (i) is a widespread lack of awareness about this disease, its symptoms or effects; (ii) are few effective treatments for this disease; and (iii) is currently no cure for this disease; (f) clinical trials are underway, however research into this disease requires greater monetary and community support and recognition; (g) scientists have linked mitochondrial dysfunction to other major diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and diabetes; and (h) advances in treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction could also improve treatments for millions of people who suffer these other illnesses; (2) recognises that: (a) 16 to 22 September 2012 is Global Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week; (b) 23 September 2012 is Global World Stay in Bed Day to raise awareness and funds for research into mitochondrial disease; and (c) the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation has been working since 2009 to support patients and their families, spread information and raise the profile of this disease in the community and medical field; and (3) calls on the Government to: (a) encourage the public and private sectors to promote greater awareness of mitochondrial disease; (b) help raise the profile of mitochondrial disease within the medical profession to overcome the lack of knowledge that contributes to misdiagnosis and improper treatment of this condition; and (c) ensure there is appropriate support for patients of mitochondrial disease and their families. Question agreed to. NA Corporations Legislation Amendment (Derivative Transactions) Bill 2012 Report from Committee",53
58,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating additional comments, on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Derivative Transactions) Bill 2012. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",58
59,Ms ONEILL,BILLS,"by leave-On 13 September, the House of Representatives referred the Corporations Legislation (Derivative Transactions) Bill 2012 to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for inquiry and report. As chair of that committee, I am pleased to be able to table the committee's report today. The committee received 11 submissions and held a public hearing in Sydney on 5 October. The committee extended thanks to all who contributed to the inquiry process. The proposed legislative measures demonstrate Australia's commitment to uphold the G20 agreement to increase the transparency of, and reduce the risk attached to, the over-the-counter derivatives market. As this House would be aware, the global financial crisis highlighted a lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives market. International regulators have found that it was this lack of transparency, this lack of regulation, that contributed to the global financial crisis. The G20 agreed to implement over-thecounter derivatives regulatory reforms by the end of 2012. As a G20 member Australia is committed to implementing the OTC derivative market reforms. The bill before the House delivers on Australia's commitment and will allow Australian regulators to more effectively manage the risks attached to over-the-counter derivative transactions. The bill will amend the Corporations Act 2001 to introduce a legislative framework that would allow the operational details of the new over-the-counter derivatives scheme to be largely established by subordinate legislation. The evidence before the committee is clear that this structure will allow regulators to readily respond to changes in the OTC derivatives market. The flexibility will mean that regulations can keep pace with market changes and continue to ensure transparency and-very important, in response to the very real lessons that need to be learned from the GFC-this will reduce systemic risk. In terms of the exercise of delegated authority, submitters to the inquiry raised three areas of concern with the bill. While acknowledging the need for flexibility, some submitters were concerned to ensure that the authority delegated to the responsible minister and to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is exercised appropriately. To this end, the committee has made three recommendations to provide industry greater guidance on the operation of the new regulatory scheme. The committee recommended that:  Treasury and ASIC issue guidance material outlining the consultation process for the development of OTC derivatives regulations and rules;  ASIC further release a regulatory guide explaining the derivative transactions and trade repository rules; and  that ASIC report to the committee on the operation of the new OTC derivatives regulatory framework, as part of the committee's ongoing oversight of the commission. In terms of the electricity sector in particular, three industries also sought exemptions from the new OTC derivatives transaction requirements. Notably, representatives of the electricity sector strongly opposed the application of the new OTC derivatives regulatory requirements to participants in the national electricity market. Representatives put forward several arguments to support the application. In essence, it was put to the committee that the national electricity market is currently sufficiently robust to not present systemic risk to market integrity. The committee found persuasive the view put forward by Treasury that amending the bill to expressly exclude any sector or class of derivative would not be best practice, particularly in the light of the international regulations and requirements around this issue. Rather, we found that it would limit regulators' capacity to respond appropriately to market changes. However, I can report that the evidence before the committee was clear that, at this time, the government does not intend to prescribe the electricity sector as a class of derivatives to which the new OTC derivatives framework would apply. The committee recommended that the Minister for Resources and Energy be consulted prior to making recommendations on rules that would affect the energy sector. The committee recommends that the bill be passed without amendment. Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2012 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2012 Report from Federation Chamber Bill returned from Federation Chamber without amendment, appropriation message having been reported; certified copy of bill presented. Ordered that this bill be considered immediately. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",58
60,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (12:17): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give this bill a second reading and: (1) calls on the Government to extend the operation of the Wheat Marketing Authority for not less than six months after the resumption of the 44th Parliament to enable the government of the day to modify Wheat Exports Australia or replace it with a another body, to better represent the needs of the wheat industry; and (2) notes that the Coalition commits to a consultation process that will commence immediately and provide stakeholders with a forum to outline what wheat industry issues need to be addressed."" Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (12:18): I commenced this speech on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 in the House over a month ago, on 10 September, so I feel as though I have been detained awhile, it having been interrupted by other House business. But I was obviously very persuasive in my previous remarks because, since I made them, we have seen a plethora of opposition MPs come out in support of the government's bill. We saw the member for O'Connor say that he was going to support it and, if need be, cross the floor. We saw the member for Hume say that he was not going to vote against it and would, if necessary, abstain from the vote. Opposition Senator Alan Eggleston is in support of the government's legislation. There are others, and that is fair enough, too. This opposition always professes its love for the free market, but it is so hostile to anything the government does Bill 2012 that its reflex position is to vote no to everything. It is time that it got a little bit positive for a change. As I said before the interruption, the Cole inquiry was established by the Howard government in 2005 to investigate claims of bribery and corruption. The inquiry found that the claims against AWB were substantiated and that the actions taken by the Australian Wheat Board were deliberate. In 2006, the Australian Grain Exporters Association asked that the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly be disbanded and that competition be allowed in the export market. In 2008, Labor introduced a bill to deregulate the wheat export arrangements. Wheat was one of the very last federally regulated commodities in Australia. The Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008 required the Productivity Commission to conduct a review of wheat export marketing arrangements by 1 July 2010. The commission's report was tabled in the parliament in October 2010. This bill is a welcome reform in addressing the consequences when a monopoly such as the Australian Wheat Board is allowed to operate without the rigours of competition and where an organisation which has the market cornered does business with an undemocratic and corrupt regime. Serious questions remain unanswered in the oil-for-food scandal, including why the Australian Federal Police dropped an investigation into possible criminal charges against Australian Wheat Board executives in 2009. In a joint investigation by the Age and the ABC TV's 7.30 program, the acting coordinator of the Australian Wheat Board oil-for-food task force within the Australian Federal Police, Ross Fusca, revealed his view that the task force created to investigate those responsible for paying the kickbacks failed to reach its full potential. He said Australians deserve to know why. The Age reported: This is one of those investigations where there has been a wilful blindness [in the handling ... people need to be held accountable. The task force was established in late 2006 and was given a $30 million budget after Commissioner Cole found 11 former Australian Wheat Board executives and a British based former BHP manager may have committed criminal offences by knowingly allowing the company to make $300 million in illicit payments to Saddam Hussein's regime in breach of United Nations sanctions. Due to his considerable experience in leadership roles, as acknowledged in performance reviews within the Australian Federal Police, Ross Fusca was chosen to help lead the multi-agency Australian Wheat Board task force. Despite the difficulties the task force confronted around staffing and other issues, such as appropriate accommodation and access to computers, Mr Fusca believes it was building the backbone of a strong criminal case, a view that he says was endorsed in 2008 by lawyers from the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Cole commission's senior barrister, John Agius QC, told the Age that police had plenty to work with. He said that there was a strong case that Commonwealth and perhaps Victorian state laws had been breached, that there were cases to answer and that the matter would be in court and people would be prosecuted. Among the evidence Mr Fusca and his team discovered were emails in which some Australian Wheat Board managers discussed the need to keep the kickbacks a secret. Mr Fusca further claimed that an informant to the task force had indicated that federal government officials were aware of the kickbacks. A confidential legal opinion obtained by the Age and written by Peter Hastings QC confirms that the inquiry had a sound legal basis from which to build a of it] criminal case. This advice was given in a memorandum to the Australian Federal Police in April 2008, more than a year after the task force was formed. It is astonishing, given the progress of the task force, that Mr Fusca says that he was offered a promotion to make the inquiry go away and was subsequently demoted from the position of coordinator after emailing his superiors seeking more staff and indicating his intention to pursue the inquiry as vigorously as he could. The task force was shut down in August 2009 based on advice that a criminal prosecution of former managers of the Australian Wheat Board was unlikely to be successful. This advice has not been made available to the public. Of the $30 million earmarked for the task force, the Australian Federal Police spent $5.95 million, according to a letter released to the Saturday Age. Mr Fusca says that the Australian Federal Police's decision to shut down his task force was premature. I believe that the public deserves a full explanation as to why Australian law enforcement agencies have so little to show for their efforts six years after the Cole royal commission exposed one of the nation's biggest corruption scandals. Overseas, many company executives who rorted the United Nations oil-for-food program to pay kickbacks to the regime of Saddam Hussein have been jailed or given huge fines. America moved fastest in probing misdeeds by firms. Prosecutors took seven companies to court, and millions of dollars-in Chevron's case, $30 millionwere forfeited by way of fines or restitution. In April 2011, it was reported by the Telegraph in the United Kingdom that a British businessman had been 'jailed in the seventh conviction in a series of prosecutions for bribery offences under the Iraqi oil-forfood programme'. His conviction after pleading guilty was the seventh to flow from the Volcker report into the manipulation of the oil-for-food program. The prosecution team, which was led by the Serious Fraud Office, was commended for its work in bringing the cases to court. The highestprofile conviction was against engineering firm Mabey & Johnson. Three executives were convicted for their part in paying bribes. For their crimes all three received prison sentences, although one of the sentences was suspended. In Australia we have not seen any criminal prosecution action like those which have taken place in the US and UK, despite the fact that the scale of the Australian Wheat Board payment of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime which flouted the United Nations' oil-for-food program were greater than anything which happened in the US or the UK. I was therefore very troubled to read Mr Fusca's statements about the AFP's handling of the kickbacks issue. At stake is Australia's international reputation upholding rigorous standards of corporate governance and accountability. As the accountability round-table has stated to me, the wrongful dismissal claim from Mr Fusca again focuses attention on the issue of whistleblower protection. There is strong community support for whistleblower protection legislation, and it is a matter of real regret to me that this parliament has not yet delivered it. We have been talking about it and thinking about it for a very long time, but the legislation is still awaited. Mr Fusca's case strengthens, in my view, the already strong case for whistleblower protection legislation to be brought on. The case for whistleblower protection is also strengthened, in my view, by reports that a supply-chain manager at the Reserve Bank's note-printing subsidiary, Securency, developed a strong suspicion as early as 1999 that Securency was paying bribes but felt he was too junior to speak out and feared for his job. It seems clear to me that whistleblower protection can help bring corrupt behaviour or misconduct to light, and I urge the government to introduce it sooner rather than later. This bill is an important step forward in the government's deregulation of the wheat industry. It enjoys the support of many wheat growers-most conspicuously wheat growers from Western Australia, who have made it clear that they do not support the position that the opposition has taken and that they do not understand why the opposition is taking a different position now from the position it took back in 2008. I hope that the opposition reflects on the statements which have been made by wheat growers. I hope that the opposition reflects on the background to the legislation before the House and on the disgraceful position in of which Australia was put by the breaches of the sanctions regime applied to Iraq under Saddam Hussein. I hope that the opposition, which has been divided on the issues we have been debating, reflects in a serious and mature way on this legislation and sees its way clear to supporting it. It seems to me remarkable in this day and age that we can say to wheat growers that we are going to decide who they can sell wheat to and in what circumstances. Not many wheat growers are endorsing that position. I hope that the House supports this legislation, which represents a logical extension of the decision taken by this government quite some years ago to deregulate the wheat industry. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (12:28): I seek leave to make a correction to the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the coalition to the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. Leave granted. Mr JOHN COBB: I correct the second reading amendment as follows: Omit ""the Wheat Marketing Authority"", substitute ""Wheat Exports Australia"". Debate adjourned. Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",60
61,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Bill 2012 and the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account (Consequential Amendments) 2012. At the outset I indicate that the coalition is concerned that the government are trying to rush through this legislation through the House after this bill was introduced into this place just yesterday. Late last night the government contacted the opposition to request that we assist them in facilitating its expedient and urgent passage through the House. Normally, a bill is introduced, a week is allowed for the opposition parties to consider the bill and to take it to opposition committees, the party room and to the shadow cabinet. That is the normal process which applies and which has applied, whoever has been in government in this country, for many decades. Despite the alleged urgency of this bill, departmental officials that met with opposition advisers this morning could not provide any substantive reasons for the urgent rush. Indeed, the 1 December start date was suggested by the government in its joint submission to Fair Work Australia and it first committed funding for this in last year's MYEFO, released almost 12 months ago. The handling of this bill is symbolic of the shambolic nature of this government and its contempt for the parliament. Indeed, if I can say it, if we had a Prime Minister who spent less time playing the victim and more time getting on with governing this nation then this parliament might act in a better way. The coalition welcomed the finalisation of the long-running case involving the social and community sector. Given the important role played in and services provided to our communities right throughout Australia by this sector, care must now be taken to ensure that these services are not reduced or jeopardised and that jobs are not lost. The government must ensure that community service organisations do not close or reduce services as a result of any cost pressures that this decision may cause. Equal remuneration is important, but so is the maintenance of the significant services that organisations in almost every community across this country provide. Indeed, in the Australian newspaper today we have seen concerns being raised in the community that this funding: … will lead to job losses and service cuts to programs for the nation's most vulnerable. Indeed, the full bench of Fair Work Australia expressed concern about the impact of this decision on some parts of the sector that provide services for which costs cannot be recovered or receive any government funding. The coalition continues to harbour some serious concerns that the government's plan to fund pay rises in the community sector will change the workplace landscape and fuel further wage pressures across the economy. Indeed, to date the government has refused to provide the details of how the funding will be met. Just earlier this week, the Prime Minister dressed up an announcement of $2.8 billion in funding for the social and community services sector workers who will be receiving pay rises courtesy of a Fair Work Australia decision. This is not just old news; it is a $300 million cut in Labor's promise. Further, Ms Gillard announced $2.1 billion, then an additional billion, before reducing it back to $3 billion, and now today it is right back to $2.8 billion. So the question is: what is the amount of money which the Commonwealth is committing to this venture? On the other hand, Labor continues to dish out millions of dollars in grants to union bosses. Ms Gillard and Mr Shorten, the responsible minister, today need to explain why they seem to have broken yet another promise. Further, the government cannot even tell us if the $2.8 billion has been set aside today or will be drawn down from future budgets. It is also worth noting that the government, ahead of putting its submission to Fair Work Australia, only consulted the unions-not the providers, not the state governments and not the employees on the ground. And today we see the Victorian government already expressing its concerns about how this is going to operate into the future and about the legislation. Unlike the government, the coalition genuinely believes in supporting low-paid workers but also, in the parliament, operating in a proper and ordered manner. We are disappointed that the government are once again using this place as their plaything so that the Prime Minister and the ministers Gillard responsible can go and hold a doorstop. If the government were genuine about supporting low-paid workers they would scrap the carbon tax, stop the borrowing and cut the cost of living for ordinary Australians. In summary, the government have had 12 months to introduce this legislation. They have not done so until yesterday, and now they now want it expedited through this parliament within a period of 24 hours. The government introduced the bill yesterday and they want a vote today, something out of the ordinary so far as the normal processes of this chamber and indeed this parliament operate. A briefing provided today about the proposed legislation has raised more questions than answers, and there is no guarantee that the government will be able to give us the necessary further briefings even today. There has been chopping and changing about the amounts promised. For example, the $2.1 billion amount, then a further $1 billion, thus a total of $3.1 billion and now apparently $2.8 billion. The coalition has had little chance to speak with stakeholders or to consider practical implications of the bill. There is a good reason that in a democracy like Australia there is normally at least a week's space between the introduction of legislation and the debate on that legislation. It is to enable the opposition parties-the non-government parties-and indeed the government backbench to go out and consult with people in the community, particularly those most affected by a piece of legislation, to ascertain what the effects of that legislation are. How can we do that with less than 24 hours notice in relation to this particular proposition? As I said, even people in the sector are in the media today saying they have concerns about it. We have at least one state government expressing concerns about it within the space of 24 hours. The ability to do that is therefore being denied in this chamber. Obviously, there will be an opportunity in the Senate to do that but surely the people's House should have an opportunity to examine legislation in a proper manner, something which this shambolic government is not allowing. The government is asking us to consider a $2.8 billion spend with less than 24 hours to do so-the hallmark of the Labor government's lack of due care or diligence for $3 billion of taxpayers' money being spent. It may well be appropriate that $3 billion be spent in this way but surely this House and, indeed, the members of this House have some responsibility to each of their constituents to make an assessment about the appropriateness of the expenditure in this manner. Finally, parliament should not be forced to consider a bill just to impress the Australian Services Union because they happen to be in town. Let us not forget the other occasions on which the government has rushed large spending bills quickly and they have ended up being total disasters, such as the BER, which will remain a hallmark of the inefficiency and the infamy of this government. The coalition will not oppose the bill but we intend to have a fulsome consideration with the wider community prior to this bill being debated in the other place.",63
62,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate this order of the day concurrently with the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account (Consequential Amendments) Bill out 2012. If there is no objection to that the Chair will allow that course to be followed.,65
63,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Bill 2012 and the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012. The member for Menzies was the architect, the author and the apostle of Work Choices, imposed on the community sector. What a mean-spirited response we saw from those opposite there today, saying they will support this bill! But they did nothing to support low-paid workers, particularly the 120,000 women of the 150,000 employees in this sector who will get assistance from this particular legislation today. It will make a big difference in my home state of Queensland and I particularly thank the Secretary of the Queensland branch of the ASU, Kath Nelson, and the Assistant Secretary Jenny Thomas for the work they do and the great work they have done on behalf of Queensland women, particularly those who work in the social and community sector. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for their inaction, their inertia and their inactivity in this sector. The fact is that we are putting close to $3 billion on the table, putting in a special account providing for those women particularly, and for those men who work in women and children's refuges, run support centres for people with a disability, lead counselling, family support services and emergency housing servicesorganisations in my electorate such as Focal Extended, Our House, IRASI, Ipswich Women's Centre Against Domestic Violence, Riverview House and many others. What are those opposite going to say about this when they go back to their electorates? 'We did nothing for nearly 12 years about this issue.' We have put money on the table to achieve this just and fair outcome for the low-paid workers of this country. Those opposite say words but when it came to the legislation that they passed when they were on this side of the chamber it was not for workers-it was antiworkers. legislation is for workers, for those people who make our community a more decent and humane place. That is what we are doing here today-150,000 workers will get assistance across the years from this legislation and what it does for them. Under the terms of the equal remuneration order handed down by Fair Work Australia, about 150,000 SACS workers will get that assistance. From 1 December, wage rises are the nine instalments until 20 June 2021 totalling between 23 per cent and 45 per cent. It is a significant win, especially for women. For those employees in Queensland this is the fulfilment in large part of that heads of agreement signed between the Australian government by the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard, and Linda White on 30 October 2009 in relation to low-paid workers across the country, preserving the new rates for Queensland employees and also achieving similar outcomes with the submission made to Fair Work Australia for employees in other states through pay equity and work value claims. What we are doing here is making sure that those workers in those areas get the kind of wage justice they deserve. The decision to create a special account demonstrates our commitment to working families across the country, to SACS workers and, through our submission to Fair Work Australia on an historic equal pay case, for wage justice in this sector. The funding here will go towards funding the wages of those workers. I am pleased that those organisations in Queensland will get the help that they need pursuant to this legislation. This includes Commonwealth funded service providers subject to the transitional pay equity order made by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission on 12 June 2009. Those Queensland social and community sector This workers will be transitioned over time to the Fair Work Australia equal remuneration order. That is a good outcome for my home state of Queensland when Campbell Newman and the LNP government are financially plundering the social and community sector and organisations like TASC funding through Queensland, which we had to step in and support because people were at risk of homelessness. Indeed, workers in those sectors were supported by this federal Labor government when those opposite said nothing while those services were being taken away from tenants and those other people who were strugglingpeople with a disability, people who are semi-literate, people who are financially challenged. Those opposite said nothing about that. This legislation will help workers in those sectors to make sure that they create the kind of society we want-decent and humane, a fairer system, a stronger economy but a fairer society. That is what this federal Labor government is all about. We are committed to making sure those workers get it. This legislation will provide it for them. The ASU across the country, but particularly in my home state of Queensland, deserves recognition, acknowledgment and applause for what they have done. It goes to show what a federal Labor government does: it stands up for the poor, the vulnerable, the weak and those with a disadvantage, while those opposite stand up for everything that is mean and tricky. It was once again shown by the speech made by the honourable member for Menzies that they are committed to the pernicious, destructive attitude legislation which we call Work Choices, and which we got rid of after the election of this federal Labor government. I commend the legislation and I commend the Minister for Community Services Julie Collins for the great work she has done.",65
64,Ms COLLINS,BILLS,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (12:44): I want to address some of the issues raised in the debate on the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Bill 2012. Whilst I appreciate the House's assistance in getting this bill through, the timing was raised by the shadow minister and I just want to put on the record some comments in relation to the timing. The bill is obviously about making payments to organisations and to states and territories. This argument that we could have done this 12 months ago is indeed nonsense because the equal remuneration order by Fair Work Australia was not finalised until late June and the Prime Minister made an announcement in July that we estimated the additional cost from the ERO to be around $1 billion. We have had to go away and do our costings since that time and the total is $2.82 billion. This bill will establish a special account under the Financial Management and Accountability Act, supporting Commonwealth's contribution of around $2.8 billion to Australia's social and community services sector following Fair Work Australia's historic equal pay ruling earlier this year. As we have heard, workers in the social and community services sector make a real difference to the lives of many vulnerable members of our community, taking on some of the most demanding jobs, including counselling families in crisis, running homeless shelters and and working with people with disability and with victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. We know that around 150,000 workers in the sector have been affected by this equal remuneration orderapproximately 120,000 of them, the vast majority, are women. The Fair Work Australia order means that some of Australia's lowest-paid workers will benefit from pay rises of between 23 and 45 per cent to be phased in from December this year. Around $2.8 billion in funding will be delivered over the eight years to meet the Commonwealth's share of the costs of these pay rises for social and community sector workers in Commonwealth funded programs, including programs funded under agreements with and payments to states and territories such as the national partnership payments and national specific purpose payments. Eight Commonwealth agencies will be able to draw on funding from the special account to assist employers who are directly and indirectly funded by the Commonwealth, as prescribed under the new legislation, and who have employees who qualify for rises under the order. The phased introduction recognised the complex funding arrangements in the sector and will allow community sector organisations delivering Commonwealth funded programs to pay the new rates without reducing services to the community. the A significant amount of Commonwealth funding will be provided to the sector through states and territory governments for workers agreements with and payments to states and territories such as national partnership payments and national specific purpose payments. This bill will enable funding to be paid to the COAG Reform Fund established under the COAG Reform Fund Act 2008 for this purpose. This government expects that the states and territories to pass on the full amount of funding and to meet their own obligations by committing their share of funds. Every day the social and community services sector delivers vital services to the hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians. We want to make sure the sector is strong and productive now and into the future. Not only are these workers deserving of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work but properly valuing caring work and providing decent wages in industries dominated by women is also an important part of keeping our economy strong and resilient. The government will continue to work collaboratively with state and territory governments to ensure the historic Fair Work Australia order is fully implemented and fully funded for the benefit of workers in the sector. The government will also work with the sector to ensure the smooth implementation of the Fair Work Australia order across the states and territories. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

68,Ms COLLINS,BILLS,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (12:50): I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (12:51): I make the point that has been made by the shadow minister who had the carriage of this bill; that is, about the speed and haste of it being improperly brought forward. Notice was given only yesterday and no proper attention or time was given to allow the opposition to go through the proper formalities for consideration of the bill. It is quite unseemly. I think it is most important that the opposition states that this sort of behaviour from the government cannot be tolerated. If you are the government, you have procedures to follow and you must follow them, and that includes giving the opposition the correct amount of time to allow proper consideration of legislation. This is an appropriation. This is a large amount of money. It will have a very large impact. As the shadow minister, Mr Andrews, pointed out, it will have an impost on many NGOs and other organisations, and there should have been adequate time for consultation, from the opposition's point of view, for the proper consideration of this bill. it The fact that we have chosen not to oppose it simply says that we on this side of the House have a solid conscience on the matter, but I say to the government that it may not and must not proceed in this way: it shows a complete contempt for the seriousness of the bill and the manner in which things must be dealt with in this parliament.

69,Ms COLLINS,BILLS,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (12:53): The Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 enables funds to be transferred from the special account we established with the last bill into the COAG Reform Fund, enabling payments to social and community sector workers in the states and territories. It is a companion bill to the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Bill and, as I said, that bill establishes a special account under section 21 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to fund the Commonwealth's contribution to the historic pay rise awarded by Fair Work Australia earlier this year to our social and community service sector workers. This supplementation from Commonwealth will be delivered through funding drawn from the special account for eight Commonwealth agencies and allocated to assist employers who are directly or indirectly funded by the Commonwealth for the purposes of a program prescribed under the new legislation, and who are required to make payments to their employees under the pay equity arrangements. This consequential amendments bill makes one minor amendment to the existing Commonwealth legislation to complete the new arrangements. This amendment will insert into the COAG Reform Fund Act a note pointing out that an amount may be credited to the COAG Reform Fund under the new Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account 2012. 2012 Bill read a second time.

71,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," It gives me pleasure to rise to speak to the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 and the consequent amendment. To cut to the chase, the amendment is to defer the winding up of the WA, the Wheat Export Authority, until some other measures are taken within the reform and deregulation of the Australian wheat export industry. I must say that farmers generally-not all of them, but generally-have welcomed the deregulation of the wheat industry, and younger farmers in particular are participating very strongly in what is now a fully deregulated market. There are around 40 exporters out of Australia now, and those who would suggest that there are still some constraints on the operations of those companies or their ability to set up business in the first place are not being strictly truthful. This debate is not so much about wheat at all; it has now moved on and is about the grain handling chain and the path to export for all grains-not just wheat. In fact, we have reached a situation where what were government-protected and grower owned monopolies in the handling and port system of Australia have largely moved into other hands and are presenting impediments in the marketplace for other buyers and sellers. The coalition are urging the government to show a little bit of caution and hold back on winding up the WA until we fix up some of these problems that are still within the industry. The WA was established primarily to approve new companies into the export market, and it has done so quite well indeed. In fact, I agree that it is doing very little the moment; it is collecting a levy of 22c a tonne from growers. It is right to ask the question: why not shut it down? What is it need doing? The problem is these issues of unfinished business. I am still involved in the wheat industry-I own a farm-and at the moment wheat is worth somewhere between $200 and $300 a tonne on average, and yet it is costing growers up to $90 a tonne to get it onto a ship and into that export market. So growers are intensely interested in the cost in the path to market for their products. It is interesting to note-and we are fully aware of this-that there is a somewhat different opinion in Western Australia to the rest of Australia. It is worth, in the House's interest, pursuing why that is the case. At around the time that the single desk in Australia was wound up, the communityowned assets built up by farmers under government regulations and government protection for many years were passed progressively to corporatised bodies, and for most of Australia from there into privately owned institutions. In Western Australia the primary bulk handling company is still owned by the growers. In the rest of Australia those companies are owned by independent companies, and that is why we have a different opinion in the West from the rest of Australia on this issue-bearing in mind that I believe that sometime in the future there will be a push to corporatise CBH Western Australia and in the future the temptation to realise those assets could be as strong in Western Australia as it was for the rest of Australia, so Western Australia too will face the same issues, some of which are apparent at the moment. One of the biggest bones of contention for those people operating in the export market is that the three regional monopolies control the market information. If as a grower I deliver grain to the local silo system and I at have unsold product, I know where the unsold product is and the body that receives the grain knows where it is-in this case, these three regional monopolies. The three regional monopolies also operate marketing arms. In the case of most of Australia those marketing arms know exactly where those pools of grain are and other marketers do not. They have privileged information and this is the biggest issue the industry is grappling with at the moment. For instance, I come from the Eyre Peninsula region of South Australia which is entirely an export market. If I were a grain trader, to get grain off the peninsula I would need to engage a bulk carrier to move a load of about 40,000 tonnes. That bulk carrier needs to dock at the Viterra site which is a regional monopoly in Port Lincoln, and my grain must be delivered at some stage into the system. Whether or not I have sold to a different buyer becomes academic, because at some stage the grain has to enter the system. That means that buyers in the market have to be certain when they book shipping space, sometimes some months in advance, that they can fill the ship. If they have committed to the shipping program and later find they can only accumulate 15,000 tonnes or 10,000 tonnes then they are left with an unfilled order. They do not have the information to know where to go to accumulate extra tonnage, but their competitors do. Those that control the bulk handling system do have that information, so this is a very serious issue for the industry. It is true that the Wheat Export Authority in their current form cannot fix this. They do not have the authority to fix it, but they are in an ideal position to become the authority that can fix it. When we talk about an unregulated market, which is basically what we have, we can throw our mind to the operations of other markets-the financial services sector, the banking sector, the superannuation sector. Sure, we have free and open competition, but we do not have it without any rules at all. In this case, wethat is, the coalition-are asking for the other companies to have access to that market information so they can accumulate their tonnage, so they can go to farmers and offer them prices on the same basis as their competitors. Talking about the marketing information that the bulk handlers hold, the WA in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the operational issues in the grain export networks said: This results in a significant marketing advantage to the associated accredited exporter of the bulk handling company. The committee will note a number of public submissions presented to this enquiry state that the retention of stock and quality information by the bulk handling companies creates market asymmetry, providing them unfair advantage in marketing and trading of grain and reduces effective competition in the market. Surely all sides of politics agree that we want open and fair and vigorous competition in the marketplace. For the bulk handling companies to make the assertion that it is not in the growers' interest to have this information in the marketplace I find very difficult to comprehend. It does not matter what you are selling-if it is real estate, cars, washing machines or even Tim Tams-you want the world to know that you have some Tim Tams, washing machines, cars or real estate to sell. You do not want to keep it a secret, but at the moment that is the case. That information is held tightly by one company. You can understand why growers are frustrated about this. We have an opportunity, before the WA is finally wound up, to give it some new instructions and get this cleared up before we remove the last vestiges of regulation. I believe that the message is getting through somewhat to the bulk handling companies at the moment. I believe there are moves afoot to try and establish a code of conduct. I believe they are recognising that growers have a genuine interest. But if we signal that this parliament has lost interest in achieving this outcome, I think we will take away the pressure to continue on the reform path. If that is the case, we will be dragged back here within a few years to reinstitute something similar to the WA to do exactly what we should be asking it to do now. In this case, the coalition are saying: hold off for a couple of years and give the industry a chance to sort it out, and we will sit down with the industry and come up with the new guidelines in which it can operate. If the bulk handling companies have moved that far in the interim period that we do not have a problem then we will not have any work to do, will we? But to just wash our hands of it and say that this parliament no longer has any interest in the issue is abandoning our farmers. Those who say that this is a stalking horse to bring back the single desk could not be more wrong. This is not about the single desk; this is about having properly functioning bulk handling and port authorities around Australia. It has nothing do with the particular commodity. It is the fact that all of these products have to be funnelled through the one set of infrastructure. There is a similarity in Western Australia that I know the member for Brand will be very familiar with. We had a High Court case within the last two weeks wherein Fortescue Metals had a win to say they will be able to use Rio Tinto's railway lines. They will be able to put their trains on existing infrastructure. This is a very big move, and it has been in the courts for a number of years. There are great similarities here, because in the end farmers pay for all the infrastructure. They do not want to have to go out and invest in a whole heap of new infrastructure to allow new companies to operate in the same space. There are some other loose ends to be tied up too. There are cases, particularly in South Australia, in the industry that I know the best. There are changes, and the ACCC has made some moves, but we have had a system where all companies have had to book places on the shipping stem for their export program. All companies have been charged a fee of $5 a tonne; but, in the case of the company that actually controls the shipping stem, if they default, they pay the $5 to themselves. It is a nice little deal if you can get it. After all, if you buy a monopoly you expect to be able to operate like a monopoly. There is some movement in that area, because the ACCC said we have to go to a full auction. I am looking forward to seeing how that operates. But it is yet to be proven. There are concerns among the growers about upmarket access, about delivery feesbecause of course if you deliver to a private operator and then it has got to come out of his private storage and go back into the bulk handling authorities, there are extra receiver fees. So all these things are extra to impediments that make it harder for the competition to operate. Not everything is bad. Like I say, I think there is some movement in the industry. But I do not think now is the time to just walk away, for this parliament to wash its hands and say, 'We don't want to have anything more to do with the Wheat Export Authority. Twenty-two cents a tonne-sure. I do not like paying any fees out of my wheat either. Growers are particularly incensed about the number of levies they have to pay. But 22c a tonne is certainly not one of the big ones. And I am getting no feedback from my growers about that particular 22c a tonne. It is interesting: in this debate, as we have gone through the period of deregulation of the wheat industry, the representatives of the wheat growers in South Australia were some of the strongest allies of the Western Australians in the abandonment of the single desk. This was where the strongest voice came from. It made sense because, as has been said in other speeches, South Australia and Western Australia are pretty much totally export markets. But those same representatives-many of them friends of mine-are coming to me now and saying, 'No, it's different this time.' I understand Western Australians have a different point of view because of the reasons that I outlined at the beginning of my speech. They still have grower control of the bulk handling company. But I ask them to have some understanding for the rest of Australia and also to realise that maybe their control of that bulk handling company is not forever and they can face exactly the same issues, for other operators trying to get into the market, as the rest of Australia is facing at the moment.",70
72,Mr GRAY,BILLS,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (13:11): I listened intently to the member for Grey's observations, and I have absolute confidence in his knowledge of his local circumstances, given his own background. But I have to say: how can members opposite turn a blind eye to the numerous public appeals by Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd in Western Australia, the WA Farmers Federation and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association-groups which represent the majority of Western Australian farmers and are their voice on this subject. Even the Western Australian Liberal Premier has pleaded for Western Australian Liberal members to support this bill. The CBH terminal in Kwinana is in my electorate and stands to lose up to $1 million a year if the coalition votes down this final grower step towards deregulation by dismantling Wheat Export Australia. The CBH terminal is a cooperative. It is owned by farmers. Farmers will lose that $1 million. In addition to that, individual wheat growers in Western Australia stand to lose a further $3 million in revenue for their own farm businesses. Western Australia is the biggest export wheat state. This is Western Australia's grower biggest agricultural industry. It is worth around $3.5 billion a year. It is one of the great pillars of the Western Australian the economy, and it is beyond belief that some members on the other side, who claim to represent the interests of WA wheat growers, are prepared to betray them and sell them short for purely political reasons. It is beyond belief that they are prepared to reject this Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 and cost wheat growers in Western Australia millions of dollars in lost revenue and continue to add to the administrative, regulatory red-tape burden of the CBH operation in Kwinana and the administrative, regulatory red-tape burden of all farmers in Western Australia. It is beyond belief that the personal appeal of 10 senior Liberal Party members in Western Australia who, on 4 October, wrote to all Liberal MPs and senators, will have the door slammed in their faces. I seek leave to table the letter to all Western Australian Liberal MPs and senators from those 10 senior Western Australian Liberals: Barry Court-a substantial and thoughtful Western Australian Liberal; Murray Nixon; Andres Timmermanis; Steve Martin; Alex Butterworth and Gordon Thomson, President of the Durack Division; Richard Wilson; Sandra Brown; Steve Cleaver and James MCLagan. They deserve to have their voices heard and their opinions heard within the Liberal Party. Their voices and their opinions count on this matter and their voices and their opinions are the voices and opinions of agricultural Western Australia-that great pillar of our state that built our state through its first hundred years of existence. I hear members opposite speak of whether or not you are selling cars, washing machines or Tim Tams. I can say this: whether or not you are selling cars, washing machines or Tim Tams, you actually want to have a free market, and that is what we are talking about here-a free market. All of us would believe-and anyone involved in primary production would believe-that it is a reasonable proposition that, before you take your crop off, you should know and understand the conditions under which that crop will be marketed. You should understand that. And I believe that members opposite do understand that. I believe that there is still an opportunity for members opposite to be brought to their senses before an industry is brought to its knees. There is time for thought and for consideration of the critical matters which Western Australian wheat farmers have sought quite properly to bring to the attention of this parliament. The Kwinana grain terminal in my electorate is a fantastic piece of infrastructure. It was built in the 1960s as a courageous act by Co-operative Bulk Handling. It cost $90 million, and these days, when you talk about the wheat terminal in Kwinana, you get the NIMBYs who would prefer, because it is bright blue, that it not blight their skyline. You get the people who do not like the dust that occasionally settles on the sea and helps grow fantastic mussels. You get the people who question whether or not that terminal is in the right spot. That terminal is a critical piece of Australian infrastructure. It cost a cooperative $90 million 40 years ago. It is an investment that today would not be made. Today, if you had to replace it, it would cost over $2 billion. is an investment for future generations of Western Australians from great farmers who made a decision to build it. The beneficiaries today are a grateful generation of farmers and of workers in my electorate who work at that terminal. It exports our principal export crop. When you are dealing with a principal export crop, you want to deal with the freest, most open market circumstances that can be created, and you want to deal with that before you take your crop off. The grain industry in Western Australia has a courageous and a unique history. From the days of its creation in the middle 1830s, at a time of starvation and malnutrition, our farmers in Western Australia began to understand the poor nature and the poor quality of their soils and they began to understand the importance of trace elements. The development of that industry grows in concert with the understanding of the addition of trace elements. It also grows at a time of the expansion of mechanised farming, the introduction of the internal combustion engine, and the opening up of a fantastic grain belt, made available to farmers in Western Australia because of science and because of an appropriate combination of agricultural common sense and know-how and industrial technology. So we develop a grain belt in Western Australia which is beyond any doubt the envy of the world. Just the other day I was at a CBH function which marked a massive investment in grain rail infrastructure, an investment in infrastructure to carry five billion tonnes of grain around Western Australia and to bring it to our ports and our silos. Of those five billion tonnes, 3½ billion tonnes are our wheat crop, and it is that wheat crop that we discuss in this bill here today. The grain industry in Western Australia is a critical pillar of our social development, our It community development, our own sense of being and, importantly, our economy. It is why our Premier supports this bill. But, unfortunately, our Premier does not have a voice in this parliament on this issue, because his own party in this place has deserted him. The Western Australian grain rail system involves 1,200 kilometres of rail capacity to carry this crop to our markets. Five hundred million dollars from the Western Australian government, from the Commonwealth government and from CBH, from farmers, has been invested in the latest technology upgrade and uplift to bring our grains to market. We want it to come to the best possible market. We want it to come to a deregulated market. We want it to come to a transparent market. We want it to come to the market that our farmers want to take it All of us in this place should celebrate the removal of regulation and not seek to extend regulation, even for limited periods of time. Where we can, we should take regulations out of the system. We all know that. A decision not to support this bill is a decision to send a bill of $3 million to our farming community and to then impose a further bill of $1 million on our combined bulk-handling operations. Today, wheat is exported from Western Australia to more than 20 countries. Major shipments go to China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan. They go in bulk and they go in containers. Our systems for managing and handling our grain exports in Western Australia are built on the great insight that is brought to this industry by combined bulk handling, by the insightful decision made in the 1960s by Mick Gayfer to put into the industry a $90 million investment, which at that time people would have thought was mad. The generation who are the beneficiaries of that courageous investment, of that courageous decision, now want to say, 'Let's really get the benefit of what our forefathers have done.' By putting in place the best grain-gathering system, by investing in that grain-gathering system, by investing in our export infrastructure, we have made available the capacity to deliver great gains and great benefits for Western Australian farmers. This season is not going to be a great season. It did not rain much in June or July. The August rains did not really get into our grain belt and much of the September rains did not get into our southern wheat belt, although some did get through to the northern part of our wheat belt. But it is not going to be a bumper crop like last year's 14 million tonnes. It is probably going to be closer to nine million tonnes. At a time of pinched markets and difficult circumstances for our farmers because of increased costs to. and the difficult situation with the high Australian dollar, why would we want to make it harder for our principal export market industry, the grains industry in Western Australia? Why make it harder? Members opposite have conceded: 'In time, we will get around to it. In time we will get around to this deregulation.' The time is now, a month before the grain crop is taken off in Western Australia, a month before up in the northern part of the grain belt they start to get their machines going to harvest their crops, and six weeks before they start to do that around my family's wheat properties in Kellerberrin and Doodlakine. It is around a month before they will do it in other parts of the southern wheat belt. Farmers deserve to know the conditions under which they will sell their crops before they take off their crops. I can do no more than politely plead with this House and the members opposite to heed the views of Western Australian wheat farmers, heed the views of the Western Australian Premier on this matter and heed the views of those farmers who genuinely want to gain the best dollar they can for the crop into which their families have invested their livelihoods-a crop which saw an extremely uncertain 90 days at the start of this growing season and which is critical to the sustained health and welfare of our farming sector in Western Australia. I know and I understand what difficult decisions look like. I know and I understand that the Australian wheat industry is not the same on the east coast as it is on the west coast. But I am a Western Australian and a person whose family connections are with this industry, a person who knows it and cares about it. Every November I take great pride in taking my sons with my father-inlaw up to the family farm to watch the crop being taken off. It is reasonable that at the time at which we watch that crop being taken off, my brother-in-law and his family should understand the conditions under which it will be sold. That is a reasonable proposition. It a sensible proposition. What the government and the parliament are attempting to do here in this bill is consistent with years of discussion. It is consistent with undertakings given by this parliament on many occasions to seek to remove the wheat export arrangements currently in place. It is good public policy. is good policy for the farmers of Western Australia. They have reasonably sought that their Western Australian parliamentary representatives support them in this place, and I am extremely pleased that Mr Crook has agreed to do just that. I am extremely pleased that people are listening to the Western Australian farmers. But I plead: this is an important matter, and there is time before this vote is taken for people to change their views and consider the central, thoughtful proposition that farmers, before they take their crop off, should understand the conditions under which their crop is to be marketed. I thank the House for its indulgence.",73
73,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," The Australian wheat industry is heavily exports focused, with as much as 70 per cent of wheat production each year being exported throughout the world. Australia, historically, has been one of the top five major wheat-exporting countries. Let me from the outset declare a passionate interest in wheat growing and the future viability and prosperity of the industry. I grew up on wheat farms at Marrar until 1968 and then until 1986 at Brucedale between Wagga Wagga and Junee. My late father, Lance, grew wheat, and two of my brothers-in-law, Gary Brill and Ian Buchanan, are wheat growers at Wallacetown and The Gap respectively. In 2010-11, Australia was the third largest wheat exporter, behind the United States of America and the European Union. On 4 June is 2008, the transition to a deregulated wheat export market began with the abolition of the single-desk wheat-marketing arrangements, a dark day in the eyes of most growers to whom I have spoken. The Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008 established a system for regulating the export of bulk wheat such that exporters of bulk wheat had to be accredited It under the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme, which is administered by Wheat Exports Australia and primarily funded from the wheat export exchange. A total of 32 companies have been approved for export by Wheat Exports Australia, all of which have operated effectively. Nineteen of these are actively exporting. In 2010-11, 18.5 million tonnes were exported; however, only seven companies exported more than one million tonnes. This wheat was exported to 52 countries for a value of $5.9 billion. Of the exported grain, 16.3 million tonnes were bulk and the remaining 12 per cent was in containers. These statistics highlight the regional monopolies which are operating in the grain market. Furthermore, of the 16 ports, 13 are dominated by the exporter who owns the port. New South Wales Farmers, Grain Producers Australia, the Victorian Farmers Federation, AgForce, the South Australian Farmers Federation and Grain Producers South Australia all have concerns on the public record about the grain supply for bulk exports currently being dominated by three established bulk handlers, stifling a competitive environment which could benefit farmers. The infrastructure networks belonging to these bulk handlers allow a natural monopoly as they have the integrated receiver, up-country storage and the port terminal services. This undoubtedly provides an advantage in the wheat export market when they become grain-trading entities. The bill before the House implements the government's response to the Productivity Commission's recommendations on wheatexporting marketing arrangements. If passed, this bill will remove the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme and wheat export charge on 30 September 2012, abolish Wheat Exports Australia on 31 December 2012, and continue the operation of the port access test, to be administered by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission from 1 October 2012 until at least 30 September 2014. The access test will then be abolished on the condition that a nonprescribed, voluntary industry code of conduct covering access to grain export terminals is in place. The coalition does not support this bill to abolish Wheat Exports Australia and believes consultation with industry is the best way to address the outstanding issues. Consultation with all of the industry is something that has been severely lacking in this, as with so many other Labor policies brought before this House in recent times. The government did not widely consult with farm organisations on this bill and relied on a task force predominantly made up of large grain trader representatives. The coalition has consulted with a large number of farmer groups and grain marketers and is of the view the majority support the retention of Wheat Exports Australia, at least until unresolved issues are addressed. As a result of these discussions, the shadow minister for agriculture and food security has moved an amendment to the second reading, calling on the government to extend the operation of the wheat marketing authority for not less than six months after the resumption of the 44th Parliament to enable the government of the day to modify Wheat Exports Australia or replace it with another body to better represent the needs of the wheat industry. Further, the coalition commits to a consultation process that will begin immediately and provide stakeholders with a forum to outline what wheat industry issues need to be addressed. The majority of growers have presented a position that calls for oversight of the market to ensure transparency and competition, which has not currently been achieved. Former National Farmers' Federation president Graham Blight has said there is 'no equity in the marketplace', and he is right, of course. The proposed abolition of all statutory oversight is premature and such a decision should be based on evidence of the effective and efficient operation of the export wheat supply chain. Many growers feel there is a need for a statutory body to oversee the industry and for it operate in a similar way to the old Wheat Export Authority. This is certainly the feeling amongst growers in my electorate of Riverina, and Ian Munro of Rankins Springs, better known as Jock, has been the most vocal about wheat issues in my time in parliament. I appreciate his forthright stance and his ongoing passion for the industry. Mr Munro describes the current system as 'unfair and inequitable' and believes a statutory body could police the ports and ensure equitable access for traders, especially the smaller traders who struggle against the regional monopolies. A code of conduct is not viewed by growers as having enough power to ensure all parties will abide by it and it will benefit only the traders, not the growers. Evidence also suggests the export wheat supply chain is not mature enough to self-regulate and there is no precedent for an industry code of conduct in the agricultural sector. Mr Munro also voiced concerns about the imbalance of the availability of wheat stocks information. This is an important mechanism to determine pricing levels throughout the wheat export supply chain, and Mr Munro's concerns were shared by many submissions from growers and exporters made to the Senate inquiry into the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. Lack of access to this information has led to dissatisfaction amongst grower groups, market and price discovery inefficiencies and an inability for growers to make informed decisions on what crops to grow. The current accreditation system also needs improvement to ensure accreditation is based upon performance and not character. The scheme does not need to be and should not be inflexible but must ensure symmetry in the supply chain around stocks intelligence, which could be anticompetitive, and maintain the integrity of the Australian wheat varietal classification system, ensure contract terms and specification compliance and recognise the need for greater transparency and improved confidence in the integrity and quality of Australian wheat. The farmers organisations that have banded together have called for amendments to the present regulations to ensure accreditation is not a bureaucratic threshold to a competitive market but rather a tool to create a market environment where everyone is on an equal playing field. There is also the need for a monitoring role for export cargoes, bulk and non-bulk, to provide assurances around the quality and varietal integrity of wheat exports. New South Wales Farmers supports the creation of a scheme to protect and continue to build a premium for Australian grain through quality assurance systems for exported wheat. This view is shared amongst other growers who are concerned a few dodgy operators would have the potential to ruin Australia's reputation for providing quality wheat if the industry goes down this path. Currently, by utilising the wheat export charge as the primary funding source to provide ongoing effective oversight of the export wheat markets, there are adequate capacity and resources. In order for any structure to provide effective oversight it will need a charter that provides appropriate oversight for the new role and function. New South Wales Farmers President Fiona Simson has voiced her concern about this bill. Her organisation believes the liberalised wheat export market has not yet delivered the purported market benefits to grain farmers in terms of competition for wheat and improved on-farm returns. New South Wales Farmers would also like to see a scheme that requires reporting of information on available stocks of wheat and the quality of uncommitted wheat warehoused by grain exporters. They believe this would also ensure fair terms of access to port terminal services and benchmark the market to build competition for farmers' grain. This bill certainly has had vocal opposition towards it from the grain industry and has forced grain marketers to address the issues of port access, the voluntary code and other sectors of grain producer representation to try to get a cohesive arrangement working in the best interests of Australian grain. There have been positive signs and industry now needs to build on this with the WA. The coalition is committed to continuing discussions with the wheat industry to help create the best environment for it to be able, given good seasons, to prosper. Whilst the coalition is eager to partake in this process, yet again this situation underscores the inability of this Labor government to understand and resolve issues, especially in the agricultural sector. For Australia to continue to be a top quality wheat exporter it is essential that systems are in place to ensure the product being exported has the necessary quality assurance programs and all growers have the necessary access to wheat stocks information to make informed decisions about which crops to grow and what their returns will be. The latest issue of the Grains Research and Development Corporation journal Ground Cover, for June-July, tells of our quality issues in Asia, the fact the USA is stealing a march on us and that our wheat is losing its relative value. Alexandra Roginski writes: Australian grain traders need to improve the traceability and consistency of grain within shipments if Australian wheat is to meet the functional needs of end-users and maintain its hard-won foothold in South-East Asian markets. She added this was the finding of a GRDC funded study by the Centre for Grain Food Innovation in Perth. While Asia is a fastgrowing market for wheat and flours derived from Australian wheat, its bakery sector is not satisfied with the traditional bulk commodity approach to Australian exports. This is another reason why the retention of Wheat Exports Australia is important until a proven structure or arrangement is put in place to address the issues that have arisen since deregulation. Professor of Food and Agribusiness Marketing at Curtin University, Peter Batt, who conducted the research with Associate Professor Fay Rola-Rubzen, says Australia still treats wheat as a commodity to be sold en masse. Instead, he argues, there needs to be an urgent shift in focus to maximising value through product differentiation for the range of end-uses in South-East Asia. Tellingly, Professor Batt says that many of those in the industry bemoaned the lack of Australian technical support and people to talk to in the absence of a single selling desk. Import statistics show that it is a matter of value. In an increasingly competitive South East Asian market, Australia is a dominant wheat supplier. But Professor Batt says that that volume does not automatically equate to higher prices per tonne. The most recent import statistics per country reveal the position of Australian wheat. Australia was the biggest exporter of wheat to Indonesia and Singapore in 2010, Malaysia in 2008 and Vietnam in 2009. Thai statistics for 2010 show Australian wheat coming second to the US. Where available, statistics on wheat flour by country show Australia as 12th on the list of exporters to Singapore and ninth on the Thai list. In Indonesia's wheat and wheat flour market in 2010 Australian wheat accounted for about 60 per cent of imports, but realised only 58 per cent of the value. This two per cent gap equated to about US$34 million in lost income to Australian growers. By comparison, Canada supplied 13.6 per cent of the wheat but took home 14.9 per cent of the payments. The US provided 11 per cent of the wheat and took home 11.63 per cent of the earnings. In the Thai market in 2010 Australian wheat was priced at US$272 per tonne, compared to US$297.50 per tonne for US wheat and US$282 per tonne for Canadian wheat. Between 2009 and 2010 Australian wheat decreased in price by about $13 per tonne, while US wheat increased by about $4.60 per tonne. Again, this highlights the need to remain steady on this valuable export industry, to get things right, to put in measures to maximise our potential and to help and protect growers, who have been through more than enough angst in recent times. National Farmers' Federation President Jock Laurie, on his recent return from Indonesia, said grain importers there raised concerns about the quality of our exports, saying the final delivered product is failing to match the standards of what had been promised in the original contracts. The Indonesian concerns follow the demise of the single desk. Mr Laurie was part of an Australian delegation including the federal trade and agriculture ministers that visited Indonesia in July for important talks on market issues and opportunities. According to Wheat Exports Australia, Indonesia has been Australia's biggest export market over the past seven years, buying an average of almost 2.5 million tonnes per year. Many growers will steer away from pools and rely on spot cash prices at harvest, which will further weaken the harvest price if this bill goes through. The WA was able to demonstrate how beneficial it could be to the industry by conducting research into an important aspect of grains marketing, and reporting to industry and government. That is how it should be. If Labor really cared about the Australian wheat industry, instead of shutting down the WA it would give the authority powers to benchmark the performance of accredited exporters and bulk and container shipments and to publish export information. Not only is Labor intending to shut down the accreditation process but the bill redirects possibly up to $2 million of paid, unused levy money to the minister to control in a vague, unspecified fund that will almost certainly be used to pay for other government functions in a cost-shifting exercise. You cannot trust Labor with place money. How many times have we seen this in recent years? If the WA is to be shut down, and that is far from settled, grain growers should be the ones deciding where unused levy funds are spent. This is another example of Labor's contempt for agriculture. Labor has cut $2 billion from the agriculture department in the past four years, and the scrapping of the WA is just another step in the process of getting rid of the agriculture department. I commend to members an article written by the New South Wales Farmers' Association grains committee chair, Mark Hoskinson, from Kikoira, in The Land, headed 'Bill breaches government promise,' and seek leave to table the opinion piece. (Time expired) Leave granted.",76
74,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," As the member for Riverina and other members on the other side of the House well know, wheat is one of the very last federally regulated commodities in Australia. The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 is continuing a process of deregulating the bulk wheat export market. That is bringing wheat into line with other agricultural commodities markets and it is doing so for the benefit of wheat farmers, so they can maximise their return, be globally competitive and continue to occupy their place in the national landscape. I had the privilege of working in the late 1990s with the late Senator Peter Cook, a Western Australian senator, who I know was passionate about two things. One was wheat; the other was free trade. Senator Cook played a key role in the period in which the wheat-for-weapons scandals were being uncovered. The subsequent Cole inquiry began the process that is now underway. This steady movement away from a single desk towards a more market oriented approach is a process that was supported by Liberals on the other side of the House as recently as 2008. But as a media release from the chairman of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, John Snooke, has noted: The reason the Liberal Party split from their coalition partners in 2008 and supported Labor's deregulation Bill was that the Nationals' policy wheat export marketing was proven to be an abject failure. It goes on to say: What is very clear is that Mr Abbott has the old Nationals' chestnut of confusing everyone into thinking that you can deregulate through regulating. It finishes up by saying: All Mr Abbott's joint statement will do is show that the Liberal Party is no longer prepared to stand against the protectionist policies of the Nationals. I do think it is a pity when those opposite who understand the importance of free markets and deregulation end up falling back into the old DLP tendencies that are so strong in the National Party and that have now come to prevail in the Liberal Party, whether it be scaring the Australian people over foreign investment, whether it be conducting outrageous scare campaigns on market based environmental solutions such as water buybacks in the Murray-Darling or a price on carbon or whether it be siding with the Nationals on protectionism over free markets.",80
75,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Fraser will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA United States Presidential Election,81
76,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The US presidential election is tightening. Monday's Pew Research Centre poll found 49 per cent of likely voters favoured Republican candidate Mitt Romney and 45 per cent favoured President Barack Obama. Gallop and Rasmussen polls had the on candidates level pegging. This is a massive 12-point turnaround from where the polls were a month ago and can be traced back to Mitt Romney's barnstorming performance in fallen for the first presidential debate. What this means is that the presidential race is now game on-anyone can winwhich makes the Australian Labor Party's personal and vitriolic attacks on the Republican Party and its candidates all the more damaging and alarming. Let us not forget that Wayne Swan, Treasurer of Australia, called the Republicans 'cranks and crazies'. Foreign Minister Bob Carr in his blog just before entering parliament described Mitt Romney as 'bloodless', former House Speaker and Republican candidate Newt Gingrich as 'the mad professor' and former Republican Senator Rick Santorum as someone who 'lusts for war'. In Carr's words, these 'unworthy opportunists' 'petrified' him. Can you believe it-Australia's foreign minister, our number one diplomat, saying that the man who could very well become the next President of the United States petrifies him. Let us not forget that, when John Howard made comments about candidate Obama back in 2007, Senator Penny Wong, now finance minister, rushed out a press release saying that risked the strength of the US alliance. Let us hear her say that now-no more double standards from the Labor Party. Forget Bruce Springsteen; we want real politicians who care about the real national interest. Attacking Republicans to shore up your political base is dangerous and against the national interest. (Time expired) International Day of the Girl Child",81
77,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today, 11 October, we celebrate for the first time the International Day of the Girl Child. This day represents an important step forward in promoting the rights of girls, highlighting gender inequality and addressing the various forms of discrimination and abuse suffered by girls around the world. The terrible news this week of the shooting by the Taliban of 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai in Pakistan for advocating education for girls shows why such a day is necessary. The recognition by the United Nations General Assembly of the International Day of the Girl Child is a significant achievement by Plan International, among others, which has been a strong and passionate advocate for this cause. Yesterday the International Day of the Girl Child was celebrated at an event in Parliament House hosted by Plan, the Australian Council for International Development and the United Nations Information Centre and attended by the Prime Minister and many parliamentary colleagues and members of the diplomatic community. Millions of girls are getting left behind. Statistics show that girls are less likely to complete school and gain meaningful employment, and are more likely to experience rape or other forms of sexual violence, as well as being subjected to forced and early marriage. We know that reducing gender inequality and empowering girls and women is the fastest way to lift countries out of poverty. The Australian government through our aid program will continue to work with girls, communities and governments around the world to improve the lives of the most vulnerable. Today, we celebrate the inaugural International Day of the Girl Child. Townsville Hospital Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:48): On Saturday night I had the pleasure to act as auctioneer for the Townsville Hospital Foundation. Justice Stuart Durward is a judge of the District Court of Queensland and the chair of the Townsville Hospital Foundation, and he lifted all restraining orders against me for the evening. Dr Robert Tam is a heart specialist in Townsville, and he spoke beautifully about the need for resources for the Townsville Hospital. He also did a portrait of Alan Border. Terry and Annette Walters have been doing this work for a fair while. Johnny Mac has had his own bout with cancer, and his work has been relentless-he has no voice left. He spoke about his battle with cancer and he said he was okay because he had spent some time with a two-year-old who was dying of leukaemia, and she had a smile on her face, so he said what he had was absolutely nothing. IGA franchisees from all over Australia were there. There was the cast from the local production of Hairspray, including my friend Vicky Saylor, who helped us with the music. We raised $141,000 on the night, with over 700 people packing a marquee at Jupiters in Townsville. Steve Price, a local radio dignitary, was the MC. The prizes were donated by local donors, including Universal Mitre 10 hardware, the mighty North Queensland Cowboys, who had every player donate their Women in League jersey, Jewellery by Design and many more. As an auctioneer, you are only ever as good as the people in front of you, and there is no better crowd than the people of Townsville. I thank them all for the work they did. Boronia Multicultural Services",82
78,Ms ROWLAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to mention the fantastic work of Boronia Multicultural Services, which is located in Toongabbie in my electorate. Boronia Multicultural Services is a nonprofit advocacy and support service for refugees and migrants of non-English-speaking background living in the Holroyd and Parramatta local government areas, supported by grants from the federal government. Last week I had the privilege of attending their 2011-12 annual general meeting in Toongabbie. This is their 23rd year of providing support to families of refugee and migrant backgrounds in my electorate and also the electorate of the member for Parramatta. Boronia's mission statement outlines that their objective is: … to assist with the advancement and promotion of a culturally and linguistically diverse community through facilitating equal access, opportunity and participation for all, based on the principles of social justice, access and equity. Its activities include mother support groups, sewing, computer classes and swimming classes, as well as specific projects such as empowering refugee Tamil women by providing them with human rights education, leadership and advocacy training and mental well-being programs for Farsi and Dari speakers. All the staff and volunteers of BMS work tirelessly to achieve their mission and I would like to especially mention the excellent efforts of Ms Venkatraman, Ms Thamaraiselvi Senthooran, Mr Michael Odur, Ms Mahin Rashtakhiz, Ms Sonu Aggarwal, Ms Jaspreet Walia and Ms Bec Reidy. Organisations such as Boronia Multicultural Services help make the community I represent a great place to live. I thank them sincerely for their efforts and I look forward to working with them in the future and advocating on their behalf into the future. Eastwood Park Korean Festival",83
79,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Saturday, Eastwood Park hosted the Korean Festival-a vibrant festival of food, food, more food and music and dance. An estimated 10,000 people attended. Dignitaries included Consul General Jin Soo Kim, who celebrated our two nations' close relationship over the past 60 years, together with Premier O'Farrell and state ministers Victor Dominello and Greg Smith. A special thank you goes to Hyun-Suk Son, better known as Hughie, President of the Macquarie University Korean Students' Association, for his wonderful support and translation work on the day. The Korean community makes Bennelong a great example of multiculturalism at its absolute best. Tuggeranong Community Council",83
80,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to pay special tribute to my friend Mr Darryl Johnston, who has recently retired as the president of the Tuggeranong Community Council and to welcome the incoming president, Nick Tsoulias. The Tuggeranong Community Council is a voluntary, not-for-profit, non-political, community based association operating in the Tuggeranong Valley in my electorate of Canberra. The TCC, as it is known, does an Rugmini outstanding job in representing the local residents and the communities of this beautiful valley. The TCC is a vital organisation and its role is critical in building a bigger, better, healthier and happier community. I have attended many TCC meetings and I am always impressed by the range of issues and the dedication the council brings to making the valley one of the best places to live in Australia. Darryl Johnston has been an outstanding president and I value his efforts and his friendship. The health and harmony of communities and suburbs are underpinned by the work of people like Darryl. His passion to improve the lives of those in Tuggeranong deserves recognition. I also want to congratulate Nick Tsoulias, who is the incoming president. He is a local businessman and is very prominent in promoting all things Calwell, particularly the festival. Finally, I would like to congratulate Lauren Jackson on reaching 6,000 career points in the US WNBA. She is a true Canberra legend. Stormwater Harvesting",83
81,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Thursday, the 4th of October, I had the pleasure of attending the announcement of the stormwater harvesting and reuse project, a $10.6 million joint initiative between the federal government and the Brisbane City Council, at Downey Park, Windsor-the home of Queensland netball and basketball. The member for Griffith was in attendance and it was an absolutely wonderful display of bipartisan cooperation. I want to thank my LNP colleagues, Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and Councillor Vicki Howard, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, Senator the Hon. Don Farrell, for their cooperation. This project will save the equivalent of 74 Olympic sized swimming pools of water each year and is an innovative way to keep Brisbane a clean and green city. In total, the project will save more than 185 megalitres of water per year and will deliver a net economic benefit to the city in the order of $13.1 million over the next 25 years. The Downey Park precinct component of the project in the electorate of Brisbane will deliver water savings of 66.5 megalitres per year. I want to thank the member for Griffith for not seeking to hijack the launch-as he did at the opening of the Brisbane Common Ground project on 29 August this year-with any further sideshow antics and media pitching for lost job opportunities. This project will be rolled out to seven sites across Brisbane following community consultation regarding the final designs, with all systems to be fully operational by 2016. (Time expired) National Gallery of Victoria",84
82,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week my wife Amanda and I had the privilege of attending the opening of the new gallery of Japanese art at the National Gallery of Victoria. The refurbished gallery is dedicated to exhibiting the unique aspects of Japanese art. NGV director Tony Ellwood said: Much of this collection will be on display for the first time as part of the opening exhibit, along with highlights from the exquisite Pauline Gandel Collection of Japanese lacquer. In fact, the new gallery was made possible by philanthropic donations-the great philanthropy of Pauline Gandel in particular. Eighteen months in the making, the new gallery has been designed in historically chronological and themed sections to display the mastery of Japanese craftsmanship and creativity. The curator of Asian art at the NGV, Wayne Crothers, said the gallery will usher in a new age of appreciation for the past, present and future of Japanese culture in Melbourne. He said: The gallery is designed to create a unique experience for the visitor by using natural materials, warm colours and a minimal aesthetic. Several traditional Japanese interior features, including a tatami matted area for viewing scrolls and a recessed ceiling with shoji lattice screens will evoke the atmosphere of a traditional Japanese space. Some of the highlights in the opening display include an historical Buddhist sculpture, a large mandala, Noh theatre robes and masks, fine porcelain, a noble samurai helmet and golden folding screens. Attending the exhibition was not only an opportunity to thank Mrs Gandel for her philanthropy but also an opportunity to bid farewell to Shigekazu Sato, the Japanese Ambassador to Australia, after completing two years- (Time expired) Small Business",84
83,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is becoming increasingly clear that this government is not only not on side with small business, it actually sees small business as the soft touch it needs to create the fiction-and-fudge surplus the Treasurer is so fond of talking about. Many people in this chamber and many listening would not be aware that, in the last financial year, the number of small business insolvencies instigated by the Australian Taxation Office went up by 116 per cent. On top of that, the Taxation Commissioner has signalled that he will go even harder this financial year. This sits alongside a recent report from the Inspector-General of Taxation highlighted the heavy powers available to the tax office to cajole, threaten and intimidate small businesses into accepting default assessments-even where they might be wrong. We have seen go-away money in the workplace relations system; there is now goaway money happening in the tax system. As the inspector-general highlighted, most small businesses have neither the resources, the funding nor the time to take on the tax office over an amended assessment. It is a scandal that this government, after being of no assistance whatsoever to small business since their election, now sees small business people as a soft target in trying to come up with some papered over arrangement for its budget black hole and the $120 billion it is yet to find for the election commitments and promises it has made. It is well past time for the small business community to have a government in Canberra that is on their side and supporting their success, instead of one targeting them as a soft touch. (Time expired) Seen, Dr Andrew",85
84,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate Launceston University of Tasmania lecturer Andrew Seen for being awarded a citation for outstanding contributions to student learning at the Australian Awards for University Teaching in Melbourne last week. Dr Seen has spent only two years away from the Newnham campus since being a student there in 1982. He has used his unique style to help students follow their scientific interests for the past 15 years. More than 160 Australian lecturers received recognition and Dr Seen was one of only three from Tasmania. Dr Seen encourages people to take responsibility for their own learning and guides them through their work. His research interests are in the development and application of passive that sampling devices for sampling contaminants in the environment, as well as in understanding the sources, history and mobility of contaminants in the environment. Dr Seen's recent work includes establishing a historical profile of heavy metal pollution in the Tamar Valley through analysis of sediment cores from the Tamar Estuary, as well as studies on contaminant mobility at impacted sites in Antarctica. His research activities involve collaboration with industry and government organisations, including the Australian Antarctic Division, Nyrstar, Ecka Granules Australia and NRM North. Dr Seen is a true asset to our community and I congratulate him on his award. (Time expired) Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks",85

86,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! I am sorry to say to the member for Higgins that, in accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA 10th Anniversary of the Bali Bombings",86
87,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," On indulgence, on the matter that the member for Higgins was just addressing-Tomorrow is a very special and a very solemn day in the life of our nation: the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings. For Australians everywhere, it will be a time for sorrow and reflection, remembrance and resolve. From our official ceremonies in Bali and here in Canberra to beachside gatherings at Coogee and on the Gold Coast, religious services in Melbourne and Perth, a fundraiser for the Burns Unit at Royal Adelaide Hospital and more gatherings, large and small, we will honour those who were lost, embrace those who survived and comfort those who grieve. I hope every Australian finds time tomorrow to reflect on this tragedy, either at one of the public gatherings or alone in the silence of their hearts. Together we remember a great loss inflicted on our own, 88 Australians taken from us forever; 114 from other countries lost as well; and many more injured and hurt, with so many of their scars, physical and mental, yet to fully heal, if they ever do. We would give everything to erase the events of that night from the pages of history but we cannot. We will carry the images of Bali on 12 October 2002 all the rest of our days. Its horror and its meaning are imprinted on all of our hearts forever. We will not forget the courage. We will not forget the loss. Tomorrow and always, we will remember.",86
88,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I join the Prime Minister in marking tomorrow's anniversary, because, for Australians, 12 October 2002 is a date that will always live in infamy. Eighty-eight Australians died; 202 people were killed in total. The places targeted were picked precisely because they were places frequented by Australians, so this was an attack on Australia. But it was more than that; it was an attack on civilisation. To our credit as a people, we did not lash out in fury at another country or at a particular religion. We worked with Indonesia to bring the perpetrators to justice. We will always be grateful to Indonesia and its people for doing so. Our country was at its best in the aftermath of the Bali bombings. Of those caught up in the bombings, many were traumatised and all were changed, but not all for the worse. Some have subsequently been involved in magnificent humanitarian work, such as Peter Hughes and David and Clair Marsh. I look forward to more help in the future for all the victims of terrorism. I also look forward to standing with the Prime Minister in Bali tomorrow to demonstrate our solidarity as Australians and to say to our country's enemies: you can hurt us but you can't break us. Reference to Federation Chamber",86
89,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:03): by leave-I move: That further statements on indulgence in relation to the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings be permitted in the Federation Chamber. I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their comments. I will be thinking tomorrow of the Borgia, Webster and Zervos families in my electorate. I lost four constituents, four good Australians, that day. Question agreed to. NA Employment",87
90,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to today's labour market data, which shows that, since her carbon and mining taxes were introduced, the unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in 2½ years, with over 22,000 more Australians now unemployed. Is the Prime Minister now prepared to accept that the carbon and mining taxes are increasing costs, discouraging investment and hurting the job security of Australian workers?",87
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Leader of the Opposition clearly misunderstands today's employment figures. I believe it is very important that Australians have the facts about these employment figures, rather than hearing the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentations. Over 32,000 full-time jobs were created in September.",87
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,87
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me repeat that for opposition members who were screaming instead of listening: over 32,000 full-time jobs were created in September. There are 32,000 Australians who are now in full-time work. For those Australians, that is a lifechanging moment, and it ought to be received as such by the opposition. Rather than interjecting or talking loudly amongst themselves, they should be celebrating the fact that 32,000 Australians got full-time work. The headline figure for the unemployment data released today has been affected by increasing participation. What that means is that more people have gone to look for work; more people want to get jobs. That is the meaning of the participation rate. When we look at today's figures very specifically-and I think we owe it to Australians to do thiswe can see that nearly two-thirds of the increase in unemployed persons can be accounted for by the result in Queensland. I think anybody who knows what is happening in Queensland would know why that is occurring. The explanation is a two-word explanation: Campbell Newman. Campbell Newman and his approach to sacking Queenslanders and putting them into unemployment is showing, and showing in these figures. The kinds of things that Liberals do once they are in governmentcutting jobs, cutting work, throwing Australians onto the unemployment queueis showing in the state of Queensland. What we already know from the Leader of the Opposition is: he endorses this approach and, as Prime Minister, would be out there drafting redundancy notices for over 12,000 public servants.",87
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question before the chair.,88
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, on the unemployment data, what this should cause people to reflect on is the damage Liberals do in government to the jobs of working Australians. Look at the Queensland figures. There is the proof. 10th Anniversary of the Bali Bombings",88
96,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How is Australia commemorating the anniversary of the first Bali bombings?,88
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for her question. We as a House have just had the opportunity to reflect on what these bombings meant to our nation, what they meant to each of us and the way in which Australians will go about their memorials and reflections tomorrow. To provide further details of the kinds of events that will tomorrow: they will enable Australians to have the opportunity and the moment to reflect, if they choose to involve themselves in a public event or even watch it on TV. Many people, of course, will do their reflection in their most private moments, but the government will hold memorial services in Bali and in Canberra. These services will provide an opportunity for people to gather to remember those killed and injured in the Bali tragedy. I will represent the government at the service in Bali, along with the Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister John Howard, while the Governor General will lead the Canberra service. Further details about these memorial services can be found at the DFAT website for anyone who wants to see the very specific details. The government has announced a comprehensive assistance package for families of those killed and seriously injured in the attacks planning to attend either memorial service. For many of the families, this will be a time where they do want to return to Bali and be there at the place where they lost their loved one and where their family was cost so much. For others, that clearly will not be possible. Some will exercise the option of attending the service in Canberra. For some, of course, that will not be their way of grieving. They will not want to take themselves to a public event; they will want to do something far more intimate and private with their own family members. 10th But, for those Australians who lost so much who do want to attend these services, a package has been made available. That is providing a similar level of support to victims and family members as that provided by the Howard government for the first anniversary in 2003. The package includes assistance with airfares, accommodation and ground transport. Even at this late stage, if people want to ring the Bali Memorial happen Hotline on 136125, more details can be provided. Our thoughts will be with these family members tomorrow as our nation grieves and remembers this event that radically changed our country. Carbon Pricing",88
98,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her words only yesterday: 'Since we announced the carbon pricing scheme, 73,500 jobs have been created.' Is the Prime Minister aware that this represents the slowest jobs growth in an 18month period since the depths of the 1990s recession? With unemployment rising further today, why does the Prime Minister think that the slowest jobs growth since the Keating recession is something to boast about?",88
99,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the shadow Treasurer, I refer him to today's employment figures and the creation of 32,000 jobs. I refer him to the Leader of the Opposition's reckless fear campaign, which the shadow Treasurer is now trying to reinterpret because the shadow Treasurer must know the kind of nonsense that was spouted by the Leader of the Opposition. What the opposition went round saying for months and months and months was that the economy would basically halt the day carbon pricing came into effect, and that it would be a wrecking ball through our economy. Terminology like 'a permanent depression' was used. Whyalla was going to be wiped off the map. Let us be very, very clear here: what the Leader of the Opposition effectively predicted was the loss of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs. That was the nature of fear campaign. The coal industry-not to exist anymore. The town of Whyalla-gone. All manufacturing-gone. A wrecking ball through the economy; a permanent depression. These were the predictions. What has in fact happened-and the shadow Treasurer really knows this, but feels the need to fall in line with this reckless campaign-is that we have continued to see jobs growth. We have continued to see jobs growth at a time of volatility continuing in the global economy. I would refer the shadow Treasurer to the work of the IMF. He might hang his head about that-needing to look at the work of the IMF-but it records, of course, the circumstances of the global economy and some of the things that are impacting on global growth rates. It also records the circumstances of the Australian economy, where we continue to see growth at trend, where we continue to see jobs created, and where we continue to see low unemployment rates. When you look around the world, who would you change with? America? Nohigher than us. The UK? No-higher than us. Parts of Europe with unemployment rates at 20 per cent or 25 per cent? Here, in the Australian economy: low unemployment; low inflation; a triple-A credit rating from all three major credit ratings agenciessomething never achieved by the Howard government in office. The opposition should stop talking the Australian economy down. Australians are proud of the economy we have created. We have done it together-employers, employees, unions and the government, working in partnership in the worse economic downturn since the great recession of the late 1920s, and we have come through, building jobs, and we will continue to build for the future through our clean energy his package and build jobs at the same time. Carbon Pricing",89
100,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister update the House on the carbon price and its impact on household electricity prices? Why is it important that Australians hear the truth regarding the impact of the carbon price on their electricity bills?,89
101,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:15): I thank the member for Reid for his question. The government has been entirely up-front about the impact of the carbon price on household electricity bills, because the Treasury modelling found the carbon price would increase household electricity prices by an average of 10 per cent, which equates to an average of $3.30 per week across Australian households. To meet that impact, the government is deploying the majority of the revenue from the carbon price to implement tax cuts and increase pensions, family tax benefits and other Commonwealth payments, to an average of $10.10 per week in households across the country-$10.10 versus $3.30 a week in electricity bills. Electricity regulator price determinations and the market itself have confirmed the Treasury modelling. In fact, in some jurisdictions the impact is less than the Treasury modelling. In South Australia, for example, the average household impact is just $1.50 per household per week. It is important to establish those facts, because the Leader of the Opposition consistently engages in a cowardly campaign of frightening people in the community and, in particular, of trying to terrify pensioners about the impact of carbon pricing. Mr Christensen interjecting",89
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dawson is warned!,90
103,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just yesterday, the opposition leader, in question time, made a false statement, a false claim, about the electricity bill of an elderly Western Australian. The opposition leader told the House: With an $800 increase in just one bill, of 70 per cent is due to the carbon tax … That is completely fallacious, totally wrong, totally deceitful. Even the most cursory examination of that bill that the opposition leader reluctantly tabled demonstrates that he did not read it. The most cursory examination of the bill demonstrates two things: a clear statement by the energy retailer that the carbon price impact is just 9.13 per cent-if you had bothered to read it, you might have noticed before you brought it into the House for your very first question. Your very first question, and you get it wrong. You do not read it.",90
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, the use of the word 'you' is inappropriate.",90
105,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I apologise. The second thing evident from the most cursory examination of this bill is that the electricity consumption almost doubled compared to the previous billing period. The statements that are made by the Leader of the Opposition are totally false, totally deceitful, totally gutless. People are starting to see through the deceit that is being engaged in here and they are going to judge you very harshly. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",90
106,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the cost of electricity, which has risen 64 per cent since Labor came to power, the cost of water and sewerage, which has risen 59 per cent, and the cost of insurance, education and medical services, which have all gone up by more than 30 per cent. Why is the Prime Minister making the lives of all Australians harder by slugging consumers with a carbon tax that is designed to push up electricity prices?",90
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," From the Leader of the National which Party what we see is a continuation of the campaign of deceit that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was just exposing to this parliament-a campaign of falsehoods and misrepresentations, a campaign designed to put fear into Australians, a campaign that every step of the way neglects the facts, including bringing into the parliament yesterday an electricity bill no-one in the opposition had bothered to read, which on its face clearly supported what the government has been saying about the increase in electricity pricing caused by carbon. ",90
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the member for Sturt does not want people to have the facts, but these are the facts. What the Leader of the National Party has just done in pursuit of misleading Australians is he has tried to combine electricity price rises from different sources and pretend that they are all about carbon. That is wholly untrue. That is a misrepresentation. That is an attempt to mislead. What the Leader of the National Party actually knows is that the impact on electricity prices is 10 per cent-$3.30 a week on average, when, on average, households have received assistance of $10.10 a week. Yes, there have been shocking increases in electricity that come from other sources and are the responsibility, in part, of policy settings of state governments-something about which the Leader of the National Party, to my knowledge, has never said anything, because instead he prefers to engage in this campaign of misleading. Australians do face cost-of-living pressures. There is no doubt about that. So the government has worked with Australians on those cost-of-living pressures, and we will continue to do so. That has included providing tax cuts, including making sure that people can earn $18,200 a year without paying a cent of tax. It has included family payment increases, including the package of sharing the benefits from the boom, opposed by those opposite. It has included the schoolkids bonus, which, to a person, everybody opposite marched in and voted against. It has included putting more money into child care, which of course is there to support families with their cost-of-living pressures. There is one opposition member who is prepared to tell the truth about these thingsthat is, Mal Washer, who has said: We beat the drum too hard on the carbon taxeveryone has stopped listening to the sound of The marrow has gone out of it-we need to move on to other issues. I suggest to the Leader of the National Party that he talk to Mal Washer about telling the truth. (Time expired) Electricity Pricing",91
109,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Before the clock starts: today is CanTeen day. Like the member for Herbert and many others, I am sure we all support kids with cancer. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, regulators, electricity market participants, economists and market experts all have been indicating failures for some time in electricity price regulation. In the light of this, will your government support moves to unify national electricity laws through an act of this parliament and to address the failed appeals process that has led already to a pointless $1.9 billion in just three years transferred from households and businesses in New South Wales directly to the New South Wales government?",91
110,Mr Randall,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Dorothy!",91
111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question and note that his question is trying to get to some of the real causes of price rises in electricity. I am not surprised that it was objected to by the opposition, because they do not want people to have the facts about this matter. The member is pointing to issues which are impacting on electricity prices and have been the drivers of the big increases families have seen-40 per cent, 50 per cent, 60 per cent-and he has particularly pointed to the drivers of costs in New South Wales. He is right to point to a set of market failures here-a market failure which means that there is a perverse incentive to continue to see more and more and more investment in the poles and wires of the system, the soit. called gold plating. This is a market design problem. He is also right to point to the fact that there are issues associated with state governments, including the New South Wales State government-indeed, one could probably say particularly the New South Wales State government-seeking to get major dividend streams from electricity, given that they are the owners of the assets, and that those dividend streams end up being paid for by households and businesses across New South Wales. These are very concerning issues. From the other side of politics we have seen these issues denied. The Leader of the Opposition used to deny that network prices had been rising, ignoring households in his own electorate and across New South Wales who are now paying over $1,300 a year in network costs, when in 2007-08 they only paid $500 a year. It is the government's intention to work on these issues through COAG processes, including the processes engaged in by energy ministers, to deal with these market design issues and consequently to have an impact on price determinations in the future. The government is committed to that program of work. I understand that the member is going to bring before the parliament a private member's bill on this issue. We have not as yet seen the contents of that bill, and of course we are respecters of the role of private members' business, but the government's commitments relate to its work program. We will be keen to discuss this with members of goodwill across the parliament-that is, people who are prepared to deal with the public policy issues, to understand the facts, to put aside the reckless and silly fear campaigning and to act on behalf of their constituents in a responsible way. NA The SPEAKER (14:26): I have been advised that the former Premier of South Australia the Hon. John Bannon is in the gallery today. We welcome him to question time. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Economy",91
112,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the current outlook for the Australian economy? What does this say about the importance of investing for the future?,92
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question, because tomorrow I will attend the IMF and World Bank meetings in Tokyo. This is a difficult time in the global economy. We saw earlier this week the IMF revise down its global forecast. We see recession in Europe. We see a moderating of growth in the US. Of course, this is impacting on growth, in particular, in our region. The meetings this weekend will be important in assessing all of these trends and shaping the response of global bodies, including the IMF, to these challenging times. It is the case that our economy is not immune from the fallout of what is happening elsewhere in the global economy. Locally, given these global headwinds, we also have a higher dollar and we have a cautious consumer, and that is weighing on some sectors of our economy. But, if you take all of these things into account and you look at the fundamentals of the Australian economy, you see an economy which is still the envy of the developed world. The IMF is still forecasting, for Australia, growth which is greater than that of every single major developed economy over this year and next. We had the revision from the IMF only a couple of days ago, which shows that our economy is the 12th largest in the world, up three places since we came to office. I think all of this reflects the fact that we have strong fundamentals, and it reflects all of the hard work that has been done by Australian business and of course by workers in this country. It also reflects the response that this government put in place to the global financial crisis and the global recession-the fact that we, almost alone, avoided recession and the fact that we have been able to support employment in our community, with over 800,000 jobs created in this country since this government came to office, despite all of the circumstances of the global financial crisis and the global recession. That is something that I think everyone on this side of the House is immensely proud of because, when it comes to employment, that is the key to economic strength. That is why it was pleasing today to see that the expected jobs growth for September was 14,500, driven by strong growth in full time employment: 32,100 additional jobs when it comes to full-time employment. Of course, the participation rate did go up and that meant that more people came into the labour market. It also meant that the unemployment rate did go up. But what we have to keep in mind is that this is a very strong figure for Australia and we should not be talking it down, as the shadow Treasurer the Leader of the Opposition do every day of the week. As a Queenslander, I believe the Queensland economy also has a bright future, but it was very disappointing to see the results in Queensland, with the largest fall in monthly employment on record: 20,900 jobs.

118,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to this electricity bill from The Bays Hospital in Mornington. A statement from its CEO says that The Bays Hospital is a small not-forprofit community hospital and that the carbon adjustment costs will be $44,000, without compensation and with no ability to pass on the costs to patients. How does the Prime Minister expect the Bays Hospital to find the extra money? Or does the Prime Minister expect that it will cut services?",93
119,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Speaker, I would ask the member for Dunkley to table the bill that he referred to as 'this bill'.",93

122,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member who asked the question: it is obviously impossible for me to address the specific circumstances of this hospital when the member will not table the account that he says he is relying on and when our experience, day after day, in this parliament is that electricity bills are misrepresented by the opposition, misrepresented in the most gross ways, misrepresented in order to further their fear campaign and misrepresented in order to deny the facts. Just to emphasise that point, we saw absurd claims made about the individual electricity bill of a pensioner in Western Australia, when anybody who had bothered to read it saw that the increase was 9.13 per cent. On health costs",93
123,Mr Billson,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I invite you to have the Prime Minister answer the question. The claims are from the CEO of the hospital. I am not sure that it is fair to suggest that the CEO's claim is absurd at all.",94
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,94
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Madam Speaker. Let me make it very clear that I am not addressing my remarks to the CEO of the hospital; I am addressing them to the member who asked the question and his refusal to table the document in order to inform this answer. And one wonders why he is refusing. On the question of health costs, the Commonwealth Treasury and the Department of Health and Ageing estimate that the impact of the carbon price will be 0.3 per cent of hospital costs.",94
126,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me repeat that again and, as the opposition interject, I am talking about figures of the Treasury and the department of health, which are the same agencies which advised the Howard government. So members of the opposition ought to treat them with some respect rather than engage in interjecting. The impact of the carbon price will be 0.3 per cent. That is the equivalent of only 3c in every $10 that a hospital spends. When you look at what this government has determined to do with respect to funding of hospitals, you will see that it has increased funding to hospitals in a way which means that we are covering the extra costs many times over. To take just one figure: indexation of the hospital agreement will see federal hospital funding increase by 6.5 per cent in 2012-13, going up each year to more than 10 per cent indexation in 2015-16. So let us just make that clear again to the opposition, which does not want to absorb the facts: indexation of hospitals is going up to 10 per cent. This is a stark contrast to the days when the Leader of the Opposition was ripping $1 billion out of Australia's hospital system, $1 billion as uncovered",94

What is more, since the carbon-pricing mechanism was introduced, I can report to the member for Moreton, there have been 200 jobs created every day, which casts the lie that somehow the proposals of the government are causing unemployment. However, I do have to report to the member for Moreton some disturbing trends in the monthly labour force figures, and they do in fact refer in particular to his home state of Queensland. The member for Moreton may not be aware yet that since 31 March-about the same time as Campbell Newman became Premier of Queensland-there have been 26,000 jobs lost in Queensland.",95
139,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
140,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will put it another way: 130 jobs are leaving Queensland under LNP rule every day since they were elected. This is a government that is committed to protecting people's entitlements. That is why today we are doing what the Queensland government and those opposite should be supporting. We are making sure that if the jobs of public sector workers throughout Australia-hard working workers in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania-are privatised or outsourced, and if then the business is sold to another entity, their terms and conditions are relayed and moved with them, so they retain the same conditions. We are making sure that, when a private sector worker in Australia has their business sold to another entity, they get all the same terms and conditions. We are making sure that, in spite the second-class status which unfortunately is being visited on them by those opposite and by Campbell Newman and Barry O'Farrell, all Australian workers are treated the same. That is what you get with Labor. We look after the workers; the other side do not. Mr Christensen interjecting",95

Why is it important we have a consistent and transparent approach to this?",95
142,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:39): I thank the member for Moreton for his supplementary question. He is quite right: we do need consistency in workplace relations policy. We heard in my initial answer that 130 jobs a day are going when the conservatives take over Queensland. Also, I did not get the chance to tell the member for Moreton that, since Barry O'Farrell has been elected Premer of New South Wales, only 19 jobs a day get created in New South Wales. How lucky is New South Wales to have someone in charge who can only create 19 jobs a day! That is hopeless. Of course, in Victoria we have Ted Baillieu, who thinks that TAFE is a fourletter word and should be cut, and we notice that the Leader of the Opposition has come out of the witness protection program to help Team Zed in the ACT. My goodness! That is just what public sector workers in the ACT want-to know that if they vote conservative in the ACT they get the coalition's industrial relations anti-worker policies! I am asked about consistency. I will tell you what, member for Moreton-when you go with the government, we mean it when we say that we will increase super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. We abolished the tax on superannuation for those on less than $37,000. What do we get from those opposite? They vote against increasing super for the worker and they vote against improving workers' entitlements, and they will reintroduce a tax on superannuation for the low-paid. I will tell you what they will also do.

143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And the member for Sturt is messing up his ability to get a question. Workplace Relations Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:41): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her answer yesterday: Anybody who has an allegation of dishonest conduct should take it to the appropriate authority to be dealt with. I also remind her of the answer she gave at press conference on 23 August in relation to the dishonest conduct of Bruce Wilson of the AWU: Once I became aware that I had been deceived … I ended my relationship with Mr Wilson. Did she also inform the appropriate authority of Mr Wilson's misappropriation of union funds?,96
144,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would well recall that I gave a press conference about these matters and answered all questions until the federal parliamentary press gallery was exhausted from these questions. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, in relation to these matters, there were police investigations that did ensue. If she checked the record, she would know that. I also remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that people judge her on her conduct in this place. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:43): Madam Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Given the Prime Minister's answers in this place, as a practising lawyer at the time in the state of Victoria subject to professional conduct and practice rules, why didn't she inform the appropriate authority of Mr Wilson's fraud when she became aware of it?",96

146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Solomon is warned. Carbon Pricing,97
147,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Will the Assistant Treasurer please update the House on the latest report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on false and misleading claims made about the carbon price and on what actions the ACCC and business have taken to address these claims?,97
148,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:44): I thank the member for Page for her question. The ACCC has today released its report on the first 100 since the carbon price came into effect, on 1 July. The report shows that during the first 100 days, around 2½ thousand complaints were received by the ACCC. To put this into some context, this amounts to just 6.5 per cent of the total number of consumer protection complaints received by the ACCC. The complaints in relation to carbon pricing have now slowed to around four complaints a day. This shows that the overwhelming majority of businesses out there are doing the right thing; they are acting responsibly and they are not making misleading claims in relation to the carbon price. Of course, that is in spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there for two years encouraging them to jack up their prices and falsely blame those price increases on the carbon price. Those business that have not been doing the right thing-and I must stress it is a small proportion of businesses-have been the subject of very strong and robust enforcement action by the ACCC. I think that has been important in sending a very strong message to all businesses of the importance of not misleading their consumers. Since day one of the carbon price having been announced, the Leader of the Opposition, in contrast to the majority of Australian businesses, has been making one misleading and reckless claim after another. We saw him come into this chamber yesterday brandishing an electricity bill of a pensioner-hiding behind the bill of a pensioner-claiming that a doubling of the electricity costs of that pensioner were as a result of the carbon price. He seemed to deliberately conceal the fact that, from one quarter to the next, that pensioner, that household, had doubled their electricity usage. It seems as though he is now making another misleading claim to the Australian days people-that, under their policies and their plans if they ever get elected, you can double your electricity usage and somehow, from quarter to quarter, your bills are going to be cheaper. What nonsense. This is the sort of nonsense that we have heard. We have heard so many misleading claims from the Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at what he has said. First he said it was going to be a cash cow. He said it was a dog of a tax. He said it was going to be a cobra strike and it would be a python squeeze. He even said it was going to be an octopus. There is a bit of a theme developing here. He has taken his reckless scare campaign not just to every fish shop and every fish market in the country; he even went to the RSPCA. We all thought that he was beginning to be the Dr No of Australian politics. It turns out he is actually Dr Dolittle. And when it comes to repealing the carbon price- (Time expired) Member for Fisher Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:47): My question is to the Attorney-General.

The legal advice is subject to legal professional privilege. That material was with the Government Solicitor. I had been briefed on that material, and I really cannot provide further information while that matter is still before the court. Ms Julie Bishop: Madam Speaker, I rise on a Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

When did she become aware-or her office?",98
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. Housing Affordability,99
164,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business. Will the minister update the House on the government's commitment to tenancy advice and advocacy services to support affordable housing across Australia, particularly in my home state of Queensland? Is the minister aware of any decisions that have reduced or removed these services? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:50): I thank the member for Blair for his question and his ongoing advocacy for tenancy services Queensland. I can say to him, and I think fitting given that yesterday was World Homeless Day, that there is a strong commitment by this government to make sure we do everything we can to prevent Australians finding themselves at risk of being homeless. Therefore, tenancy advice and advocacy services are vital. They are vital in every state and certainly in Queensland. It is true to say that some decisions have been made by the Queensland government that would have potentially impacted adversely upon 80,000 Queenslanders who require advice of the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service. Indeed, we know we need to ensure we prevent homelessness by having the services in place to prevent people being evicted from homes, to prevent mums and dads and kids finding themselves out on the street. That is why the decision by the Queensland government to cut absolutely all funding to the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service was cruel and heartless. It was a cruel and heartless decision because it will impact so badly upon so many vulnerable Queenslanders and it was an economically absurd decision because it will cost more to look after those people who will be hurt as a result of that decision. Of course, there will be more frontline staff cut in Queensland as a result. That really does fit with the Campbell Newman approach of 'all pain, no plan' when it comes to government services in that state. What is more galling is that the money that has been taken from these services is the interest accumulated from the bonds paid by tenants into the Residential Tenancies Authority. So it is not even taxpayers' money; it is tenants' money that has been taken by Campbell Newman. This was a terrible decision. As a result, this in government has stepped up with $3.3 million it is of emergency funding to ensure the 23 offices across Queensland will remain open to look after up to 80,000 Queensland families each year. We are doing that to ensure that those services are there for those who need them. I have also made clear that from 1 July next year any future Commonwealth-state arrangement with Queensland in relation to housing and homelessness will have to ensure that those services are maintained. Why did Premier Newman make such a decision? He has been emboldened by the shadow Treasurer and by the Leader of the Opposition, who said these cuts are good cuts. 'They are courageous cuts,' the shadow Treasurer said. They are disgraceful cuts, and we totally oppose them. (Time expired)",99
165,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Typical Labor.,99
166,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Typical Member for North Sydney. He is warned. Member for Fisher Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:54): My question is to the Attorney-General. Why did the Attorney-General allow the government's legal practice directions to be ignored in order for the government to offer Mr James Ashby a $50,000 settlement in his case against the Commonwealth?",99
167,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (14:54): I think it is absolutely clear that you have not read the legal services directions at all. All of our conduct in this case has been entirely consistent with the legal services directions. Not only that it has been entirely consistent with the legal advice that we were given. It does not matter how many times people ask these questions, material that has been released to any party in litigation which is subject to undertakings given to the court is not going to be breached unless people want to be found in contempt of court, and the Commonwealth has no intention of being found so. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:55): Madam Speaker, I ask a supplementary question of the Attorney-General. How can the Attorney refute the obvious conclusion that the government settled the case with Mr Ashby in order to suppress the public release of offensive SMS messages from the member for Fisher?",100
168,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (14:55): Clearly, if that was the intention, it did not work. The one reason you can be sure that it was not the intention is that it did not work. The Commonwealth, as people in this chamber seem to have forgotten, was a respondent in an action brought by Mr Ashby. Mr Slipper was also a respondent in an action brought by Mr Ashby. The Commonwealth settled that matter with Mr Ashby. Mr Slipper has not settled his matter with Mr Ashby; it is currently before the Federal Court, and I do not think it is appropriate for us to speculate about what might happen in that matter that is still ongoing. Workplace Relations Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:56): My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women. The social and community services pay equity legislation was passed by the House today. What does this mean for some of our lowest paid workers who have been waiting for fairness and justice in the workplace? Can the minister set out the facts about the impact of the government's pay equity reform on working people and the economy?",100
169,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (14:57): I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Today's passing by the House of this legislation does ensure that the Australian government's $2.8 billion share of the equal pay increases awarded by Fair Work Australia to social and community the services sector workers is able to be passed on to organisations that employ workers under the scope of this decision. The social and community services pay equity special account locks in the government's contribution to these pay rises over the eight years of this decision for directly funded programs and programs through Commonwealth-state agreements. This government is and has always been committed to delivering 100 per cent of our share of these historic increases. The Commonwealth is seeking to work collaboratively with all jurisdictions and has requested feedback from every state and territory to determine the appropriate amount of Commonwealth funding. This is an open and transparent process that we are undertaking, and it was disappointing to see in news reports today that the Victorian government is claiming that they need more Commonwealth funding for supplementation, especially since the Victorian government has not yet given us feedback on its costing assumptions on this negotiation. Let us be clear: we are not going to pay Victoria's or any other state's share of this increase. We will fund our share 100 per cent, and we have said that. The Victorian state government made a promise before the last state election that they would pay their fair share. They committed $200 million over four years for this. They said that if it was any more than this they would fund it. We want to work with every state and territory government in good faith for the benefit of the workers who are affected by this decision and, importantly, for the vulnerable people in our communities who rely on their services. We have undertaken a rigorous process to calculate our share of these increases and we have tested these calculations with a number of different processes with the sector. All of our commitment, the $2.8 billion, is fully funded and accounted for in the budget. These workers will benefit from pay rises from December this year of between 23 and 45 per cent in total. Around 120,000 of these 150,000 workers are women in very challenging jobs, dealing with some of the most vulnerable in our community. We want to continue to work with the sector, and of course with the states and territories, to ensure the smooth implementation of this historic decision. The passing of this legislation by the House will assist the Commonwealth in making offers and payments to organisations so workers can have their payments by Christmas.

As it is very hard to hear motions in this place when everybody else is yelling, I will stop the clock, if we could. I think that reasonable. For everybody's information, sub judice is a very difficult issue for the parliament. It is a very difficult issue. It does not go to matters that are before the court or public; it is about the impression the parliament makes on the issues and the decision that a judge or jury may make-or in normal circumstances where there may be. So it is upon the parliament to be very cautious in any of these issues. However, I believe that the motion does not affect sub judice.

185,Ms GILLARD,CONDOLENCES," Madam Speaker, on indulgence, while we have been here in question time, it has started to come to public attention that a very young man, a very young soldier, has died as a result of the training accident at Holsworthy, which I am sure people saw the reports of over the course of the week. This is a 22-year-old soldier. The minister has spoken to his opposition counterpart and, if suits the convenience of the House, he will make a brief statement on indulgence about the death of this young man.",105
186,Mr SNOWDON,CONDOLENCES,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (15:29): It is with great sadness that we learnt of the young soldier who tragically lost his life today. He was one of 18 members of the Army who were involved in a vehicle accident on the Holsworthy range on Monday, 8 October. This young man, Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze, enlisted in the Regular Army in April of this year and, after completing his recruit NOES training, commenced his initial employment training in July. He had been in a critical condition since Monday's accident, and earlier today his family made the heart breaking decision to switch off his life NA support. Jordan Ronald Penpraze was born in Mornington, Victoria on 15 August 1990. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 3 April 2012 and, as I said, on completion of his Army recruit training at Kapooka, he marched into Holdfast Troop, Initial Employment Training Squadron, at the School of Military Engineering on 26 June. On 11 July, he commenced his Royal Australian Engineer Initial Employment Training. During his time in Holdfast Troop, Sapper Penpraze demonstrated his quick thinking when he and another soldier successfully resuscitated an elderly citizen while on local leave in Liverpool. Sapper Penpraze remained with the elderly citizen, maintaining CPR until the ambulance arrived. Sapper Penpraze was a respected and very well liked member of the troop. He was a quiet and stoic sapper who possessed a it determination to perform to the best of his ability. He took on all lessons immediately with maturity and a strong desire for selfimprovement. His commitment to his section and his mates saw him complete his work with no reservations or complaints. He would rather take the hard job or the heavy load to spare a mate who was doing it tough. It was this selfless commitment to his mates that made him such a respected member of 3 Troop. While Sapper Penpraze completed everything he did to a high standard, he excelled at watermanship, showing his skills with watercraft and a passion for boats. His previous experience allowed him to take on a leadership role during this phase of the course. He maintained this enthusiasm during field training exercises, receiving excellent reports from all field activities. Sapper Penpraze's very sad death is a reminder to us all that being in the ADF is dangerous, whether in Afghanistan or here at home in training. Our heartfelt condolences go to Sapper Penpraze's family, his friends and his comrades.",105
187,Mr ROBERT,PAIRS," I rise on behalf of the coalition to associate ourselves with the fine remarks from Minister Snowdon. It is a reminder that freedom is not free; training for war is tough. Eighteen young soldiers were badly injured when a truck rolled down a steep hill while they were training to defend freedom. Sapper Penpraze was a 22-year-old digger training to be a combat engineer. If you know nothing more about this young Australian soldier, know this: he was training to go into an engineering division that has paid a heavy price in Afghanistan. The toll taken on the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment and the Incident Response Regiment of Special Operations Command has been exacting as they fight the battle against IEDs in Afghanistan. This was the job, this was the unit, this was the career that Sapper Penpraze was going into. He was a fine Australian soldier. We should all remember that this man gave his life while in training to prepare to fight wars in defence of our nation and in defence of freedom. We will remember him.

NA NA Carbon Pricing The SPEAKER (15:36): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Mackellar proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse effect of the particularly on senior Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (15:36): In calling for this discussion of a matter of public importance today-it being the adverse effect of the carbon tax, particularly on senior Australians-I do so wearing my hat as the shadow minister for seniors. There has never been a minister for seniors in this parliament before. We have had ministers for youth, we have had them for children-we have had them for all sorts of groups. But never before have senior Australians been recognised in this way, which was an acknowledgement by the Leader of the Opposition of the importance of this group. For the purposes of the portfolio responsibility, seniors are those people who are over the age of 50 and, in fact, constitute 40 per cent of all voters. It is important to note in this debate that the impact on senior Australians can be particularly cruel, particularly on those who Amendment have retired or are on pensions and those who are self-funded retirees, because those people are on fixed incomes and do not have the elasticity of looking forward to an increase in salary to make up for the imposition of the carbon tax. The carbon tax is essentially a tax on electricity. And it is designed specifically to see people use less electricity. It is designed to lower the standard of living, particularly for those people who cannot afford to meet the increases. The stories that we hear-for instance, of people delivering meals-onwheels through the winter to people in receipt of the age pension and finding those people in bed, not because they are ill but carbon tax because they are cold-are true stories. These are people who are forced not to turn on the switch to activate a heater or, in some cases, even lights, to the degree that there have been some suspicious fires that have been caused by people resorting to candles because they felt they could not afford electric light. That is not the Australia that my father and his generation fought in World War II to deliver to this country. The idea that we should not consider having electric light and electric heating as automatic rights in an Australian household is something quite foreign to people who recognise the sacrifice that was made to ensure we lived in a free country. It is important to realise that the impact electricity prices, particularly on people who are self-employed or who work in small business, is also very relevant to seniors, because people who are self-employed or work in small business will work much longer than those who work in big business. The fact of the matter is that you can find people who are shopkeepers, accountants or lawyers-people who are maintaining an active work-life well into their 70s and 80s in private practice and yet are being hit very hard by this electricity impost. I will give you an example of a sole practitioner in a law firm who has a very substantial practice but has just seen a quarterly electricity bill rise from $1,000 to $1,500 for the quarter. And the likelihood of that continuing to rise, of course, under this carbon tax is well known. Let us look at how it operates, because it is a tax that is both cascading and compounding. It gets into the nooks and crannies of every aspect of your life. Everything we do in a civilised country depends on electricity. It is the difference between a First World country and a Third World country. When Bob Brown was here and in cahoots with Prime Minister Gillard, they wanted us all to live in a cave with a candle. But now that we have Senator Milne, she would really rather we did without the candle! The fact of the matter is that your life is meant to become lesser. When the Prime Minister talks about a 'gold standard' for infrastructure to deliver electricity, what on earth is she talking about? Does she want a silver standard? A bronze standard? A lead standard? How many blackouts would be acceptable to her? The fact of the matter is that, on previous occasions, this same Prime Minister has complained about there not being sufficient infrastructure. And yet when of the infrastructure is built, in order that communities have electricity and do not have blackouts, it is spurned as being 'gold plated'. Well, there are plenty of instances I can think of in the world of countries where there is simply not enough infrastructure. There are plenty of countries where the elites will take the power and the people will be poor. This is not the sort of country we want here. But let us look at how this tax works. The tax is imposed on the so-called emitters, or generators, of electricity. It is imposed on the creation of the good, the service, of electricity. On every transaction that occurs between the tax being paid and it being paid by the final consumer, again the tax is paid. So it becomes a tax on a tax on a tax on a tax, and then the GST is paid on it as well. It is quite unlike the GST which, as a valueadded tax, has all the taxes paid between the initial creation of the good or service and the final consumer refunded. Consequently, there will be rises that will occur in everything we do. Prime Minister Gillard says there will be no carbon tax on fuel for the family car. Really? How does she think that the petrol is got from the tank at the service station into the tank of the car? Electricity pumps it. How do you think you pay for it? You go to the cash register, which is driven by electricity. In this building, the lights, the air conditioning-everything about it is driven by electricity. The sewage system, the water system-all driven by electricity. And that is the impost that the carbon tax has put on every aspect of our lives. Our dependence on refrigeration is well known. You go to the supermarket. You pick up fruit that appears to be fresh and yet you know it has been kept somewhere else in a warehouse under refrigerated circumstances. You take your meat, and you take it for granted; somehow it got from the abattoirs to your supermarket and has been kept cool and fresh and safe-electricity again. And also there are the gases that are used to make that refrigeration work; the escalation in the tax for them has gone through the roof-some people say 290 per cent. So this is an insidious tax that is attacking the very structure of our lives. That includes an impost on the fans in schoolrooms for children and on the buses that take the children to school. Nothing escapes. And yet we have a Prime Minister who stands there as she did today and says, 'No, no; everybody is protected or compensated.' Let us understand. What does compensation do? Compensation is a payment for an injury that the person paying it has caused. This Prime Minister said, six days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Let us remind ourselves why she said it: because Tony Abbott had been saying throughout the entire election period that, as sure as night follows day, there would be a carbon tax should the Gillard government be re-elected. So she looked straight down the barrel of the camera to refute it. Had she not said that, she not have been in the position to negotiate to become the Prime Minister, because win she did not. And the Treasurer said it was a hysterical allegation by the opposition. Well, it was not hysterical; it was accurate. The long and the short of it is that we have said we will repeal that tax. Let us again look at this question of compensation. Treasury calculated that the damage done is $9.90 a week and therefore they will offer compensation of $10.10 a week, saying that people will be 20c a week better off-wow! Anybody who truly believes that Treasury can predict with that degree of accuracy must believe there are fairies at the bottom of the garden.",107
192,Mr Billson,IMPORTANCE,"There's no precision in the budget estimates. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I am about to pick up on that point made by my friend the shadow minister for small business, who understands very well the impact on small business.",110
193,Mr Billson,IMPORTANCE,"Devastating. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Absolutely. The fact of the matter is: Treasury gets it wrong every year. Every year, the budget is wrong. Six months later, we get supplementary estimates to fix it up. In the case of the budget of this government, it was going to have a $22 billion deficit and it turns out to be $43 billion. So anybody who thinks that they can get it down to a 20c margin, as I said, must believe there are fairies at the bottom of the garden. This is a punitive, harsh and unfair tax. Because it attacks the disposable income of those on fixed incomes-pensioners, partpensioners and self-funded retirees-it also has an enormous impact on the retail sector. Research that I had Access Economics do predicted that the silver market would go platinum because of the purchasing power of would Australian seniors. When their spending power is diminished or fear is put into their hearts-and the fear comes from the rhetoric of the government, not the warning from the opposition; the government has said that you have got to be fearful because the world is going to come to an end because of climate change unless we have this tax. And yet this tax will not bring the emissions down one bit. In fact, they will be continuing to rise to 2020. So the whole nature of it is fallacious. We hear the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency shriek and carry on. He is the one who said the seas were going to rise up and houses would fall into the sea. Where did he buy his house? Right on the seaside! The fear campaign and the fearmongering that has gone on in the name of the government, saying, 'Be fearful of climate change; this tax is the answer to nothing short of a good old furphy. The fact of the matter is it is a punitive tax which is meant to damage people-hence they use the term 'compensation'-and it damages seniors more than ever. I notice the member for Braddon over there having a yawn. Of course, he would be very bored by the plight of seniors. He would be very bored at their plight and would not give a damn what happened to them. That is way the Labor Party is. You would remember during the 2010 election campaign the Prime Minister said in cabinet-and it was effectively leaked-'Why would we give anything to pensioners? They don't vote for us anyway.' That is the attitude that the government has towards Australians-to disparage them and to pretend to have their interests at heart with this ridiculous compensation package. The fact of the matter is that the damage to them will be far, far greater than any compensation that will be paid. Then we have the flip-flopping that has gone on in the policy. It is $23 a tonne to start with. Then it will go to $29 a tonne and then to $37 a tonne. The government then came in and said: 'We'll get rid of the floor price. We'll tie it all to Europe. But we're not going to change our Treasury modelling. It's still going to come out at $29 a tonne.' That is despite the fact that in Europe it is around $6 a tonne. It is a con. The Australian people are being conned and they are being punished by having their precious electricity, which determines the standard of living that they enjoy, being taken away from them. They are being punished by a government that told an untruth before the election in order to attempt to win government. But win they did not. The Prime Minister is there only because she stitched up two deals-one a deal she stitched up with the execution of Kevin Rudd it,' is and one a deal she stitched up with the Independents. The Independents are equally complicit in this perpetration of punishment of the people. We in the opposition need to be strong-which we are-and every day bring evidence. The Prime Minister denies that evidence daily. We have noticed that nothing is the Prime Minister's fault. It does not matter what happens, it was not her; it was Tony Abbott, it was the state government or it was somebody else! Even with the unemployment figures today that showed there had been a growth in unemployment, she boldly stood there and said, 'We've created more jobs.' But a rise in unemployment means more jobs disappeared than were created. But of course that is not senior her fault. She is only standing there. It has got to be somebody else's fault. The day will come when you can no longer call the gender card or the victim card. By pretending to be a victim, the Prime Minister has demeaned every woman in this parliament. We did not come here for it to be said that we cannot do the job and have to be treated differently; we on this side of the parliament came here to say that we are the best people for the job of representing the people and that the ideas that we have are the best ideas to take us into government. We do not wish to be treated as if we are somehow less able and victims of somebody's spiteful words. It is a pathetic thing to say. Could you imagine Angela Merkel making a speech like that or Maggie Thatcher making a speech like that? Of course not. The fact of the matter is: if you take leadership, you must exercise leadership. If you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. At the end of the day, what we are seeing here is a government which has no purposefulness in order to look after the interests of the people. It wants to punish the people. (Time expired)",110
194,Mr SNOWDON,IMPORTANCE,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (15:53): I acknowledge the contribution of the honourable member opposite, the member for Mackellar, not for its comments or arguments about the carbon tax, because there were not any. As to a price on carbon and electricity, she referred to electricity prices, and she referred to the rebuttal by the Prime Minister, the minister responsible and the Treasurer of the statements being made on a continuing basis in this parliament by the opposition. We saw a prime example of that yesterday, when we saw another illustration of the porkies which seem to float from the other side of the chamber on a regular basis, attempting to mislead the Australian population into believing that somehow or other the price on carbon is responsible for the extraordinary increases in electricity prices across the country, when the opposition know and the community knows, generally speaking, that that is not the case. The facts speak for themselves. When we saw yesterday the opposition table a bill and assert some horrendous increase in electricity price as a result of the price on carbon, we learnt, of course, that the increase on the electricity bill which was presented was almost solely attributable-except for nine per cent, which I think was the figure attributable to the price on carbon-to increased electricity consumption in that household. To come into the parliament and assert that the doubling of the electricity cost to a particular family was the direct result of the price on carbon was disingenuous. It was dishonest. It was untrue. It was a porky. It is up to the opposition to make the case as to why they believe we should not have a price on carbon, but it is not up to the opposition to strike fear in the hearts of Australians that somehow or other their lives are going to change irreversibly, beyond their control, because of the fact that we have a price on carbon. We were told that it was going to be Armageddon when the price on carbon was introduced. We were told that Whyalla would disappear off the face of the earth. Let me just say that I sit next to Minister Gray, the member for Brand. His mother lives in Whyalla. He tells me, most assuredly, that Whyalla still exists. I am surprised, therefore, that we have not had an apology from the Leader of the Opposition, because all of these grandiose claims about Armageddon, about how the earth would be flattened by the decisions taken by this government in relation to a price on carbon, have proven to be untrue. Yet we do not see the opposition walking back from the accusations they are making to the community about the impact of the price on carbon on their daily lives. We ought to know about the electricity prices. We know what has happened to electricity prices in this country, and very little of it has got to do with the price on carbon. We know that, in the last three years, per household, power prices have gone up in New South Wales by 55 per cent; in Victoria by 33 per cent; in Queensland by 39 per cent and in South Australia by 43 per cent. In Western Australia, they have gone up by a whopping $552 per household. It is not the carbon price-it is decisions by state governments. Yet we did not hear a whimper, not a yelp, from the opposition protesting against the increase in electricity prices in those states when they increased them so markedly, with a dramatic impact on the household budgets of families in those states. It is a shame on the opposition. They need to explain to the Australian community the detail of why prices increase, not come in with some story, which proves to be untrue each time they tell it, that somehow or other it is the carbon price which is responsible for a dramatic increase in electricity prices. It is manifestly untrue. It is an untruth. We do not see the opposition going out and trying to tell the truth; it is quite the opposite. They are attempting to convince the Australian community that every increase in price that they see on their electricity bill is a result of carbon pricing. They know it is false. We know it is false. But they will not admit it to the Australian community. We have just seen, unfortunately, another example from the member opposite, a person whom I respect-but nevertheless it is up to her to make sure that she tells the truth. Just simply tell the truth. If we all tell the truth this place about the impact of carbon pricing, there will be no fear in the community about the impact of carbon pricing. There will be no fear because the facts are abundantly clear to all those who take just a moment to have a look at what is happening. In the context of the carbon price, the government acknowledged that there would be an impact on family budgets. We acknowledged what that impact would be. So we put in place a set of measures to address the additional costs to all Australians across the community, particularly those in need such as aged Australians and veterans. I will give you some of the detail. As a result of assistance to seniors, 3.4 million pensioners in Australia will receive assistance that more than covers their average expected cost of putting a price on carbon: a real and permanent increase to the pension of around $338 per year for singles and around $510 a year for couples combined. Self-funded retirees with a Commonwealth seniors health card will receive the same support as aged pensioners through extra payments paid with the seniors supplement. Seniors and others with medical conditions who rely on medical treatment that uses more power can get extra help with their bills through the 'essential medical equipment payment' of $140 per year, with over 10,000 payments already made. Our support is targeted at lowand middle-income families and pensioners who have the least room to move in their family budgets. On average, the expected increase in costs due to a carbon price for a single pensioner will be just $204 per year. With the increase in their pension payments of $338 they will be $134 better off. Why don't the opposition just simply tell the truth and tell the community that in fact their family budgets will be able to sustain in any increases that might come about as a result of the carbon pricing because of these supplements which are being made? On average, the expected increase in costs due to a carbon price for a pensioner couple will be $284 per year. With the increase in their pension payments of $510 per year, they will be $226 better off. So why are we hearing consistently, day after day after day, representations from the opposition which tell us that that is not the case? It is manifestly untrue. We know that, under the Liberals' plan, they will claw back $300 a year from single pensioners and more than $500 a year from pensioner couples. And the New South Wales and Queensland Liberal governments have finally come clean on their plans to claw back money from public housing tenants to fill their own coffers. We have already delivered the most historic pension reforms in the 100-year history of the pension system. These reforms have delivered increases of $172 a fortnight for singles and $182 for couples combined, on the maximum rate since 2009. New indexation arrangements mean that pensions are keeping better pace with pensioners' cost of living. That is in addition which I have referred to earlier. Let me now go to veterans, because that is an area which I know that the member opposite, the member for Boothby, is interested in. There are 156,000 service pensioners and senior supplement recipients who receive a lump sum of $250 for singles or $190 for each eligible member of a couple. On 14 June this year, 110,000 disability pensioners received a lump sum of up to $380 a week and 92,000 war widows and widowers received a lump sum of $250. The children of veterans who receive fortnightly education allowances are also eligible for clean energy payments. An ongoing payment, the clean energy supplement, will commence between March 2013 and January 2014, depending on the type of payment received. An essential medical equipment payment of $140 per annum is also available for eligible pensioners, pensioner concession cardholders, health card Commonwealth seniors health card and DVA gold or white card holders to cover the additional costs of running essential medical equipment and medically required heating and/or cooling that arise from the introduction of a carbon price. Additional assistance is available through the family tax benefit, the new low-income supplement and the tax system. The government are more than compensating people for the impacts on their cost of living as a result of carbon pricing. That is clear. Yet, as I said earlier, day after day after day we get the same old drivel coming from the Leader of the Opposition, his frontbenchers and his backbenchers about the impact of the price on carbon. They are going into their communities and telling people untruths, trying to persuade people that somehow or another the world will end as a result of carbon pricing, when they know that it is to those matters simply untrue. I say to members of the opposition: why is it that you cannot fundamentally agree with the facts? Why is it that you cannot agree with the facts-for example, we know that in the case of electricity prices in New South Wales the Treasury estimate for the change in price is 10 per cent. The average increase in regulated prices due to the carbon price is 8.9 per cent. In Queensland, it is 11 per cent-that is, $3.34 a week. In the case of South Australia, it is 4.6 per cent, or $1.47 per week. In Western Australia, it is 9.13 per cent, or $2.50 a week. In Tasmania, it is 5.6 per cent, which is less than $3 a week. Those are the facts, and people are being compensated with a $10 payment. How is it that we are left in this position where the opposition masquerade and come in here with these trumped-up claims about the impact of carbon pricing on electricity bills when, as we saw yesterday with this very bill, that they were totally false and holders, totally discredited? I note the observations made by the minister during question time. We did not see the Leader of the Opposition, or the person who raised the question yesterday, come in here and say: 'My apologies. I've misled the parliament and I've misled all those people who may be listening to this broadcast. The fact is that the carbon price did not have the impact that I claimed it would have.' Why didn't they do that? Why can't they just admit the truth? Why can't they deal with the facts instead of making up stories which are so absurdly untrue that their untruth is obvious to the world? The claims which were made about the end of the world-the Armageddon which would come upon us-after 1 July have been shown to be plainly false. It is obvious to the whole of the Australian community that Whyalla still exists, that the coal industry still exists and that the economy is growing. But this is not what was said. I invite all those people in the community who are worried about the carbon price to go to the words of the Leader of the Opposition and check them against the facts. The facts will tell you that the Leader of the Opposition and all of those behind him are telling giant porkies. (Time expired)",112
195,Dr SOUTHCOTT,IMPORTANCE," We need to think back to 2007 and remember why Labor was elected then. They were elected in part because they understood how important the issue of the cost of living was to families and to seniors. Everyone would have seen on the TV news the photo opportunities of Kevin Rudd sitting around a table with families to discuss the household bills. There was lots of nodding and lots of empathy. He did it in so many seats. Labor were going to do things: Fuelwatch, which was a failure, and GroceryWatch, which was a failure. Now we have come to a situation where the Labor Party are in complete denial over one of the main concerns-that is, the cost of living-of families and people on fixed incomes, especially seniors. I am talking not just about electricity. We have seen dramatic rises in all utility rates-of water, of electricity and of gas. They keep on going up. A lot of the government's arguments say, 'It's not all due to the carbon tax,' but there no doubt that the carbon tax makes the pressure on the cost of living much, much worse. The latest argument from the government is, 'The price rise for electricity is in the order of 10 per cent; the policy is working as planned.' But what that ignores is the enormous pressure that Australian families and Australian seniors are feeling. They are struggling with all the cost-ofliving increases under this government. What the government do not get is that, by adding a carbon tax, they have just made the situation much, much worse. We often hear this phrase, but it is worth hearing it again. Not more than six days before the last election, the Prime Minister of this country clearly misled the Australian people when she stated, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Not one Labor candidate distributed any material about or said that they would be voting for a carbon tax, yet every single one of them did so. We know from Australian political history that any party which goes to an election promising one thing and then doing another will pay a very high price when they next have to face the Australian people. I think about 1993, when Paul Keating said that he was campaigning against a GST and then, in his first budget after the election, he dramatically increased the sales tax on a whole raft of goods. It was, in effect, a GST by stealth. Following that, the Labor members who voted for the increase in sales taxes in 1993 faced the black-and-red as on TV about how they voted to increase the sales tax on wine, on cars-on everything. The attitude of the Labor Party seems to be denial: 'What are you complaining about? It's working as we expected.' I think about 1993; I also think about how, in 2001, when the Liberal party were in government, there was a big campaign by the motoring organisations over concerns about the high is cost of petrol with the introduction of the GST. We listened to what the community was saying and made some changes because we recognised the pain in the community about the high price of petrol. But we had not taken a policy of making such changesthat is, removing excise and adding the GST-to the electorate, so the situation then was not equivalent to the situation we find now, where a government which was elected promising to do something about the cost of living for families and seniors has done the very opposite. In my own electorate of Boothby, 18.7 per cent of people are over 65. As I go around the electorate I have a lot to do with people on the age pension, with people who are part pensioners and part self-funded retirees and with people who are self-funded retirees. One of the unfortunate things about the carbon tax is that people on fixed incomes will be hit the hardest. As the cost of living rises under the carbon tax, those people who are on fixed incomes-pensioners and self-funded retirees-will have less money to spend on leisure, less to spend on recreation, less to spend on their grandchildren and less to spend on the essentials of life. There are something like half a million self-funded retirees in Australia. There are 1.2 million age pensioners and there are 880,000 part age pensioners in Australia. They are really the forgotten people in this debate. The Labor Party gave no thought to the impact on seniors of introducing their carbon tax. I regularly see self-funded retirees and pensioners at shopping centres and at my listening posts and, through my surveys, I hear from those who tell me what this tax means to them as they struggle to make ends meet because they see their grocery bills and electricity bills going up and up. Senior Australians have worked hard all their lives. They should not be expected to absorb the cost of the carbon tax on their own when they have already given so much back to our community. Another one of the lies is that a carbon tax will not work unless it hurts, that that is the way to change behaviour, which the government are so keen to do. So, again, their argument about compensation ignores the fact that you do not need to compensate people if you do not have a carbon tax. That is the simple thing: the compensation is only necessary because of the carbon tax in the first place. I also want to go to issues in my electorate of Boothby in South Australia. The Belair Hotel, when they received their first power bill under the carbon tax, saw that their offpeak power rate had increased by 45 per cent due to a carbon adjustment charged by AGL. When the Lakes Resort Hotel in the electorate of Hindmarsh got their first post carbon tax electricity bill it cost them an extra $3½ thousand a month",115
196,Mr Tehan,IMPORTANCE,How much?,116
197,Dr SOUTHCOTT,IMPORTANCE,"$3½ thousand a month, due to the carbon adjustment alone. If you are running a hotel there is not much you can do to reduce your electricity. The City of Onkaparinga is a local government area in the electorates of Kingston, Boothby and Mayo. The Mayor of the City of Onkaparinga, Lorraine Rosenberg, has been quoted as stating that the carbon tax will cost ratepayers an extra $800,000 a year. Street lighting makes up 70 per cent of the council's electricity bill. They cannot reduce their usage-they have to keep the lights on at night. They have no choice but to pay more. Paul Kerin, CEO of South Australia's Independent Essential Services Commission, when asked if repealing the tax would cut electricity prices, responded, 'Yes, and we'd look to make adjustment at that time.' So there you have it, from the CEO of South Australia's Independent Essential Services Commission. If you want to see electricity prices come down, support the coalition and their plan to reduce the carbon tax. The one thing you have to say about the Labor Party is that they do have extraordinary discipline. We saw it at the start of this week, where they blindly voted to support a situation that was obvious to everyone was unsustainable, and they are now blindly following this same approach, ignoring their voters, ignoring their constituents. (Time expired)",116
198,Mr LYONS,IMPORTANCE," I guess I should lay out on the table why we are position. One of the major reasons is that Liberal Party gave their preferences to a member of the Greens, so that is the parliament we are stuck with. It was Liberal preferences that elected the Greens member of parliament, and that is why we are in this situation.",117

200,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! Can members on my left please keep it down.,117
201,Mr LYONS,IMPORTANCE,"The Australian people decide who is in the Australian parliament and the Australian government then have to negotiate. So the Leader of the Opposition lies back in his chair with his feet on the table and his hands behind his head and says, 'You are going to vote for me, aren't you, you Independents, you Greens, because I am the opposition leader now?' That was the difference. The Prime Minister went in and negotiated. One of the Independents told us that the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I'll give you whatever you like except I won't sell a certain part of my anatomy.' That is the difference. The Prime Minister of Australia went in and genuinely negotiated. Part of situation was caused by the Liberal preferences going to the Greens-and that is the parliament we have got. The government has been upfront about the carbon price and electricity prices, as they affect all Australians. Treasury modelling has found that the carbon price would increase household electricity prices by 10 per cent, $3.30 a week on average. The Electricity Regulator determinations have confirmed this. In some cases, the carbon impact has been less than the Treasury's estimates. To meet the impact, the government has provided $10.10 a week on average to households. The opposition in this should focus on the state Liberal the governments, who are lining their pockets with this compensation from those in public housing. It is important to establish these facts because those opposite are engaged in a cowardly campaign of frightening pensioners. Recently the opposition leader made several misleading claims about an electricity bill from West Australia. The opposition leader told the House there was an $800 increase in just one bill, 70 per cent of which was due to the carbon tax. But, surprise, surprise, when this bill was examined it was clear that the proportion of the increase which was due to the carbon price was a fraction of the claimed 70 per cent. This is lazy, this is deceitful and this treats pensioners disrespectfully, as nothing but fodder for a political scare campaign. If the opposition really cared about pensioners, they would have established the facts about this bill, rather than rushing in here to distort it for political ends. Those opposite have misled people generally and senior Australians in particular about job losses. Those opposite have misled people about assistance for small business. They have misled people about the strength this of our economy. It has been a farce of wrecking balls, cobra strikes, python squeezes, dogs of taxes and octopus embraces. It is time the opposition displayed some integrity and put this discredited scare campaign out of its misery. The member for Moore is a man of great integrity and a person who in my short time here I have grown to admire for both his words and actions. I think the opposition should take his advice and come up with properly funded policies which look to the future. The opposition leader should get off his downward spiral of negativity by taking advice from the member for Moore. The carbon price has been in operation for over 100 days. Before it started, the opposition leader made countless dire predictions about its impact. Plague and pestilence were to be brought upon us. Not a single one of those predictions has come to pass. The opposition leader had predicted: Whyalla, Gladstone and the Hunter Valley would all be wiped off the map, but investment is growing-the Mayor of Whyalla says his town is 'kicking goals'; the death of the coal industry, but Australia's exports of thermal coal are forecast to increase by 12 per cent to 165 million tonnes in 2012-in fact, another coal loader has been ordered for Newcastle; the death of the steel industry, yet OneSteel, or Arrium, is now the subject of a takeover bid; and the death of manufacturing, but manufacturing employment has grown by 9,000 jobs since the carbon price began. We know that some areas are doing it tough, and Bass in Tasmania is one of those areas, but that is nothing to do with the carbon price. I believe it is partly because the community, including businesses, have been relying on the pulp mill being built. The opposition leader predicted the price on carbon would create unimaginable price increases, yet the RBA can find no significant price rises. He also predicted of thousands of job losses, but the unemployment rate has dropped from 5.3 per cent to 5.1 per cent. The opposition leader has repeatedly claimed no other country is taking action. But Australia's carbon price will soon be linked to a scheme covering more than 30 other countries, and recently the government of the US state of California-the eighth largest economy in the world-announced that it will be exploring the potential linking of our carbon markets. Contrary to the opposition leader's fallacious claims, the government's Household Assistance Package, funded by the carbon price, has made millions of people better off. The government has delivered tax cuts, higher family payments, increases in pensions and benefits to millions of households to help with the modest costof-living impacts. One million people no longer have to file a tax return because we trebled the tax-free threshold. That is a reform those opposite would never have made. It is only tax cuts for the wealthy that they understand. We know the opposition, when in government, were the highest taxing government as a proportion of GDP in Australia's history. The opposition leader has trafficked in fiction and, if I can borrow a word from the minister, in a mendacious scare campaign. He continues to do it despite the facts and despite reality. The opposition have misled the people about the strength of our economy. It has been a farce of wrecking balls, cobra strikes, python squeezes, dogs of taxes and octopus embraces. The carbon price is an essential economic reform. It is vital for our long-term competitiveness. It will allow Australia to play its part in tackling global climate change and at the same time improve our productivity through better use of energy tens inputs. Numerous economic reports have found that, while taking action has an economic cost, the cost of inaction will be far greater. The cheapest and most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution is to harness the power of the market, to put a price tag on greenhouse gas pollution that creates an incentive to cut that pollution. Every major economy is tackling climate change. Countries are using a mixture of regulation, carbon pricing, renewable energy targets and investment. Ensuring Australia does its fair share in tackling the global problem of climate change, we are doing this at least cost and are in a position to compete and prosper in a low-carbon economy, enhancing the productivity of Australian industry so that we are well placed to take the growth opportunities that will be available in Asia and beyond over the next decades, which will support all Australians, including senior Australians, into the future. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (16:28): The carbon tax will have an impact on all Australians. For some individuals, the impact will be very significant, and that will case for many of our senior Australians. That is something that is of great concern to me the member for MCPherson, and I know that it is of great concern to many of the seniors that live in my electorate of MCPherson on the Gold Coast and also more broadly on the southern Gold Coast. I know that because they come and speak to me about it. They take every opportunity to raise with me their concerns about how they are going to pay their bills into the future and whether they will have enough money to get themselves through their retirement. One of the questions that are at the forefront of their minds is: what will the impact of the carbon tax be on my future? I think it is important to look at some of the numbers for the seniors that we have here. I should start by saying that the definition of a senior Australian is anyone over the age of 50 years.",117
202,Mr Ramsey,IMPORTANCE,"That's a bit harsh! Mrs ANDREWS: It is very harsh! In my electorate of MCPherson, 34.5 per cent of the population are 50 years and over, so they are classified and categorised as seniors. I recently hosted a seniors forum on the Gold Coast with my friend and colleague the member for Moncrieff. We were fortunate enough to have as our guest speaker of the day the shadow minister for seniors, the member for Mackellar. Debate interrupted. NA",119

204,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT," I am about to read a very compelling email from a constituent that indicates just what political correctness has done to the family unit in this be the great country of ours. I quote: Mr Schultz. I'm a 52 yr old father of four at my as wits end. Last week my youngest girl (15) gave birth to a baby boy. We had no Idea she was pregnant and according to the doc she had blocked it from her memory. She told them, not me at the hospital who the father was a 20yr old male. I was told not to intervene as she was in a fragile state and loving my daughter unconditionally I did so. Later I was told after speaking with doctors a doc worker and councilor that my daughter would not have him charged, further they advised her he should be involved in her life. My wife who has spent a week with my daughter in hospital was told she has no say. As parents we have no rights for our baby daughter, the anguish she had to endure alone breaks my heart, three hours I spent trying to help her while she was in so much pain and the shock she went through giving birth. My wife and I raised four great children, we love them dearly and they love us in return. I'm at a loss as to why we were shut out when a snake of a man who was a friend of my eldest daughter and fiance did a thing like this and walks away without penalty. Where are our rights, my daughters rights she is a baby for gods sake. I love my girl and my grandson but their has to be something some avenue we can turn, this bloke is dangerous. He then went on to send me another email yesterday: Re my daughter Amy. Said social worker con my daughter without our prior knowledge Whilst talking to Amy totally ignored my wife telling our daughter that it was her sole decision in the matter. Prompted her on more than one occasion that the MAN should be involved in the upbringing of the child. Attempted to invite herself into our home when the district nurses were due Rang to speak to Amy who was busy at the time with the baby wanting to make app to visit I denied her on the basis that my daughter had said (dad can you keep that women away from me). My wife and I are incredulous that this person without forethought presumed that Kath and I were the same as all parents when all people are different and that she could have access to our child after going through a very physical and emotional time without any ok from us after all this is our baby. One final point this lady made my daughter feel insecure not secure in the family and massive friend support she has. As a result of that, I wrote to three ministers of the Crown at the state level. In particular I wrote to the Hon. Pru Goward, who is the Minister for Family and Community Services, and I said this: I refer to you the attached correspondence dated 21st September 2012 frommy constituent in Cowra, New South Walesin the Hume Electorate who brings to my attention his grave concerns regarding his underage daughter of 15 years of age giving birth recently to a child fathered by a 20 year old male. Enquiries made with the NSW Police reveal that, if a complaint is made and is proven, this is a jailable offence under NSW law carrying a substantial penalty by way of a 10-year sentence, could you please confirm this information so that I may advise my constituent. I would further point-out that the intervention Doc's Worker, Councillor & Doctor have not assisted this family in anyway, and may have influenced the 15 year old's decision not to have the adult male charged. This inappropriate interference without full knowledge of the parents may have made the situation worse as this whole affair obviously began when this girl was a 14 year old minor as she is now only 15 and gave birth in mid-September. I am in contact with the parents and have written permission to pursue the matter vigorously on their behalf. I have also written to the Attorney General and the police minister and I intend to write to the minister for health in New South Wales to ask why these people employed by the state of New South Wales interfered in and shut down the rights of parents to look after their child, who in fact under the laws of this country is still a minor. I really do despair when these sorts of issues are raised in this politically correct environment that we live in today. They take away the God given right and the appropriate right under our system of democracy for parents to look after, educate and maintain the health of their children. (Time expired) No. 292 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force",119
205,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT," On Thursday, 27 September 2012 it was a great privilege for me to join the 292 Squadron in the consecration parade of their Governor General's banner. In particular, it was a great pleasure to join the Governor of South Australia, His Excellency Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce, who was the reviewing officer, and the Premier of the state, Jay Weatherill, in what was a wonderful parade on a very beautiful Adelaide day. This parade was flawless, I have to say. It was a great example of a parade out there at Edinburgh. I want to congratulate the parade of a appointments: the parade commander, Wing Commander Roger MCCutcheon; the parade adjutant, Flight Lieutenant Nicola Rhodes; the parade warrant officer, Warrant Officer Steven Peters; and the holding squadron commander, Squadron Leader Colin Gray. The escort squadron included the commander, Squadron Leader Nicholas Pausina, whom I know because he was my escort on an ADF exchange, and he is a constituent of mine. There was also the adjutant, Flight Lieutenant Michael Sleeman; the warrant officer, Andrew Ribbans; the No. 1 flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Christopher Pendleton; and the No. 2 flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Troy Murphy. In the representative squadron were the commander, Squadron Leader James Hawking; the adjutant, Flight Lieutenant Matthew Coombes; the warrant officer, Warrant Officer Nicholas Harding; the No. 1 Flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Adam Steff; the No. 2 Flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Darryl Guerin; the No. 3 Flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Philip Southwood; and the No. 4 Flight commander, Flight Lieutenant Alexander Cave. In the colour party were the colour bearer, Flight Lieutenant Matthew Basedow; the colour warrant officer, Warrant Officer Kevin Schibrowski; and the colour escort, Flight Sergeant Deb Robertson and Sergeant Adam Driscoll. The master of ceremonies was Flight Lieutenant Philip Blakers. As I said before, it was a flawless parade undertaken by those parade appointments and by all of those from 292 Squadron who were parading that day. The motto of 292 Squadron is 'Prepare the hunter'. It plays a vital role in assisting Wing, which is based at Edinburgh, in doing its job. Its job over the last decade has been very busy indeed. I have been fortunate enough, when I did my Australian Defence Force exchange at Edinburgh, to see what all of the squadrons at Edinburgh do. In particular, I was fortunate enough to go out over the Timor Sea with 292 Squadron and see the important work that it does in border protection. Seeing that work up-front and close and personal changed my mind about many of our border protection issues, and it certainly gave me a great appreciation of the important role that 92 Wing plays up there and the important role that 292 Squadron plays in training and preparing them to do that job. Getting a Governor General's banner is no small thing. Non-operational units can only get it after 25 years of service in the Air Force, so it is regarded with great reverence. Colours have of course been associated with military units from the earliest of times. This was a great day with flawless parading by 292 Squadron. I congratulate it on receiving its colours and on its flawless parade. I wish it every success into the future. National Diabetes Services Scheme: 25th Anniversary Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (16:39): Madam Speaker, may I congratulate you on your elevation to high office. Last night, Diabetes Australia celebrated 25 years of administering the National Diabetes Services Scheme. The NDSS is a world-leading program, delivering diabetes related products at subsidised prices across the country. Prior to the scheme operating, consumables, such as syringes, were not subsidised, meaning the management of diabetes was incredibly expensive. To illustrate the difference this program made, Judith MCLeod, who was one 92 of the first people to be a registered participant of the scheme in 1987, told guests at the celebratory function last night how she was given only one glass needle that was intended to last her forever, due to the cost. She told us how she once accidentally dropped the needle from the syringe down the sink and could not recover it. She went without medication for 24 hours. Medication, too, was difficult to get, so rigorous planning was needed to ensure that she had sufficient supplies to last, particularly over holiday periods. Through the establishment of the scheme, vital medications and equipment can now be easily accessed across the country by walking into any pharmacy with an NDSS logo, or calling up the national telephone service. The scheme has expanded over its life-I am pleased to say it has had bipartisan support in this parliament over a very lengthy period of time-and has allowed new technologies to be added, improving the management of diabetes for hundreds of thousands of people. One of the most important and recent additions was the listing of pump consumables, particularly for children, ensuring diabetics could afford the peripheral items used to operate an insulin pump. Not only does the NDSS improve the lives of individuals, it represents a significant cost saving to the health budget. Proper management of diabetes ensures that patients do not develop more severe complications that require hospitalisation, or even the amputation of limbs. That message was brought home very clearly to members of this place this week. The Australasian Podiatry Council was in Parliament House yesterday demonstrating the ease with which proper patient management can save limbs. It is a regrettable, but also preventable, fact that 19.6 per cent of diabetes sufferers in Australia, over 200,000 people, have some form of peripheral arterial disease, which potentially places them at risk of requiring amputation. But if it is picked up early and managed properly, such drastic measures as amputation can be avoided, saving people's limbs and their quality of life, and many millions to the health system. In fact, the Australasian Podiatry Council's 2012 budget submission notes that up to $397 million per year could be saved by implementing more modest foot checks. Translating research into workable products is another area where Australia can lead, and in many cases has led, the world in the fight against diabetes. With the support of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group the islet transplant centre of excellence was established. While speaking with members of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation recently, it was highlighted that where Australia once provided funds to US researchers, the depth of Australia's research talent has now seen money flow from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in the United States to our shores. But we still lag on the all-important step of translating that research into clinical trials, which leads to medication and products which could improve, and indeed save, the lives of people across the globe. The success of programs such as the NDSS demonstrates that proper patient management is a critical factor in reducing the lives, limbs and money lost to diabetes in the community. The program is a beacon to government to investigate further initiatives that have the potential to save not only Australian lives but those of people across the world. I congratulate Diabetes Australia on its success over the 25 years and look forward to new initiatives in this critical area being endorsed by the government. It is not so much the cost of medicine that we should be concerned about but the cost of undiagnosed diabetes that is the problem. (Time expired) Sino-Australian Relations",120
206,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," Madam Speaker, I add my congratulations on your elevation to high office. In the last week of September it was my privilege to attend and participate in the 2012 Australia-China Futures Second Track Dialogue, whose governing theme was 'The Australia-China relationship at forty: building a pathway for the future.' Held in Beijing, the second track dialogue was co-sponsored by Griffith University and Peking University and supported by both the Australia-China Council and the Queensland Government. I would like to thank Griffith University, particularly Vice Chancellor Professor Ian O'Connor and Professor Andrew O'Neil, director of the Griffith Asia Institute, for opportunity to participate in this dialogue. The dialogue provided an opportunity to examine the evolution of Sino-Australian relations over the four decades that have passed since the establishment of formal diplomatic relations by the Whitlam government in 1972 and, most importantly, to consider the opportunities and challenges that we share in the Asian century ahead. I was pleased to meet Yi Wang of Griffith University, the author of a recently published book entitled Australia-China Relations post 1949-Sixty years of Trade and Politics. China's growing strategic importance not only in our region but globally raises the issue of how Australia as a creative middle power positions itself in the Asia-Pacific and the world vis-a-vis China and the United States, and I note that this is the subject of considerable expert commentary at present. But the more popular sense of the relationship between Australia and China tends to be a relatively narrow and simplified version of a much broader and more complex reality. Australia's resources sector is connected to and relies upon the appetite of the growing Chinese economy. There are the questions of how sustainable Australia's reliance on China as an export market for commodities is in the long term and what should be done to diversify Australia's economic relationship with China, and, further, how China and Australia relate to one another outside the lens of economics and the trade relationship. How do we diversify and broaden our engagement through our own distinctive yet evolving cultural and political frames, recognising that differences do exist, being prepared to discuss even difficult issues with the respectful honesty that is built upon a foundation of friendship? The second track dialogue was especially the thought-provoking and refreshing because of the chance it provided to consider aspects of the Sino-Australian relationship that are less commonly part of how we think about the connections between our countries but that will be increasingly important in framing our future. Most of all I appreciated the emphasis on the importance of people-to-people links as essential to building trust and understanding. During the first session of the dialogue, regarding cooperation and higher education, it was noted that, while there are some 97,000 Chinese students studying in Australia, there are only 3,000 Australian students studying in China. The critical need to develop interest in Asian culture and language among Australia's young people and the wider community was discussed. There is the sense that despite Australia's growing intellectual understanding of our place in Asia, our personal and official attachments are still skewed to the West. If we look at Australia's diplomatic representation, Australia is significantly under-represented in Asia compared to Europe. In my own electorate I have observed that most schools teaching languages other than English are teaching European languages such as Italian, French or German despite their more limited relevance to Australia's present and future. The dialogue also addressed emerging areas of closer cooperation in science partnerships and engagement, and disaster management. Both China and Australia have embraced R&D as necessary to their futures. China has become one of the largest investors in R&D and sources of scientific publications while Australia is one of the most prolific producers of scientific publications per capita. China has established collaborative partnerships on science and technology with 152 countries. I was encouraged to learn of the strong partnership that has developed between Australia's CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1975. China is now Australia's third most significant partner in research and development. Our joint projects include medical research, biodiversity, food security, water conservation, wireless communications and renewable energy. On the issue of disaster management, it was noted that the Asia-Pacific is the world's most natural disaster prone region and that the frequency, cost and impact of natural disasters is only going to increase with population growth, increased urbanisation and climate change. Experts expressed the view that Australia's disaster management planning assumptions have historically been too narrow, focused on past events, and that Australia needs a permanent fund to prepare for and respond to emergencies so that the government is not dependent on emergency appeals and ad hoc levies imposed after the event. On the eve, as it were, of the release government's timely white paper on Australia's place in the Asian Century, I am very grateful to have had the opportunity presented by the 2012 second track dialogue to participate in discussions of some of the most interesting developing aspects of the Australia-China relationship. There is no doubt that our common future, as nations and as regional participants, will be made healthier and safer, and that the lives of our respective citizens will be made more prosperous, free and sustainable, by our cooperation in such future planning. Bougainville Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (16:50): Earlier this year I travelled to Bougainville with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop. During that visit we had the opportunity to meet with Bougainville President John Momis and members of his government, and to build an understanding of how Bougainville is faring as it emerges from the years of civil war that wrought such destruction in what otherwise can only be described as a paradise. Bougainville has come a long way from those difficult times and gradually things are improving. It is telling that elections in Bougainville at national and regional level are largely conducted in a safe and peaceful manner and the results are accepted as representing the will of the people. There remains, sadly, a significant issue with weapons that remain in the Bougainville community. The source of those weapons varies, with some brought into Bougainville for the purposes of the conflict, others obtained from the PNG Defence Force and others being refurbished weapons already on Bougainville having been abandoned after the Second World War. It is about that last group of weapons of the that I would like to address my remarks. The Bougainville campaign during World War Two involved some 125,000 Australian and American troops and up to 65,000 Japanese troops. The Japanese forces occupied Bougainville as part of their expansion into the Pacific and subsequently, after success in Guadalcanal American and Australian forces landed and established a beachhead at Torokina, on the west coast of Bougainville, which over time became a major base including airfields and tens of thousands of troops. Along with the troops came those other essentials of war-weapons, ammunition, both for light arms and for artillery, and bombs. Those munitions have been a steady contributor to the death and destruction in Bougainville during the recent conflict and their influence still creates a notable challenge for the Autonomous Bougainville Government. An informal survey in 2008 disclosed an enormous number of unexploded bombs, artillery shells and mortars, largely remaining from when the Allies left. There were literally hundreds of mortar bombs lying in the very racks where they were placed in the 1940s-large bombs embedded in the ground where local villagers would step over them on their daily business. The ABG and the PNG Government sought US assistance and, as a result, in 2009 the US provided a specialist group to assist with this problem. As Safe Passage, a newsletter for the humanitarian mine action and conventional weapons destruction communities, reports: … after three months of work over three tons of ordnance that had been scattered throughout the area was destroyed including several large bombs that were destroyed where they were found. As valuable as that work was, there is an important aspect that remains untouched and which poses a serious threat to peace in Bougainville-the weapons that remain at Torokina and elsewhere in Bougainville. As good as the work of the US quick reaction force destruction team was, it was restricted to bombs. I am advised that there was no significant destruction of the many weapons that remain. During the Bougainville conflict, these weapons were utilised. They were retrieved from their World War II resting places and restored to working use. There is an ongoing trade in weapons in Bougainville, albeit now reduced by local pressure. But it remains an issue. The Bougainville peace process has come a long way since the Bougainville Peace Agreement was signed in 2001, but there remain issues outstanding, with groups remaining outside the peace process. These groups remain armed and, while they do so, remain a threat to peace. It is in that context that these leftover weapons assume an importance we cannot ignore. Australia still has a role to play in supporting the peace process in Bougainville. As Bougainvilleans will tell you readily, peace does not come through a peace agreement alone. It is a long process over many years. It remains fragile-and a significant contributor to that fragility is the ready access to these weapons. So how can Australia help? Initially, the best contribution would be to undertake a proper assessment of the numbers and location of these World War II weapons and to provide advice as to how they may best be collected and destroyed and then to provide the support and expertise to ensure that that advice is implemented. Australia has been a major contributor to the Bougainville peace aerial process. We have worked closely with the PNG and Bougainville governments to help bring peace to Bougainville. Removing weapons from the community is an essential component of ongoing peace. Madam Speaker, I add my congratulations on your election. Community Cabinet: Launceston",122
207,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," The 36th community cabinet was held in Launceston last week. The community cabinet is a great opportunity for people to bring their concerns directly to their federal representatives and for the government to get first hand access to community perceptions and expectations. Prime Minister Gillard and many of her ministers spent time in the state in the lead-up to the community forum engaging with communities about local and federal issues. I visited Launceston's Tas-Fab steel fabrication plant with the Minister for Innovation and Industry, the Hon. Greg Combet. We talked to Tim Peypers, their managing director, about how they are using their $300,000-plus grant from the Tasmania Innovation and Investment Fund to expand their Launceston operations and employ new staff. The Prime Minister and I were also able to visit the Benevolent Society and hear about how they were going to spend their $50,000 in federal funding, funding which will assist them in fitting out their new premises in Kings Meadows so they can continue to create positive social change in our local community. At the Launceston General Hospital, the Prime Minister officially opened the Northern Integrated Care Centre and the University of Tasmania's Launceston Clinical School. The centre will help better manage chronic and complex conditions by providing accessible, customer focused and integrated services. The Northern Integrated Care Centre also includes the University of Tasmania's Launceston Clinical School, which conducts undergraduate medical training for years 4 and 5, as well as for postgraduate and PhD students. The clinical school was developed with the support of a $3 million grant from the federal government's Capital Development Program. These facilities are proof that national health reform-and, in particular, improving primary health care for all Australians-is making a real difference in helping Australians get the high quality services that meet their needs and the needs of their families. I also visited Ravenswood Heights Primary School with the Prime Minister and Senator Jacinta Collins, the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations. The school held a forum with parents, students and teachers. They discussed with the Prime Minister how they are benefiting from funding received under the national numeracy and literacy partnerships, the national curriculum and how the school will benefit from the National Plan for School Improvement. I thank Principal Brittany Roestenberg for warmly welcoming us to her school. The community forum, which was open to the public of Northern Tasmania and which was held at Launceston College, was a great success. Local community members took the opportunity to ask the Prime Minister and cabinet members about various local and national issues, including Bass Strait freight charges, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, carbon pricing and international aid. I thank Principal Keith Wenn, along with all the students involved, for making the event a patients success. Keith pointed out some of Launceston College's many achievements and I would also like to note his personal dedication to education in Tasmania. Keith has worked for students for some 35 years in various schools throughout Tasmania. We are very lucky to have him at Launceston College. The forum was marked by a touching moment when Mr Syd Edwards read a letter he had written to the Prime Minister, expressing his admiration for her leadership. So far, more than 13,500 people have attended community cabinet meetings across the country. I am proud to be part of a government that is inclusive and allows the community to have direct access to ministers and the Prime Minister. This was open to all of the community. There were even some Liberals there-to learn. It was quite an interesting event.
