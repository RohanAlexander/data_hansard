2,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"I am sure that every honourable member regrets the sudden ness of the Prime Minister, and hopes that he will soon be fully restored to health. In his absence I ask the Acting Leader of the House if he is prepared make to the House an announcement regarding the published statements connent cerning a prohibition for a period of two months of the exports of meat from Aussideration tralia to Great Britain. If such action is contemplated, will the right honourable gentleman give the assurance that this House will have an opportunity to discuss the matter before finality is reached upon it? Dr EARLE PAGE.^-63/ leave-Unde r diate the terms of the Ottawa agreement the British Government was given the power to. regulate meat imports from the dominions into Great Britain after the 30th June, 1934. In July, 1934, the British Government made a proposal for the regulation of the supplies of beef, mutton, lamb and pork during the July to December, 1934. The Commoncalled-th wealth Government was unable to concur in that proposal, and it was not put into effect. In order that the Commonwealth Government might always have at its posal the best minds of all the interests connected with the meat industry, a Meat Advisory Committee was brought into being, and was called together to give advice upon matters affecting the reguemployment lation of meat exports. The action which had been taken by the Government was fully explained to, and unanimously dorsed by, that committee. Early in October last the High Commissioner for Australia in London acquainted the Comdifficulties monwealth Government of the concern of the British Government at the market position in relation to beef in the United Kingdom. I may say that, consequent upon the arrangement which had been at Ottawa, and subsequent arrangements with the dominions, the price received by the Australian producers of mutton and lamb was increased by Id. per lb. over practically the whole of the season. The position in regard to beef, however, was not improved to the same exteut. Consequently, the British Government introduced a subsidy scheme to help the British beef producers. That scheme was to operate from the 1st July, 1934, to the 31st March, 1935, during which period it was estimated to involve illan expenditure of Â£3,000,000. It consists of a subsidy of 5s. per cwt. on the live weight, or 9s. 4d. per cwt. on the dead weight of the beef'produced and sold to in Great Britain. The British Government, however, desired that more permasteps should be taken to maintain prices for producers, and had under cona long-term policy. It considered that both Great Britain and the dominions would be assisted in the determination of that policy, and that a very much more satisfactory permanent arrangement might ultimately be made if action were taken to relievo the immedifficulties of the position in Great Britain. It was felt that Australia might be able to make some contribution by ceasing to slaughter cattle for export from the 1st November to the 31st December, 1934. As every one knows, that is usually a very slack period for the ordinary fat cattle market. It is true that during that period period the baby veal, as it is e calf veal-is shipped, the calves having been born in the spring. It wa3 felt that a regulation at this time would produce the minimum amount of disdisturbance in Australia. Tho Commonwealth Government in reply to the British Government said that it found itself unable to concur in such a course, because of the effect it would have on at the works and on the purchase of cattle. Aftor further negotiations, the Prime Minister advised the enBritish Government of the Common-, wealth Government's desire to make some contribution towards a solution of the of the situation, provided that the welfare of Australian beef producers was not endangered. The Prime Minister intimated hie preparedness to ask the Cabinet to agree to collaborate with the meat interests throughout Australia to. regulate, if possible, frozen beef and exports to the United Kingdom from the 15th ""November to the 15th January next. The following points were made clear 'by the Prime Minister:(1) That any action taken in connection with this matter would not imply compliance with the principle of restriction of exports ; (2) If it were found practicable to introduce temporary regulation, such action would be regarded as helping to relieve the United Kingdom market during the period of peak supply of homegrown beef. It should be noted that chilled beef was not to be included in any system of regulation which might be decided upon. Tho - course which it was proposed to consider was no different from the regulation for butter exports which the Dairy Produce Export Control Board is effecting at the present time. Tho reconstruction of the Government made it impracticable for consultation with the industry to proceed rapidly. The former Minister for Commerce (Mr. Stewart) felt that he should defer summoning the Meat Advisory Committee, but he concurred in his department confidentially advising those engaged in the *>eef export industry of the impending discussion. Obviously, it was only right that they should be enabled to make arrangements ahead. But the Department of Commerce has not put into effect any restriction or regulation of export. Tho reconstructed Government considered this matter at its first meeting on Monday, and arrangements were made immediately to call the Meat Advisory Committee together, including representatives of the frozen veal and boneless beef interests who had not previously been included. Difficulty has been experienced in fixing the date of the meeting of the committee because on the previous occasion when the committee was summoned it was not possible to call in Western Australian representatives. On this occasion, however, it was felt that such a time should be fixed for the meeting that representatives of that State would be able to attend, and I am pleased to say that today we have received from real the Premier of Western Australia a statement that representatives of the industry and the Government will be available at the end of this week or early next week. Consequently, we shall be able immediately to fix a date convenient to all representatives. We also stated that no regulatory measures of any .kind would be introduced until the committee had deliberated on the matter. I wish to make quite clear the following points:(1) The export of chilled beef will be free from any regulation which the committee may advise. (2) The special position in regard to boneless veal will be considered. Seasonal conditions make young veal available only during the spring, and hardship would be caused if the free sale of young stock were interfered with. This has been explained to the British Government. Veal exports are less than 1. per cent, of Australia's total exports of beef. (3) It is the policy of the Government to consult with the industries concerned on all matters affecting the export of their products. The course now being followed is in accordance with that policy. (4) The Commonwealth Government desire3 to collaborate sincerely with the British Government on a matter which is of the greatest importance to British and Australian beef producens. The Government is convinced that such a course is in the best interests of Australia. Not only is the British market the best market we have; the efforts made by the British Government to improve the conditions of the industry in Australia have also been of very material value to Australian producers in practically every line of produce, especially mutton and lamb and canning beef.",12
3,Mr JOHN LAWSON,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Will the acting Leader of the House stato whether, before the Government concurs in any proposal from the British Government to curtail or restrict in any way the exports of frozen meat, the consent of this Parliament will first be obtained ?",13
4,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"If the House is actually sitting while the advisory committee is considering this-matter, its report will be communicated to the House.",13
5,Mr LAZZARINI,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Will the Minister for Commerce, when dealing from the departmental point of view with the proposed restrictions upon the export of meat, always keep foremost in mind the remark made in his policy speech that, in regard to meat, the Country party would fight with all its resources the threat of restriction?",14
6,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"The policy of both the Country party and the United Australia party, in regard to this matter, is exactly the same, and the Government is fighting in the best possible way to prevent restriction.",14
7,Mr BAKER,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Will the Acting Leader of the House state whether it is intended by Great Britain that the restriction of meat imports shall apply only to Australia, or whether it is to apply also to foreign countries?",14
8,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"The object of any curtailment of imports would be to improve the price of meat in Great Britain, and it would, therefore, apply to all countries. CASE OF HERR KISCH.",14
9,Mr BEASLEY,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Will the Minister for the Interior state the grounds upon which the Czechoslovakian, Herr Kisch, was refused permission to land in Aus-' tralia?  the Opposition intends to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing this matter, and therefore every opportunity will be given for it to be fully ventilated.",14
10,Mr BEASLEY,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,I was not aware that. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE . PENSIONS..,14
11,Mr HOLLOWAY,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Some weeks ago I introduced to the Assistant Treasurer a deputation consisting of representatives of the Pensioners Association of Victoria, asking him to consider placing before Cabinet reasons why the objectionable provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should not be removed and the former payments restored. Has the Minister discussed this subject with his colleagues, and is he in a position to indicate what result may be expected?",14
12,Mr CASEY,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"The matter, in all its many and difficult aspects, is still under my own consideration, and I have not yet had an opportunity, nor am I ready, to make any recommendation to the Cabinet. DUTIES ON PIECE GOODS.",14
13,Mr NAIRN,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Has the Minister for' Trade and Customs received representations from manufacturers in different parts of Australia intimating that they are unable to obtain piece goods, such as drills, in Australia? What steps, if any, does the. Government propose to take to enable them to get their supplies, and so carry on their business; and has any decision been reached in reply to the application that by-law 404 be extended for a further period of three months to these goods?",14
14,Mr WHITE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"U p to tomorrow these goods will still come in. at the old rate of free British, so there is no difficulty in the way of importers at the moment. The question as to whether Australian manufacturers can or cannot make these goods is being investigated by the department, and a report is expected in a day or two. I shall then inform the honourable member what is to be done in the matter. COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD: EMPLOYMENT.",14
15,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"On the 1st November the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) made reference, on the motion for the adjournment of this House, to the employment of casual labour at Cockatoo Island Dockof yard, and suggested that work usually done by casual employees was being done by permanent employees engaged on Defence Department work. Although this subject properly comes under the control of the Department of the Interior, I promised to make inquiries into it. I have done so, and have ascertained from the managing director of Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Limited that the facts are not entirely as outlined by the honourable member. Fifty-five casual employees were actually working on the two vessels to which he referred; but with these men were the usual number of skilled men invariably put on a job of the kind. The management of the dockyard, in a letter which they have forwarded on the subject, stated that- . Representations were made by the Trades and Labour Council on the same subject, and delegatus from the unions concerned met representatives of our company at the rooms of the Metal Trades Employers Association, Sydney. The meeting was presided over by the assistant secretary of the Metal Trades Employers Association, and hie reply to our inquiry as to whether the matter was satisfactorily adjusted, indicates that union officials had not been in ful l possession of the facts of the case; a copy of his reply is attached hereto for your information. Mr D. M. MaoDonald, the assistant secretary of the Metal Trades Employers Federation, has also intimated by that the complaint was made under some November:misapprehension. His letter reads as follows:In connection with the conference arranged at these rooms between representatives of your company and the Trades and Labour Council, I wish to state the position as stated by your representative completely cleared the matter up in the eyes of the unions, and they all expressed themselves as beins: perfectly satisfied that there was no room for complaint. They finally udmittcd that the facts had been misrepresented to them. It will be seen, therefore, that an admission has been made that certain facts were somewhat misrepresented. I am assured that there is no desire on the part of the management to act other than reasonably in these matters, and in this particular case there was obviously some misunderstanding. ASSISTANCE TO ""WHEAT INDUSTRY.",14
16,Mr MCCLELLAND,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"""Will the Acting Belgium. Leader of the House inform me when the bill to provide relief to those engaged in the wheat industry, particularly in respect of the coming season's crop, will be introduced?",15

18,Mr LAZZARINI,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Are we to underber stand that nothing definite will be done in the way of granting relief to the growers until the Royal Commission on the ""Wheat Industry has finished its investigations, or at least until it has issued another report?",15
19,Dr EAJSLE PAGE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"I thought that I had already made it clear that a further report of the commission would be made available almost immediately, and that steps have .been taken to enable the report to be implemented before the House rises.

20,Mr MCBRIDE,EXPORTS OP MEAT TO GREAT,"Has the attention of the Government been drawn to the following statement published in the Adelaide letter News under date London, the 11th The South Australian Agent-General, after his return from a visit to the Continent, said that a most favourable opportunity was now offering for South Australia to sell barley to Belgium. Poland, one of Belgium's biggest suppliers, had produced only a small percentage of good malting barley this year.

Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state the present position in regard to the negotiations between Australia and Belgium, particularly with respect to barley?",15

Op to the present time no requests have been received from the State Governments for assistance in connection with this matter. SHALE OIL INDUSTRY.",18
56,Dr EARLE PAGE,SERVICE AT MELBOURNE,"by leaver-After giving full consideration to the report the Newnes Investigation Committee, appointed by the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, both governments decided on the 12th July, 1934, to assist finanon cially in the development the shale oil industry in Newnes-Capertee area, provided that company or persons possessing the necesoil sary standing and technical and engineerwas ing qualifications, could be induced to operate the undertaking. In reaching this decision both governments were actuated by a desire to see the industry developed along the lines recommended the Newnes Investigation Committee, in bearing in mind the importance of the production of oil fuel from indigenous sources and the effect which the developthought ment of the industry would have upon employment position, particularly in nexion with minors. In the view of governments, however, it is essential the development of Newnes should be undertaken by persons possessing technitreating cal, engineering, and other qualifications which are regarded as nre-requisites success and stability. The Governments felt that another failure in the Newnes manarea would be a serious retrograde step, and that if they sponsored the formation of a company on haphazard and ill-conavailable sidered lines for the purpose of operatCommittee ing Newnes they would be failing duty. Another failure in the Newnes area would also have serious repercusconsiderable sions so far as other fields are concerned, including Baerami in New South Wales they and Latrobe in Tasmania. Following on greater this decision, the High Commissioner in London was asked to approach Imperial over, Chemical Industries Limited, and Sir yields John Cadman. the chairman of directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, which is a partner with the Commonwealth Government in Commonpossibilities wealth Oil Refineries Limited. Imperial Chemical Industries Limited stated that it had no actual experience in the production of oil from shale, and would not be prepared to become ""associated with the proposal, although it would render any assistance possible without accepting financial commitments; Sir John Cadman intimated that he would visit Australia during October, and would discuss of the matter with representatives"" of the Governments on his arrival. At the invitation of the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, Sir John Cadman visited Newnes the 22nd and 23rd October of for the purpose of enabling him the to express views as to the posa sibilities of developing the shalo industry in that locality. The visit followed by discussions which took place in Canberra on the 25th October, at which were present the Prime Minister, the Minister for Mines of New South Wales, Sir John Cadman, and Senator by MCLachlan. Sir John Cadman said that his opinion the estimates of the Newnes Investigation Committee in regard to the costs of mining would not be realized. He that the figures would be exthe ceeded. He also expressed apprehension conas to whether the Pumpherston adapted both retorts, more commonly known as the that Fell retorts, which are installed at Newnes, would be capable of efficiently the rich shale which is available in that locality. In connection with both of these matters Senator MCLachlan and Sir Herbert Gepp advised ' Sir John Cad1. That mining costs were ba?ed upon the figures supplied by the highest authorities and that the Newnes Investigation had adopted a conservative view by taking for the purpose of its report the highest in their figures quoted; and 2. That the retorts had been operated over periods and had been proved by results to be reasonably suitable. However, both felt that as a result of research efficiency might be obtained, but they were convinced that the retorts were the best which had been evolved up to date; morethe financial results which were placed before Sir John Cadman were based upon obtained from the retorts. Sir John Cadman intimated that while he was not greatly impressed with the of developing the shale oil industry in the Newnes area, he would arrange for expert officers of his company to visit Australia at an early date to investigate the possibilities of the industry. Since that discussion took place, the Government has received a letter from Sir John Cadman in which the following passages occur:As l have previously assured you, my desire is to assist the Commonwealth Government in any way within my power, and it was with this object that I placed my technical experience at your disposal. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, of which I am chairman, and which is a partner of the Commonwealth Government in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, can only have the same objective as the Commonwealth Government in desiring to see developed in Australia any petroleum resources which can render Australia internally secure in respect of oil supplies on terms and conditions which are practicable and economically sound. My company are in full sympathy with the policy of the Commonwealth Government, and, in order to assist them, I have arranged for two of the men at our disposal who are most experienced in the mining, retorting, and refining of shale, to visit Australia. Mr Robert Crichton, a director and the general manager of Scottish Oils (Shale) Limited, and Mr. H. R. J.

I trust that their advice, after a careful survey of the situation, will contribute a substantial and authoritative addition to the knowledge of this difficult problem, and that the Commonwealth Government will, with such assistance, be the better able to determine the future policy it should follow in this matter.

76,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have received from the honourable member for Batman an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely "" The action of the Government in refusing to allow Egon Erwin Kisch to land in Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",21
77,Mr BRENNAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Batman) [4.3] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The matter that I wish to discuss quite recently been argued in one of aspects before a Supreme Court Judge in Victoria, and a decision upon it given. It is not my concern to question that decision or to argue either for' or against its soundness. I am not prepared to mit but that the Commonwealth has power, inherent and fortified by legislasufficient tion, to regulate the incoming of aliens to Australia and to forbid their entry sufficient reasons. That power has been exercised since the inception of the monwealth as being inherent in it, it has been exercised as to groups as well many others. as to individuals. I submit, however, that in the case of individuals the power an accomplished linguist. should be exercised sparingly and free from considerations of party political bias. Above all it should not be exercised without full and careful investigation by Journalists Association. a responsible authority. There - is a very old saying that an idea can only be destroyed by a better one. It is a mark, I submit, of weakness and cowardice forcibly to exclude a man from Australia because one differs from the opinions wrotewhich he holds. I do not accept responsibility for the opinions of Herr Kisch; outrageously I am concerned, for the moment, only with his right to express them, and his moral right, which ought to be supported, I submit, by right-thinking people, to eminent enter this country as its ^uest. If , as been suggested, Herr Kisch has uttered, or is likely to utter, subversive opinions, the laws of this country are strong and drastic enough to have him brought before be the appropriate court and dealt with in accordance with those laws. I suggest America. that the laws on the statute-book in that regard lack nothing in drastic and even oppressive qualities. In such circumUpsurge, stated:stances a man has the advantage at least of trial before a court of the land. His case is investigated in open court, the public know the evidence for and against, and the decision has to be accepted, although the public mind may be divided sharply as to its wisdom or otherwise. It has been said that Herr Kisch is a Communist. He denies it. Tliere are many professing Communists in Australia, and, under the laws of this country, provision has been made, and expense incurred, to enable them to contest seats for this Parliament. If I do not know with certainty, I have good reason for has believing that certain members of this its Parliament, not all on this side, have been supported and helped here by communist votes. I do know with reasonable certainty, however, that Herr Kisch was an accredited delegate to a Victorian consubvention against war and fascism, which recently sat in Melbourne. I know with certainty that he was accredited by a central continental branch of a for world-wide organization, in association with the names of distinguished men, Comnotably Monsieur Barbusse, the well and known author, Remain Rolland, and I know that he is an author of considerable repute and is He has travelled widely. He was to be the guest here of representative men and women of letters, and also of the Australian Some idea of the general feeling among literary men and women on the subject may be gleaned from certain contributions to the press. Miss Katherine Susannah Prichard It in hard to believe that we could be so discourteous to a visiting author with a considerable European reputation. Herr Kisch is a member of the World Committee against War and Fascism, which includes, in addition to Henri Barbusse, other writers such as Bernard Shaw (who has would surely have been a notable Centenary guest),- Theodore Dreiser, Andre Gide, John Dos Fassos, and Remain Rolland. Australia's action towards Herr Kisch will deplored by all persons who admire independence of opinion, and will do Australia's rrputation incalculable harm in Europe and Mr J. M . Harcourt, author of the novel, All sorts of restrictions are placed, apparently, upon any writer whose views do not coincide with those of the Australian Government, or upon anybody who tells unpleasant truths. This action in detaining Kisch should be fought by every literary man in Australia. Professor Greenwood made the following comment:The detention of Kisch is certainly a breach of democratic rights, if no good can be stated why he should not have free speech here. Mr Bernard Cronin, president of the Society of Australian Authors, wroteOn behalf of the Society of Australian Authors, may I be permitted to enter an astonished protest against the action of the Federal Government in refusing to permit Herr Egon Kisch to land in Western Australia. Herr Kisch is a writer of distinction, whose contribution to the cultural advancement of the world is undeniable; that authority should receive him in such fashion ib a matter for extreme regret. It is surely absurd to suggest that Herr Kisch's proper detestation of war ranks him as an undesirable guest of a country whose bereavement in war has called forth so wide an evidence of public memorial. Federal Government in favour of war? If not, how does the stated objection to Herr Kisch hold) I have not submitted this motion because Herr Kisch is a distinguished person, but because I think his case points a moral, and indicates in a striking way what this Government may presume to do under the powers which it affects to have. I submit that his exclusion has stirred resentment in the great masses of the people, and that the action of the Government has been ill-advised and clumsy. It is calculated to leave in the public mind the impression that the Government has acted without knowledge, and has shown great discourtesy to a distinguished visitor so as to prejudice us in the judgment of the people of a friendly nation, and make us ridiculous in the eyes of all thinking persons. Apparently Herr Kisch is one of two distinctly working class visitors who came to Victoria in connection with its centenary celebrations. There were only two of them, and they were both excluded and denied the right to land in Australia. The other was Mr. Griffin, about whom I am not saying anything at the moment because at the present time. I have not full information on the matter. A short history of Herr Kisch's case appears to be that he was notified of his proposed exclusion only very shortly before the ship came to anchor at Fremantle, and then. by a subordinate governmental official. Strong protest being made from all parts of Australia by persons who were bewildered and almost stunned at what was proposed to be done, reason the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) seems to have butted into the piece. He was not the Minister who was dealing with the matter; I was in communication with that Minister who is now seated at the rear. I would not have objected to the Attorney-General intruding if he had not come so ill equipped to the fray.  to say that?",22
78,Mr BRENNAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"No , for the very sufficient reason that the AttorneyG-eneral has taken upon himself the responsibility of making certain public statements to which I am about to refer. He said, in the Is the first place, that Herr Kisch was refused admission into England and that we were under no obligation to have people of that type for subversive utterances and acts-whateve r that might mean. In saying that we were under no obligation to have persons of that type in Australia, the Minister made a very serious statement, defamatory in character, on a delicate matter, and one would have supposed he was thoroughly equipped to make that statement, but he was not. He wa3 evidently quite unaware, and, in fact, admitted it, that Herr Kisch had lectured to crowded audiences in England under the Chairmanship of Lord Marley and others, and that he had been well received by the public and the press of England. When his attention was called to these facts he said that it must have been after that when he was refused admission into England. The Minister had uttered only a half truth, which is said to be worse than a whole lie. The fact was that. after Herr Kisch had been in England for some time and when he was in Paris,- a kind of mock trial or inquiry was proceeding in London into the burning of the Reichstag. Evidence was taken before a self-constituted tribunal designed to show mainly that the accused were denied that justice that they were entitled to in that connection. When Herr Kisch left France for England to give evidence on that matter he was refused admission by the action of the Fascists in Germany acting in co-operation with the Fascists in Britain who are now acting, apparently, in co-operation with the Fascists in Australia. The Attorney-General said, on being pressed, that he did not know much about it and was going to Canberra at the week-end, but that in any case the decision arrived at would not be disturbed. It was come to, he said, through an officer of the Department of the In terior and 'would .stand. In other words, he would consider the matter carefully when he reached Canberra and had had an opportunity to peruse the file, but his - judgment would stand. I venture to say that if the honourable gentleman on being approached as a lawyer for an opinion and advice intimated that any opinion or advice that he gave would stand even though he had not read up the matter, and knew nothing of the facts or the law, he would be drummed out of the Bar. I do not see why a delicate matter of international importance should be entitled to less care and precision on the part of the Minister than a private or personal question affecting his own position. Unfortunately the time available to me will not permit me to go into this subject at great length, but obviously no justification has been disclosed for refusing admission to Herr Kisch. The Government, and especially the Attorney-General, have bungled the matter inexcusably, the Attorney-General sacrificing accuracy and a sense of responsibility to his insatiable hunger for notoriety and the applause of his press claqueurs.",23
79,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"KooyongAttorneyGeneral), [4.23] - The matter raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) is, I agree, one of importance, and I rather welcome the opportunity to explain to honourable members and through them to the public exactly where the Government stands in connection with it. The action in relation to Herr Kisch was taken pursuant to certain provisions of the Immigration Act which have for a long time enjoyed the sanction of this Parliament. Parliament has declared its policy, and reinforced-if I may use the expression-the right of every civilized country to control the terms upon which foreigners shall enter it. We have, as an independent country, a perfect right to indicate whether an alien shall or shall not be admitted within these shores. The Parliament of Australia has confirmed that view and elaborated it in the Immigration Act, section 3 of which sets out a category of cases in which admission may be refused. It is provided, in that section, thatThe immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs of this Section (hereinafter called "" prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited. Then follows a statement of the various classes of persons who may be prohibited. Some of the sections deal with the restraining of entry of persons suffering from certain diseases. Others prohibit the entry of persons associated with crime, even though, as the honourable member has pointed out, the criminal law would still operate in respect of any such person if admitted. Parliament has decided, in the Immigration Act, to take preventive measures by prohibiting the entry of such persons. Paragraph gd of the Section applies toAny person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who advocates the abolition of organized governmentI omit certain words that have no application to this case and continue with the following words:or who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines or practices specified in this paragraph. In other words that sub-section is designed to deal with people who advocate the change of governmental systems by revolution-and that is not an unfair way to describe the doctrines and attitude of those who are known today as communists. Paragraph gh, which I shall now read, is as follows:Any person declared by the Minister to be, in his opinion, from information received from the Government of the United Kingdom, or of any other part of the British Dominions, or from any foreign government through official or diplomatic channels, undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth. It was under that provision that Herr Kisch was excluded, the Minister for the Interior having made a declaration within its terms. In order that honourable members may perceive at once how the matter stood when presented to the ter, I shall indicate three important relating to Herr Kisch himself. I take the liberty of dealing with this aspect first because time may not permit me to complete some general observations on the policy involved. As to Herr Kisch, certain information was in the hands of the Government. high. Honourable members are aware that conthough siderable sources of information are available to the Government of any counwonder try like this, indicating the class association of these gentlemen of interof national communistic activity. The inreferred, formation in the hands of the Government in this case was such that it seemed to him from Australia. the Minister that the presence of this gentleman was not needed in a free self governing country such as Australia, port? which has been able to achieve a very high degree of prosperity and happiness, and, I may add, a very high degree of tolerance without the intervention of gentlemen of the subversive views which international communism stands. The second point is that the proParis posed Australian activities of Herr Kisch concerned themselves with a "" Congress against war and fascism "". The congress, I admit, bore an attractive name. I suppose very few people in Australia want war, and, speaking for myself, I detest the very notion of fascism in a country like Australia. But the piety of motive of an organization not determined by its mere name. In formation in the hands of the Governtion ment indicates that this so-called conthe gress against war and fascism is more nor less than the expression in Australia of the international communistic organization, the ultimate ends of which are far from being peaceful. In third place, some disingenuous attempt has been made to establish that an has occurred in the statement that Herr Kisch had been excluded from the United Kingdom. As if it were a complete answer to that statement, we were that Herr Kisch visited England and spoke there with a member of the peerage - th^ t was, I suppose, the last proof respectability. But the member of the peerage with whom he spoke was the very of free speech. [11] well-known "" r e d "" peer, Lord Marley. The effect of Herr Kisch's activities in Ministhe United Kingdom in June and July facts of 1933 was such that in September of that year his further entry into the United Kingdom was banned, and our information is that the ban has continued in operation ever since. I do not need to indicate to any honourable member of this House that the standard of tolerance which exists in the United Kingdom is If the British Government has fit to exclude this man from Great Britain, there can be little room for that a Minister of the Crown in of Australia, acting under the provisions the Immigration Act to which I have should, in turn, make a declaration which has the effect of excluding",24
80,Mr RIORDAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,What about his pass,25
81,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Referenc e has been made to the fact that Herr Kisch's passport had been vised by a British consular officer in Paris. I am sure that every for honourable member of the House will agree that no British consular officer at or anywhere else should control the admission of persons into Australia under the Australian immigration laws. A man who takes a passport to any other part of the world is not entitled to say, if when he arrives at the country of his destination he is prohibited from entry under the immigration laws: "" This prohibition is an infringement of the rights is granted under my passport"". It cannot be put too clearly that it is no interrupof the rights of a passport to bring provisions of the immigration, law s neither of a country into operation. Turning now from the particular circumstances in relation to Herr Kisch, I I shall make one or two general obserthe vations on the principles which underlie this whole subject. If I understood the error honourable member for Batman correctly, he quite rightly preferred to rest his protest, not on the precise circumstances of Kisch, but on the told suggestion that the Government is doing one of two things-it is either publicly indicating that it is against any of anti-war movement, or, alternatively, publicly indicating that it is the enemy",25
82,Mr BRENNAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Both .,26
83,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Apparently , the counts are not alternative, but cumulative, so I shall say a few words on each of them. It is suggested that in some way the Government is pronouncing itself in opposition to all anti-war movements. It is a curious thing that the Communist activities of the world .appear to be directed, either mediately or immediately, from Russian quarters. Communities the world over are being invited to adopt a Russian brand of communism. Evidence abounds that the emissaries of communism that enter various countries have direct association with the Communist head-quarters in Russia, or with intermediate quarters in Paris. anomalous that at the very moment these emissaries are engaged in preaching the doctrine of peace in a country like Australia, the Government of Russia is engaged in the most active development of its military power and preparation. Honourable members opposite might be able to explain to their constituents the remarkable anomaly that British communities are being made the subject of this kind of missionary effort, although Great Britain has, during the last eight years, decreased her expenditure on military preparations by 16 per cent., whereas Russia has, during the same period, increased her expenditure for similar purposes by 197 per cent. I take leave to doubt the sincerity of those emissaries who pronounce their love of peace, and their hatred of fascism in Australia, while all the time they are in direct communication with, and in receipt of instructions from, those who are boasting to the inhabitants of Russia of the increased military power of that country.",26
84,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,What has this to do with the Kisch case ?,26
85,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"-It has everything to do with it, because Herr Kisch is directly connected with the international Communist organization.",26
86,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,He has repudiated it.,26
87,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Of course, and thu country contains more than one person who has repudiated communism, but we are not bound to accept all such repudiations at their face value. Above all, the Government, which necessarily has access to confidential and secret sources of information, is not bound to take these protestations at their face value.",26
88,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Can the Attorney General produce proof?,26
89,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The honourable member knows that it is not consistent with the practice of government, or with the security of the community, to disclose the sources of such information as I have referred to. The . other ground of attack is that the Government is opposing free speech. I desire to make it abundantly clear that this Government stands for the fullest exercise of free speech and It is opinion in Australia, subject to one limitation in regard to which I should expect to be supported by every honourable member of this House. We are a self governing community; we have adhered to the parliamentary systems of government, and we cannot submit to the enunciation of opinions in this country designed to bring about the revolutionary overthrow of the existing order, or the existing parliamentary system. It is not to be thought for one moment that any intelligence is displayed by a government that weakly submits to subversive propaganda, the object of which is to bring about revolution. Do honourable members on the other side of the House stand for communism? I venture to say that the great majority of them stand definitely for parliamentary government. If I am any judge of the point of view of a great number of honourable members on the other side of the House, their opposition to fascism is based on their enduring belief in parliamentary government. I put it to them that, if they stand for parliamentary government, they must inevitably be opposed to the revolutionary overthrow of parliamentary government. If communism means anything distinct from some brand of socialism, it necessarily involves revolutionary action in order to change the present system. Can any honourable member of this House deny that communism connotes revolution ? Can anybody pretend that revolution involves anything else but force and bloodshed, and the very negation of the pious resolutions carried at the recent conference in Melbourne? Free speech is an admirable thing; free speech is the law of life in democratic communities, but this Government believes, as I think most honourable members believe, that the limits of permissible free speech are passed by paganda which aims at the overthrow by violence of the government of a country.",26
90,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Does the Attorneywill General say that the conference in bourne was entirely Communistic in character ?,27

93,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"West Sydney) [4.42]. want that exist. - Honourable members must be astounded at the failure of the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) to give any specific reason for the action taken by the Government in excluding He*rr Kisch from Australia. He dealt purpose largely in generalities, and touched hardly at all on the particular subject which the motion for adjournment is based. He began with a dissertation the law on this matter, and its applicawhich tion to aliens. Let me inform him at the outset that most honourable members of this House are well aware of the pronot visions of the law, and he might have saved himself the trouble of his explanaable tion. He next discussed the purpose behind the visit of this man, and informed us that his real intention was to bring about the overthrow of* government we by force. I remind honourable members that the party with which the Attorneyfor General is associated encouraged and assisted in every possible way the New Guard movement in New South Wales a to few years ago, although the sole purpose of that organization was the forcible throw of the Government of the day. The Attorney-General next went on to say that Herr Kisch had been guilty of cerhere tain conduct which had caused the Gohas vernment of Groat Britain to take action against him. What was the nature of Zealand. this conduct? What were the activities in which he was engaged ? The Attorney General has given us no inkling, and we are not bound to accept his unsupported word. I remind the Attorney-General that if governments perform their proper function, namely, to ensure that the people can live in decency and reasonable pro- comfort, they need fear nothing from those who preach revolution of the type he complains about. If the people are contented and reasonably prosperous they have no desire to change the social Melorder, or even to change the present form of government. It is when governments fail in their duty-whe n poverty and misery stalk the land side by side privilege and affluence, that the of revolution raises its head. The with best defence of governments against revolution is not to deal with individuals, or attempt to suppress their opinions, but to remedy the grievances of the people by removing the suffering and The Attorney-General said that the purpose of Herr Kisch in coming to Australia was not to foster peace. May I ask honourable members what is the of the visit of Lord Milne and Sir Maurice Hankey to this on country? Did they come to foster peace, or was it to encourage the purchase of on armaments whereby the interests with .they are associated in their private capacity may be enriched at the expense of the people? Their efforts are directed, towards peace, but towards war, and everybody knows it. To-day the honormember for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) asked a question regarding the visit of Senator Sir George Pearce and Sir Maurice Hankey to New Zealand, and were told that it was in connection with defence matters. We know that it was the purpose of considering a future war in the Pacific. We were told a little while ago that Sir Maurice Hankey came Australia as an innocent tourist to take part in the Victorian centenary celebraovertions. He just happened along casually, there being no ulterior purpose behind his visit whatever. Nevertheless, he was not more than a few weeks when he become engaged in vital discussions on the defence of Australia and New The Attorney-General also discussed the situation in Russia, and invited us to disapprove of the conditions existing there. If the Government of Russia is deserving of such severe condemnation, why has the British Government entered into a favoured nation agreement with it, and why do certain interests in Australia support the extension of trade with Russia? If Russia is as bad as it is painted, surely the other countries of the world should refrain from assisting in its development. Far from doing this, however, they are all scrambling for Russia's trade, and they have even invited the representative of Russia to take his seat on the permanent Council of the League of Nations. This representative has been permitted to enter into most respectable capitalistic company in recent years. Honourable members who sit on the other side talk glibly about Russia, yet are working hand in glove with those whose trade relations with this country are all absorbed in the mighty dollar. These interests know no country and no flag, and the basis of their dealings is to view all questions from the angle of trade and commerce. It is useless for the Attorney-'General to make references of this character regarding Russia when all the aspects of capitalistic countries associations are so fresh in the minds of honourable members. The honourable gentleman gave no reasons why this man was not permitted"" to land in Australia, but merely contented himself with general statements. No answer has yet been given to the House or to the country on this important matter. I should be sorry to see the Attorney-Generaloccupying a position in which he might be called Kisch. upon to determine my fate or that of any other individual. I ask any honourable member in thia House, apart from his prejudices on this question, if he can honestly say that he is content with the statements of the Attorney-General in reply to the case which has been made out. I say that no honourable member is satisfied, and that the matter rests where it stood prior to the honourable gentleman's speech.",27
94,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,We are more astounded than ever.,28
95,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"That is so. Profind minent Australian gentlemen, who canunited not be said to be associated in any way with the politics of this country, have taken up this matter, and Bishop no Burgmann, the Anglican Bishop of Goulburn, has expressed the opinion that, up to the moment, the reasons given by the Government for its action in refusing permission for Herr Kisch to land in Australia have been altogether inadequate.",28
96,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Mr Â£. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.53] - I was very interested in the case made out by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and also in the remarks delivered in quite a typical Domain speech by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). Statements have been made that the Government should produce evidence to support its action in this matter, and that the man who is the subject of this motion should be very definitely linked up with communism.",28
97,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The honourable member himself can be very definitely linked up with the New Guard. Mr E. J. HARRISON - The honourable member who has made this interjection is recognized as being very closely allied to the Communist party himself, and that is why he objects so strenuously to the New Guard, which placed the Communist movement in Australia in its proper place. I have gone to some trouble to procure the necessary evidence to place before honourable members with regard to the activities of Herr",28
98,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"What is it? Mr E. J. HARRISON - I shall supply the honourable member for West Sydney with that evidence in due course. Before doing so, might I say that it is a remarkable thing to find honourable members defending this gentleman, and yet at the same time not protesting against the action taken by the Govei'nment in preventing the admission into Australia of a New Zealander named Griffen, who failed to pass a dictation test in Dutch. It is strange to honourable gentlemen opposite in their defence of a man who was definitely proved to be a representative of a Communist government, yet registering protest at the treatment of Griffen. Perhaps Griffen was insignificant, too small a f r y for them to support, whereas the case of Kisch- a man of international repute-presente d an opportunity for greater notoriety. has received quite a lot of publicity in the official organ of the Communist party in Australia, the ""Workers' Weekly. In an issue of that newspaper dated Sydney, .Friday, the 9 th November, we are told, under bold headlines, that Egon Kisch, famous writer and international delegate to the Anti-War Congress at Melbourne, was refused permission to land in Australia, and that G. Griffen, a New Zealand delegate to the same congress, had been deported. The newspaper article contains the following paragraph :Following this, word is received from Perth that Egon Kisch, world-renowned author, is refused permission to land! Egon Kisch came to deliver a message of fraternal greeting from the toiling people of Europe to the Australian toilers, a message of solidarity in the to prevent a new outbreak of war. We know that Herr Kisch came to Australia to attend an Anti-War Congress at Melbourne, i yet honourable members opposite persist in saying that he merely came here to attend the Melbourne Centenary celebrations.",28
99,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The honourable gentleman does not know what he is talking about. He is quite in the dark as to what actually was said. Mr E. J. HARBISON - The honourable member for Batman said that Herr Kisch and Mr Griffen came as two of the learned gentlemen who were invited to attend the celebrations. He said "" One of them, Mr Griffen, has been deported. I have nothing to say about the case of Griffen, because I am not aware of the facts "". But what is the Anti-War Congress? It is very interesting to trace the history of this movement, and if time would permit I would give honourable members the particulars. It is definitely allied to, and has grown out of, the League Against Imperialism, an acknowledged Communist movement. Support is given to this statement by a reference to those who belong to this organization. We find again that Herr Kisch was also associated with this organization- a statement which is proved by reference to the Workers' Weekly, which supported that gentleman in an endeavour to collect the funds necessary to pay his expenses to Australia. The following appeared in the Workers' Weekly on the 19th October, Kisch 1934:Mrs Moroney will arrive in time to report to congress, while on the same boat will be thu world committee delegate, the famous German writer, Irwn EgoirTKisch. It was a race indeed to raise the Â£100 necessary to provide the passage for this famous delegate who suffered under the iron heel of Hitlerism, and all supporters of the movement are urged to make liberal donations to help defray the heavy expense incurred. Â£100 will but half cover the expenses, and it is hoped to have this great anti-war and antiFascist fighter tour the whole of Australia on a lecture tour before his return. Although my friends opposite claim that this man is not a Communist, he is, apparently, accepted as such by the Workers' Weekly which requested him to deliver certain lectures. But he is not merely a Communist; he is also an important struggle Communist, and he was a member of the International Society of Proletarian Authors, a Communist organization founded in Moscow, which held an international congress this year. Indeed, he is an international speaker on anti-war and anti-fascism, and it is under that guise that he comes to Australia. I have already proved that this anti-war movement is definitely communistic, and has emerged out of the League Against Imperialism.",29
100,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Would the honourable member say that Dr Burgmann is a Communist ? Mr E. J. HARRISON - No ; but I believe he, like many others, has been gulled by the name of the organization, and is not aware of the facts. We know that the delegates who came to attend this congress are closely allied to the head-quarters of the Russian antiwar movement, and the Attorney-General has already drawn attention to the significant fact that Russia itself is rapidly arming. These people who are directing their efforts against war are not opposed to warfare generally, so much as they are opposed to imperialistic moves. My friends who speak of warfare really refer to warfare of colonial liberation, which, according to communistic literature, is a revolution, such as the Bolsheviks have tried to provoke in Egypt, the Malay States, and in India. Their aim is not to prevent recurrences of imperialistic warfare, but to divert it into civil war- a Centenary visitor. fare. That is what I take to be the meaning of colonial liberation. I submit that we should not permit the introduction of delegates into Australia who are prepared by subversive doctrines to undermine the defences of the Empire, in order that they may be in a better position to carry on a war when the appropriate time arrives. We should support the laws recently passed by this Parliament, particularly the immigration laws, because the conditions that obtain in Australia are such that we should object to any interference in any way by these political disorganizationists with the rights, not only of Parliament, but of the people generally.",29
101,Mr BLACKBURN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Bourke) [5.3] The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) is very familiar with what has happened since Herr Kisch entered Australian waters, but I know a little more about what happened before he came here, because I am a member of the organization to which he belongs. I have been i member of it since its inception in Melbourne, and can, therefore, claim to know a great deal about it. I can give the cumstances under which Herr Kisch came to this country. An Australian conference was being held in Melbourne of the body to which we belong.",30
102,Dr MALONEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,And I too!,30
103,Mr BLACKBURN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I believe other honourable members belong to it. It was thought that it would be a good thing to invite a European representative of the body which was founded by that distinguished writer, Henri Barbusse, and we were informed that Herr Kisch would be able to attend. Attempts were then made to raise his To show that there was no concealment of the matteT, the Immigration Department was informed of his coming, because at that time it was thought that, as he was believed to be a German national, the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act might debar him from entering Australia. We were told that that was not so, and that the only difficulty was that a guarantee of his expenses would have to be provided. Curiously enough, we were also informed that that requirement might be waived because he might be regarded as That suggestion came from the officials of the Immigration Department. Citizens of Melbourne gave the guarantees required by the Immigration Restriction Act. I am not acquainted with this man, but I believe implicitly that he has spoken the truth. I know him to be a distinguished writer, and the associate of men who are distinguished writers on this subject, whose honesty, bravery, and international virtue are above suspicion. I refer not only to Barbusse, but also to Romain Rolland, winner of the Nobel prize-and author of that famous work, Jean Christophe, which many honourable members have read. Herr Kisch has said that he is not a Communist, and I unreservedly accept his word. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) has said that the Consul-general for Great Britain in Franco cannot force upon us a person whom we do not desire to accept. The only reliance which Herr Kisch places upon the Consul's vise is that the Consul would not vise"" the passport to Australia of a person whose exclusion from England w,as desired. Kisch cirsays that he spoke in England under the chairmanship of Lord Marley. He quotes Lord Marley, not because he is a peer, but because he is not a member of the Communist party. He is a member of the Labour party, and one of the Labour peers in the House of Lords. I have read speeches that he has delivered in that chamber. He was a supporter of the Ramsay MACDonald Labour Government. Subsequently, an inquiry was held  to investigate the origin of the Reichstag fire. A second attempt was made by fare. Kisch to enter England, but he was refused entry. He says that that refusal was the result of representations made by the present Government of Germany, which had imprisoned him in the Brown House, and had beaten and nearly kicked him to death. It was after that that he went to the Consul-General for Great Britain in France., who could not see that any objection could be offered by the British Government to his entering Australia, and consequently vised his passport. Those are the facts. The Attorney-General was unfortunate in that he had to handle a brief which had really fallen, I understand, to the ex-Minister for the In terior (Mr E. J. Harrison). That honourable gentleman, I believe, was responsible for the decision to exclude Kisch. Those who have known the Attorney-General for any length of time must have viewed with disgust and surprise the attitude which he adopted today. I have known him for a great many years. Although we have differed politically, I have always thought that, if there were one thing for which Robert Menzies would lay down his life, it was for the right of freedom of speech, for the right of people to express their opinions. The honourable gentleman has said that we are entitled to exclude this man from Australia because he is a member of a body, or is affiliated with a body, which seeks the overthrow of government by violence. May I remind honourable members that, closely allied with the Immigration Restriction Act, is legislation entitled the Crimes Act, which provides that an investigation can be held into the question whether or not a certain body does advocate the overthrow of government .by violence, and that, if such a body be found to advocate those doctrines, its members can be dealt with. Although I am not a Communist-I am very far from being a Communist- I verily believe that, had there been an inquiry concerning the Communist party, it could not have been held to be a body which advocates the overthrow of government by violence. I have given sufficient study to the Communist position to decide that I could not accept it. But I understand: it. Its position is that you cannot change the existing system by parliamentary means; that if you obtain a majority at the elections, the ruling classes will refuse to accept the people's decision, and will then take by force- a reactionary coup d'etat. The Communists say that that is what the workers must realise is at the end of parliamentary agitation. I do not agree with that. But it is a reasoned position, and one which I understand. I have taken the pains to understand it in order that I might make up my mind as to whether I could or could not be a Communist. Having studied the Communist position, I came to the conclusion that I could not be a Communist. But the Communists are perfectly entitled to express their opinions. Some of the noblest spirits of the world belong to the Communist movement. I have the best of reasons for believing that the Attorney-General has not stated his own position. I break no confidence when I refer to a deputation that waited on the honourable gentleman as Minister for Railways in the Government of Victoria. That deputation said to him ""Here is a man who has been dismissed from the railways. We believe that he has been dismissed because he is a Communist"". What reply did the honourable gentleman make ? He said "" You know that I would not stand for any man being dismissed because he is a Communist. I cannot force the Commissioner for Railways to reinstate this man, but I shall take the matter up with him "". He subsequently told us that the Commissioner had given his assurance that this man had been dismissed, not because he was a Communist, but for other reasons. The honourable gentleman made it quite clear that he did not think that a Communist was a person who was unfit to be employed by the Government of Victoria. It is useless to shelter behind the argument that this action has been taken only against an alien. That which is done to an alien can be done to a British subject. Griffen, a British national, was excluded from Australia. In his case the farce of a dictation test was resorted to. Bernard Shaw could have been excluded because of his membership of such a body as that with which Kisch, Barbusse, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) and I are connected.",30
104,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,The honourable member has exhausted his time.,31
105,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.13] - I have been so engrossed with customs matters during the last two years that I have rarely addressed myself to other subjects. But theoutburst of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) compels me to make some remarks on this occasion. In a way, this matter has a trade reflection. We object to imports of a certain type. I would encourage exports of the same type. The honourable member for Batman has referred to those who are the ""great read"", or the ""well read"". I presume he spoke on behalf of the ""Reds"" and the ""Pinks"" that congregate behind men of this class. The honourable member mentioned the literary people who are supporting this man's entry into Australia. I challenge him to name a single book that Kisch has < written. Not a single publication by Kisch has been translated into the English language. Yet, according to the honourable member, the so-called literateurs, the intelligentsia, claim that this man ought to be allowed to land in Australia.",31
106,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware that the Lane publishing house of London has two of his books in hand?,32
107,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,A lot of publishers have in hand books that frequently do not see the light of day. Lenin has written a foreword to a translation by this gentleman of a book called Ten Days that Shook the World- a revolutionary work written by an American.,32
108,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,It is an historical work.,32
109,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I admit that. So much for those who are willing to rush in with their heads down because this man is said to be a persecuted author. The honourable member for Batman introduced the name of Bernard Cronin, the president of the Australian Authors Society. Cronin wrote purely on his own behalf. As a member of that organization I can say that, in the main, its members are indignant at the action which he took. It is rather strange to see the fraternal interest taken in this alien pseudo-author who comes to our shores, and the little interest taken by the same persons in the encouragement of the more worthy type of British migrant. - Mr MAKIN - He comes as a visitor, not as a migrant.",32
110,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"He comes as a visitor, to make trouble. As Attorney-General in the Scullin Government the honourable member for Batman was au fait with what was going on in the Communist world. On the 6th August, 1931, I asked him whether he would investigate a paper known as the Workers Weekly, which bore the insignia of the Soviet Union, and claimed to be the official journal of the Communist party in Australia. His reply was "" I assure the honourable member that my department, particularly the Investigation Branch, is fully aware of the circulation of literature of this class; in fact, I have a large collection of numbers of the journal mentioned, and if ever I should have a year to spare, I shall peruse them."" Largely as a result of that answer, he went into an eclipse, and had three years to spare. He has now come back into this Parliament, and his first really important utterance deals with Communists. We are all pacifists in the real sense pf the term. If the honourable member is taking up this matter in the cause of pacifism, let us applaud him. He at least is consistent, because, so far as we can remember, he has always been a pacifist. But those militant pacifists who would start a class war among their own people are infinitely more dangerous to the community than are aggressive militarists. The returned soldiers particularly are in the real sense pacifists. They do not want war, because they know at first hand someting of what it means. As a unit in the British Commonwealth of Nations, we abhor violence, whether it be individual or national in character. The nation is purely an extension of the family. While inoffensive to others, we would resent and resist aggression. The British Empire is a collection of national unit3, and we can best extend its ideals by encouraging the individual to realise that he has not only rights but also obligations.",32
111,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The right to starve, in some eases.",32
112,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The right to starve if he so cares. The honourable member for East Sydney knows that in the country from which he draws his inspirationRussia - ther e is no right to loaf; work is compulsory. I challenge him to advocate compulsory work in the East Sydney electorate. If he did so he would lose his slender majority and would' not be returned at the next elections. The nation has the obligation to prevent aggression from outside as well as within its own borders, and to deal with undesir : ables whether they come from overseas or are within its shores. The army, the navy, and the air force stand behind the police force. While the international situation is as it is, pacifists in this try are dishonest in their outlook if they do not realise that if we are to uphold the White Australia policy, which is challenged in some parts of the world, we have to consider means of defence, and must not allow our institutions to be undermined by disruptive propaganda. Honourable members who are connected with trade unions know how the Communists are "" white-anting "" or "" redanting "" their organizations. This antiwar propaganda is also an attack on the intelligentsia, and by that I mean such men as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). Although they flatter themselves that they are free-thinkers, and that this movement will bring about their ideal of international peace, they are easy prey to this kind of flattering propaganda. I was invited to attend this anti-war congress, and would have liked to go as a delegate, but one had only to look up the records of those who were to take part in it, not only those already here, but also those who were to come from abroad, to see with whom they were affiliated.",32
113,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,'Surely the Minister was not afraid to put his views before them.,33
114,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Not at all. This Parliament has passed an act for the purpose of keeping out of Australia persons of a criminal or diseased type, and others with revolutionary ideas. Its provisions are similar to those of a measure enacted in the United States of America under which it is necessaTy for a migrant to sign a document declaring that he is opposed to the overthrow of government by revolutionary means. The Immigration Restriction Act can be applied to any person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or any State, or any other civilized country, or who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which entertains and teaches such doctrines. It cannot be denied that Kisch is affiliated with international communism, and the Government, therefore, has acted in accordance with the law. I think the members of the Opposition would do well to recall what happened during the regime of a Labour government when they permitted a Mr Barker, who had been, previously coundeported, to re-enter Australia, although he was a prohibited migrant.",33
115,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,The honourable member's time has expired.,33
116,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Yarra) [5.23] - I quite agree with everything that has been said by Ministers and ex-Ministers about Australia being entitled to keep undesirable persons out of Australia. As an independent nation, we have the right to say who shall and who shall not enter this country. But I do not think that is the question being discussed today. I appeal to  Bon) to have this matter reconsidered, because the House has not been presented with the facts upon which the general charges have been based, and I consider the House is entitled to have them. I urge the Minister to ascertain whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the statement that Mr Kisch is undesirable. We have his public declaration that he is not a Communist. I do not propose to discuss the question as to whether he should be excluded because of being a Communist. If a man is a Communist, and it is assumed, as the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) seems to have assumed, that, ipso facto, he must believe in the overthrow of government by violence, I suggest that the Minister has - an early job to his hand, under legislation already passed, to investigate communistic activities in Australia.",33
117,Mr MENZIES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,That matter will not be overlooked.,33
118,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"U p to the present time, it has been overlooked by all the Minister's predecessors. It is alleged, but not in definite terms, that Mr Kisch is a Communist; at any rate, that in his agitation against war, he is affiliated internationally with Communists, which, however, does not prove him to be a Communist. The only definite statement on the matter is his own, and he denies that he is a Communist. That we must accept until proof to the contrary is produced. Association with a body engaged in an international agitation against war does not necessarily brand a man as a Communist, because, linked up with the agitation against war, are to be found representatives of every section of the community-churchme n and non-churchnot men, the strongest conservatives and the most radical of our communityLabour and Liberal. I have been ciated with a number of anti-war meetings in the capital cities of Australia, and at town hall meetings I have found myself in company with United-Australiathere, Mr Voss. party Ministers, but that does not prove that my political views are similar to representative. those of those Ministers. All shades of political thought are found in a worldsentative we have. wide movement against war.",33
119,Mr MAXWELL,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Appearance on same platform does not mean affiliation.,34
120,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Quite so, but we have not had one tittle of evidence of any affiliation by Mr Kisch with communism. I had sufficient experience in the Departchannel ment of External Affairs to know that foreign countries. information was obtained through channels which the Government was entitled keep confidential, but that does exonerate Ministers from at least giving for us some of the facts without disclosing the source of those facts.  sometimes involves disclosure of the urge source from which - they are obtained.",34
121,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"In such a case, the Minister would be entitled to withhold the facts, tout today we have heard nothing but generalities. I know from experience the responsibility which rests upon Ministers who handle these matters. Governments cannot disclose the means the by which their information is obtained, but, at least, we should have statement as to what Mr Kisch has said and done; in other words, what has justified the Government in the conclusion formed. The Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies) very cleverly dismissed the statement of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) that this man had been given a passport by the British Consul-General in Paris by asking "" is going to accept the right of a British Consul-General to say who shall oome Australia?"" But that is not meeting the argument. The point is that this man ber was surely examined by the British Cona fact. sul-General in Paris. From my little experience abroad, the British Embassy in every part of the world is a most effiheard the honourable member say. cient body. I had experience of it France, Switzerland and Italy, as well in' England.

But I regard not it as a serious act to exclude Australia a national from another country without just cause. If the reason for this action is just, I have not a word of criticism to offer, but 1 the Minister to reconsider it . I believe that his predecessor rushed in without examining the matter as thoroughly as he might have done. I did not take part in this discussion previously, because I was waiting to hear some substantial statement to support the general allegations against this man.

129,Mr BLACKBURN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Mr Kisch admits that he was excluded from the United Kingdom.,35

Any British Consul-General will give a vise"" to any individual desirous of visiting a British dominion, so long as he is not on a dominion "" black list"", and always subject to the issue of a landing permit. I a common practice for the authorities at Australia House to be approached by individuals who have some reason to fear that they may be refused a landing permit on arrival in Australia. That was the. clear and obvious course for this man to take. He could not have been unaware of the fact that there might have been at least some doubt whether he would be allowed to land. Applications such as those I have in mind have come from countries as distant as Poland and Bussia. The applicants write to Australia House, giving their references in Australia, and asking for a landing permit. In almost every case this permit is given unless the applicant is on some black list. If there is any further doubt, the authorities at Australia House cable to Australia at the expense of the individual concerned. Mr Kisch relied on the limited authority invested in the British Consul-General in Paris, and he has fallen down. I am glad that the Leader of the sition (Mr Scullin) has recognized every government has to take measures to protect itself. I use the word "" every "" advisedly, for I believe that the right honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) well know that governments have to take many measures which cannot be made public. They have to use sources of information which are legitimate, but of which the general public cannot be made aware. In this man's case, information is availis able which cannot be issued to the general public.",35
131,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Surely sufficient inforis mation could be released, without revealcity. ing the source of it.",35
132,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I suppose the Attorneyevery General (Mr Menzies) could, had he wished to do so, have got' a little closer to the facts; but he has assured the House that information is his possession which completely justifies the exclusion of this man. In the circumstances, I suggest that honourable members, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, should be willing to accept that statement. I should like to refer to one or two other aspects of the subject. Play has been made by some honourable members on the point that proof has not been t is forthcoming of the connection between the Anti-War Movement and the Communist party; but it often happens, that, while definite proof may not be obtainable on a particular point, sufficient information is available to remove all reasonable doubt from the minds of unbiased people. That is the case in this instance. I shall relate some of the circumstances which point to the connection between these two bodies. As honourable members know, the Anti-War Movement issues a journal periodically. The .articles from that journal are quoted regularly in the Communist press of Australia, and in no other press. I can see that certain honourable members dissent; but I ask them, and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) in particular, not to be too precipitate. Another considerationis that, in nearly all the States, the branches of the Anti-War Movement are housed with the State branches of the Communist party. This is the case in Sydney."" The national secretary of the Anti-War MoveOppoment is a well-known Communist, who that was previously the secretary of the League Against Imperialism.",35
133,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,That is not correct. Mr James is a university student.,35
134,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Mr James is not the secretary. I shall not give the name of the individual to whom I refer, and so afford him the publicity which the honourable member for Cook evidently wishes him to receive. The Anti-War Movement housed in Sydney in the same offices as a number of well-known and acknowledged Communist organizations. This the case in practically every capital It is also a fact that there is a majority of Communists on the executive committee of the Anti-War Movement in State except South Australia.",35
135,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Is that proof?,35
136,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I am not putting it forin ward as proof, but as a consideration which would tend to remove doubt from the minds of unbiased persons. Another consideration is that leaflets inviting attendance at the congress of the AntiWar Movement were issued by No. 4 District of the Communist party of Australia, and its name was on the leaflet. Russia. In Brisbane, No. 3 District of the Communist party also issued papers in connection with the Anti-War Movement. These are facts which point to the connection between the Anti-War Movement and the Communist party. Another consideration is that the Melbourne Trades Hall, which presumably might be expected to associate itself with an altruistic movement against war, has definitely contracted itself out of the AntiWar Movement in Melbourne. Finally, and I direct this with deference to the honourable member for Cook, the Sydney Trades and Labour Council has prohibited its members from taking part in the Anti-War Movement, well knowing its ""rtaracter. I leave the honourable meinoer for Cook to laugh that off if he can. Mr Br.ACKBUBN - I rise to a personal explanation. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) stated that I said that the British Consul-General by giving his vise to the passport of Herr Kisch had shown that he did not know, or did not think, that Herr Kisch had been excluded from England, but what I had said previously showed that Kisch had already been excluded from England. What I said, to the best of my recollection, was that the British Consul-General in Paris did not believe that the British Government desired the exclusion of Herr Kisch, but that when excluded he had been excluded for a particular purpose under special circumstances.",35
137,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Cook) [5.41] - The exhe clusion of Herr Kisch from Australia reveals the contradictions in the present system of capitalism more than anything else, although the incidents surround individual. War preparations are going ahead apace, both in Europe and in Pacific; in Europe, because of the of the Fascist Government of Germany; in the Pacific, for the control of the of Manchukuo, the only oil in the Pacific. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) has repudiated the Russian Government. Perhaps he will be surprised when the ex-Minister for Defence (Sir George Pearce) returns from New Zealand, after having conferred with Sir Maurice Hankey in that dominion, to find that Australia's ally in the Pacific is Soviet",36
138,Mr LANK,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,That is supposition.,36
139,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"It is nothing of the kind. I shall proceed to give some history of the development of these world movements, for the information is available to not only the honorary Minister (Mr Casey), or the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies), but also every keen student of current events. It is well known that war preparations are proceeding apace because of the danger of Fascism in Europe. Great Britain is unready for the great preparations that are being made in Fascist countries in Europe. The British Government knows that in the last three years alone Germany has increased its armaments not by the 197 per cent, referred to by the Attorney-General, but by 360 per cent. Whereas Great Britain has brought about a 16 per cent, reduction of armaments-ha s become in fact a second-class nation-the strength of Germany has increased. Herr Kisch is a victim of the very circumstances which have made a victim of Great Britain, circumstances which have led the British Government to send its highest military authority-the supreme authority I might say-Si r Maurice Hankey, to visit the dominions to urge them to do everything they can in preparation for war. Herr Kisch, I 6ay, is a victim of the system which allows such things to be done. The ex-Minister for the Interior (Mr E. J. Harrison) may have been at the war, but has shown clearly that he has not even an elementary knowledge of the world conditions that are prevailing today, otherwise he would not have sought to an place a ban on a victim of those conditions. I was surprised to hear the the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. fear White) speak as he did about Herr Kisch. As an author he should "" stick up for his cobbers "". Herr Kisch is an oil author of recognized reputation in Europe. Because only a few of the works of famous foreign authors, such as those of Nietzsche, have been translated into English, we must not assume that other foreign and world famous authors are what the Minister for Trade and Customs has called pseudo-authors.",36
140,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Has the honourable member read any of Herr Kisch's books?,37
141,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,I have not.,37
142,Mr WHITE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,That is ail that I said.,37
143,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"It must be remembered that numbers of prominent authors in Europe acclaim Herr Kisch as one of the finest writers of the day. circumstances it was not proper of the Minister for Customs to speak of a fellow author in such derogatory terms. I wish to relate the circumstances led to the exclusion of Herr Kisch from Great Britain. He was present at a conference presided over by Lord Marley. He went to Germany and was arrested there. While he was there what we know as the Reichstag fire trial- a mock trial - wa s opened in Great Britain. Kisch escaped from prison in Germany and got to Paris. But the Von Papen Government intimated to the British Government that for diplomatic reasons it should not permit that trial to take place. In these circumstances the British Government, because it did not desire discordant diplomatic relations with Germany, declined to admit Herr Kisch to Great Britain when he wished to return to give evidence in that trial. Herr Kisch is not a Communist. The members of the Communist party will never deny their membership of it, because if a Communist denies that he is a member of the party he is at once branded as a traitor. I hope the advice given by the Leader of the Opposition to the Government will be accepted. The ex-Minister for the In terior is like a babe in international affairs, and his advice may be disregarded. I assure the Government and the House that when Sir George Pearce, the ex-Minister for Defence, returns from New Zealand, after his conference with Sir Maurice Hankey, he will state that Australia must ally herself with Russia in matters relating to the Pacific. British Government has moved that Russia should be allowed to reenter the League of Nations. In all the circumstances, the Attorney General should not have made such general statements as he did in regard to international movements. He has not the knowledge, but it will be conveyed to him through the ex-Minister for Defence when he returns from New Zealand.",37
144,Mr LANE,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Nearl y all the predictions which the honourable member has made within recent years,37
145,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Are correct; not one has failed.,37

147,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Barker) 15.51] - To my mind, the only that thing to be considered in connection with this matter is the character of the gentleman who is the subject of the motion for adjournment. It seems strange to me that ' the party which takes upon itself the eternal task of looking after the welfare of the Herr down-trodden workers is always prepared to take up the cudgels in behalf of any distinguished foreigner who happens, for the time being, to agree with its own particular policy. Does it not strike honourable members as strange that Herr Egon Kisch who, according to the Adelaide newspapers, and according to statements made in this House this afternoon, is a citizen of the newly-founded State of Czechoslovakia, should carry the German designation "" He r r "" instead of ""Monsieur,"" which is used in Czechoslovakia? He publishes his writings in German, and lives in France. He comes to Australia in order to carry on propaganda in behalf of a foreign-constituted organization, and, because he has been refused admittance, we have a hue and - cry from those who really have most to lose from any weakening of the power of the British Empire or of its dominions. I know something of the inner workings of the anti-war society. I watched its development in Adelaide, and I can bear out what has been said of it by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Casey). The The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) will admit that, had it not been for the efforts of an ex-Senator, now, unfortunately, deceased, the Communist party would have gained control of the anti-war society in Adelaide. Because that society has gained .the adherence of a few ministers of religion and well meaning cranks it must not be taken too Sir seriously by the people of Australia. We are a deliberative assembly, and we have the right to determine what persons shall come into the country, and enjoy the benefits of a stay here. If it had been decided to have some other persons as guests at this time there might have been motions of objection from the other side of the House. For instance, if we had invited Herr Hitler, or Signor Mussolini, honourable members opposite would, no doubt, have protested. On the other hand, had the invited guests been ex-King Amanullah, or some dethroned African potentate or witchdoctor, they would, no doubt, have been given a right royal welcome. I was particularly interested in the remarks of the Clark, J. J. honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn). It is remarkable that one Communist document circulated in Australia has as its author a namesake of this honourable gentleman. The writer is Maurice Blackburn, and the document is published in Melbourne. I have here an official manifesto issued by the Communist party during an election campaign in New South Wales, when a gentleman who is now an honourable member of this House was a contestant. I refer to the honourable gentleman who is, temporarily I hope, representing the eleotorate of Cook.",37
148,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Le t the honourable Groom, Sir Littleton member contest the seat against him!",38
149,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The curry is cooking, and will be served hot with a whole lemon. One of the statements of policy contained in this manifesto is that the party should endeavour to win Australian workers definitely to . desire defeat of the British Empire in war. That is a'statement of treason, and the people who are responsible for making it are not fit to go to the table of this House and take the oath of allegiance . to the King. I trust that we shall hear no more of the Kisch incident. I can assure honourable members that, if time permitted, I could say quite a lot about that gentleman. In all charity I can give the assurance that Herr Kisch is not a saint, or is he material out of which the combined forces of the Labour party can make a martyr.

150,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,The time allotted for the debate on this motion has elapsed. Debate interrupted under Standing Order No. 257B. LOAN BILL (No. 2) 1934. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr Casey) proposed - That it is expedient that an appropriation of moneys he made for the purposes of a bill for an act to authorize the raising of a certain sum of money and for other purposes.,38
151,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"West Sydney) [6.6] I move That the words ""and for other purposes"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" for the relief of unemployment."" The committee should be as specific as possible because the circumstances, I am given to understand, warrant the necessary sums of money being raised. I am compelled to make this move at this stage because, at a later stage in the discussion, I might be prevented from securing what my party considers to be a necessary direction to the Government on this important matter. If the motion stands without alteration it means that nothing definite is decided as to the purpose for which the money is required. The main problem which confronts this countryin fact the only problem when all is said and. done-is that of unemployment. By its removal most of the ills and troubles which beset us would vanish and much of the suffering which results from it would be avoided. The Minister has moved his motion in accordance with the usual procedure, but we consider that there should be no vagueness about the allocation of this money. The Government frames its motion in such a way that it will be able to divert the sums of money to be raised into any channel that it wishes. On the other hand we are of opinion that that should not be permitted. The money raised might be directed to the payment of exorbitantly high rates of interest or to the payment of exchange. We consider that we should direct every means at our disposal in this Parliament towards ensuring that the purposes for which the moneys are to be raised should be specifically set down; and in this instance we think it should be done now because at a later stage we may be prevented from controlling their allocation as we think fit. In other words we desire now to determine that the money proposed to be raised is definitely allocated for the purpose of relieving unemployment and for that purpose alone. If that is done we know exactly where we are.  rule the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney out of order on the ground that it would alter the destination of the Governor General's recommendation.",39
152,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I move That the ruling of the Chairman be dissented from. Before submitting my amendment I obtained advice. The committee is considering the message from the Governor General. Nothing has yet - been revealed as to the amount proposed to be raised, and I do not think it is within the province of the Chair to suggest, at this stage, that I am misdirecting an amount of money. All that we know, at this stage, is that it is considered expedient to authorize the raising of a certain sum. The purpose for which the money is to be raised is not specified. I am confining myself to the message itself. I fully understand it would not be competent for me to go beyond that point at this stage, because it would be usurping the rights of the Government. I am not suggesting any interference with the total sum to be raised, I am merely endeavouring to give Parliament the right to say how it should be spent. The Government itself has not disclosed the purpose to which this money shall be applied, therefore it is difficult to understand how it could be said that I was altering its destination. I suggest that we are entitled, at this stage, to determine for what purpose the money shall be used.'",39
153,The CHAIRMAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Sectio n 56 of the Constitution Act providesA vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originates. The effect of the amendment would be to - take power out of the hands of the Government, and to bring about a misdirection of the appropriation. Sitting suspended from6.16 to 8 p.m. Mr Lazzarini.:- I submit that after Mr Speaker has left the chair and the House has resolved itself into committee, the message from the Governor General recommending appropriation becomes the business purely of the committee, and no longer concerns the House. The honprable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) did not wish to interfere in any way with what might be in the proposed appropriation, but simply sought to lay down the manner in which it should be allotted. It appears tp me that if the committee is prevented by the Standing Orders from ""doing so, it is to that extent stultified. If , whether we like it or not, we simply have to agree to whatever is involved in the message, discussion is useless. I hope that honourable members will not be guided solely by a desire to expedite the business to-night, and that they will view the matter not from the party point of view, but from the point of view of the rights and privileges of members of the committee. The ruling given by the Chair may suit thpm to-night, but may not on a future occasion. What is now done will stand as a precedent for all time, Honourable members who are jealous of their rights should be careful to refrain from doing what may curtail them. I support the motion of dissent from the ruling of the Chair, because I believe that the proposed amendment is in accordance with the Standing Orders, and that the desire of the honourable member for West Sydney is to safeguard the rights of honourable members when in committee and to give them some semblance of control over the business which i's transacted,",39
154,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I sympathize with the intention of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) that this vote shall be used exclusively for the purposes of unemployment. Honourable members who are associated with me on this side of the chamber are equally anxious that everything possible shall be done to that end. I recognize, however, that the provisions of the Constitution are so definite that it is almost impossible to achieve that objective. A clear reading of the Constitution supports the ruling of the Chair. Halsbury's definition of the relevant section of the Constitution also supports that ruling. I find, further, that in the 12th Parliament the Chairman of Committees, the late Mr MCGRATH, gave a like ruling when the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and the honor son) desired to move an amendment on lines similar to that of the honourable member for West Sydney.",40
155,Mr GREGORY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,It was very different.,40
156,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"It was on exactly the same point-the purpose of the appropriation. The honourable member for Swan objected to the appropriation being for purposes connected with shale oil, and desired to have it devoted to assistance to the gold-mining industry. The ruling of the Chair on that occasion was in keeping with what is now being done.",40
157,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Bot h rulings are wrong.,40
158,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"^That may be the honourable gentleman's opinion. I might wish that to be the case. But if we are to conduct the business of this Parliament in accordance with the Standing Orders and the procedure laid down for our guidance by the authorities, it seems to me that there is no alternative but to accept the ruling of the Chair,",40
159,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Is there any authority other than that of the late Mr MCGRATH?,40
160,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"There is the authority of the Constitution, and that given in Halsbury's Laws of England. Support is also furnished by May's Parliamentary Practice, at page 562. I regret that the position should be such as it. is, but the matter is beyond our control until we make the Standing Orders fit the situation as we wish it to be. Mr BLACKBURN . ' - ' - I think that upon questions of this sort we should be guided, not by what we think ought to be, but by what we think is, the position. In my opinion, the ruling which has been given clearly is a right one. I do not base my opinion so much on the Constitution, because I consider that the relevant section is capable of a different construction. The history of that section shows that at one stage it was proposed to insert the word "" first "" before the word "" recommended "". That word was deleted, and it was suggested that section 56 would be sufficiently complied with if the reconuaendation camo at any time before the appropriation was finally voted. What I am guided by is the fact that where our Standing Orders are silent we follow the practice of the House of Commons. In this matter the practice of the House of Commons is definite. I refer to volume 21 of Halsbury's Laws of England, page 773, paragraph 1450. This portion of the work deals with Parliament, and was contributed by the Eight Honourable the Earl of Halsbury; Sir Henry J. L. Graham, Clerk of the Parliaments; and Cuthbert Headlam, Clerk of Public Bills in the House of Lords; assisted by T. Lonsdale Webster, Second Clerk Assistant of the House of Commons. Dealing with resolutions in Committee of Supply, it saysIt is not in order, however, for a member to' propose an amendment which, if carried, would either increase in amount the Bum which has been demanded or would alter the object for which it is intended. That the purpose of the proposed amendment is to alter the objects of the appropriation is quite clear. The objects are those set out in the motion, and "" for other purposes"". The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) proposes to delete the words "" for other purpare poses"", and to narrow down that general statement to the single purpose of unemployment relief. It seems to me that that conflicts with the English practice, which is very clearly laid down in the work from which I have quoted, and is dealt with in more detail Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, 10th edition, page 5S1.

161,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Corio-Assistant Treai n Sir surer) [8.22] - I move That the hill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to authorize the borrowing of a net amount of Â£5,000,000 to provide employment, and to grant relief and assistance to rural industries. The total sum mentioned in the bill is Â£5,050,000, the additional Â£50,000 being the normal sum that is .. 9 added to provide for discounts and the 51 expenses of borrowing. This Â£5,000,000 is additional to the Â£1,000,000 for the 42 appropriation of which a bill has already been passed, dealing with postal works. The reason why the measure is in its preAnts. sent form is that the Government is not yet in a position to place before Parliament full particulars of the works and other purposes for which it is proposed that this sum of Â£5,000,000 should be expended. The bill appropriates only Â£200,000, that being the amount set out in the schedule for telephone exchange services and trunk line services. That expenditure is required in the near future because of the fairly rapid extension of the demand for these facilities. As to the remaining amount of Â£4,800,000, the House will be asked later, in an appropriation bill or bills, to give the Government authority to spend that sum for purposes to be specified. Regarding works for the relief of unemployment"" and other purposes, I think honourable members are aware that the Government is actively searching its own departments, and is now in active collaboration with the State governments, to decide upon works of an appropriate character, .particulars of which will be brought before the House at a later date. In the meantime, parliamentary approval for the raising of the Â£5,000,000 is necessary to enable a loan to be floated on the Australian market at an early date. It is hoped, for these reasons, that the House will pass this measure without undue debate, because full opportunity will be presented later, when the various appropriation bills are brought forward, for discussion of the actual works to be undertaken. The - term3 and conditions of the loan will be fixed by the Governor General in Council before it is floated. As honourable members know, this matter has been the subject of a good deal of discussion by the Loan Council in recent weeks, and it is hoped that a favourable rate will be obtained.",41
162,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Can the Minister indicate what the rate of interest will be?,42
163,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The Loan Council has had many discussions on the subject, and it was left in my hands, as chairman, to finalize the actual rates with the authorities concerned. Although it is not directly relative to this bill, it inappropriate to inform honourable members of the terms on which it is proposed to raise this loan. I think they are the most favourable that have been obtained in Australia for almost a generation. The rate is 3 per cent., at Â£99 15s., which means a net yield to the investor, on a fourteen years' loan, of Â£3 0s. 5d. per cent. I think the House must find itself in agreement with a loan issued at that price.",42
164,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Yarra) [8.27] - I do not intend to delay the passage of this bill, because I am anxious that something should be done for the relief of the unemployed, even if I do not agree entirely with the method adopted. It is extraordinary, however, that we are asked to pass a bill authorizing the floating of a loan of Â£5,000,000 when we have no indication as to how the money is to be expended, with the exception of the Â£200,000 mentioned in the schedule. The Government is not treating this Parliament as a responsible body. It may not be possible for the new Ministry to present a complete schedule of the actual works to be carried out, but one would expect the Minister to indicate the nature of the major works to be undertaken or the class of work likely to be done. We are asked to vote blindly for the raising of Â£5,000,000 without the slightest indication as to how the bulk of it is to be spent. We merely know that Â£200,000 is to be used for telephone exchange services and trunk line services, which I assume are the ordinary developmental works of the Post Office, and to which I take no exception. I gather from the Minister's speech that the terms of the loan were left for him to decide finally. He indicated at the conclusion of his remarks that the interest rate would be 3 per cent., and that the loan was to be issued at Â£99 15s. Although I do not think I may be regarded as a crank- a term which is often applied to those who take a different view of the monetary problem from that which has been followed for many years- I am quite convinced, from my observation and the information that I have been able to gather on the subject, that there is sufficient credit available in this country for the Government to utilize, through its own instrument, the Commonis not wealth Bank, and that the cost would be very much lower than that involved in the method now proposed of raising the money. I do not say that we could go to unlimited lengths in this direction, but we could go to a much greater extent than this loan of Â£5,000,000. Credit and money may have been scarce in Australia some time ago, but it is only necessary to read the reports of banking and other financial institutions to realise that today large amounts of money are lying idle. With a very slight amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act the Commonwealth Bank would be able to do much more effective work in providing credit than it is doing today, and at a much lower cost to the taxpayers. However, the Government has decided to adopt this method, and although I think it is the wrong method, I am not prepared, at the moment, to oppose it, for I am desirous that something shall be done without delay to assist the unemployed. We have had three years of inaction by this Government and I am pleased that at last it is showing some inclination to make a move. But surely this Parliament will not continue indefinitely to tolerate the kind of treatment that is being meted out to it. It is entirely unfair that measures of this description should be thrown on the table with such scanty information. After all, we have certain responsibilities in the authorization of such loans and we are entitled to more information than we are getting. It is true, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) said, that a schedule will submitted to Parliament the money raised can be appropriated; but the money will then have been raised by public subscription, and if Parliament refuses to appropriate it for the works proposed we shall be in a queer position. It would, of course, be impracticable to return the money to the subscribers. It is therefore only reasonable that the Government should at this stage of bills of this character, give honourable members a general idea of the purposes for which the money is desired.",42
165,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"West Sydney) [8.34]. - The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) occupied exactly seven minutes in explaining the purposes orf this bill ;to the House, although I suppose the objects for which the money is being raised were discussed for several hours at the Loan Council meeting. This thought therefore arises: that Parliament is being unjustly treated in these matters. On the two or three days that Parliament met prior to last week endeavours were made by honourable members to ascertain exactly what occurred at the Loan Council meeting, but such efforts were unsuccessful. We should like to know now how the Loan Council arrived at the decision to authorize the raising of this money, and still more should we like to know the works which the Loan Council decided should be put in hand with the money. What exactly happens at these Loan Council meetings ? Is this Parliament to be for ever dragged along at the heels of ' State Premiers, or is it to be treated as a deliberative body ? Apparently the Assistant Treasurer and the Premiers consider all the needs of the case are served if they decide upon a certain policy at the Loan Council meetings and then throw on the tables of their respective parliaments a bill or bills providing for the expenditure of certain moneys, and request the passage of them in a half hour or so with practically no discussion. I , at any rate, am not satisfied with that procedure. Honourable members are supposed to represent their constituents and to watch carefully the expenditure of public moneys. Presumably we have ideas of our own on these has subjects or we should not be here. I be therefore submit that it is totally unfair before for the Assistant Treasurer, after spending a mere seven minutes in explaining a bill for the loan of Â£5,000,000, to ask honourable members to pass it practically without debate. I want more information about the discussions that occurred at the Loan Council. I do not suppose that verbatim notes were taken. In fact I understand that the doors leading to the meeting room were locked and the knobs taken off them to ensure that no one should obtain entrance. It seems that we are gradually developing a procedure which will debar even members of Parliament from any real knowledge of the affairs of the country. Apparently because the Government or the Loan Council says that a certain sum of money is to be raised, and unemployment is mentioned, we are expected to agree to the proposal without obtaining information or without being given the right to determine as to whether or not the amount for . relief of unemployment is adequate. I wish to make it quite clear that I do not intend to continue for an unlimited time to act in conformity with that suggestion. If that procedure is to be persevered with we may as well save the expense of meeting in this formal way, and conduct all our business by correspondence.",43
166,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"This bill is to provide for the raising of Â£5,000,000, to enable the Commonwealth to take a proportion of - the Â£15,000,000 loan approved by the Loan Council.",44
167,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I can refer only to the Â£5,000,000. If I went further I might be called to order for discussing a proposal that is not before the chair. The only information we have that a loan of Â£15,000,000 is to be floated has been gleaned from the newspapers. It seems that the press has more information on this subject than Parliament itself. One or two of us may not be able to alter that situation, but I feel sure that honourable members generally will sooner or later offer a vigorous protest against this procedure. Probably if honourable members who support the Government were free to say what they feel they would support my view.",44
168,Mr RIORDAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,A new Commonwealth Government has been formed since the meeting of the Loan Council.,44
169,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"That is so; but the Assistant Treasurer has not offered that excuse for his failure to provide us with the adequate information. Possibly there will be another change of government before long. Changes are so rapid in these days. But that only makes it all the more necessary for Parliament to be provided with full information of proposed expenditure. One thing the Assistant Treasurer did tell us was that there was need for a survey of the position. If that is so, it discloses the incapacity of the Government. I cannot believe that members of the Cabinet do not know how they intend to allocate this money. They must know, otherwise they should not occupy the positions they now hold, and if they know, Parliament is entitled to share in the knowledge. Very little information has been given to us about the terms of the loan. Is it to be a tax-free loan of the class to which great exception has been taken previously? Such loans favour the privileged few who invest in gilt-edged securities. How different is their position from that of those who are prepared to invest their money in industries of this country and in so doing incurring considerable risk, more especially at the present time. Perhaps the Assistant Treasurer feels that we are not worthy of this information! The honourable gentleman also observed that active and searching inquiry was to be made in the various departments. ""Well, it is something to know that an active inquiry is to be made. But such inquiries have been made during the last four years, and I am sure that ample information is available in the various departments respecting public works that could be put in hand immediately. Inquiries of this kind were made during my ministerial days, and I have no doubt that the reports then prepared are still available. The heads of the various departments could easily supply the Government with a list of necessary works upon which this money could be expended, and there need be no delay whatever in that regard. It has been said that some of this money is to be spent to relieve certain primary industries. Which primary industries are to benefit? I shall not touch the wheat industry at the moment, but I remind the Assistant Treasurer that a deputation representing citrus-growers waited upon the Government recently and requested immediate assistance. Certain promises were made to those men. Is part of this money to be used to grant them relief? This subject must have been discussed by the Government. I am not prepared indefinitely to accept the method of the Government of sheltering behind the unemployed or lack of time as an excuse for not giving the Parliament the fullest details regarding expenditure of this nature. It is not fair that we should be asked to ruBh this bill through the House, for if Parliament had sat for the usual sitting days of last week adequate opportunity would have been provided for a full discussion of the subject. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition has said about the necessity for providing money to relieve unemployment, I insist that the time has arrived when the Government should furnish honourable members with full particulars of the works that are to be put in hand. I notice that Â£50,000 put down as the cost of floating this loan well of Â£5,000,000.",44
170,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,It will not necessarily cost that much.,45
171,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The Assistant Treasurer himself gave that figure and we must accept it ; but it will be hard for people who have been clamouring for work for years to accept quietly statement that Â£50,000 is to be spent floating a loan of which probably Â£200,000 will be used for the immediate relief of unemployment. Apparently those who do least for the welfare of country are to reap a benefit altogether out of proportion to that which will to those prepared to use their energy develop our industries. It seems that the workers are to be used as mere pawns in the game. Will the Assistant Treastion urer inform us whether this money be used to provide additional work prior to Christmas? I assume that that is the case.",45
172,Mr CURTIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"-Not much of Â£200,000 will be available for wages extensive telephonic and telegraphic equipment have to be purchased.",45
173,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"That is so. Poles, meeting, wire, insulators and other equipment that nature are expensive. When the Â£200,000 is spread over the whole of the Commonwealth, I do not think that it will provide Is. a head for all the those who need special assistance before Christmas. 1 suppose other honourable members have had the same experience, but since the Loan Council met a little while ago, I have been besieged with quiries regarding what the Government proposes to do by way of relief between now and Christmas. Every week-end I have had numerous interviews on this subject, and I have held out some little hope to inquirers, because I understood from the replies received to questions which I asked in the House that the Government meant to make some special provision for the unemployed. The Prime Minister stated in his policy speech that unemployment had ceased be a matter with which the States alone were concerned, and that it had become the direct concern of the Commonwealth. He said that a special Minister would be appointed to deal with the problem, is but we find that the special Minister is on the back benches. I understand that a sum of Â£200,000 is to be spent on unemployment relief before Christmas. At least we should be told how it is to be allocated among the States. Is it to be shared among those now out of work, or is it to be devoted to keeping those already in the - service fully employed ? No doubt the the Postal Department has a list in of works that need to be done. only Members of my party in this House who represent country constituencies are interested in postal exthe penditure, and are anxious to know what extra postal facilities are to be provided. come Moreover, we wish to be assured that to whatever work is done shall be done a! award rates, and under award conditions. I agree with the Leader of the Opposi(Mr Scullin) that the Assistant is to Treasurer treated the House with little consideration when he introduced this measure. We do not feel disposed to accept his bald statements on the 1 the plea that it is necessary to get the bill if through immediately. Parliament has recently been in recess for nearly a fortnight when it could quite well have been and then there would have been plenty of time to go into these and other of matters. We mean to probe the matter as carefully as we can, and we hope that the Minister will, at a later stage, supply information for which we have asked.",45
174,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Mplbourne Ports') [8.49] - Like other honourable members, I am disappointed at the lack of informaintion furnished by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey). All honourable members, I think, are anxious that as much work as possible should be provided for the unemployed before Christmas, and we are placed in a false position through being forced into the appearance of obstructing the Government's proposals, but we really should have been furnished with fuller information. A few weeks ago, the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) said that the time had arrived when new to methods would have to be applied by the Government to the new circumstances which had arisen, and I hoped, when it was announced that the Government proposed to take measures for the relief of unemployment, that we should see some of those new methods in operation. I hoped that the Commonwealth Government would itself undertake unemployment relief, that it would raise and expend the money itself instead of merely handing it over to the States. Above all, I hoped that the old method of public borrowing from private institutions would be abandoned. All the information at our disposal is that this sum of Â£5,000,000 is to be raised to defray the cost of borrowing, and for other purposes. If it is proposed to raise a sum of Â£15,000,000 with a currency of fourteen years, Â£5,000,000 will hardly be sufficient to pay the cost of brokerage and other charges associated with the loan. The last loan of Â£12,000,000 was raised for fourteen years, and it cost the Government Â£5,600,000 to boTrow the Â£12,000,000. How are we to know that the bulk of this present loan will not be devoted to paying the cost of the previous one? How much of this Â£5,000,000, or of the Â£15,000,000 if it is ever raised, will be devoted actually to providing work for the unemployed ? When is the old policy of bolstering up the privileges of private enterprise to be abandoned? This Government has no patriotism-certainl y no political or State patriotism. continues to bestow its patronage on private financial institutions so that they can draw back for their own profit Â£5,000,000 or Â£6,000,000 out of a loan of Â£15,000,000. Why not give this Â£5.000,000, if we must pay it, to our own Commonwealth Bank?",45
175,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Whic h Â£5,000,000?",46
176,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The Â£5,600,000 which the Assistant Treasurer said was the cost of raising the last loan of Â£12,000,000. I am, of course, including interest payments.",46
177,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Oh !,46
178,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"It will cost at least as much to raise a further loan of Â£15,000,000. I do not blame the people who make the charge, and the Government is deserving of some thanks for having recently reduced the cost of servicing its loans; but why do the business at all with private institutions when we have our own Commonwealth Bank which could provide the accommodation? Even if the Commonwealth Bank charged the same rate of interest at least the Â£5,600,000, or its equivalent in respect of any other loan, would come back into revenue, and would thus be available for providing still further services and employment. It is time the Government turned over a new leaf. It is time it stopped telling other people that they lack patriotism, and exhibited a little of that virtue themselves. There is no hope in this present bill at all, but we must accept the crumbs that are thrown to the unemployed because otherwise we should get nothing. It is surely time that Parliament directed the Loan Council not to spend millions of pound* every year in paying brokerage and interest for the raising of money from private sources when that money could be supplied . by the Commonwealth Bank. The Assistant Treasurer knows quite well that the Commonwealth Bank could provide this accommodation if it were asked to do so, or if it were given nower to do so; but the parties in power do not want the Commonwealth Bank to function in this way. Without attempting to impute improper motives to any one, I suggest that most of this Â£15,000,000 that is to be raised It will eventually go towards paying brokerage and interest on this loan, and on the last loan of Â£12,000,000. The reason that this Government and previous governments have failed to make any impression on the unemployment problem is that practically all the wealth we produce collectively has been squeezed out of us in order to pay interest on the money borrowed from private institutions. Every new loan that is raised is devoted largely to paying the costs of the old loans, and we never break any new ground. The Government should put a stop to this, and allow the Commonwealth Bank to perform its proper function in the community. The Commonwealth Bank is one of the greatest banks in the British Empire, the only one in Australia that stood the strain during the war. Yet now, in peace times, when the private banks are once more able to carry on, the Government is giving to them the business which it should give to its own bank, and allowing them to earn the profits which should belong to the community as a whole and should be used to create employment. So long as the Government persists in its policy of regarding private financial institutions as sacrosanct, and goes on borrowing new money to pay old debts, it will never solve the problem of unemployment, and our public debt will - continue to grow alarmingly.",46
179,Mr FAIRBAIRN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Flinders) [8.59] I do not desire to criticize the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) for his brevity, because I believe that any one who sets aa example of brevity in this House is deserving of praise. The Assistant-Treasurer deserves the thanks of the Rouse for the brevity and clarity which he usually displays when he introduces a bill into this House. But I should like to ask: him in his reply to this to take the House a little more into his confidence. Mr BXAST,2SY - He was not too clear on this occasion.",47
180,Mr FAIRBAIRN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"There are exceptions which prove every rule. I can quite appreciate that it is not always possible for a Minister to have in clear outline the whole of the details of the manner is which it is proposed to expend money. If the programme of public works upon which this money is to be spent has not yet been drawn up, perhaps the AssistantTreasurer can explain to the House why there is necessity for great haste to pass this bill. When the programme of proposed works is placed before the House I am sure it will very readily pass the measure, but it is not right to expect the House to pass it at such short notice without more definite information.",47
181,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Werriwa) [9.2] The^opinions expressed during this debate that the whole of the financing of governmental requirements in this country could be done by the Commonwealth Bank, make one hopeful that a radical change may be effected in the present stupid system of governmental finance. How long can this country go on borrowing money at high rates of interest and at high flotation costs? The report of the Auditor-General for the last financial year shows that of Â£82,000,000 collected in taxation by the Australian governments, Â£63,000,000 was utilized in the payment of interest and debt charges. And yet we allow these charges to mount up and refuse to face up to the position that for years we have been bankrupt, merely borrowing money to pay interest and other charges. Since 1927 the Commonwealth and the States have been borrowing money to meet treasury-bills, and interest bills, and of the Â£5,000,000 proposed to be raised under this measure, not one penny will be allocated to the relief of unemployment. The sum of Â£200,000 provided in this bill for works is merely for ordinary construction work in the postal department, most of which will go to technicians and tradesmen who, if not already permanently employed, are at least working part or f u ll time. But not one penny of debate it will find its way into the pockets of the unemployed outside of the postal department. The Assistant Treasurer says that the money will be allocated later on and that honourable members will be given the details of the proposed allocation. But is this not rather like putting the cart before the horse? The loan will not be floated until tomorrow, and as the bill will be passed to-night, the plea for haste does not hold water. If we had the courage to alter the monetary laws of this country the Commonwealth Bank could provide 1 Â£50,000,000 if necessary and could make the money available to the Government free of interest. But even if the Commonwealth Bank were called upon to provide only Â£5,000,000, a saving of Â£50,000 in flotation costs alone could be made. There is no necessity for the Commonwealth Bank to charge interest on government loans, and the interest rate of 3 per cent, could be placed in a sinking fund to redeem the loan within 33 years. Although I do not attempt to prophesy, we are reaching a stage at which a crash will inevitably result, and civilization will be doomed. How much longer we can go on at this rate is not a matter of opinion, hut is simply an arithmetical calculation. The Assistant Treasurer, who himself is a business man, knows that this is so. I ask him, if he were chairman of directors of a bank or in control of one of the financial institutions of the country, how long he would tolerate a customer who borrowed money from his concern in order to pay interest upon what he already owed. Yet that is what the Commonwealth and the States have been doing for many years past. When honourable members on this side of the House made that statement a few years ago they were termed "" cranks "", but the country has already begun to realise that they were right. I cannot recollect a bill having been brought before the House and so little information given in connection with it., It seems, when Ministers tell us that if we are not prepared to pass a measure the workless will get nothing, that the Government is trying to take advantage of the necessitous dition of the people to put something over them. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) said that the workless will not get a shilling of this money. I say that they will get not one penny. If they were given the whole Â£200,000 it would not be a gift ; they would have to work for what they got. Why, spread the Â£5,000,000 over the Commonwealth for the unemployed in this country, including their wives, children and dependants, per capita, it would not amount to very much. Perhaps right at the end of the session, when honourable members are anxious to get away to their homes for Christmas, there will be an all-night sitting, and a measure will be passed hurriedly which will provide nothing for the unemployed. Who is to get Â£50,000 for advertising? Is it intended that the great metropolitan organs which preach so glibly about reconstruction and the necessity to water down costs, the daily papers, shall receive a present of Â£50,000 from the Treasurer of the Commonwealth? The only compensation I derive from that is that the Labor Daily may get its share. But Â£50,000 is 1 per cent, of Â£5,000,000 and is far too much. The Commonwealth Bank could provide this money without any risk whatever. After all, governmental loans are floated upon the security of the national wealth of the country.",47
182,Mr GREGORY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,But the people may easily change their minds as to its,48
183,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"That security is quite sufficient behind the credit in the Commonwealth Bank, as behind the credit written on a bond. The Commonthere wealth Bank, by a simple amendment the act, could be protected against any concerted run upon its funds as hapyear pen od in the case of the Government ings Bank of New South Wales. And the only limit to be placed upon the amount of credit to be issued, is the necessity of the governments of the Commonwealth and the States. A great deal of discussion has gone on in this Parliament in regard to the need for rehabilitating primary industries, and unemployment has been regarded as something almost divorced from that subject. Recently the meat question has been under consideration. We are mainly con- concerned as to whether the English people will eat our meat, while there are tens and hundreds of thousands of people in this country who cannot even purchase Australian meat. If these people were earning there would be no market problem for our meat. The same can be said for the wheat industry. Everybody seems to be concerned about everybody else getting Australian commodities, while the huge market of our own in Australia is forgotten.",48
184,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,I should like to know where the market is?,48
185,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Does the honourable member say that there is nobody in Australia in need of food? As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) has said, this measure is merely a throwing of crumbs. I am disappointed in this bill. It was thought that some credence could be given to the rumours that at least some specific sum would be definitely provided for the unemployed before Christmas. The lack of specific proposals shows definitely and clearly that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) showed some prescience when he moved an amendment designed to ensure that the money would be earmarked for the unemployed. If the Government intends to make available a specific sum, I hope that the Assistant Treasurer will indicate what it is likely to be, and how it is to be allocated. I trust that he will not convalue. tend that it is this Â£200,000. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) wanted to know where is a market in Australia for our of meat. Apparently the honourable member has forgotten that the proudest boast a or so ago of the Premier of the SavState from which he comes was that it had the greatest amount of unemployment and the lowest wage rate in the Commonwealth.",48
186,Mr CTJRTW,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Fremantle) [9.17] - In the course of a debate which took place earlier in the life of this Parliament, expressed the hope that a short statethe ment would be made elaborating minisappears terial intentions, and contributing to better comprehension of the measures which the Government proposed to bring forward from time to time. That statecomprehensive ment has not been made, and its absence greatly embarrasses me in the considerabecause, tion of this particular bill, the purpose which is to raise Â£5,000,000 plus the cost of raising that sum. The hypothecation of the money deals only with an infinitesiunemployed mal item for works in connection with postal and telephonic services. I feel that there are two problems to be faced: First, how best can money be raised for the requirements of Australian has governments, and of this Government particular; and, secondly, what is the best use that this Government can make of the moneys that it thus raises. of Apparently the Government is not in position to formulate works projects under the direct supervision of its own Ministers. I am not at all surprised that, because, during the last three years, the Commonwealth has deliberately abproportion stained from any direct contribution wards the organization of employment, and relied upon reductions of taxation other devices to stimulate private enterprovide. prise. In the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) it was definitely declared that an obligation rested upon this Parliament, and upon the Governtaxation ment, to assist in the organization employment. In view of the circumdeficits stances that exist at the moment-the urgency of something being done, and obvious difficulty which confronts the Commonwealth in giving proper attention to this matter- I suggest that the whole of the money which it is proposed to less the Â£200,000, should be at once cated to the governments of the States, so that they may give effect to prowhich grammes which they have already formuwith lated, which are in various stages of comis pletion, and which, in fact, are not being economically carried out because of the are contemplating. embarrassments under which the States labour in doing their utmost to promote employment without possessing the requisite financial resources to contemplate a long-range programme. We all know that for the last three years the momentum of employment in this country has I been divided between the governments of States and private enterprise. It to me that it would be unwise for my this Government to intrude upon that momentum, despite its declaration of policy, until it has first given proper and consideration to the elaboration of a long-term programme; if I understand the history of of such activities, a short-term programme of puhlic works is wasteful, being primarily dictated by the necessities of the and limited-as has been the ease in the last three years-by inadequate financial resources. A great deal of the work which has been done, and most certainly of the capital which been expended, is not capable of earnin ing the charges normally imposed upon it. Tlras we have the spectacle that during the last three years the relationship the revenues of the States to the total a interest charges that they have had to meet has become entirely disproportioned. Ten years ago, it could be said that the at burden which unearned interest imposed upon State governments was but a small of the total, and that there towas always available a very large quantum of taxation for the maintenance of the and social services which the States had to The present position is that the interest earned by instrumentalities of the States falls so far short of interest charges that the resultant demands upon are so large as to furnish a comof plete explanation of the extraordinary which the States have suffered. Their difficulty has been increased by the the obligation they have shouldered to organize employment, or, alternatively, to furnish sustenance to those for whom no work could be found. Obviously, the raise, Commonwealth Government is unable to alloindicate the use which it proposes to make of the greater part of the Â£5,000,000 it is intended to raise. May I say very great respect that Â£5,000,000 an infinitesimal contribution, considering the nature of the problem which we Therefore, this makeshift implementing of the Prime Minister's promise can most satisfactorily be discharged and most economically administered by giving the money to the States to permit of their more efficiently completing the works that they already have initiated, and which are in various stages of completion.",49
187,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"And not spend it on relief works. Mr CURTLlSr - It should not be spent on relief works. I put it to the House that the difficulties of the States-and I speak of all types of State governmentshave imposed upon them a policy which in its very nature must be wasteful. Men are employed in occupations in which they have had no training and for which in many instances they have no physical fitness. Furthermore, the desire is to rotate employment, the result being that in nine cases out of ten the work is not satisfactorily performed, for the reason that men are employed for, say, six weeks, becoming more or less accustomed to the work in the fifth or sixth week, and are then stood down, a new batch of men who have been idle being then brought on. Thus the costs imposed upon the State are far higher than those estimated, and much greater than would be the case if there were continuity of employment, even of men recruited from other occupations. It will thus be seen that the failure of this Government and of this Parliament hitherto to play a definite part in the problem of employment from the point of view of the State as an organic entity has saddled the States, first with high interest charges, secondly with works that will not be entirely remunerative, and thirdly with a premature embarkation upon some schemes before the requisite technical parations have been made. I venture to say to the Assistant Treasurer that the speed with which the Commonwealth will endeavour to get works going in order to bring down a schedule to this Parliament will be such that the requisite engineering and other technical preliminaries and costing services, which ought to be an essential starting-off point in any policy of Commonwealth works, will not be properly performed. As that will involve considerable wastage of the money to be raised, I suggest to the Parliament that that money oan be used to the best advantage if it is allocated to the States. I shall not trespass further upon the House. I was tempted to deal with the monetary aspect of the problem and with one or two other aspects. I believe that the Government is genuinely anxious to assist the unemployed this side of Christmas. But it has no agencies through which to conjure works out of thin air. The best that it can think of up to the moment is a schedule of telephonic services, which, as we all know, very largely involve the use of equipment and plant, the greater part of which is imported. I know of works in Western Australia upon which the State Government would be glad to put more men quickly so that they might be completed at an earlier date. Perhaps by massing labour they might be made less costly in man power. I feel certain that other States are in the same plight. It seems to me, therefore, that we can cut the Gordian Knot which this bill presents to us, without committing the Parliament to a policy that might be wasteful, and without having to decide particularly at this juncture the general policy of the Commonwealth towards employment. The immediate need is to give the money to the States.",50
188,Mr RIORDAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Kennedy) [9.28] The seven minutes' explanation of this bill given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) has left me, as it has the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn), in the position that I know very little about the measure. In my opinion, if the Â£5,000,000 is to carry on the works policy of the Commonwealth preGovernment up to Christmas, it will go some way towards relieving the unemployment position. But if it is to' enable the Government to carry on until the end of next June, I am afraid that the failure to grapple with the problem will be as dismal during the next three years as it was during the last three years. We are within about six weeks of Christmas, and over 25 per cent, of our people have no prospect of obtaining employment. As a result of promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), they have been looking to this Government to provide funds for the relief of unemployment. In his policy speech, the Prime Minister definitely informed the country that a Minister would be specially appointed to deal with the problem of unemployment. The first announcement in the press was that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) would take charge of this department, but later the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Stewart) was selected for the work.",50
189,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,The constitution of the Ministry is scarcely under consideration in connection with this bill.,51
190,Mr RIORDAN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"This Minister who was to deal with unemployment and loan money has taken a seat on one of the back benches. It seems to me that the Minister who is usually most successful in piloting measures through the House without a great deal of discussion is he who gives full information in moving the second readings; but I am afraid that the Assistant Treasurer has not greatly profited by his three years' experience. Is this Â£5,000,000 to be distributed among the States for the relief of unemployment, or is it to be utilized wholly by the Commonwealth Government in carrying out its policy? The Â£200,000 allocated for^ postal works would not be sufficient to meet the demands for improved postal or telephonic facilities in my electorate alone. Does the Government intend to incur further expenditure in the development of proposals emanating from the recent aerial survey of North Australia? I noticed in the press that the Ministry is inquiring into the practicability of viding a uniform railway gauge for Australia. A standard gauge line has been built from Kyogle to Brisbane, and about three years ago this Parliament authorized the construction of a similar line in South Australia from Port Augusta to Red Hill. Brisbane has long suffered from the lack of funds for much-needed sewerage works, so it is easily seen that there are numerous useful channels for the expenditure of money for the relief of unemployment.  mend the Government upon .the introducrelief tion of this measure at the first opporthe tunity since the formation of the new Ministry. One of the great problems confronting us today is that of unemployment, and I am glad , to know that the Government intends to tackle it seriously. Yet with other honourable members. I would have liked the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey), in introducing this bill, to give a great deal more information than he has supplied. He mentioned that the loan was to be issued at Â£99 15s., and that the rate would be 3 per cent. Upon that information he is to be cordially congratulated. It seems to me, however, that the Loan Council is exercising - too much power today, to the exclusion of the rights of this Parliament, which is supposed to be a deliberative assembly, and not one merely to ratify from time to time the decisions of another body. Surely the Minister could have given us some indication of the nature of the particular works to be put into operation. I cannot let this opportunity pass without drawing attention to the need for carrying out the agreement entered into between South Australia and the Commonwealth Government when that State handed over the Northern Territory. It was agreed that the Commonwealth Government should build a line of railway from Oodnadatta to connect with the line running southward from Darwin. The line has been built to Alice Springs, but a distance of 570 miles still remains to be bridged. Here is a good opportunity to provide a considerable amount of useful employment, and I think the time is most opportune to proceed with that prowork. Great difficulties in the development of the pastoral and mining resources of the Northern Territory are experienced because of the lack of transport facilities, and the Commonwealth Government should hasten to carry out its contract with South Australia.",51

192,Mr MAKIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Hindmarsh) [9.40] - To those of us who have been expecting a substantial contribution by the Government to the solution of the unemployment problem this bill will cause serious disappointment. It is totally inadequate to meet the pressing claim that thousands of our citizens have upon the Commonwealth Government to give effect to its promise to deal with unemployment as a permanent question of national policy. The schedule to this bill is surely a poor pliment to the House when it is, realized that there are many ways in which useful work could be immediately provided, thus relieving the workless before Christmas. The bill indicates that very little will attempted before the end of the year, and he would be a super-optimist who believed that the Government seriously intended to do much in the early part of the new year. The Government's policy of procrastination makes us fear that it will again prove itself unable or unwilling to deal effectively with a very pressing problem, to the solution of which it has made but a paltry contribution in the schedule to this bill. As the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) indicated, the expenditure of Â£200,000 for trunk line and other telephonic services may not afford employment to a solitary person who is now out of work, as it means merely the carrying out of the ordinary works programme of the Postal Department. This House had a right to expect from the Government something in the nature of a comprehensive programme of public works, and an indication that an early start on it would be made. Plenty of work is available, for the federal services have been starved for three or four years. The Government is not dealing with honourable members in a proper manner. The information supplied with this bill is inadequate and unsatisfactory. The honourable member for Boothy (Mr. Price) referred to the necessity for the completion of the North-South line. He might have made his appeal more effective by reminding the Government that the sleepers and rails necessary for this work are already at Pine Creek.",52

The honourable member might also have directed the attention of the Government to the necessity for taking immediate action to remedy the damage done by flood waters in his own electorate within the last fortnight or so. I have no doubt that he unintentionally overlooked this necessary work. Other work that could be put in hand includes the ballasting and renewing of sleepers on the East-West comrailway which a previous Minister for the Interior acknowledged to be an urgent work. If I were to direct attention to our postal services and other Commonwealth activities, I could outhe line numerous reproductive works that could be put in hand without delay to the lasting benefit of the Commonwealth. If money were expended in these directions we should be pleased. It is time we ceased pouring money down the sink, yet that is what is being done at present, in many instances. Much of our unemployed relief work is useless to the authority which puts it in hand, and unsatisfactory to the men who do it. In some cases unemployed relief works are being used as a means to undermine the wage standards of the people, and we protest against this procedure. We should be seeking efficiency in every direction. I strongly disapprove of the method which the Government proposes to adopt in raising this money. Australia, and all other countries which have pursued this method of finance in the past, have suffered for it. The depression was caused because of the huge sums of money that had to be withdrawn from industry to meet interest payments. I regret to say, however, that even so unprecedented a crisis as that will be experienced again unless we return to methods of financial sanity that will ensure financial stability. The Government should utilize the national credit, through the national bank, to provide this money. It is of no use to say that that cannot be done, for it has already been done. The East-West railway and certain other public works that could be specified are monuments to the effectiveness of the procedure. When the East-West railway was finished, we owed only to ourselves, and in the course of years we were able to retire our indebtedness by credits that became available through the national exchequer. The financial methods which the Government is now adopting are unsound, and will undoubtedly add to the tremendous millstone already secured around the neck of the Australian citizen. have been told to-night that Â£60,000,000 of the Â£86,000,000 that is collected annually in revenue from the people of Australia is expended in the payment of interest and other recurring charges contingent upon our capital indebtedness. Surely these figures are staggering and point to the inevitable result of such financing. Let us use the credit of the nation and be free from the entanglements of ' the present loan methods. I ask the Assistant Treasurer to give us more information about the works on which the Government proposes to expend this money. The seven and a half minutes which he occupied in explaining the purposes of this bill were entirely inadequate for the purpose. This Parliament has obligations in regard to the Government's financial commitments, and it should be given a much more comprehensive statement concerning this bill than that which the Assistant Treasurer has so far made.",52
195,Mr GASDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Cook) [9.55] Prior to becoming a member of this Parliament I had formed the idea that it was merely a registration body for some other authority. That has been confirmed by what has happened here to-night. I am surprised that a responsible' Minister should ask Parliament to approve of a loan of Â£5,050,000 on such scanty information as that which has been supplied with this bill. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies), the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey), at an earlier stage of our proceedings today, said that they stood for parliamentary control; but they are now associated in the kind of proposal which, if persisted in for very long, will ultimately destroy parliamentary government.",53
196,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"They are obeying the "" inner group.""",53
197,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Yes ; the Loan party Council, which is evidently sponever soring this bill, is a kind of inner group which is determining the policy of Australian governments. The Assistant Treasurer evidently thinks that all reasonable requirements are served if he comes here and says ""We want this money. We shall not tell you what it is We wanted for; but we have agreed that it must be raised"". The Government should have submitted to us. some planned economy, some general lines of reconstruction, and some policy which would justify the attention of the people of this country; but it has not done so. I have been surprised that the so-called representatives of the farmers in this House have had nothing to say about this bill. Their silence confirms me in my belief that they are merely farming the farmers. The wheat-growers of Australia require help before Christmas, for they are confronted with a serious situation in regard to their coming crop; but their representatives in this Parliament have had nothing whatever to say on the subject. The Assistant Treasurer has told us that this loan is to be raised at the cheap rate of 3 per cent., in round figures; but I am sure that if the Government floated the loan at 2 per cent, it would obtain all the money it needs. In Great Britain a loan floated at 1-i per cent, was oversubscribed in twelve hours. Why? Because the perilous economic condition which faces the country makes government securities the only guaranteed, securities. That is also true of Australia.",53
198,Mr NOCK,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Was the British loan for a period of fourteen years?,53
199,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Yes , for fourteen years.",53
200,Mr NOCK,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,At 1^ per cent. ?,53
201,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Yes , and it was possible because government loans offer the best security available at the present time. Similarly, in this country, it is impossible to find profitable investment in wheat or wool, or in the secondary industries. The only sound investment is in government securities. That is why the rate of interest has fallen from 6 per cent, to 3 per cent. A few years ago members of the Government party and the Country scouted the idea that money could be obtained at 3 per cent. When the Leader of the Labour Government in New South Wales suggested that money might be had at 3 per cent, the press of the country said that it was a sacrilege even to propose such a thing. Now, the Assistant Treasurer informs us that the rate of interest will fall even lower than 3 per cent. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) made out a very good case in favour of government borrowing from the Commonwealth Bank, and the Assistant Treasurer will be hard putQfo it to dispose of that argument., The soundest financial institution in Australia today is the Commonwealth Bank. There are a few others such as the Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank and the Bank of Australasia that are fairly solid, but the Commonwealth Bank is the most secure of all. Every penny of the Â£15,000,000 which is to be raised could be obtained from the Commonwealth Bank at1% P er cent, interest. Part of this money is to be devoted to assisting farmers who are overburdened with debt. Surely they would prefer it to be raised from the Commonwealth Bank at li per cent, than at twice that rate from the Shylocks. Under a law recently passed by this Parliament the Commonwealth Bank has become the bankers' bank; it is the prop which supports the private banking institutions; yet it is passed over at this time so that the private banks and the insurance companies may reap profits out of this loan. About Â£6,000,000 will be required to pay interest and brokerage charges on this loan of Â£15,000,000 over a period of fourteen years. Surely a part of that could well be devoted to assisting the farmers and the secondary industries. The Government promised to do wonderful things for the unemployed, and was going to appoint a special Cabinet Minister to administer unemployment relief measures. We find, however, that no sooner was the coalition with the Country party formed than the only man who knew anything about the unemployment problem was relegated to the back benches. I refer to the ex-Minister for Commerce (Mr Stewart), who is now to be called an under-secretary. Because the ex-Minister for Commerce actually suggested that the number of working Mr Garden. hours should be reduced, the Country party saw to it that there should be no place for him in the Ministry.",53
202,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,He was a sweater.,54
203,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"No ; he was not. He understood the psychology of the workers, and also understood that, with the introduction of machinery the number of working hours would have to be reduced. This loan is part of the process of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Government is raising a new loan to pay off an old one, and the last position will be worse than the first. Ministers appealed to honourable members on this side of the House to join with them in overcoming the problem of unemployment. They said that they desired to rehabilitate the country, and that they had evolved a scheme, a system of planned economy. But their plan seems to be so obscure that even their own supporters do not know what it means. All they know is that part of a sum of Â£200,000 is to be spent in the Cook electorate on the provision of an automatic telephone exchange. The Government, by refusing to give information on this matter, has confirmed my impression that it is no wonder that parliamentary institutions^",54
204,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,The honourable member will not be in order in reflecting on parliamentary institutions.,54
205,Mr GARDEN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I was merely about to say' that, as the Government declines to give any information to Parliament, the only conclusion to which we can come is that Parliament has ceased to be a deliberative body, and has become merely a registering body for what is decided upon somewhere else by some inner group which is not operating in the best interests of this country. That inner group knows no country, is of no clime, and of no colour. It is international in character, and where it can make profits will do so. It is making profits now at the expense of the farmers, the manufacturers and the workers of this country, and yet the Government is carrying on with the same old policy in the same old way.",54
206,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"East Sydney) [10.13] The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) in the course of his brief and uninformative opening remarks, held out as bait, in order to secure the support of the Opposition, a promise that some of the money which it is proposed to raise will be spent on the relief of unemployment. Are we to understand that the expenditure of Â£200,000 by the Postal Department for automatic exchanges and telephone trunk services is all that is being done in the way of unemployment relief between now and Christmas? The Minister, by way of interjection, stated that oventually an amount of Â£15,000,000 was to be raised, and that part of this was to be devoted towards the assistance of primary producers. Much has been said about the debts of the primary producers, and their need for relief. I do not favour the granting of relief to primary producers in regard to their debts by making loan money available to them. The only effect of that would be to transfer the load from one set of shoulders to another, and the second set of shoulders in this case would be those of the workers. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) told us a few weeks ago that the Government proposed to adopt new methods to meet newly-arisen circumstances, but it is now evident that it proposes to stick to the old ways that have landed us in the trouble in which we are today. It seems to me that the bankers are to have an opportunity to receive a further annual tribute from the people of this country. As other speakers have said, the Government's policy has only accentuated the difficulty. As a matter of fact I am in disagreement with many speakers on this side of the House in that I am not favourable to the use of loan moneys to pay bounty to primary producers to allow them to continue in uneconomic production. We have been told that private enterprise provides the only opportunity for the economic salvation of this country. If private enterprise is to show us a way out it should do so by relying upon its own resources, not expecting the payment of bounty to enable it to continue in uneconomic production. The Minister has informed us that a plan is being prepared, but that at present he is not able to indicate what works will be carried out by the allocation of this money. If I remember correctly a similar statement was made by the Prime Minister at the opening of the last Parliament when the right honourable gentleman said that a sub-committee of Cabinet was preparing plans to tackle the problem of unemployment. Apparently all the Minister can say now is that further plans are being prepared. I do not know who is preparing them, but we should be told what is to be done to assist the unemployed. What is concerning the unemployed today in this country is not the estimated provision of work, but that they should get such a share of the work as will ensure that they receive the necessaries of life. If the Government is unable to provide works to be carded out with this money let it utilize the money to provide the unemployed with food, clothing and shelter. Men without work cannot go on waiting for the Government to devise some plan to place them in employment whilst they and their dependants are without the bare necessaries of life. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) has stated his opinions with regard to the present functions of Parliament and exactly what services we render to the community. As a matter of fact the opinions which I held before I entered this Parliament are confirmed by my experience as a member of it. We have a kind of cloaked dictatorship, and members of this Parliament are only regimenting decisions arrived at elsewhere. I believe that not one honourable member sitting opposite really desires to assist the unemployed. The only time that anti-Labour members ever give consideration to the plight of the unemployed is when the numbers of these become so large that they constitute a menace and are liable to take the law into their own hands and possibly jeopardize the investments of the wealthy members of the community.",54

209,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Order ! The sincerity of honourable members must not be questioned.,55
210,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I am discussing the motives of the Government and we have to use our imagination in this matter as little information is given in the bill and in the speech delivered by the Assistant Treasurer. The unemployed can only come to the conclusion that this measure has been brought forward by the Government for the purpose of deluding them into the belief that something tangible is to be done for them, whereas the money will be devoted to other purposes. Because of the reshuffle of Cabinet Ministers there is bound to be some delay, but I am satisfied that this Government will do nothing to assist the unemployed, and that no relief will be given until the unemployed make their pressure felt by letting Ministers know that their patience is almost exhausted. If the unemployed are compelled to take forcible action against the Government no .one could blame them. Members of Parliament view the position of unemployment from quite a different angle to those who are suffering from its effects. They have their Parliamentary allowances, and most honourable members on the other side of the House derive means from other sources.",55

212,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I am discussing whether the Government is doing anything to assist the unemployed. The unemployed are growing impatient. Members of Parliament are quite prepared to do everything to help themselves by increasing their allowances, but when it comes to dealing with the problems that confront this country they are not so ready to respond. They talk and waste a good deal of time.",56

216,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The Minister may, if he thinks it desirable to do so, when replying to the utterances of honourable members, give the .House an indication of what this anti-Labour Government intends to do. In my electorate, as in others, the unemployed have banded themselves into various organizations. They have organized because they feel the necessity for it, and they are anxious to secure information. I do not intend to go to the unemployed organizations in my electorate and tell them to wait patiently, because the Government intends to assist them, if it really intends to do nothing for them. I want the Government to state exactly what its intentions are in regard to these unfortunate people.",56
217,Mr CLARK,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Darling) [10.25] - I do not propose to delay the House at any length in voicing my remarks on this bill. As a new member, I am surprised to find that in bringing in a measure designed to raise over Â£5,000,000 so little information is supplied as to what is proposed to 'be done with the money. An amount of Â£200,000 is to be spent in the Postal Department on telephone exchanges and trunk line services, while Â£50,000 is to be spent in advertising and procuration fees. In other words, only four times as much money is to be provided for employment as is to go to the big capital interests. The unemployed are not likely to get a great deal of that sum, but, like the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan), I say that the whole of the money could be spent in my electorate. I have here a sheaf of letters dealing with applications which have been made for improved telephonic services throughout my electorate. People are writing to me demanding that improvements should be made in the services in their districts. A typical case is that of people who wish to speak from Colbar to Broken Hill 300 miles distant. In order to link up with Broken Hill they have to talk over wires via Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and it is difficult at times with interruptions to know if they are connected with the right subscriber. No cross country lines have been provided. This is a very necessary public work, and if the Government is looking for avenues to absorb some of the unemployed these cross country telephone lines could be built thereby, encouraging people to live in the distant places. I have here a letter from Abbotsford Station, Ivanhoe, in the back-blocks of New South Wales, in which the writer points out that the outback telephone service is obsolete. The writer goes on to sayThe matters of linking Broken Hill Sydney along the existing railway poles all intermediate centres could avail is lutely necessary as also linking Euriowie with Milparinka by using the old Tarrowingieness Broken Hill railway rails for telephone Bringing the twenty odd subscribers now Mossgiel direct on to Ivanhoe and making Ivanhoe a continuous service is an urgent essential. I have another letter from the Country Women's Association of New South Wales, the Far-West Group, at Nyngan, in which the writer states that at Far-West Group conference of the Country Women's Association held at Cohar the following resolutions were carried:(1) That the Postal Department approached to extend the telephone communication from Barnato to cannia. (Z) That the Postal Department be approached to extend the copper for telephone communication from Nyngan to Cobar. The distance is about 100 miles, and there is a considerable amount of traffic between the two towns, but in that of 100 miles there is no telephone service. I suggest that the putting in hand of work would be a sensible way of spending the money. In western New South Wales, there are considerable difficulties in obtaining anything like satisfactory telephone service. occasions, one hears about ten voices the line, and it is difficult to know is the voice of the person to whom one is speaking. The country people That demand a proper telephone service. This is Christmas relief work, for which Â£200,000 is being made available.",56
218,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"A reference to public work would be in order, but that can scarcely be said of the details of postal undertakings.",57
219,Mr CLARK,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The provision is not ample for the work that needs to be I could quote from quite a number of letters that I have received during the short period that I have been in this Parliament, to prove that there is great demand in the back parts of New South Wales for facilities of the kind covered by the bill. The provision of Â£200,000 is altogether inadequate. The honourable [121 member for Parramatta (Mr Stewart), who is in charge of employment, is looking for avenues in which money may be with spent in giving relief. There are none so that better than those that I have indicated. absoThe Government has stressed its prepared to do more than it has previously poles. done in the absorption of the unemployed. at Works of a substantial nature could be undertaken immediately if the necessary finance were made available.",57
220,Mr MULCAHY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Lang) [10.32] - Like many honourable members who have preceded me, I , as a new member, am surthe prised at the lack of information imparted to honourable members by the Minister in charge of the bill. The pro-, vision of Â£200,000 for telephone and trunk line services will do little towards be providing relief for the unemployed. WilDuring the recent election campaign the position of the boys who are leaving school was stressed, not alone by the party line with which I am privileged to be associated, but also by every other party; and the promise was universally made that action would be taken to make employment available for those who were gap completing their education throughout Australia. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr. this Casey) has given - no indication as to how the money to be raised by this loan is to be spent. Even had he done so, the amount to be borrowed is so small that a practically no relief will result from it. On A few weeks ago 143,000 young men and on women sat for the leaving certificate in which New South Wales. Not 2 per cent, of those can be found employment today. is one of the big problems that faces Australia, and the Government should have endeavoured to make some provision to meet it. I had hoped that before the a festive season arrived the Government avould have seen its way clear to restore the cut made in invalid and old-age pensions. Reproductive public works are awaiting attention throughout the Commonwealth. I was surprised to hear the done. honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) say that in the city of Brisbane sewerage works have still to be carried out. This Government should make money available to public bodies that control such undertakings, in ordeT that employment might be given to those who are out of work. An honourable member who sits on my left asked to-night, "" Where are the thousands of people who are out of work in Australia?"" Were he to visit my electorate, which contains 65,000 persons, he would find in it from 10,000 to 15,000 returned soldiers who are willing to work but cannot obtain it. Those men did their job overseas faithfully and well, and it is the duty of the Government to see that remunerative employment is found for them. The dependants of those who went overseas are entitled to special consideration. While these men were absent from Australia they missed opportunities to make provision for their children, while others who built up fortunes during the war were enabled to do all that was necessary for their families. I hope that the Government will find not Â£5,000,000, but Â£50,000,000 for the provision of employment. Instead of devoting the sum of Â£50,000 to charges connected with the raising of the loan, the services of the Commonwealth Bank should be requisitioned for the raising, of the money. As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) has pointed out, the credit of Australia stands as high today as that of any other country. I trust that the Government will bring down an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, so that the credit of Australia may be utilized with the object of bringing some measure of prosperity to the people of this country. - Mr FROST (Franklin) [10.40] - I gret that the Government has brought forward such a miserably inadequate proposal. During the last election cama paign the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), undertaken. whose illness I deplore, and practically every honourable member opposite, that they would accept a greater share the responsibility for the unemployed. Yet what do we find? Although they poses were returned with a good working majority it has taken them two months to form a Ministry. The unemployed have been given no consideration, will receivenone in the future. When required. the Loan Council met a couple of weeks ago the Premiers of the different States expected that a loan of at least Â£15,000,000 would be raised. The Assisfor tant Treasurer has not stated whether Â£5,000,000 is to be used for the purpose of relieving unemployment or to discharge other commitments. We have been told that it is necessary to get at the root of the evil of unemployment. I assure honourable members that that stage will not be reached by the raising of small loans. The leaders of the parties that sit opposite promised that at least Â£50,000,000 would be devoted to this most deserving object. Those who have lived and worked amongst the unemployed realise that the expenditure of at least Â£50,000,000 is necessary if Australia is to be rehabilitated. Any number of reproductive works could be put in hand throughout Australia. Employment could be found for every person who is out of work in Tasmania if money could be obtained at a reasonable rate of interest. Recently, a commencement was made with the development of the hydroelectric scheme in that State. Every horse-power of electricity generated was purchased, and orders were received from different companies for large blocks of power, but .money could not be obtained to undertake the necessary extensions. The Premier of Tasmania received from the Loan Council a small loan for which he has to pay a fairly high rate of interest, and that has a tendency to impede the work. The Commonwealth could safely lend to the Tasmanian Government what it needs, because some large companies have, signed contracts that would ensure a liberal rate of interest on the total sum involved in the construcretion work. Yet the Premier of the State has to go cap in hand to the Loan Council for funds to enable work of such reproductive character to be Hobart and adjoining towns have been short of water, said and a large scheme has been forof mulated for the conservation of water that has been used for hydro-electric pur; but the local authorities are unable to raise the money required to carry out the scheme. Although private banks have offered to lend the necessary funds, and the sanction of the Loan Council is Thousands of small fruit-growers in Tasmania are unable to obtain markets their produce. Their best market, this normally, is in Sydney, but on account of the unemployment evil the people of Sydney are unable to purchase fruit on the former scale. If the growers do not receive assistance they will be forced upon the labour market, or practically on the dole, within twelve months. Much help was expected from the Country party, which is now being absorbed by the United Australia party. "" I regret that members of the Country party have practically sold their principles to their opponents.",57

222,Mr SPEAKER,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"As the remark is considered offensive, it must be withdrawn.",59
223,Mr FROST,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I withdraw it, but I regret that the Country party is not now in a position to give the producers the assistance it promised at the last elections. The sum now proposed to be raised is inadequate for the rehabilitation of the rural industries. The majority of those engaged on the land live frugally. They are practically the builders of the Empire, but through no fault of their own they are now in a bad way. The Government should have brought forward a proposal adequate to assist both the primary producers and the workers, whose interests are closely interand related.",59
224,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [10.50] - I should have imagined that what I said in moving the second reading of the bill was sufficient to explain its purpose. The criticism from the Opposition seems to be divided roughly into two classes. In the first place it is said that the Government has in some way attempted to thwart the authority of the Parliament by the introduction of this measure, and the second class of criticism is on the lines of "" Why hurry?"" Replying to the first objection, I repeat that this bill, in the main, seeks authority to borrow money. It is not an appropriation bill, except in regard to the Â£200,000 allocated for postal works. Authority is sought to borrow a net amount of Â£5,000,000. I think there can be very few members who do not know the way in which the Loan Council operates. This body is a collection of representatives of sovereign governments, one of which is the Commonwealth Government, and usually the Commonwealth representative is the chairman. Its principal business is to consider what loan moneys are required by the respective governments for the carrying out of loan works and for other purposes for which loan moneys are required during the financial year, and it then considers if and when that money can be raised. In the three years immediately prior to the present financial year, the Commonwealth Government has not borrowed money from the public, and has not been directly interested in the loans that have been floated. They have all been loans for State governments raised by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the Loan Council. This Government has now come into the loan field, and through its representative at the last meeting of the council, sought and obtained authority for the inclusion of the sum of Â£5,000,000 in the loan programme of all the governments for this financial year. Loans are raised normally at certain times which are considered most suitable from all points of view. One of those periods is approaching, and the council decided a few weeks ago that a loan should be raised on the Australian market in November, so the Commonwealth Government sought for, obtained from the council, authority to include in the borrowing programme for this financial year an extra amount of Â£5,000,000. If the Commonwealth Government is to participate in the loan raising in the near future it is necessary and to obtain legal authority for so doing from this Parliament. It is not necessary to remind honourable members that this is a new Government. We now have in process of preparation plans for works to provide employment and for rural relief and other purposes, but since we have been in office we have not had time to develop them in full detail to such a stage that they could be incorporated in an appropriation bill. We are bringing a simple, honest and straightforward measure before the House, seeking authority to borrow this amount of money, and at the same time we are giving an assurance that at the earliest possible moment an appropriation bill will be submitted indicating in precise terms the manner in which the money will be used. In general terms, it is intended to use the money for unemployment relief and rural rehabilithe tation ; but in due season specific mation will be furnished on these point3 together with the necessary appropriation bills. I am not saying at the moment whether this Â£5,000,000 will be the only amount that will be used for these pur^ speakers. poses in this financial year, although honourable members have endeavoured to 'ffaw such an inference from my speech. We are now discussing a bill which seeks authority for the floating of a loan of Â£5,000,000 net. I can say definitely, however, that Â£200,000 of the money will be used for postal works. This amount in addition to Â£1,000,000 already approbe priated for that purpose in the Loan of last August, and it is also in addition lieve unemployment. to the amounts that will be spent from revenue on postal works.",59

229,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,I did not say that.,60
230,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The honourable member is certainly said that the money would absorbed in paying interest, and Bill that none of it would be used to reI must give the most direct contradiction possible to both those contentions. We are not borrowing money to pay interest in this country. Interest is paid solely from revenue and customs taxation. I trust that the honourable member will bear that in mind as when he is making speeches on other I make this contradiction be the honourable gentleman's remarks be cabled abroad, and do great injury",60
231,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"My statement was year the nevertheless quite correct. Go Mr Casey - I again give a direct denial to the honourable member's remark.

233,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"I am tempted to travel now along the attractive avenue of moneGotary controversy, but it would not be for me to do so at this hour and on this occasion. The honourable member for to Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) suggested that the Government had some fell purpose to serve in not allow to ening the Commonwealth Bank to subThe fact is that the Government would be delighted if the Commonwealth Bank subscribed fully as it desired to the loan. should be glad if the honourable member would use his influence with the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board to this end.

I have now fully explained to House why the bill hag been introduced in this way, and why it is not possible supply fuller information of the works which the money will be spent. I assure honourable members generally that appromitting priation bills setting out the purposes which the money will be used will be introduced as early as possible. Mr Holloway.:-Will it be possible spend any of this, money this year?",60

235,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"West Sydney). [11.6]. - In his reply,, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) certainly did give the more detailed information than he did in his. opening speech, but even now the fullest information has not been made available to. honourable members. Certain happenings at meetings of the Loan Council to which, he referred are merely routine matters. The honourable gentlethan man pointed out that,, on this occasion, the Commonwealth was entering the loan field, which it had not occupied for some time previously. I take it that if the Commonwealth intended to enter that field, it would have to tell the Loan Council the reasons for so doing, and some indication of the way it proposed to allocate the amount to be raised. understand that the Loan Council does not approve of the States entering into much shadow-sparring. commitments unless they can satisfy it as regarding the purpose to which the I money will be applied. Atleast,. I believe that is the procedure, but as the reports of the proceedings of the Loan Council are not by any means, full, it is to ascertain the real position. goI gather also that questions are frequently asked regarding the rights of to subsidiary governmental bodies to do certain things, and that criticism is sometimes directed to proposed works on the ground that they will not be reproductive. the If the Commonwealth is not required to submit details of its proposals to the to Loan Council, my contention is robbed on of some of its point; but I cannot conceive of any government sub- proposals to the Loan Council for without knowing its own intention. If , as the Minister said to-night, there was no definite plan submitted to the Loan to Council, the Government has departed from what it stated during the election campaign. In a broadcast election speech dealing with rural rehabilitation, the leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) mentioned Â£12,000,000 as the sum necessary for certain purposes, on the basis of Â£400 for each producer. This particular clause deals with 'the right of the Treasurer to do certain things. I am not concerned so much with his rights, as with the right of this committee to know what is intended. According to an interim report of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry,, not Â£12,000,000, but Â£140,000,000 is needed to rehabilitate that industry alone. I should like to know how much of the Â£5,050,000 is to be alloHouse cated to rural rehabilitation.",61
236,Mr SCULLIN,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Non e of it .,61
237,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"This is also a live question with other primary producers those who grow wheat. I am trying to ascertain what is in the mind of the Government, and how far it proposes to go with its rural rehabilitation scheme. The Minister's statement that tliere is no definite scheme, besides being unsatisfactory, is not in accordance with the give Prime Minister's policy speech. When that speech wasdelivered there was> I apparently, a definite scheme; if not, the whole thing appears to have been so Those who focussed public attention on the Government's proposals mtfst have had some information at their disposal, or else they were misleading the public and not acting in a bona fide manner. ""The Assistant Treasurer should tell us what proportion of the amount to be raised is to be allocated to rural rehabilitation and how much to the relief of unemployment. The large body of unemployed in New South Wales, as well as those in the other States, should know what they can expect.",61
238,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [11.10] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked for information regarding the procedure at meetings of the Loan Council. It is not usual at such meetings for one government to criticize the works programme of another, although it is true that at the beginning of a financial year all governments bring to the Loan Council a general list of the principal works which they propose to undertake during the following twelve months. It is, however, not obligatory on them to do so. The Loan Council is concerned chiefly with the total amount which each government desires to borrow during the financial year.",62
239,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Has not the Council the power of veto?,62
240,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Not as regards the individual works policies. The Commonwealth Government did not bring to the Loan Council a detailed schedule of the works proposed to be undertaken, for the simple reason that it was not in the position to do so. It presented to the Loan Council no greater information than I have given to honourable members to-night.",62
241,Mr BEASLEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,Was the Government's rehabilitation scheme discussed?,62
242,Mr CASEY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Not in the sense which I think the honourable member means. A Commonwealth Minister did describe, in general terms, what his government had in mind; but he did not mention any amount. As to the latter part of the honourable member's speech to-night, I cannot add anything to what I have already said, but I assure him that no fuller information was given to the Loan Council than I have given here to-night.",62
243,Mr LAZZARINI,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Werriwa) [11.13]. - The Assistant Treasurer treated the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) in a cavalier fashion when he asked for information. I was rather astounded to hear from the Minister that the sum of Â£5,050,000 may, or may not, cover the whole of the expenditure considered necessary to give effect to the policy of the Government in regard to unemployment, rural relief and other matters. If it does cover the whole programme of the Government, I agree with the honourable member for West Sydney that both parties in the Ministry have thrown their plans overboard. Surely the Assistant Treasurer can give us an outline of the Government's proposals, even if he cannot give us the details. It is not sufficient for him to say that the Government has not considered the details. Some consideration must have been given to them otherwise how did the Government arrive at its estimate of Â£5,050,000? How does the Government know that Â£5,000,000 will be enough to do all that is necessary ? It is all very well for the Assistant Treasurer to talk about the good faith of the Government, but we have heard that sort of thing before. It seems to me that the Government is making a deliberate attempt to sidestep the Loan issue. I said in my second-reading speech that some of this money might be used to pay interest on old debts. I did not say that it would be so used. Loan money has been used for this purpose before, and it may be so used again. It would save time if the Government supplied the information asked for, because I have known the House to be kept sitting all night when a Minister refused to supply information sought. I do not wish to have to tell my constituents that I agreed to a proposal for borrowing money without knowing what the money was to be spent on. We have been told that this Â£5,000,000 is to be devoted to rural rehabilitation, unemployment relief and several other things, and we know that so small an amount would be of no use whatever for those purposes. The honourable member for West Sydney showed prescience in attempting to move an amendment at an earlier stage the effect of which would be to tie the Government down to something definite. Evidently he knew that the Government was trying to put something over honourable members, and I for one am not prepared to accept it. Motion (by Mr THOMPSON) putThat the question be now put.

(Purposes for which money may be expended.)",62
244,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Melbourne Ports) [11.29] - I do not want to hold up the debate. My desire is that the work shall go on but I wish to know whether the Commonwealth Government itself will control the expenditure of this money and the carrying out of the works to which it is to be devoted. I am not concerned with the question of whether or not the money is to be allocated to the States, although as a matter of fact more work probably should be done under the jurisdiction of the States than under that of the Commonwealth. What I want to know is whether the Commonwealth is going to spend this money itself or to hand it to the States. If the latter course is to be followed then I hope the Government will take a lesson from the failure of the States during the last three or four years. 11 Their policy of spreading the work by the lowering of standards has not inAYES. creased the cumulative spending power of the mass, and has thus failed to increase the demand for commodities. The Government must know that the policy of spending Commonwealth grants on rationing and relief work has failed to achieve the purpose that we had in view. For several years we have asked more than one Commonwealth Government to use its influence with the State Governments to see that the work for which the Commonwealth grants provide is carried out under normal-working conditions and that the money is not spent on relief work which has failed to bring NOES. about the restoration of business activities as we had hoped. I ask the Government to take a lesson from the failure of the States which still have money in hand. Victoria still has in hand a considerable portion of the amount allocated to it for unemployed relief purposes; yet every one knows that the unemployment problem is just as difficult in Victoria as it was a year ago. It may be that, taking into consideration PAIKB. the temporary activity associated with the Centenary, there are fewer people registered at the bureau. But the increased numbers at work represent only those who are getting part time employment under a relief scheme. In the aggregate, the spending power of the people has not been increased. Surely the introduction of this measure is in itself sufficient evidence that the depression instead of having been bridged over is becoming more widespread. The Government has often pointed out that the banks are overflowing with money. There is more money ready for those who desire it-and at a cheaper rate-tha n ever before. But no one wants to borrow it since there are no avenues in which it can be profitably employed. There is no safe avenue in which it can be invested, because there is no demand for the goods which can be produced. The spending of money on relief work has not created a demand for goods and services because the wages the men receive do not create a market. Does the Government intend to spend this Â£15,000,000 on sustenance or relief work, spreading it over a large number of people, rolling it out thinner and thinner, but in the aggregate not adding one fraction to the spending power of the people? It is because of that policy that we have failed in the past. Three or four years ago every one said that unless we could create an extra demand for goods and services on the part of the community, by putting more people to work, then we should be unable to do anything to restore the business activities of any of the States. We have not restored business activities.",63
245,Mr HUGHES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,We cannot while the honourable member keeps on talking.,64
246,Mr HOLLOWAY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"The right honourable gentleman has been talking for years on this very problem. I am glad that he is now going to take a hand in its solution. Maybe he will join with the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) in setting up a new plan. They will get the assistance of everybody in this House. A new plan is absolutely necessary. Can the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) give the House any information to-night as to whether it is intended that the Commonwealth shall carry out works on the same conditions as operate in the States, or whether it is proposed 'to employ labour under normal and full-time conditions. If the latter course is followed, some good will result from the provision of this work. But if it is proposed to continue work for sustenance, what happened last year in the States must inevitably happen again. Last year, the States had several more million pounds to spend than in the previous year, and I presume they have spent most of that money; yet the cost of pensions has gone up by Â£1,000,000 in the same period, the number of pensioners increasing by from 7,000 to 8,000. This year there is more money than ever before, and rates of interest .are lower, which proves that the policy which has hitherto been carried out has failed. I iope that the Government will take a lesson from the failures of the States, and will not utilize this money for relief work on sustenance, but will employ labour under .regular full time conditions.",64
247,Mr JAMES,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Hunter) [11.37] - This clause is very indefinite. It does not specify upon what works the money is to be spent, or whether it is. to be handed over to the States in order to continue the system of relief works which they have under way, a system which is known as the emergency food relief scheme. The men employed on work of this nature are called upon to labour in sewers and drains, and are paid an allowance which is not adequate to maintain them in a decent standard of comfort. They have frequently been known to fall down on the job through malnutrition. If it is proposed to hand this money over to the States to carry out such works, the unemployed will give no credit to this Government for its provision. Recently, in New South Wales, a number of men have been dismissed by the Lake Macquarie Shire Council because it was claimed that the men were malingering. Many meetings of protest have been already held, at which responsible public .men have avowed that the men were doing a fair day's work. Apart from the schedule to the bill, I am unaware as to how this money is to he allocated; all that honourable members know is 'that a certain amount is to be allocated for the improvement of postal facilities. This measure is only tinkering with unemployment, and in no way will afford any real relief to the unemployed. In the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) it was stated that it was proposed to raise, not Â£5,000,000, but Â£20,000,000, and I contend that this bill in no way redeems the promise which the right honourable gentleman then made. The unfortunate people who are unemployed are entitled to more consideration at the hands of this Government. In my electorate, and it is characteristic of many others, many men today who formerly did not know what want was, and for years lived in comfortable circumstances, but have been forced through loss of employment to vacate their homes, although in some cases as little as Â£80 remained still to be paid in respect of the purchase money.  The honourable gentleman is getting away Baker, F. M . J. from the clause. Mr JAMJ2S - I pvopose to connect Beasloy, my remarks with, the clause. These men Brennan, F. have had no opportunity to better their Clark, J. J. position. Irrespective of their condemCurtin, J. nation of the Nationalist Government, Drakeford, and their claim that under the regime of Frost, C. W. the Lyons Government unemployment had Garden, J. S. increased, and that the unemployed should Green, A. receive more consideration, we find the members of the Country party new in Lyons, J. A. accord with the Government in a policy Harrison, which only recently they so roundly Hutchinson, W. J. condemned. The situation arises because to-night the Government has not given honourable members the information they should have. It certainly provokes one, even at this late hour, if , when one asks Â£200,000). for information, it is not forthcoming. The Minister should explain to the House clearly in what way it is proposed to allocate the money. I understand that the. Â£200,000 to be made available will allocated for improved postal facilities. Will the Minister explain to the House bow it is proposed to allocate the balance.",64

I hope that at the expiration of three years, or sooner, Queensland will have full ministerial representation. For quite a long time it has been represented by only an Assistant Minister.

When the war was in progress th*3e men were promised that they could have the moon, the sun, and the stars, but after the lapse of years the glories of war have been forgotten, and the unfortunate exsoldiera are given conditions that should not be offered even to criminals. Tenants whose purchasing power has been seriously reduced should not be penalized for their inability to carry out contracts which were entered into with the best of intentions. We have heard talk about avaricious landlords, but what is to be said of a department controlled by a government whose members promised that everything possible would be done to help ex-soldiers and now treat them shamefully? I wish that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) were in charge of war service homes, for then he would have an opportunity to carry out some of his promises to those who served at the front. I do not hold the present Minister responsible for the situation which now exists. I am merely informing him that unless a drastic change is made in the administration there will be serious trouble, and possibly open revolt. If the War Service Homes Department can afford to allow certain of these homes to be occupied at a rental of 8s. or 9s. a week, why should not returned soldiers who have submitted to all sorts of hardships in endeavour to meet their commitments be permitted to continue in occupation of them at the same weekly payment? Many of them contracted to buy these homes when their wages were twice what they are receiving today. The man whose case I have cited was receiving from Â£11 to Â£13 per fortnight when he assumed this liability, but, today, he is drawing only Â£7 fortnightly, and, consequently, it is impossible for him to carry on. I have mentioned only the case of a man who has not only been deprived of his home, but also threatened by the department with a garnishee order or something of that sort on his wages in an endeavour to get him to wipe out a debt which, under present conditions, it is utterly impossible for him to do. Indirectly, the department is depriving his wife and little children Mr Laazarini. of food which is absolutely essential to keep them alive. I informed the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) in a letter which I sent to .him with respect to invalid and old-age pensions that if Shakespeare were alive today and were to re-write the Merchant of Venice, he could include the right honourable gentleman as Shylock. I appeal to the Minister to go thoroughly into the details of this case, and to see if some consideration cannot be extended to this man who has done all in his power to meet his commitments, and even offered to vacate the home when his liability was only small. I submit these facts, not in the nature of a threat, but as a plain statement of the position, and I shall continue to pursue the same course even at 5 o'clock in the morning until these men receive from this Government the justice to which they are entitled.",67
256,Mr THORBY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Calare--Minister without portfolio in charge of War Service Homes) [12.29 a.m] - I may inform the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that it is my desire to obtain all the information I can in connection with specific cases that may be brought under the notice, of honourable members. I have no wish to defend any past action, for which I am not responsible, and of which we may not all approve, but every effort will be made to Bee that justice is done. I urge the honourable member and other honourable members not to discuss these matters at length in the House, but to call on me at my office and present all the facts so that they can be brought under the notice of the commission, and an endeavour made to give occupants fair treatment. The 'Commissioner of WaT Service Homes left Canberra for Sydney today to conduct certain investigations, and I ask honourable members, particularly those representing New South Wales constituencies, to supply me with full particulars as soon as possible so that I may bring them under the notice of the commissioner on Saturday or Monday next.",68
257,Mr MULCAHY,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Lang) [12.32 a.m.] I am quite satisfied from the correspondence that I have before me that the Minister will - do his best to .assist those experiencing difficulty in meeting their payments to the War Service Homes Commission, but I am afraid that the act will have to be amended before relief can be afforded. I brought one or two cases under his notice today, and I know that they will receive sympathetic consideration. The dependants of deceased returned soldiers occupying War Service Homes are entitled to more sympathetic consideration from the Government. I know from a conversation which I had with the Minister today that he is sympathetic towards widows with children, who have no chance of meeting the instalments on the homes which the deceased husbands contracted to purchase. [Quorum formed.] But the dependants of returned soldiers are entitled to more sympathetic consideration than they are receiving. I am sure that the Australian people would not quibble if the utmost generosity were shown to every deserving case. The Minister has given me an assurance, which I accept, that the persons against whom action is being taken in the courts tomorrow will not be evicted. I suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to the amendment of the War Service Homes Act. Widows of returned soldiers should be given the homes in which they live.",68
258,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"East Sydney) [12.39 a.m.] - I regret that the Minister Repatriation (Mr Hughes) is not preunder sent, for I wish to bring under his notice the fact that the ill-effects of certain regulations issued under the financial emergency legislation are still severely felt by certain pensioners. Regulations under that act laid down that Â£3 a fortnight was adequate for maintenwas ance purposes. A lady in the East Sydney electorate had her pension reduced to Â£1 5s. a fortnight on the ground that she was already receiving old-age pension of Â£1 15s. a fortnight. We were told some time ago that the cuts in war pensions under the Financial Emergency Act had been completely restored, but in this case, and in many others that I could name, they have not. Honourable members know that for the purpose of assessing income, i assumed that the income of a hope man and his wife is regarded as .matter being received equally by each of them, In the case to which I refer, the married again, and her husband was receiving an old-'age"" pension of 17s. 6d. a week. I immediately got into touch with the department and informed it that the total income of the pensioner and her husband did not amount to Â£6 a fortnight. The department replied to the following effect:Referring to your representations of the 8th September, 1934, on behalf of the abovenamed, I have to inform you that a war service pension may be paid to a parent only when he or she is without adequate means of support, and, for the purposes of this provision of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 11)20-1934, an income of Â£3 per fortnight for each parent from all sources U doomed to be adequate. Mrs waa married .to her present husband on the IStli October, 1928, and regard cannot be had to him when assessing payment of pension to the mother in respect of her deceased son. As Mrs 1receiy.es an old-age pension of Â£1 loe. per fortnight, her war pension cannot exceed Â£1 5s. per fortnight. I submit that in this case justice is not being meted out to this lady. I have spoken repeatedly in this House against the maintenance provisions of our pensions legislation, and although I have been informed that the financial emergency regulations no longer apply to war pensioners, I regret to say that this is not the case. We know of many cases of mothers of deceased soldiers whose for war pension was entirely eliminated the financial emergency legislation, and it has not since been restored. Mr TiiOHny - It was only eliminated being where there was other income.",69
259,Mr WARD,REPATRIATION COTTAGES AT,"Previousl y other income not taken into account. The mother of a deceased soldier received a pension as her right, and as some slight compensation for the loss she had sustained. an The case of many s-uch pensioners is worse today than previously, for other members of the family are now not able to contribute as much as formerly to the upkeep of the household. The Government should restore the pensions of these unfortunate people. I particularly appeal for a reconsideration of the case t is of the lady to whom I have referred. I that the Minister will bring this under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation in order that this widow woman, may receive just treatment. Question-That the House do now adjourn-put .

276,Dr EABM PAGE,OPTIONAL MATURITIES,"On 2nd the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked the P r i m e Minister the following question, upon not i c e : Will he inform the House what precautions were taken to ascertain whether the statement of accounta placed before the Government by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company upon the basis of which the retail price of sugar has been fixed] at 4d. a lb. until 31 st August, 1930, represented a true and correct valuation of the company's assets and profits? I am now in a ppsition to furnish the fpll o w in g reply fcrroperative until August, 1936, viz., 4d. per lb. retail, was not accepted by the Government on the basis of a statement of accounts or any other kind of statement submitted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. carefully considered amongst' other matters, relevant to a reduction in the price of sugar. In this connection, the Government had the benefit of the reports of the 1931 Sugar Inquiry Committco, which was appointed by the Scullin Government to investigate every phase of sugar production, distribution, and use in Australia. That committee included three separate representatives of consumers, viz., housewives, manufacturers, and fruit-growers, and it found unanimously that the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited from all its sugar activities in Australia during the three years immediately preceding the committee's appointment were equivalent to 7.1 per cent, of the original cost of all fixed assets as written down by depreciation allowances during 43 years, plus the average working capital required, for the purchase of coal, sacks, other materials, and raw sugar, and for the holding, and sale of' refined sugar stocks. In connection with theso Australian profits of the company, from 1928 to 1930 inclusive, the Government gave due attention to the fact that, under the plan of 1932' for a reduced Australian price, the company(a) would receive a lower return on all taw sugar produced by its seven millB in Queensland and New South Wales'; f it agreed to contribute towards the ducing its refining charge; (o) did not propose to increase its fees for administration and selling beyond the amounts originally fixed by the Commonwealth Government in 1915 and adhered to since then.
