1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 4 December, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. Mr SINC,LAIR (New England) (10.01)-The fragility of international law is no better demonstrated than by the failure of the League of Nations. Those who look back at the record of the League of Nations-we recall the aspirations of coming together and trying to find some sanction to compose international disciplines-will realise that World War I failed to really produce an animal that would solve international disputes and World War II produced the United Nations. The United Nations has regrettably not had a particularly happy record either. This statement that is now before the House reflects for the first time since the Korean war an attempt by the nations of the world to collectively assert a point of view which hopefully will in this instance persuade Saddam Hussein, whose invasion of Kuwait the world condemns, to withdraw and allow Kuwait to co-exist within that very war-torn and divided area of the world known as the Middle East. My concern in the debate today-there is only a lJ.rief time to look at it-relates to three things: firstly, the United Nations, secondly, the Middle East and, thirdly, the defence forces, because I do not think we can ignore the consequences of where we are following the Middle East deployment. In regard to the United Nations, I will very briefly refer to some of the problems of trying to assert international law. Law within a country is the product of having disciplines which are imposed. We go through the structure of the Australian court system; there are penalties, fines and imprisonment. Nations cannot be restrained in that same way. The difficulty with the United, Nations is to find a vehicle by which, firstly, we can reasonably get to some agreement within the United Nations that a common position should be adopted and, secondly, there has to be some vehicle by which reasonably we can ensure that compliance with whatever that resolution might be can be obtained. No one likes the use of force. I find that as one moves around within Australia there are inevitably, whatever theatre of war, people who have suffered because their loved ones, their forebears and, in some instances, themselves, have been involved in it. When we commit three warships, three Royal Australian Navy vessels, to the Middle East inevitably we feel for those whose family members are sailing on those vessels and for those who sail on those vessels; those who have taken the decisions that they should be committed feel that they are committing a selective group of Australians in a theatre which to my mind is no different from the commitment of an earlier government of Australians to Vietnam, no different from a commitment of earlier governments of forces to Malaysia, to Korea, to World War II or to World War I. I find it paradoxical that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his rhetoric about this speech has not. referred to the strong opposition that he registered at the time that the then government committed forces to Vietnam. To my mind Australia's role and the United Nation's role are all part of us as a small nation trying to ensure that in other theatres, theatres where we may not be direct participants, we can play some part to achieve a peaceful resolution. I find in this. particular instance it, pleasing that at least the Prime Minister has adopted what I would see as the totally proper course. It is only by countries being prepared to accept the discipline of the United Nations, a discipline which fortunately in this instance is so much better because we have been able to get the eastern world as well as the Western world to come to some common position, that we are in a position where perhaps the resolution of the problems in Iraq might be overcome. I am pessimistic that the United Nations, without a success in the Middle East, may well go the same way as the League of Nations. There has been a great deal of criticism in Australia, I think properly, of the role of the United Nations in recent years, and it is very sad that it has been unable to enforce any rule of law. I say to all those involved that there is far more at stake, in my view, than just a resolution of the problems of Iraq. If the United Nations could be made effective and if the resolutions of the United Nations could be more than rhetoric, then there is a chance of a vehicle by which peace could be truly achieved and truly applied. In discussing the Prime Minister's statement and looking at a decision that, quite properly, I think all members of this House are in concert should be taken, that is, to commit Australian vessels to the Gulf region, we need to be aware that there is probably far more involved. It is perhaps one of those few chances when not only can the Iraq situation be resolved but also the United Nations can be proved. I think that is quite fundamental. The second thing that worries me about this problem is the difficulties of the Middle East. Those of us who have been to the Middle East know something of the ancient enmities that exist there. I suppose that in Australia we all have friends from either side. I feel sad that within this Government there seems to be nobody really prepared to take up the Arab cause. The present Governor General and former Foreign Minister was one who at least tried to listen to the Arab. point of view. A decision has been pursued in almost a bipartisan way within this place that there should be an attempt to reconcile the views of the Arab nations with Israel. We have tried to be even-handed in our approach to the problems of each of those nations, and yet it has been extraordinarily difficult to do so. Within own constituencies we have people from different countries of the region and the situation becomes all the more difficult. Like many honourable members, I have been approached by people who have relatives in Iraq and Kuwait, those whose prejudices inevitably come from their relatives rather than necessarily from an understanding of the situation. It does concern me that, even if the resolution of the United Nations were successful and the sanctions against Iraq achieved the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, were that alone to be the result the problems in the Middle East would not be resolved. Saddam Hussein has pursued chemical warfare tactics against his own Kurdish minority. He has developed a capacity, either now real or imminently so, to launch a nuclear attack on nations in the region. He seems to be a person who is committed to a wider Iraq dominion than any reasonable assessment of the politics of the region could accept. What Australia needs to do, in looking at this resolution and at the Middle East, is set down more clearly than we have-and certainly more clearly than I have found in the Prime Minister's statement or in his past actions-what Australia's long term policy in the Middle East should be. It is only about five years ago, as many of my colleagues will recall, that this Government withdrew its representation in Kuwait. Australia had a foreign post there. We pursued independently our policy in Kuwait. One of the difficulties in the circumstances of the takeover is that there was such inaccurate information about what was going to happen. The signs were all there. Saddam Hussein's actions against Iran were known. There was a general consciousness of the policies and programs being followed by Saddam Hussein, yet nobody read the signs correctly. Of course, Australia could not do so because we had withdrawn our post in Kuwait. That nation, along with others in the Arab League, exerts enormous power in the world, not just through its oil wealth but through the real wealth it has acquired because of oil, and it worries me that Australia does not seem to have a very our adequate long term program towards the Middle East. The second product of the statement by, the Prime Minister that I think is important is that we do not just act because we are members of the United Nations iIi,taking a stance on the Middle East and we do not just take a stance because we feel that it is the right thing to do with respect to the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. I would like to see Australia develop a more consistent - and certainly even-handed approach towards the Middle East, an approach which recognises both Israel's continued right to exist and also the peculiar individual politics of the countries of the Middle East. After all, Lebanon is in a mess""-and there are many Lebanese in Australia. I am delighted to know that one of my colleagues is about to go to Beirut. I think it is terribly portant that people from this Parliament and from Australia generally maintain contacts in the area. We need to establish more clearly than we have the lines by which Australia should develop and maintain its relationships with countries of the Middle East, because those relationships are quite critical. I have dealt with the United Nations and our policies towards the Middle East. The third thing that I want to say briefly is that it worries me that the envoys who have gone from Australia to seek from Saddam Hussein the release of hostages seem to be approaching the subject in a way that is not really enhancing the prospects for a long term solution to the problems of the area. I would like to see the hostages released, but we need to address the blame where the blame lies: it is Saddam Hussein who is at fault; he absolutely no excuse for holding thousands of people against their will in circumstances which put their lives. at risk. I have a great deal of sympathy for those who are there and for those who do not know where their relatives are or who, if they know where they are, are apprehensive that if the hostilities which this twelfth resolution of the United Nations, resolution 678, endorses should take place, ment like this. they might be the first casualties. We need to understand that we have to apply pressure to Saddam Hussein not by going on bended knee but by acting in concert. Napoleon long ago said that if he had to fight an enemy he would prefer it was a coalition. Let us try to make sure that our coalition within the United Nations can act in concert and that we do not undermine the efforts to put pressure on Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, for that is really what this is all about. Above all for Australia, this statement of the Prime Minister has another fundamental consequence on which I want to say a few things in conclusion. It marks the end of the Dibb report on Australia's defence capabilities as far as the Australian Defence Force (ADF) is concerned. I have been very critical of the Dibb report. I do not believe Australia can play a improper role if it is only going to defend within the confines of our national boundaries. We cannot defend our national interests only within those boundaries; we need to make sure that our Defence Force is sufficiently strong to be a an adequate deterrent so that no-one would want to attack us. As a consequence of our commitment in the Middle East, I hope we will recognise that a number of decisions must be taken within the Australian Defence Force. I am told that at the moment there are very few Australian vessels which could fulfil the active role on patrol in the Middle East. If that is so, those vessels that have been equipped for but not fitted with Phalanx missiles, for example, and missile deterrent weapons, need to be fitted with such equipment. The Government-if it believes, as I do, that it is necessary that has)) we commit Australian warships in the Middle East-needs to make spre that there are replacement vessels available. We have three DDG vessels and I understand only one is available at this stage to go to the Middle East. We have four FFGs; only three of them are available. There is a real problem in the adequacy of the equipment of the Australian Defence Force to be able to meet a commitIt worries me that in the circumstances of a commitment that the Prime Minister has said may require us to go to war, he then places limits on the extent to which Australia is prepared to be involved and says that it is not proposed to make any other contribution in naval, air or ground forces. There is no time restraint on that but I am concerned that there has to be an ability within the ADF to respond necessary. The Dibb concept has failed. The fitting of equipment for which vessels have origin in ally been designed needs now to be accelerated so that if there should be a need to increase the capacity of the tralian response we can do so. Of course, that involves not only the Royal Austrahave lian Navy (RAN); it also involves our looking at the operation deployment force at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville at the capacity of the Royal Australian Air Force, particularly the FIlls. Their· has been forced. avionics upgrade has not proceeded. I would like that upgrade to happen as soon' as possible so that, should it be necessary for them to be committed, they too will be available. One final aspect of this which, unfortuand nately, the Prime Minister has not adAustralia dressed-it has been addressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)is that there is a difficulty in knowing whether or not there are enough Austratralia lian sailors now in service with the Ausother tralian Defence Force to meet the one requirements of turnaround, turnover and replacement, if it should be necessary. RAN trained manpower has been declinwith ing. The morale of many in the Force has not been as high as it might be. I hope, therefore, that the Government will look not only at the adequacy of the equipin ment aboard RAN vessels but also at the availability of trained manpower so that, should there be a necessity to increase our commitment, people are trained and able to meet whatever commitment might be given to them. Above all, this country can never afford to send untrained personnel to war. Therefore, let us make sure that within the Services the people are properly cared for, properly treated, properly paid, propcountry erly remunerated and properly recognised after their return. If there is a need additional commitment, let us make sure that those people are available in the ence Force. At this stage I do not believe they are, and I am sad that the GovernPerhaps ment has not addressed that problem in this statement.",9
2,Mr BRADFORD,MIDDLE EAST,"MCPherson) (10.16) if - I am very proud-if pride is the appropriate emotion-particularly as a new member of this Parliament to participate a debate of such historical significance and importance as this one today. It is a - debate in which, in a sense, we are dealAusing with the committal of Australia and Australians to war. I, like all those who spoken, would have preferred that the Australian Parliament never had to discuss the possibility of committing Ausand tralians-many of them young Australians-to a war situation. But our hand As I am a returned serviceman-there are three returned servicemen currently serving in this House; the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), who was in the chamber until a moment ago, the Leader of the National Party of (Mr Tim Fischer) are the other two-I can empathise with the role that those serving in the Gulf are playing and what they and their families here in Ausmust be feeling. Indeed, I have anpoint of contact, in a sense, because of the early hostages, Miss Kim Hepworth, was a schoolteacher at Nerang High School in my electorate. I was involved her family in the negotiations for her release, which, thankfully, came very early. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talked his speech about the Australian Labor Party coming to this issue, in his words, with a lot of history. He rightly and, I think, frankly pointed .out that history has taught the Labor Party many lessons in this particular area. But I am reminded, as we deal with this matter, of its record on Vietnam. I cannot let this opportunity pass to remind the Labor Party and this House once again that the young men in Vietnam, who were fighting for what our believed in at the time, were horrified to hear that, while Australians were for dying in Vietnam, the man who was to become the Deputy Prime Minister of this Defcountry, Dr Jim Cairns, was collecting money to support our enemy at the time. he saw that particular war conveniently as being, to use the Prime Minister's words, someone else's war. Last night the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)-by .his own admission the only member of the lert wing faction of the Labor Par.ty who. IS speaking in this debate-descnbed VIetnam as a focus of conflict between East and West; it was not. It was a response by the West to blatant and naked. agg-es­ sion. As I compare what occurred In V-et­ nam with the situation we are dealIng with today, the difference on t-at occasion was that aggression was aIded and abetted by the Soviet Union and China. But things today have changed and they have changed dramatically. Today, if. we were dealing with Vietnam, the Untted Nations might have been competent enough to deal with th-t - ituatio-. But Vietnam is history. It IS InterestIng to hear my learned friend the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) expressing some reasons for b-ing pessimistic about the role of the Untted Nations and pointing out the dire necessity for the United Nations to s-cc-ed here. Surely there is room for optImIsm about the future of the United Nations. Both the Prime Minister and, I am very pleased to say, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have made reference to the importance of a bipartisan appro-ch to this current crisis in the Gulf. I SIncerely hope that the uni!y of suppo-t that is given in this respect IS reflected treatment of our troops who serve or may serve in this war when they return h<:,me. I indulge a little here by once again drawing a comparison with Vietnam, which was after all, the most recent full scale war' effort .that Australia was engaged in. For many years the treatm-nt of our veterans who returned from VIetnam was nothing short of appalling. Not only did they face the derision of t-e public for whom they had fought, but It was not until many years later that they received full recognition of the important role they played. In respect of Vi-tnam, it is important to note that, whIle. the United Nations may not have authonsed the use of armed force in that case, the United States of America and Australia, as America's ally, and a number of other countries as allies, recognised that we had a responsibility to resist the aggression of North Vietnam. The United Nations, for historical reasons being unable to act effectively then, was also in this context unable to prevent aggression and to act decisively in r.espe-t of East Timor in circumstances WhICh, In many respect;, are not greatly - issimilar to what has occurred in KuwaIt. In respect of East Timor, the United Nations, while demanding ,the withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor, faile- to adopt the hard line, and warranted lIne, that was taken in respect of the Gulf. The Gulf situation, therefore, is not without recent parallels. One significant difference, however, is the case of Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein. Here we have a man who is probably the most dangerous world leader of our time, a man totally without principles who has, in my view, been appropriately compared to Hitler. Many other people come to mind such as Idi Amin. I agree with the Prim- Minister's description of the invasion of Kuwait as an act of 'pure aggression'. In fact it may well have been more. It is a displ-y of aggression in its most deplorable form. Perhaps Saddam H';lssein thought that he would get away w-th it for he has shown an almost cavalIer disregard for inter-ationa- la,,:. Fortunately, on this occaSIOn, thIS. attItude - as In the been met with an appropnate reactIOn from the United Nations and indeed the rest of the world. Early resolutions enacted - y the United Nations in respect of Iraq Imposed economic sanctions. They do not appear to have worked to any great extent, and even if they are having some eff-ct, it .-ill ta-e time for them to alter Iraq s pOSItIon SIgnificantly. I would think that the world has come to realise that, in respect of Iraq, time is fast runn.ing out. T-e latest U'nited Nations resolutIon, resolutIOn 678, has in effect put an end to a stalemate and in the face of the intransigence of Saddam Hussein, it is the most appropriate and indeed called for course of actIOn. I endorse the beliefs of colleagues on both sides of the House. In this debate we have been almost uniquely united in our support. I agree with what has been said that it is very much in Australia's interests to support the United Nations-just as I might say I agree that it was in our interests for us to support the United States in South Vietnam. Australia is a large island nation, abundant in natural resources, but with a relatively small ence Force. As the right honourable member for New England said, it is a rather under-equipped and under-prepared Defence Force. So our continued relationship with allies, particularly the United States, is our guarantee of future national security, for we may well at some future point need to rely on the United Nations to protect us from an aggressor, in the same way that Kuwait, hopefully, will be shown to have been able to rely on the United Nations for that protection. I am pleased that the Prime Minister clearly addressed the role of the United States in his statement earlier yesterday. suspect that there would have been and are a number of Labor Party membersdespite the assurances last night of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)-who would not support Australia maintaining a close relationship with the United States. However, the high profile that America has taken in the Gulf situation and its willingness-and let us face it, if it had not been for the edness and willingness of the United States to be involved then what is happening there today could not have happened any other way-to promote and act on the United Nations resolution must be congratulated without any equivocation. The United States of America has once again displayed its preparedness to take a leading role in the preservation of world peace. That action cannot be diminished in any way. We must recognise that fact, for it is an integral part of the response of the United Nations, and the United Nations response could not have worked without the cooperation and involvement of the United States of America. No-one should doubt the resolve of the United States to accept the responsibility that it has as one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful nations. One factor in international relations that made the adoption of the latest UN resolution possible is, of course, the end of the Cold War, and a number of honourable members have spoken about that. But who would have thought that once again in so short a time we would see the Def- United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) uniting as al- \ lies once again, as of course they have been on previous occasions, particularly in the first and second world wars. While commending the Prime Minister on what he said yesterday, as most speakers have, on Australia's attitude, I must in a sense share the alarm expressed earlier by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) at the failure of the Government to announce what our response would or should be if the situation escalates in the Middle East. The only reference that the Prime Minister I made in his speech yesterday is one sentence: It is not proposed to make any other contribution of naval, air and ground forces. What I and many Australians want to know is: how will Australia react if Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait by 16 January and the American forces, supported by allies, actually move in against Iraq? I share the concern expressed by the right prepar- honourable member for New England about the capacity-and this raises a whole range of other issues-of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in respect of meeting not only that challenge but any other challenge that may arise. As allies we may be expected to increase our commitment through the deployment of air and ground forces and, if we are asked-indeed we may wonder whether we have been asked-what will the response of the Government be? Does the Government have a contingency plan in the event that we are asked to commit further forces? The left wing faction of the ALP has, I am sure, expressed a desire, and I believe quite explicitly, to limit Australia's contribution to the Gulf crisis, but what will the Government say if the allies call for help? If the situation there does escalate to war, it may not be over quickly. Iraq has shown an amazing capacity to fight. It has a one million person strong fighting force, and, added to that, is the wild card of Iran with a similar staggering force of over 640,000 troops, and no-one can predict the role that Iran will play should war break out. I ask: what chance did Kuwait have with a fighting force of just over 20,000? Iraq also has an arsenal of the most horrific weaponry, including chemical weapons, which do not fall far short of nuclear weapons in terms of their destructive capacity. We should be thankful that Hussein apparently does not have nuclear weapons, but we must also contemplate just how long it will be before he does. There is a suggestion it may be only months. If the allied forces have to move into Kuwait, the death toll will most certainly be high. Iraq, with its superior knowledge of desert warfare and the sheer number of its ground forces, will have the advantage. American forces are virtually untested in this environment, but United States air superiority will prove to be telling factor. But we have to hope and pray that it will not come to this. The whole matter can be settled by Saddam Hussein accepting the world's judgment of his actions and his handing back the nation of Kuwait to it- rightful government. But if the worse does happen, where will Australia be? The Middle East is for us an extremely important trading region, and we rely on its oil to an extent though our allies and trading partners rely on it even more. Despite some of the things that I have said, I am very pleased that we have in this Parliament a bipartisan approach to the commitment of forces to the Gulf. It is with pleasure that I note that, and I note particularly the Government's undertaking to keep the Opposition informed.",12
3,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDDLE EAST,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,15
4,Mr LEE,MIDDLE EAST,"This debate is probably one of the most serious in which I have ever participated in this House, for obvious reasons. Before I make some of the comments which I have prepared for this morning, I just want to respond to one or two of the remarks made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). I was also a bit concerned about the commerits made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) yesterday in his response to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Of course, I suppose that all honourable members should be grateful that this debate is taking place in a bipartisan atmosphere. Almost all speakers have used the word 'bipartisan' during their contribution. But I find it a bit distasteful when people make those comments and then go on to hint that there is some reason to doubt the support which some members on my side of the House have for this resolution. It is a bit hard if Opposition members on the one hand say that they are glad it is a bipartisan debate and on the other hand then try to score a few partisan points. I find that a bit contradicthe tory, not only of the honourable member for MCPherson but also of the Leader of the Opposition. If we are going to have a genuine bipartisan debate, I think we have to accept the good faith of all the members who participate in it, including people such as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and others who I think have made a considered contribution to this debate. One of the other points made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was that he was disappointed that the Prime Minister did not approach him when the Government made its first decision back in August to commit these ships to the Gulf. Frankly, I doubt that Prime Minister Menzies took the then Leader of the Opposition into his confidence when the Australian Government decided to make its initial commitment to the Vietnam war. In fact, if we read the history books, I think we must concede that a lot of information which was then available to the Menzies Government was not provided to the then Opposition executive. Perhaps a lot of the turmoil and disputes that followed from that conflict could have been avoided if people had tried to develop a genuine bipartisan attitude right at the beginning, instead of having a division on party lines throughout that ter.ribI'e conflict. So first of all, I acknowledge the fact that the honourable member for McPherson, all the other Opposition members, and honourable members on this side of the House have tried to make this debate bipartisan. It is something which is going to be very important if this conflict ends up being as serious as many of us believe. This debate has been triggered by the United Nations Security Council carrying its twelfth resolution on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Resolution 678 sets a deadline of 15 January for Iraq to get out of Kuwait. That vote was carried by 12 votes to two with one abstention, from Chinaan overwhelming majority. It is something which all of us hope and pray Iraq will take notice of. The Prime Minister's statement makes it clear that the Government will bring back the frigates HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide from their tour of duty, with the frigate HMAS Sydney and the destroyer HMAS Brisbane taking their place as Australia's contribution to the allied effort to try to pressure Iraq into withdrawing from Kuwait. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will gather from my age that I am not a veteran. I was only 15 in 1972 when the last Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam. Mr Bradford-You still look it.",15
5,Mr LEE,MIDDLE EAST,"The honourable member pays me the compliment of saying that I look like I was 15 in 1972. I make the obvious point that I am not a veteran and have not had to survive under the pressures of a war environment. However, my own electorate contains more veterans and war widows than any other electorate in Australia. As part of my duties, I regularly attend Returned Services League of Australia sub-branch functions and meetings with my local Vietnam veterans subbranch, and I would not be human if I did not take note of the many comments _. they make about the pain and suffering' which war has caused them and their families over many years. The honourable member for McPherson made many comments about the Vietnam war and I am sure that he, as a member of parliament, and as an individual, understands the suffering that that war is still causing for those who participated, in the overwhelming majority of cases, with great valour and courage. They represented their country with great distinction. The Vietnam veterans always make the point to me that, whatever their own personal feelings were about the justice or injustice of the Vietnam war, whether they were called up or had joined the defence forces, they thought it was their job to go to Vietnam if that was the decision of the elected government. I think it is a mistake on the part of some people to blame the veterans concerned because some people disagreed with the Government's decision to go to Vietnam. It was not the veterans' decision; it was the decision of the Government and ultimately of the Parliament of those days. That is why this debate is very important. It is very important that the Parliament has a chance to debate the Executive's decision, so I welcome the statement made by the Prime Minister and the opportunity that it gives to people such as ourselves to debate such motions. Mr Deputy Speaker, a little Dver a month ago,' you and I had the honour to visit Belgium as part of a delegation from this Parliament. One of the most moving moments of our overseas visit was to visit Ypres and,under your leadership, we laid a wreath at Menen Gate in Belgium where the names of 50,000 Commonwealth veterans who died in the fighting at Ypres in the First World War, but whose bodies were never found, are recorded. That was a very salient reminder for people such as ourselves and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), who was also a member of that delegation, of the terrible cost of war and the great loss of life which can result. We are all very nervous about what the ultimate outcome might be in the Gulf. It is important that we remember the past sacrifices our country has had to make on shores a great distance from Australia. Was it right for Australians to die in Ypres in Belgium in the First World War? I think it was justified because ultimately the sovereignty of a small country, Belgium, was threatened when Germany invaded in 1914. Because we were then a dominion of the Commonwealth, we did not have much choice; Australian troops were automatically involved in that war. But in hindsight, I think Australian troops were fighting for the freedom of the citizens of Belgium and that is something we can be proud of. Our involvement in the Second World War is probably easier to understand and justify. We had Japan threatening to invade our shores; we had the rise of fascism in Europe; and we had the horrors of the Holocaust and the other unforget"" table events that took place in Europe during the Second World War. So, as a young person who studies history, I suppose I do not have much difficulty in understanding Australia's involvement in that war and accepting that it was justified. We then come to the current conflict. Is there justification for Australia becoming involved in a war in the Gulf, if !-at happens after 15 January? There are some people who say that the West is there only because of oil. The obvious response 'to that, I suppose, is that Iraq probably would not have invaded Kuwait if Kuwait did not have any oil, and we would be denying the truth of the matter if we did not acknowledge that oil has to be factored into everyone's calculations on this dispute. The reason why the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq affects Australia's interests is ultimately it comes down to oil. Iraq, because it has invaded Kuwait, now controls about 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves. If Iraq is successful in· retaining Kuwait and Iraq has the ability to threaten and pressure the other oil producers in the Gulf, then ultimately Iraq will be able to influence the price and supply of about 40 per cent of the world's oil. And if Iraq can, through pressure and threats, turn the world's supply of oil on and off at will, that means that Iraq will decide whether the world economy will go into a recession next year; that Iraq will decide whether Australia's main trading partners, such as Japan and Europe, will slide into a recession next year; and that, ultimately, Iraq will decide the future of the Australian economy. That is why Iraq's actions are directly affecting Australia's interests. So, leaving aside the arguments about whether the people of Kuwait have the right to have their country and their freedom restored, I think it is easy to see that there is a direct. link between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Australia's national interests in the way that I have explained. I turn for the moment to the right of the Kuwaitis to have their legitimate government restored. Some people have argued that the Kuwaiti Government was an undemocratic feudal monarchy and that, for that reason, it is not worthy of our support. Mr Deputy Speaker, if we said that only countries that have Western-style democracies are worthy of protection, I am afraid there would not be very many countries that we WQuid ever be able to help, because, unfortunately, not many countries throughout the world can claim to be democracies. If we say that countries perhaps in our own region are not entitled to international protection· from an invader because they do not fit our formula of democracy, I am afraid we will be sentencing our neighbours to many more invasions as the years go by. I think it is important that we also concentrate on Iraq's record in recent years. Iraq has made no secret of the fact that it has already developed chemical and biological weapons; it has used chemical weapons against its own people, the that Kurdish minority. Such action has not been taken since the First World War, and that is something that is very hard for all of us to believe-that a country would use chemical weapons against its own people. At the same time, there is plenty of evidence to show· that Iraq is working hard at developing nuclear weapons. The Customs officials in Europe have seized trigger devices for nuclear weapons which the Iraqis were seeking to smuggle from Europe into Iraq. It is well known that the Iraqis have purchased the equipment needed to develop the technology to produce enriched uranium and other material which they will need for nuclear weapons. So who knows how long it will be before the Iraqis will have a nuclear weapon? I am very grateful that President Bush, after the Security Council resolution was adopted, made the offer to Iraq tl}at it could send its Foreign Minister to Washington to enable direct face to face negotiations. In return, Secretary of State Baker is to travel to Baghdad for discussions with President Hussein. All of us hope that those negotiations will be successful. We hope that Iraq will see the error of its ways and withdraw from Kuwait so that any use of force can be avoided. If it does not withdraw from Kuwait then I suppose the 26 Western allies, the 26 nations which have agreed to support the United Nations resolutions, will face the terrible choice: do they use force to try to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or do they use force to try to force Iraq out of Kuwait? That decision will decide whether large numbers of allied troops will be put at risk in time of war. That decision will be very difficult for those people to make. However, I do not believe that people can afford to turn away. I think back to what I have read about the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. Some people travelled from Australia to Spain to fight for what they thought was on the side of freedom and democracy. They thought it would be wron- for fascism to take control of Spain. Anyone who has read Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls will know that John Donne put forward the argument many years ago as to why Australia cannot afford to turn its back on Kuwait. We have to understand the phrase which John Donne used: . . . never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for the.",16
6,Mr WEBSTER,MIDDLE EAST,"1 would like to preface my remarks by commending the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). There is an old saying that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings comes great wisdom. He referred quite regularly to his youthfulness. We all have to acknowledge that there are times when he comes into this House and speaks with considerable wisdom, as he has today. I have no doubt about the sincerity of anybody on· either side of this House with regard to wanting to see a peaceful resolution to this terrible issue that confronts us today, not only as a nation but as an international community. I would like to commend the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on his statement to the Parliament yesterday on the Gulf crisis and to state that I support Australia's involvement in this crisis. The presence of the Royal Australian Navy in the Gulf region is necessary in support of our allies and our friends. The possibility of great loss of life disturbs me greatly and deeply, as it does all members of this place. I truly hope that this confrontation does not lead to war and result in the massive loss of life. I need not remind any of us that fathers, brothers, daughters, mothers and sisters will be lost at an alarming rate. We have all read with great horror of the transpor- . tat ion of thousands of body bags and tens of thousands of containers of plasma to the Middle East in anticipation of great loss of life. The international coalition is still holding firm and its objectives for the full and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait and the release of all hostages remain. President Saddam Hussein continues to show little sign that he intends to· comply with the will of the international community and withdraw. He continues to rebuff the United Nations. He continues to strengthen his military position in Kuwait, to destroy the fabric and national identity of Kuwait and to manipulate the fate of Australian and other citizens trapped in Iraq imd Kuwait. I understand that sanctions are still being applied rigorously. We hope that the existing pressures will suffice to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw. If they are not sufficient we nee? to. convin,ce him that the military optIon IS a senous one. The option for peace is in his hands. We remain anxious for the well-being of the many thousands of hostages and other citizens who remain in Iraq and Kuwait. Some have been released through the - ntervention of political figures and relatIves. We understand the suffering families and the humanitarian most of those who go to Iraq, President Hussein exploits these visits for his"" unacceptable ends, The international community is and must remain united in resisting that blackmail. Iraq initially committed an act of naked aggression against Kuwait, and the United Nations Security Council rightly insists on its unconditional withdrawal. Howhausted ever, firm adherence to that point does not mean that there can be no talking all, - t is the b-siness of diplomacy proVIde alternatIves to war. Whilst we have must use every means short of war to enforce the United Nations policy it would be foolish to rule out the use of force alast resort. One thing we must be very clear about today is that if a war is to fought it is a just war. I want to speak for a few moments about the concept of a just war. That concept antedates the Christian era and may be traced back both to the Holy Wars of the Old Testament and to some Greek and Roman ethical teaching. The notion was Christi ani sed by Augustine in the fourth century. It was systemised by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth cenfbc-ed, tury, further developed by Francisco de Vitoria in the sixteenth century and enm-te, dorsed by most of the reformers. It is held by a majority of Roman Catholics and Protestants today. I mention that because we commenced today with a very profound prayer, as always do, seekmg the guidance of Aldistinction mighty God. We certainly need to undertentional stand the concept of a just war in that context. It has been stated in various forms, although usually seven conditions with gard to a just war have been specified, namely: f-rmal - eclar-tion, last resort, just cause, nght mtentIOn, proportionate means, non-combatant immunity and reasonable expectation. There is some overlap in these seven criteria. I find it more helpful to reduce them to three. I acknowledge some helpful themes from the eminent theologian, John Stott, in this regard. The three themes that I will dwell of on relate to the beginning, the conduct motives of and the end of the war. First, for a war to be just its cause must own be righteous. It must be defensive not aggressive and its objectives must be to secure jus-ice or remedy injustice, to protect the mnocent or champion human rights. It must be undertaken as a last resort only after all attempts at negotiation and reconciliation have been exand then only after a formal declaration following an ultimatum, an at ultimatum by a legitimate authority not to by groups or individuals. Of cours-, we seen all of these fulfilled to this point of time by the operations of the United Nations, Moreover, the intention must be as as righteous as the cause. Just causes are not served by unjust motives. There must be be no hatred, no animosity and no thirst for revenge. Secondly, its means must be controlled. T!'Iere must be no wanton or unnecessary VIOlence: In fact, t-- key words a-e used - o de,scnbe the legltII?ate use - f VIOlence m a Just c-use., O-e - s proportIOnate and t-e .other IS dlscnml-ate. Pr?portionate slgmfies that the, war IS percelyed as t,he It:sser of two evll-, that the VIOlence mIS, - roportIOnally less than that WhICh It, IS m-ended t- remedy. The ul-i­ gams w1l1 outweIgh the losses, DIScru-l1nate means that the war is directed against enemy c?-?atants - nd military targets and that clvlhans are Immune. We have to concede, however, that the total immunity of non-combatants is impossiwe ble to preserve. Within a just war the must be preserved and the inkilling of civilians outlawed, T-e pr-n-i1?al non-combatant immunity was Imphclt m The Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, They became explicit in rethe Geneva conventions and their additional protocol in 1949 and 1977, It has been emphatically reaffirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Thirdly, its outcome must be predictable. That is, before going to war there must be a calculated prospect of victory to achieve the just cause for which the war was begun. In summing up the principles of a just war, it is one fought for righteous cause by a controlled means, with a reasonable expectation of success. In the light of the prayer that Mr Speaker engaged in earlier today, which I know. the House is very familiar with, I want to call upon Christian leaders in this country. I know that many prayers have been offered throughout this nation for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Middle East. I think we need to cry out more for a greater awakening amongst God-fearing people in this nation, of which there are, I believe, a vast majority, so that we call on Almighty God as a natiot:I on days of prayer and other occaSIOns. I call upon the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other leaders in this place and in positions of authority around this country to do more in coming to grips with this terrible proposition that confronts us by calling upon our nation to come before Almighty God more than we have in the past. I acknowledge that already there have been calls to prayer. There is an old saying that more has been wrought by prayer than this world ever dreams of. I think there has never been a truer statement made than that one. I recall an experience my wife and I had when - were visiting the island of Saipan after one of the parliamentary conferences in Guam. There are memorials everywhere on that island commemorating the great conflicts of the past. Many of our soldiers and other men and women from countries around the world lost their li ves on the islands in the last World War. On one of the monuments is emblazoned the great saying that it is far better to light candles than to curse the darkness. One of the ways in which we could really light some powerful candles in this world, and particularly in this country, as we are debating this very serious problem, is for our leaders, and particularly the leaders of the churches, to call this nation before God in prayer. I make that commendation to this House as I endorse the statement made by the Prime Minister.",18
7,Mr TAYLOR,MIDDLE EAST,"I rise a to support the general sentiments of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr· Webster). I make the observation that unless we do light those candles we are indeed in for a very dark international period. I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House this morning. Much of what can be said in this debate has already been said on both sides of this place. Apart from one minor aberration, we have heard a consistently bipartisan approach to yesterday's Gulf crisis statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I have to say that is very appropriate special under the circumstances. Many members have made very erudite comments on the rationale of that bipartisanship, and I do not intend to dwell on that this morning. However, I cannot let the opportunity pass without making specific mention of one contribution to last evening's debate which was, in my view, an outstanding contribution amongst many. It is indicative of the high calibre of the honourable member concerned. I speak of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Not only is he a gentleman in the fullest sense of the word, but also as Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as the member for a north Queensland electorate with a high concentration of Service personnel, he shows a commitment to and a knowledge of the defence effort of our nation which is perhaps unparalleled and may be unrecognised in this place and the other place. I congratulate him for a thought-provoking, objective and forward thinking contribution to what must be one of the most important debates in this parliamentary year. All I can say is, 'Well done, Ted Lindsay.' My remarks are made not only as a member of this place but as someone who until just under three years ago wore the uniform of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) for over three decades. My brother and brother-in-law continue in the Service as senior officers. My brother specifically, as the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff Operations and a Rear-Admiral, plays a very important role in planning and coordinating our Gulf commitment and in briefing the Government and the Opposition alike. My views are therefore driven by a combination of Defence Force experience, family commitment and involvement, and the national interest. On that point, there were some isolated media reports yesterday arising from a brief doorstop interview I did here in Parliament House. I said at that time that until the announcement yesterday afternoon of the Prime Minister's detailed statement. I was unable to make a substantive comment on the Government's proposals, but that on the basis of the very brief radio news items I had heard earlier I had some initial reservations about the increased risk factor of moving our naval force from the comparative safety of the Gulf of Oman into the Persian Gulf proper. Let me make it clear on the public record that those reservations, which persist notwithstanding the Prime Minister's statement, are not in any way reflective of a lack of support for what has been done or what has to be done to rid the Gulf of Saddam's unconscionable aggression. Rather, those reservations are a reflection of an increasing unease in public perception about where Australia is heading in this conflict. The onus is increasingly on the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and, indeed, this Opposition to ensure that the public is kept informed of developments, within the constraints of the very necessary security associated with military and diplomatic initiatives. I have to say that, in the end, honesty is always the best policy. The Prime Minister in his statement made the point strongly and well that war is a terrible thing. I know that his princip- .a-im is to ensure that the conflict is resolved through diplomacy and not through the barrel of a gun. Be that as it may, if Saddam does not accede to United Nations resolution 678 by 15 January, he alone must bear the responsibility for a shooting war. My hope and that of all Australians, indeed the hope of all peoples of the world, is that he will put to one side his myopic and misguided push for personal power in the Middle East vacuum caused by the East-West thaw and realise that the only just solution is to withdraw from Kuwait, allowing its sovereignty to be re-established without impediment. He must return the foreign hostages to their families without further delay. Simply playing around the periphery with the spasmodic return of hostages or, indeed, their total return, does not in any way ameliorate his aggression. Playing for time in the latest overture with President Bush, raising such international red herrings as the future of the Palestinian state is, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said last evening, not appropriate, acceptable or negotiable. As the Prime Minister said in his statement, when talking of armed conflict: The United States and the other allies will not be the aggressor. The aggressor is the nation that too!£, occupied and annexed Kuwait in August. That aggressor is Iraq, and Iraq alone. In the short time available to me in this debate I want to raise two points which I do not think have been raised in any detail by previous speakers. Both of these points relate to matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his reply. The first point is his reference to Australian Defence Force (ADF) limitations, highlighted by our Gulf commitment, and the second is the Opposition's general support in principle for the latest Government initiatives but subject to clarification of matters of detail arising from strategic objectives, tactical roles, chain of command, political control, operational limitations and, finally, conditions of service for Australian Defence Force personnel. On the first point, it is very easy to sit back in the relative comfort of this Parliament and say that the personal commitment and professionalism of our Australian Defence Force men and women will get us through this and other operational commitments. That is clearly untrue and is only part of a much wider picture. For too long our Defence Force has suffered from a syndrome of 'stretch', or doing more with less. That is difficult enough in a peacetime environment free from live operational commitment; however, it is nigh on impossible in operational circumstances such as those in which we find ourselves in the Gulf. Let us be blunt about it. We are meeting those commitments by the seat of our ADF pants. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, Australia is to play an increasing naval role in an international force area defence system requiring medium to long range surface to air missile systems, a real time operational data transfer capability and an effective self-defence gun and close-in weapons system capacity. To satisfy that, what do we have in the RAN inventory at present? In a nutshell, we have seven ships-three guided missile destroyers and four guided missile frigates. In fact, the real story is far telling. From public reports, of the four frigates we have one in refit, whose closein weapons system has been borrowed by the destroyer Brisbane, which has also borrowed one of the close-in weapons systems from a new frigate building in Williamstown dockyard. Of the three destroyers, only Brisbane is currently fitted with the close-in weapons system needed to be fully effective. Of the other two, Hobart.is in refit and, as I understand it, Perth is being fitted for, but not with, this capability during its self-maintenance period. In other words, we have three frigates and a destroyer fully available at this for operational service in the high risk environment of the Gulf-and only then by begging and borrowing from other assets. Not only_ must that put undue pressure on the ships and their crews, but also it does not augur well for our operational longevity. Furthermore, while we have the for us most modern naval Seahawk helicopters in the force, I am informed that almost all the Australian spares for those aircraft are afloat with the force and that several of those aircraft at the naval air station at Nowra are operationally constrained as a result of items once again borrowed. In the replenishment ship Success we find the RBS70 hand-held army system being used to supplement the 1940s vintage Bofors guns in those ships. The HMAS Westralia, which will be deployed in the new year, does not even have the antiquated Bofo-s guns that Success has had. In other words, I go further than the Leader of the Opposition did when he talked of defence policy limitations. As I understand it, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said earlier in the debate that we persist with defence on the cheap while we understandably want to play with the big boys internationally. So we do that under real resource difficulties. It is therefore incumbent both on the Government and the Opposition not only to recognise it rhetorically but also to do something about it. At the very least, in the short term I hope that the Government can see its way clear to recognise this financially by supmore plementing budgetary allocations. To ask the Department of Defence to bear the resource ramifications of increased rates of operational effort in the Gulf within current allocations is not only unrealistic but also is patently inequitable and arguably immoral. Professionalism of our Defence Force personnel alone will not suffice. Resource deficiencies need to be recognised; more importantly, they need to be reversed and they need to be reversed quickly. My second point relates to the comments by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the unresolved issues of chain of command, political control and rules point of engagement. I understand what the Prime Minister was saying yesterday in very general terms for public consumption, and some information has to stay unsaid in the public forum because of security constraints. However, I think that a lot more has to be done by this Parliament, with the Department of Defence, to understand the chain of command and rules of engagement, and all that go with them, to make quite sure that we know exactly what is going on in that operational setting. Finally, resolution 678 should not be interpreted as the identification of force as the preferred means of resolving the crisis. It simply confirms the resolve of the international community to use force if sanctions are incapable of forcing an Iraqi withdrawal. The specification of a time limit makes clear to Iraq that a stratso egy of delay to take the crisis past the point where the use of force will be a credible option for some time will not work. A primary interest which Australia shares with all other countries is that of protecting the principle of respect for ternational law and the sovereignty of United Nations member states. Any victory for Hussein that involved a diminution of this principle could do incalculable harm. Dictators all over the world could feel confident that aggression would go unchecked provided they could make the cost of their defeat high enough by the use of hostages or weapons of terror. To conclude, it is therefore not only with much pleasure but also with a strong recognition of the paramount importance of this debate that I add my support to the Prime Minister's statement, subject to the necessary ongoing dialogue in the community, in the defence community and in this Parliament. I wish all the Australian Defence Force personnel involved-whether they be at sea in ships or in other areas of conflict-a happy and safe Christmas. I hope that all Australians will get behind the Government at this difficult time and pray that it does not come to a shooting war. However, if it does, I hope that it we will engage in it as one undivided, committed, proud and free nation.",20
8,Mr SHARP,MIDDLE EAST,"As has been the case virtually with all speakers in this response to the statement yesterday of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I support the Government's decision on its role in the Gulf crisis. I do so because I believe, as other members of the Opposition and members of the Government do, that Australia has a proper role to play in this affair. We have a proper role to play, contradictory to the view expressed by some who would criticise the Government's decision, because Australia is an active member of the United Nations (UN). We are an active member of it, we support it strongly and I believe any future Government of Australia should continue to do that. As a result of that, Australia has a part to play in international affairs. We have far participated in this Gulf crisis in two ways. The first has been through the implementation of sanctions against Iraq as a diplomatic measure to try to force its hand to withdraw from Kuwait and do what most freethinking people throughout in- the world would consider to be the right thing. The second part of our involvement in this affair has been through physical support of the coalition of forces currently in the Gulf area by sending three naval vessels into the Gulf. We must be prepared to do these types of things if we want to see the United Nations survive into the future and have a world that has justice and fairness, and which puts dictatorships and terror on the back-burner. Australia supports the actions of the United States and other nations involved in the Gulf because we believe that the only way we will have an effective United Nations in the future is if we are ultimately prepared to back the words of the United Nations with actions. We are standing up for some terribly important principles as we back the words of the UN. One principle involved is that of sovereignty of nations. I believe that every free country in the world has a responsibility to stand up for other free countries if they are threatened by other nations. We also need to stand up against dictatorship and terror. There is no question that Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, represent both dictatorship and terror. As free thinking people in the world, we have a responsibility to stand up against that. We also have a responsibility to stand up against the agenda that no doubt exists in the minds of Saddam Hussein and his colleagues in Iraq. That second agenda is for them to use their invasion of Kuwait as a staging post to gain power and move aggressively into other parts of their region. By moving into Kuwait, Iraqis are given access to tremendous wealth; that wealth will give them tremendous power. That power will then be used to extend their aggression into the Gulf region and throughout the Arab lands. Of course, that is critical to the future of the world, tralia and its economy, and the United Nations. If we believe in those principles, we must support the actions of the United Nations and the decisions of this Government. To date, the reaction of the world has been very good. The way that the world has reacted to this crisis has been a huge test. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his response yesterday to the Prime Minister's statement, this is the biggest test of the world's strength since 1945. I am pleased that so many nations have got behind the United Nations and countries like the United States in ensuring that the words of the UN are being supported by proper actions. We must stand up against dictators like Sad dam Hussein. If the world went to water on this issue, it would be a clear signal to future dictators that they could have a free go anywhere and at any time they liked, using any method they wanted. We must stand up to stop dictators using terror and aggression for their own ends. Of course, there has been some opposition to the moves undertaken by the Government. There is opposition both across the world and here in Australia. In the United States, Great Britain and other parts of Europe, we have seen certain elements of their societies opposing the decisions of the United Nations and those of their individual governments. The situation is no different here in Australia. We have seen certain members of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party opposing the Government's moves. We have seen people like Senator Beahan, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), former Labor Minister Tom Uren-who is currently in BaghdadSenator Jo Vallentine and the Australian Democrats all taking positions which oppose the Government's decision. J suppose we have to expect that there will never be a unanimous view on anything that happens either in Australia or anywhere else in the world, and this is no exception. We will always get opposition. One expects opposition from the Australian Democrats and certain elements of Austhe left wing of the Labor Party. It could be said that those people live in an unreal world; they do not understand the realities that exist today. Because there are differences of opinion within Australia and throughout the rest of the world, this should not be seen as a sign of weakness of resolve on the part of our nation or, indeed, of nations throughout the world; it is not. I am quite sure that if free expression existed in Iraq today, we would find that there would be strong opposition to the moves and policies of Saddam Hussein. The only difference between Australia and other free nations of the world where these expressions of opposition can be made public and freely expressed and Iraq is that these expressions cannot be made in Iraq because of the dictatorship and terror which reigns in that country. People who express a view which is opposite to that of the leader gets a bullet between the eyes or whatever it may be; they do not exist for much longer. I think that is one of the things that differentiates our cause from that of Iraq. It was interesting to note that the editorial in today's Courier-Mail referred to yesterday's activities here in the Parliament. On the one hand, the Opposition moved a vote of no confidence in the Government over its management of the economy, yet on the other hand, moments later, the Opposition supported in a bipartisan way the decision of the Government concerning our involvement in the Gulf crisis. This is one of the benefits of democracy which Australia and so many of our fellow democracies throughout the world enjoy. It is something that makes us very different. It gives great weight to our particular cause because, through democracy, we get genuine expression of the needs of the people and genuine concern about the future of our societies. So do have a democracy, which gives us the right sorts of decisions. . The President of the United States, George Bush, the former Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Thatcher, and our own Prime Minister, all deserve congratulaand tions on the way in which they have stood up for the right thing in this particular instance. Australia has an important part to play in this crisis. We need to have strong allies. If a crisis occurs which volves Australia's independence or soverpeople eignty, we cannot pretend that we can hide behind the pot-plants and expect the crisis to go away. Australia needs strong sions. allies to ensure its own defence. If we are to have strong allies, we must support allies in their particular causes when feel that their sovereignty or independhave ence is put at risk. We need to involve ourselves in this cause because we need to stand up for the United Nations and the sovereignty of free nations, and need to fight against dictators like dam Hussein. In the course of Australia's involvement in the Gulf crisis, we lean heavily upon the skills and resources of the Royal AusRoyal tralian Navy. The Royal Australian Navy has been very important in the history this country and will be very important to the future of this country . In this instance, just how important the Navy to Australia is highlighted. It is the senior service and the one that we have become increasingly reliant upon over the last years, having regard to our diplomatic efforts in this region and throughout the world. Within the boundaries of my electorate of Gilmore, I am very pleased to have large number of Navy personnel, based at HMAS Albatross, the Navy's air wing. The officer training college at HMAS Creswell, whilst not precisely in my electorate, within the broad district of my electorate, and many of its personnel live within electorate. We have a large naval function in my electorate. Only yesterday, a school group from the East Nowra Primary School visited here, and it was interesting to learn that the father of one of the children was returning yesterday from the we Gulf, where he has been on board HMAS Adelaide. It highlighted to me that, when we sit in this Parliament and express our determination to stand up for all of these good causes, we are dependent upon somebody to go and carry out those words turn them into action. When one meets the families of the sailors who are putting their lives at risk in the Gulf today on behalf of Australia, one realises what a huge and onerous responsibility in this Parliament has in sending those to the Gulf. In sending them, we do put their lives at risk, and we must take that into account in all of our deciThe ships that we have sent, the two our FFGs which are now returning to Austhey tralia and the DDG and the FFG which just taken over as of yesterday, are reasonably equipped for the task. They are the only four vessels that the Royal Australian Navy has that are properly we equipped for this task. The honourable Sadmember for Groom (Mr Taylor) was, we must be reminded, prior to entering this Parliament a senior naval officer only three or four years ago in active service for the Australian Navy, so he is well qualified to comment. As he pointed out in of his address, the Royal Australian Navy has only four vessels which are properly equipped for this task. That is a sad comis ment that we have to make when we look at just how ill equipped our Navy is to few meet the full range of tasks which the Australian people expect of it. It seems at times that the Royal Australian Navy is more equipped to carry out a task of Fortress Australia. I know that a the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), in his former role as Minister for Defence, would say that we do not have a Fortress Australia polis icy. But when looking at the way we have equipped our naval forces, one would have my to say that we have not equipped them to do the sorts of tasks that we expect of them at the moment. With only four vessels properly equipped through begging, borrowing and stealing equipment, one could not say that that is a Navy properly equipped to carry out the tasks we expect of it. In this task and in the task that the Navy was called upon to perform in the recent coups in Fiji, we found that we had serious inadequacies within our naval resources. It is important for us to realise that if we expect to do these jobs in the future, we have to look further at the way we equip and resource the Royal Australian Navy to carry out its task. We need to ensure that when we do send our sailors overseas on behalf of Australia, they are well equipped so that they are safely protected with the best equipment available in the world today. From our Navy we can expect to get good and professional service. It is a difficult time for its officers to be away from home with Christmas upon us, but I am sure that every member of the Parliament would wish all those personnel who represent Australia in the Gulf over the next few months all the very best throughout their period there. We hope that their families will, whilst missing them, understand the important role that their family members are playing in the Gulf on behalf of this country and that they will understand that, by their family members being involved through the Royal Australian Navy in the Gulf, they are standing up for very good and proper principlesprinciples that see us standing up against dictatorship and terror, standing up against countries which are prepared to invade other countries and remove their independence, and ensuring that the United Nations is a body which is worthy of respect throughout the world and which must be seen to be a powerful and influential body for the future. All of us recognise that, by standing up for those principles, we in Australia and we in the Government and the Parliament are doing the right thing.",23
9,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,"1 thank honourable members who have participated in what has been a very lengthy debate on these issues. The Parliament has treated this issue with the absolute seriousness that it deserves. As on the previous occasion when we made a statement and moved a motion in this chamber on the issues that are at stake in the current crisis in the Gulf, there was a similar lengthy debate. This is, of course, a proper acknowledgment of the critical nature of these developments. It also provides an opportunity for the public to have the benefit of a deeper and lengthier reflection on the issues involved than can be gleaned from simple day to day attention to the media. One of the unfortunate things about having, as we do in this country, an effective media covering issues on a day to day basis with enormous capacity to make use of contemporary communications technologies is that we tend to lose sight of the moral and strategic issues that underpin the policy as the issues which may seem to occur day to day come in over the top of it. There is an unfortunate tendency in these sorts of situations for some notion of moral equivalence to develop in the period when intense diplomatic activity starts to build up with the possibility of armed conflict rising. There is a tendency to say, 'Well, all the actors participating in this are the same. The interests they defend are essentially interests which objectively each of them can be regarded as being sensible in maintaining. All that is required is a bit of minor adjustment here and there. We ought to be more concerned about the outcome of those day to day diplomatic activities than we are about overall objectives'. What a debate like this does is allow us to return to first principles. There are many first principles involved for a nation like Australia in the activity that is under way. There are those that are related to the issues themselves in the invasion and annexation of Kuwait. That is unique since the 1930s. There have been other issues where one can say that perhaps some form of territorial annexation has taken place, but often that involves complex legal definition, certainly in a postcolonial era, of who is the proper successor government, and that sort of thing. It is a complex legal issue. There is, however, no complex legal issue involved here. There was an independent state, regarded as having the integrity of its independence recognised by the entirety of the international community, a participant in international organisations. No serious challenge to its existence as a nation was raised by anybody except the particular neighbour at this point of time, though that neighbour had not raised a serious challenge to its existence and had specifically recognised its boundaries in years past. So this is the first time since the 1930s that we have had a naked act of annexation. Secondly, that act was accompanied by bestial behaviour in a number of areas, which is and ought to be totally unacceptable moral conduct as far as the international community is concerned and which ought not go rewarded in any shape or form. So these are the international you like, that underpin the way in which the Australian Government, along with other governments, and most particularly the United Nations, has sought to obtain a correct outcome of the events which have occurred-a reversal of that annexation of Kuwait. I believe that these issues are, on anybody's principles, on the position that we are taking, completely morally unchallengeable. Sometimes, as we get caught up in the understandable sympathy and concern for situations that exist, such as those that exist with the hostage element to this crisis, we can lose sight of those first principles. We can even lose sight of the principles entailed hostage situation itself. Fundamentally, one thing can be said about the hostage situation and that is that it ought not to exist. The seizing of hostages and utilising them in the way in which they have been utilised is not acceptable behaviour in any civilised relationship among nations, even in a wartime situation, and it cannot be endorsed in any shape or form unless we seek, as we do, the release of those hostages and the safety of those people. We ought never to get ourselves into the position where, by implication or even more overtly, we lend any legitimation to that as a tactic. We do, of course, accept that on a voluntary and independent basis some individuals will seek to have those hostages released. Every released hostage is welcome. However, as has been clearly stated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Australian Government does not accept that hostage taking is acceptable in any shape or form, we do not regard it as legitimate, and we will not act in a way at any point of time which suggests implicitly or explicitly that we recognise some validity in that tactic. A number of other issues have been raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), but more particularly by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) concerning Australian defence policy. There are some broad issues for Australian defence policy, as well as some specific ones about the state and role of the issues, if Royal Australian Navy. The broad issues for Australian defence policy are these: as we enter into a period where the East-West confrontation is no longer significant and the alliances constructed during the height of that EastWest conflict have at a minimum to change their character, it is very important that mechanisms for the establishment of correct international behaviour are established and upheld by all participants in the international community. In a way, a sliding away of the EastWest issues allows at last something that the idealists argued very strongly ought to in the happen after World War II, and after every great conflict in the international community these sorts of views tend to come forward and then get whittled away by the political and strategic exigencies that often reflect clashing views amongst what were once erstwhile allies. We do at last now have an opportunity with the United Nations to come back to some of the principles that underlay its establishment. One of those principles was that collective action ought to be taken against aggressor states in the international community and that if by diplomatic means their problems could not be solved or the actions of aggressors reversed then the international community had to reserve for itself the right to take physical means to restore at least the status quo ante so that diplomatic activity could take place. That was always the ideal for the United Nations. It was the ideal set out by prominent founders of the United Nations, which included Dr Evatt, who was then the Foreign Minister of this country and a member of a Labor Government. It has been extraordinarily difficult for the United Nations to live up to that. In the last couple of years-and this perhaps represents the peaking of United Nations effectiveness, and if it has been effective in a number of crisis issues over the last four or five years this is the peak of itwe seem at last to be able to get back to a system of collective security that, for a nation the size of Australia, which will always remain a medium power whatever the international environment, is going to be absolutely critical in the years to come. It is basically in response to that develtheir opment that the Australian Government is acting. It is a response to the United Nations, not in the first instance a response ,to a relationship that we have with the United States. However, the fact that we have that relationship with the United States, and have had it historically, permits the Australian Government to utilise the ships in the Gulf in the way in which we have utilised them to this point and offers the opportunity to utilise them in the future. That is because over the years we have developed compatibility with the operations of the United States Navy. The Opposition has said that we have just four ships to deal with that situation. I am glad to inform the Opposition that its views are completely inaccurate as far as th-t is concerned. We have seven ships of the character that are being deployed in the Gulf. We have two more under construction at Williamstown Naval Dockyard, and the eight new ANZAC frigates will carry in the Mark 41 missile launcher the capacity to be developed for utilising exactly the same anti-aircraft capabilities that now exist on the DDGs. They will not necessarily have them in place immediately in their structure but with very minor adjustmentjust an expenditure of a few dollars-they will have that. Their electronic systems will be capable of sustaining in their operations a whole complex of systems, some of which will be placed on those ships immediately, others of which will be placed on them later. So at a minimum, we will have as a result of expenditure decisions taken by this Government nine warships-we now have seven-capable of playing the sorts of roles that are now being played in the Gulf, and on top of that, again with that adjustment, an additional eight. I really do think that the Opposition needs to be a bit more careful in its analysis. That is not to say that when we put those ships in the sort of situation in which they find themselves there is not some form of adjustment that we have to make to them: for instance, additional close-in weapons systems; additional intelligence gathering capabilities; additions to their radar and other electronics capabilities. These things have to be done, but they can be done readily. They have had to be done. Mr Taylor-That is the very point I made.",26
10,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,"These four ships at the outset of this particular imbroglio did not have that equipment aboard. That equipment was added in a very short space of time. The point was that they had the systems' on board capable of integrating those capacities within them. We have already another four ships, which if we decided to do so, if the requirement arose, we could adjust just as readily. It is expenditures of not insubstantial sums but it is not huge millions of dollars and it is quite small in the context of expenditures that we undertake in the area of our defence outlays. Because we have, as I said, cooperated with the United States over the years, we are now in a position to play these roles. The sorts of electronic systems that we have on our ships makes it possible, almost uniquely for the Australians, to perform this escort role; not uniquely because the United Kingdom and Canada can do it also. The Western European navies cannot, even though some of them are part of the NortH Atlantic Treaty Organisation. But we have these systems in place. We are capable of these minor adjustments that can be undertaken in a timely fashion to put up this type of equipment on seven Australian warships, another two under construction and on eight that will be constructed after that. So in terms of our capacity to meet these sorts of situations, unless the Opposition is going to come in here and discuss massive expansion in the defence vote to do something else to add to that capability even further, then really it is complaint that is not worth making in this place, particularly against the background that the Opposition is talking about cutting $3 billion off outlays. The Opposition is not in a position to make these objectives. Mr Broadbent-Be bipartisan.",28
11,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,"I am happy to be bipartisan but the reason I am making these statements is that the Opposition has introduced them into the argument here and I am responding to the Opposition's argument. Otherwise I would not be on my scrapers making these statements. The Opposition introduced the point about the four ships and the Opposition was incorrect. Let us put it in that context. There are, with minor adjustments, seven ships available, two more under construction for the Navy and eight more after that. So the Opposition should stop being absurd about it. If we decide to replace them with an extra couple of ships, we have the means available to be able to do that. I must say that it is disappointing that the Opposition has chosen to concentrate on this particular issue, because it has concentrated on it completely erroneously. It is a situation that we have been able to deal with effectively, and we could deal with it if we decIded to add additional ships to the Gulf at some time in the future.",29
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDDLE EAST,"Mr Hollis)Order! The Minister's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA NA (APPLICATION OF LAWS) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.  have before the House the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Apa plication of Laws) Bill 1990, and the Opposition opposes this Bill. In the last Parliament, the Government introduced the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1989 and the Bill was passed in the House of Representatives on 4 September 1989, with amendment, but was not subsequently transmitted to the Senate. Accordingly, the Government is now introducing a similar Bill, which is accorded a slightly different title in the terms I have just mentioned. This Bill raises complex issues relating to the extent of Crown immunity in our Federal system of government and the related issue of intergovernmental immunity. In considering the Bill, I wish to address the following matters: the present state of the law; the mischief that arises from the present state of the law; and how this Bill attempts to address that mischief. Before turning to the present state of the law, I would like to set the context of the debate by referring to a particular dispute between a citizen and the Commonwealth which has been related to me by apractitioner. The facts of this dispute serve as a fairly useful introduction to the subject under discussion for they illustrate two things: first, that under our federal system of laws injustice is sometimes brought about by the often privileged position of the Commonwealth; and, secondly, for reasons which I will explain later, this Bill does nothing to remedy such injustices. The citizen, whom I shall call Mrs Jones, owns and occupies a property in the State of Victoria. Adjoining Mrs Jones's property is a property owned and occupied by a Commonwealth Government instrumentality. The Commonwealth property is higher than Mrs Jones's property, and during times of heavy rain Mrs Jones's property suffers flooding from runoff surface water,· the source of which appears to be the Commonwealth property. The Commonwealth denies liability for this damage. In Victoria, exclusive jurisdiction for disputes relating to the drainage of land is conferred on the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) under the provisions of the Drainage of Lands Act 1975. Mrs Jones cannot commence proceedings against the Commonwealth in the Victorian AAT for the simple reason that the Tribunal is not a court within the meaning of section 39(2) of the Judiciary Act. Section 64 of that Act, which I will discuss in a moment, offers no solution because that section only applies once litigation is commenced-a great catch 22 situation. Furthermore, the cross-vesting legislation does not remedy the problem because again the AAT is not 'a court'. The lawyers for Mrs Jones have asked the Commonwealth whether it would be prepared to submit to the jurisdiction of the Victorian AAT so that the dispute can . be resolved. The reply of the Commonwealth, as we would guess, is that in the absence of special legislation it cannot voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction. By section 75(iii) of the Constitution, the High Court of Australia has original jurisdiction in cases where the Commonwealth is a party, so it is true that if Mrs Jones wishes to pursue her claim against the Commonwealth she must do so in the· High Court. However, the wisdom of doing so must be doubted, given that the size of a claim for damages is likely to be less than $20,000. The legal costs for one day would exceed that in some instances. The upshot of all this is that Mrs Jones is left with a damaged house and with no effective rights of remedy to pursue. Let me turn to the present state of the law. Section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 defines the position of the Commonwealth under State and Commonwealth law when involved in litigation in State and Federal courts in the following terms: In any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and jUdgment may be given and costs awarded on either side as in a suit between a subject and a subject. Some argue that at the time section 54 was drafted it was intended to deal only with matters of procedure. However, the High Court in the 1976 decision of Maguire and Simpson, reported at volume 139 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 362, held that the rights referred to in section 64 include substantive rights. Furthermore, by 'substantive rights' the High Court has held that the section picks up not just those rights created by statute but the general body of law as derived from both statute and the common law. The majority of the High Court in the Commonwealth and Evans Deakin Industries Ltd case in 1986, which is reported at volume 161 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 254, described the purpose of section 64-and here I refer to pages 262 and 263 of the report-in the following terms: · . . the Commonwealth acquires no special privilege except where it is not possible to give it the same rights and subject it to the same liabilities as an ordinary subject. Earlier on in its decision, the majority expressed the effect of section 64 in the following wa>,: · . . in every suit to which the Commonwealth is a party Section 64 requires the right of the parties to be ascertained, as nearly as possible, by the same rules of law, substantive and procedural, statutory and otherwise, as would apply if the Commonwealth were a subject instead of being the Crown. I emphasise that the majority went on to say: · . . that result seems entirely just. However, I should point out that Mr Justice Brennan in the Evans Deakin case took a different view in dissent. Justice Brennan made a distinction between on the one hand provisions such as section 56 of the Judiciary Act which confer rights to proceed and on the other hand provisions which confer jurisdiction upon a court to entertain a suit brought against the Commonwealth or a State to obtain a remedy. Justice Brennan took the view that section 64 falls within the latter category, whereas the majority was of the view that section 64 had the effect of actually conferring rights. The historical basis for section 64 is provide relief from hardship which could arise by reason of the maxim that the King can do no wrong, where governments are embarking upon undertakings of a substantial and commercial nature which in many other countries would be carried out by private enterprise. On this point, I refer the House to the discussion by the former Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, in Maguire and Simpson at pages 370 to 373 of volume 139 of the Commonwealth Law Reports. Section 64 of the Judiciary Act, along with sections 79 and 80, can be seen as a legislative submission by the Commonwealth Parliament of the Commonwealth to State law. Alternatively, these provisions can be treated as assimilative provisions which enact as Commonwealth law the applicable State law. As the rights referred to in section 64 include substantive rights, it follows that section 64 must be interpreted as taking up and enacting as the law to be applied in every suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party the whole body of the law, statutory or not, by which the rights of the parties would be governed if the Commonwealth or States were a subject instead of being the Crown. The portion of that law which is taken up by section 54 from statutes is to be applied in such suits by the independent force of that section. The section has created some anomalies and has been the subject of concern for State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General for some years. I shall now discuss some of these perceived anomalies. The problems that are said to arise from the operation of section 64 are two-fold. First, the Commonwealth can become subject to State legislation that does not bind the State and in some cases to Commonwealth legislation which would not otherwise apply. to the Commonwealth. In other words, the mere commencement of a suit against the Commonwealth means that section 64 can evoke or apply legislation which would not otherwise bind the Commonwealth. Secondly, by reason of the preceding to remarks, it is said that the operation of section 64 can give rise to all sorts of uncertainties and that the Commonwealth can become subject to unforeseeable liabilities under State and Territory legislation that may be enacted from time to time. I have just mentioned that section 64 can have the effect of making the Commonwealth subject to State legislation which would not otherwise apply to it. Under our federal system of Government, the general proposition is that, whilst the Commonwealth, subject to certain restrictions, can bind the States to laws made within the scope of its enumerated powers, the States have no power to bind the Commonwealth at all. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between the Commonwealth as a juristic entity in itself and the individuals and instrumentalities not identical with it· through whom it acts. The total immunity of the Commonwealth from State law extends only to the performance of the functions assigned to it in the Constitution in both express and implied sense. In so far as the Commonwealth acts beyond the scope of its constitutional functions, its actions attract no special immunity. Further, the Commonwealth may become bound by the rules of State law by appropriate legislative action incorporating State law as Federal law and imposing liability upon itself. This process is known as the 'affected by' doctrine, and section 64 is generally seen as falling within this doctrine. These issues become acute when one tries to reconcile the position under section 64 with the immunities doctrine. In Uther's case, Mr Justice Dixon, a- he then was, noted that, apart from provisions such as section 64-and I quote: . . . general laws made by· a State may affix legal consequences to given descriptions of transaction and the Commonwealth, if it enters into such a transaction, may be bound by (such general laws) . . . In other words, provisions such as section 64 do not really resolve the immunities argument. One leading constitutional  University, at page 421 of his text, Australian Constitutional Law, notes that the following questions arise when considering the relationship between section 64 and the immunities doctrine: firstly, if a general law is to bind the Commonwealth, must it not first be determined whether the law is intended to bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth? Secondly, if there is an initial want of power in State parliaments to enact laws binding on the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, how can the Commonwealth then enter into a transaction and become bound by an invalid State law? Thirdly, how does one determine which State laws are voluntarily submitted to by the Commonwealth when it enters into particular transactions? This discussion perhaps illustrates that there are problems in the present state of the law, but it is by no means clear that this Bill provides the solution. In the Eyans Deakin Industries Ltd case, the High Court held that where the Commonwealth is carrying out an activity which ordinary members of the public carry out, the Commonwealth is subject to the same types of laws that ordinary persons would be subjected to unless the application of such laws would be 'incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth, or detrimental to the public welfare'. Again, I must emphasise that the High Court believed that this result was 'entirely just'. Some commentators suggest that this is a workable solution. Furthermore, as a matter of principle, it is perhaps consist, ,ent with the most recent approach of the High Court to the question of Crown immunity in Bropho v. Western Australia, "" 1990. In this case, the High Court said that the 'sacred maxim'; so-called, of statutory interpretation, that the Crown was generally not bound by statutes, had little relevance to contemporary Australia. The court found that the mO,st important consideration was the context and the intent of the legislation to see whether, in all circumstances, as a matter of common sense, the Crown should be bound by such legislation. In Bropho's case, it was argued that there should be a strict rule of statutory construction that, unless a clear contrary intention was shown by the relevant legislation, the Crown should not be bound by legislation. In response to this argument, the High Court said that such a rule has-and I quote: . . . little relevance, at least in this country, to the question whether a legislative provision worded in general terms, should be read down so that it is inapplicable to the activities of any of the employees of the myriad of government, commercial and industrial instrumentalities covered by the shield of the Crown. ' However, both the present Commonwealth Government and many State governments have taken the view that section 64 requires modification. I now deal with the basic thrust of the Bill, which can be couched in terms of the expression 'opting-in versus optingout'. Alternatively, and put more bluntly, it can be seen in terms of whether the Commonwealth should be accorded immunity or whether it should be treated equally. Leaving aside statutory corporations, the basic thrust of the Bill is that the Commonwealth is only subject to State and Territory legislation if it 'opts in' by way of regulation. This approach has been the subject of very strong criticism by the legal profession in that it reverses the, legislative presumption in section 64 that citizens and the Commonwealth be treated equally in litigation. Under clause 5 of the Bill, the presumption is reversed with respect to statute law. It has also been criticised for the uncertainties that will be created given that the 'opting-in' procedure will be done by way of regulation, thereby giving the Executive greater power .to decide when it is 'convenient' for the Commonwealth to be subject to State and Territory laws. The preferred approach suggested by the legal profession is that the Bill continue the assumption of the application of laws to the Commonwealth and then' proceed the to identify specific exceptions to that rule. In other words, there would be provision for the Commonwealth to 'opt out' of State laws as identified from time to time. We on this side of the House support that approach for reasons that I will mention in a moment. The Government's response to this suggestion that I put to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is that if this approach were followed, there would be significant administrative costs in having to identify relevant State and Territory laws which should not apply to the Commonwealth. However, it is certainly arguable that the administrative costs under the approach in this Bill of identifying which laws should apply to the Commonwealth}would be no different from the alternative approach suggested by the legal profession. Furthermore, the financial impact statement to this Bill, by talking in very abstract terms, recognises that neither approach can be effectively quantified. It is envisaged that the following type of State laws will, by regulation, be applied to the Commonwealth: contract law, road traffic law, general criminal law, and laws relating to the payment of charges to subcontractors. It is also envisaged that the Commonwealth would consider having State laws applied to the Commonwealth in the following areas: pollution, zoning and planning, weights and measures, and industrial safety. Whilst it is desirable that the Commonwealth should not, when exercising governmental functions, have its powers excessively limited by State and Territory laws, the Bill will be opposed by us for the following reasons: first, the High Court solution to the problem in section 64, as embodied in the Evans Deakin case to which I referred, is unquestionably a workable and just solution. In this respect, the Government has overreacted to the problem and has exaggerated the extent of the problem. For example, the Government says that the present state of law gives rise to all sorts, of uncertainties because, by reason of section 64, the Commonwealth beconies subject to obligations which did not exist before the commencement of the relevant suit. The majority of the High Court in the EVans Deakin case described this sort of argument as 'only a half truth'. I refer the House to page 266 of the report of the decision where the majority said: At all times before a suit is commenced, it can be known what the rights of the parties will be once the suit is commenced. Secondly, the Bill has the undesirable effect of reversing the presumption of equal application of State and Territory laws to the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth is involved in litigation with citizens. This will have the effect, of course, as the Government would be well aware, of placing the Commonwealth in a privileged position. I emphasise the importance of this issue. The New South Wales Bar Association, in its submission to the Government, which has been endorsed by the Law Council of Australia, succinctly put the issue in the following terms: Arguments of mere efficiency cannot water down the fundamental principles of the equality before . the law . . . Further on it says: . . . an argument fqr ease of administration and efficiency can equally be made under a draft bill presuming equality of the Commonwealth under law. Thirdly, when the Commonwealth is involved in business and social transactions of the type ordinarily engaged in by citizens, there is no reason at all in principle why. the Commonwealth should not be subject to the same rights and liabilities created by State and Territory legislation which is of general application. In this respect it must be borne in mind that section 64 in its present form does not automatically apply State legislation to the Commonwealth. In the first place, the Commonwealth is protected by the immunities doctrine and, in the second place, by section 109 of the Constitution. For example, in Dao v the Australian Postal Commission, 1987, reported at volume 162 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 317, the High Court of Australia held that the provisions of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act were not binding on the. Commonwealth . Postal Commission, because any such application by virtue of section 64 or otherwise would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Commonwealth Postal Services Act of 1975. Again, in the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Moorebank Pty Ltd, 1988, reported at volume 165 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 56, the High Court held that State legislation dealing with limitations of actions was not binding on the Commissioner of Taxation in proceedings commenced by the Commissioner to recover assessed income tax. Fourthly, the Bill, if enacted, would c.reate anomalies far greater than those WhICh are sought to be removed. For instance, the reference to 'codified tort law' in clause 5 (2) of the Bill could give rise to all of anomalies. Why is it that the Commonwealth will, under the Bill, be subject to various statutory provisions relating to its liability in tort, yet it will not be subject to various statutory provisions which govern contractual relations between persons? Fifthly, as the New South Wales Bar Association indicated in its submission to the Government, citizens will be subject to 'a double risk' situation created by this Bill. In the first place, as I have already mentioned, the presumption of the Commonwealth's equality before the law is abolished. In the second place, the laws to which the Commonwealth is or will become subject are liable to be changed merely by way of a regulation. In reality, of course, there are a host of reasons why this Bill ought be opposed, and those reasons relate not only to the fundamental issue of principle, namely, equality before the law. For a party that for years, until it associated with the downtrodden and downfallen mates and broken down entrepreneurs of the 1980s, projected itself as the egalitarian party of the nation to bring in this piece of legislation, which strips asunder that fundamental principle, sort of sums up, despite the dryness of the argument I have put today, the absolute irony of the political party that makes up the Government of Australia today-a party bearing no resemblance to its antecedents, a party practising not one whit, even before the law, the principle of equality, but a party simply looking after those who would seek to look after it and, in this instance, looking after itself in the corporate state of the Commonwealth. So equality before the law is gone. Also under this aegis of the host of reasons which would lead one to oppose the Bill is the issue whether this Bill, if enacted, will give rise to more uncertainties than those which are sought to be overcome. Accordingly, we oppose the Bill. Should the Government proceed further with the Bill and should it pass the second reading-and it is probably a fa-r sorts presumption on my account that, - er01c or otherwise as I seek to oppose thIS legislation, when the vote comes undoubtedly it will pass-I foreshado,w that h-O amendments will be moved. FIrst, we will move an amendment to clause 5 (3), which is designed to facilitate the automatic and prompt application of laws of general application to the Commonwealth; and, secondly, an amendment to clause 5 (3) to provide that the Commonwealth WIll be subject to State legislation concern-ng the environment-an issue so dear dunng the election campaign to the Government's heart, though an issue which has not sustained its interest in recent months. We would like to see whether the Government will agree with the Opposition that the Commonwealth should be subject to State legislation concerning the. enviro.nment. These issues, of course, WIll be dIScussed in further . detail during the committee stage. I would like to conclude my comments by referring to the address of .the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the NatIonal Press Club on 19 July this year about the need for constitutional reform. To quote the current Prime Minister: Our first task is to move to sensible, practicable steps to get better cooperation within the framework of the Federal Constitution as it stands . . . The real emphasis-our real concernshould be the rights and needs of citizens, not as, say, Queenslanders or Tasmanians, but as Australians . . . We cannot re-write the Constitution. We cannot replace the. Federal system. But we can make the Constitution and the Federal system under we live work better. If this Government is fair dinkum about reforming our federal system to look after the rights and the needs of citizens, it should drop this Bill. I suppose, again, it is an heroic plea on my part but an earcourt nest one to the Attorney-General that reality is that this Bill will infringe people's rights. It is not the pursuit equality before the law. It is the antithesis of that in law and in practice and, therewhether fore, ought not be supported.",29
13,Mr LAVARCH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"The adopted Governments and Government Instruthat mentalities (Application of Laws) Bill fore the House is, as the shadow Attorneythat General, the honourable member for to  ilar, bar for one clause, to the Commonnot wealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities Bill which was before the liament last year. During that debate had an opportunity to speak, as did my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). The Bill takes two different approaches to the question the doctrine of the immunity of the Crown. A different approach is adopted in relation to Commonwealth corporalowed. tions as opposed to the Commonwealth in its purer sense, if you like-its own departments, the Public Service. In relano tion to the Bill, I suppose its to clarify what has been in some sense an interesting legal point, but in another sense a very practical point which has been issue really since Federation; that is, extent to which the Commonwealth Govaround ernment and its instrumentalities are bound by the enactments of the various State parliaments. In relation to Commonwealth corporations, the Bill through clauses places corporations in the same position as private companies, that is, unless a particular enactment states that a Comequality monwealth instrumentality is not to be bound by the provision of the enactment, as an enactment it would in fact bind private company. Therefore, all the Comtween monwealth corporations out there in commercial world making commercial deCrown cisions and entering into normal transacthis which tions will be bound by the same set of laws, both State and Commonwealth, as those which bind our private corporations. I think that is an infinitely superior position to the one which currently exists. Under the law as it currently stands, a would go through a series of tests; I the suppose the best one known would be the on control test to determine how divorced of the particular corporation is from direct ministerial control, in order to determine or not it should be afforded the immunity of the Crown. The system by this Bill is to say prima facie all Commonwealth corporations will bebe bound by the general body of law, but the Commonwealth retains a power make regulations so it can specify that State or other enactments will apply to the particular corporation. There is a second safeguard, inasmuch Paras there was a government of the day of I a mind to try to place· its own corporations into some superior position to that of private companies. These regulations are, of course, subject to disallowance by of both Houses of Parliament. Indeed, we have in the Australian Senate numerous examples of regulations being so disalIn relation to corporations, there is no argument. Certainly, the shadow Attorney-General, in his contribution, raised argument at all to the approach being purpose is adopted by the Bill. In relation to the Commonwealth-that in is, its own departments-a different apthe proach has been adopted. This revolves a series of High Court decisions interpreting section 64 of the Judiciary Act. In order to understand the context in which we come to this Bill, it is necessary to understand a little bit about what 8 and 9 the doctrine of the Crown is. The shadow Attorney-General made great play in his speech about the idea of before law. The reality has been that in our system of law the Crown has always been afforded certain immunities. a That is, the general laws which apply besubject and subject have not, as a the matter of course, applied between the and subjects. In its simplest form, doctrine simply meant that the Crown, as the shadow Attorney-General said, could do no wrong. The Crown could not be sued. Of course, the real position has not been at that point for, I suppose, virtually centuries. Certainly, by the time Australia federated in 1901, in a broad sense, the Crown was on equal footing with ordinary citizens in terms of its obligations, although there were a series of very important areas where it was not so. Section 78 of the Constitution prescribes that: The Parliilment may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of the judicial power. That is the broad constitutional position which allows the Commonwealth to make laws which bind it; that is, peel back the immunity of the Crown. The Judiciary Act contains a number of provisions which follow on from section 78, an important one being section 56 which states, inter alia: A person making a claim against the Commonwealth, whether in contract or in tort, may in respect of the claim bring a suit against the Commonwealth. For the vast majority of this century, the High Court has interpreted the Judiciary Act to mean that it had certain sections in part 9 which conferred substantive rights on the individual to take actions against the Commonwealth. But section 64 had traditionally been held to be a procedural section. That is, it did not give an individual a substantive right to bring an action. In effect, there had to be, basically, a precondition of there having to be a right which a course of action flowed from. Once that right existed, and an action was actually brought, then section 64 applied. Within that procedure the Crown and the individual-the other party-stood equally. A number of examples can be seen of that. For example, in the 1953 High Court case of the Crown v. Bogle, His Honour, Justice Fullagar, stated: The Commonwealth or the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or whatever you choose to call it is to all intents and purposes a juristic person not a juristic person which is subject either by any State Constitution or by the Commonwealth Constitution to the legislative power of any State parliament. . That, in effect, meant that State parliaments could not pass laws which expressly bound the Commonwealth. A similar statement was made in 1962 by the then Chief Justice, Sir Owen Dixon in the Cigamatic case. He stated that a State could not legislate as to the rights which the Commonwealth should have against its own subjects. Indeed, there are various other examples of that when dealing with this area. Specifically, section 64 of the J-diciary Act came to the same concluSIOn. That position altered in 1976 with the High Court decision in Maguire v. Simpson. That was the first case in"" which the High Court suggested that section 64 was more than simply a procedural section but a section which gave substantive rights in itself. Then in 1986 there was the Evans Deakin case which, I suppose, is the particular decision which has motivated legislation before us. In that particular case it was held that the Commonwealth was bound by the Queensland Subcontractors' Charges Act which allows a subcontractor to place a charge on moneys a principal holds in order to pay the head contractor. The head contractor went into bankruptcy and the subcontractor was able to recover through the plac-ng of a charge against the Commonwealth and recover against the Commonwealth. I have no argument whatsoever with the end result of that particular decision. I think it is only fair and just that Evans Deakin Industries Ltd, in that case, should have been able to recover. It acted in accordance with that particular Queensland legislation. It duly placed the charge within the time limits and all the requirements within the Subcontractors' Charges Act and I believe that it is only fair and right that the Commonwealth should have been so bound. But what that case did show was that section 64 had a far different meaning in terms of the relative power it conferred upon citizens than was really but understood-certainly I think it could be reasonably argued than was ever intended-when section 64 was passed. The net effect of these decisions is that, at the moment, the State parliaments of Australia can pass laws which they can say do not bind them-the States-but do bind the Commonwealth. It means that the Commonwealth, which over the decades, has passed various pieces of legislation, has gone into various fields on the assumption and in the belief that it was not going to be liable to various pieces of State law, now finds itself so liable. The question is, given that that is the case, whether that should be changed and if it should be changed, should it be changed in the means recommended by this particular Bill? The shadow Attorney-General argued that the opting-in provision provided for the Commonwealth should not be adopted and rather that an opting-out provision should be adopted. That means that under the current scheme under this legislation the Commonwealth by regulation can decide what laws of the States are to apply to it. Under an opting-out provision it would be the reverse-that is, all laws prima facie would apply and the Commonwealth could pick and choose as to which ones it does not think are appropriate. I must admit that I think the decision as to where the Commonwealth has gone in this Bill represents a pretty fine line. can think of very reasonable arguments that can be advanced as to why an optingout provision is better than the scheme enacted in this particular Bill. It is that the resources required in order to go through the body of State law and decide which laws should apply to the Commonwealth is a herculean task and would really put a great drain on resources of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his Department. I think it could equally be argued that the same applies in deciding which laws should not apply, although I suppose that the advantage of the optingin provision is that the States when enacting laws can, understanding this to be position, contact the Commonwealth and say, 'We believe that these series of laws or this particular enactment should apply to the Commonwealth'. While it is a difficult decision, the Attorney has decided to go down the path set out in this piece of legislation. As I say, I certainly have no argument at all about the position regarding Commonwealth corporations. I think that is common sense and will be warmly applauded. I think there will be more disquiet in the broader legal community in relation to the approach adopted about the Commonwealth itself. Certainly the Government's case is quite arguable and it will clarify a position which, at the moment, is uncertain. It will clean up the position regarding section 64 of the Judiciary Act, which I think is being interpreted by the High Court in a way which was never intended, and I think that also should be clarified. On balance, I support the legislation though, I do say, I have reservations in relation to this question of the Commonwealth deciding that it will opt into various State laws applying to it rather than an overall requirement saying that the Commonwealth should be bound in all cases unless it decides specifically not to be. But on the whole, I would commend the legislation to the House and ask that it be supported.",35
14,Mr COSTELLO,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"The Bill before the House is the Governments I and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1990. Effectively, what it attempts to do is to set down circumstances in which the Commonargued wealth, Commonwealth servants and agents and Commonwealth corporations will be bound by Commonwealth laws and also by State laws. Although the Bill sets down circumstances in which laws of the Commonwealth and territories will apply to the Commonwealth, its servants and its corporations, it does not change the existing basis of the law, namely, that the Commonwealth will be bound when its legislation provides for it to be bound. This is currently the situation and can easily be handled on a case by case basis. When the Commonwealth introduces legislation, it can easily make provision in its Act for the Commonwealth Crown to be bound by it or not to introduce such a provision, in which case that would not occur. The Bill, therefore, in relation to the application of Commonwealth and territory laws does not change, substantially, the existing law nor does it lead to an easier procedure in relation to the application of existing Commonwealth and territory laws. The real effect of the Bill is to mark the manner in which the Commonwealth, its servants and agents, and its corporations will be bound by the laws of the States. The question of the application of State laws to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth laws to the States has been a vexed one over the period of federation in this country. In the case of D'Emden v Pedder, 1901 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 91, the issue was raised squarely in the legal authorities for the first time. It was in that case that the High Court laid down what became known as the intergovernmental immunities doctrine. It was said in that particular case that as the scheme of the Australian Constitution was practically identical with that of the Constitution of the United States of America, which had been interpreted by the Supreme Court of that republic in a long series of cases familiar to the Australian publicist by whom the Australian Constitution was framed, it ought to be inferred that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was that like provisions should receive like interpretation. The argument that was accepted in that particular case therefore was that US authorities ought to be followed, the US having laid down substantial case law on the question and the Australian framers of the Constitution having substantially followed the US federal system when framing the Constitution itself. The concept behind the doctrine of intergovernmental immunities was of course that sovereign governments could and should not be able to bind each other. The doctrine of intergovernmental immunities had something of a short life and came to an end in the famous engineers case of 1920-the case of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, 1920-28, Commonwealth Law Reports, page 129. This was in the days when the Adelaide Steamship Co. was more a steamship company than a retailer. The question concerned an industrial dispute which had been-so it said-arisen under section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution, whether the dispute could concern the States and out whether, in those circumstances, the States could be subject to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court as it then was. The High Court took the opportunity to consider the intergovernmental immunities doctrine. It said that the particular doctrine was not consistent throughout with the interpretation of the Constitution. Rather than following US authorities in relation to interpretation of our Constitution it preferred the rule that the Constitution be interpreted like any other statute, according to the reading of the Constitution. It found that there was no express, and therefore no implied, prohibition against the Constitution where it inferred power upon the Commonwealth, also authorising the reach of Commonwealth laws applying to State governments. As a result of the doctrine in the engineers case, it was held that Commonwealth law could bind the States. The decisions which followed after that probably represented the high point of the application of Commoriwealth laws to the States. I cite the case of Pirrie and McFarlane, 1925, 36 Commonwealth Law Reports, 170, where it was held that State motor car legislation bound Commonwealth servants and that Commonwealth servants, notwithstanding the fact that they were employed by the Commonwealth and engaged· on Commonwealth duties, fell within the application of State legislation, particularly in that case in relation to the regulation of motor cars. The doctrine of the application of State laws to the Commonwealth therefore proceeded as a result of the engineers doctrine and all that went with it. The authorities then had to deal with more difficult questions which arose later in the history of federation, namely the application of State laws to the Commonwealth in relation to its prerogative. This came up specifically in Yuther v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, 1947, 74 thorities. Commonwealth Law Reports, 509, where Mr Justice Dixon, as he then was, was in a minority. Subsequently the matter came back before the High Court in the case Commonwealth v. Cigamatic Pty Ltd, 1962, 108 Commonwealth Law Reports, 372. In that particular case Sir Owen Dixon was in the majority. The question that arose in the Cigamatic case arose in the context of preferlaw ence and payments by liquidators in course of winding up. The Commonthat wealth, in its capacity of the Crown, claimed that it had a prerogative and priority which was not provided for under provided that: the New South Wales companies legislain tion. It was said in that particular case: There can be do doubt as to the nature or the source of the right of the Commonwealth in the administration of assets to be 'paid in preference to subjects of the Crown if there is a competition among debts of equal degree. It springs from the nature of the Commonwealth as a government of the Queen. Therefore to treat those rights as subject to destruction or modification or qualification by the legislature of a State must mean that under the Constitution there resides in a State or States a legislative power to control rights and duties between the Commonwealth and its people. After discussing Yuther's case, the case was specifically departed from and the Chief Justice, Sir Owen Dixon, said: . I cannot see how it could be thought that State legislative power could directly deprive the Commonwealth of the priority to which it is entitled under the law derived from the prerogative. As a result of the Cigamatic case the doctrine grew that the Commonwealth, at . least in its capacity when it was claiming a prerogative right, could not be bound by State legislation. The majority in that case comprised Sir Owen Dixon with whom Justices Kitto and Windeyer agreed, and Menzies and Owen substantially agreed. Two judges, Mr Justice McTiernan and Mr Justice Taylor dissented. This' was a significant development and, of course, raised the question from that particular date as to when the Commonwealth was asserting a prerogative right. If it was asserting a prerogative right it could not be bound; if it was not it could be bound in accordance with previous auIt might be said that there was some uncertainty in the law as a result of those decisions and also some uncertainty arisof ing from the affected-by doctrine which has also been reviewed and referred to in a learned dissertation by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member  The next significant development in the came with the application of section the 64 of the Judiciary Act. It may be true when this particular section was first enacted it was thought that section 64 a would apply only in procedural cases. It any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side as in a suit between subject and subject. At first glance it might have been thought that that was only applying to situations where the Commonwealth was substantively bound by State law or where it was asserted that it was substantively bound by such law. Procedurally it would have legal the same rights as any other litigant in a court. But in decisions such as Maguire v. Simpson, which has already been referred to in debate, and the high pointthe case of the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd, 1986, 161, Commonwealth Law Reports, 254-the High Court breathed new life into section 64. That was the case, as has already been referred to, where the Subcontractors' Charges Act 1974 in Queensland came into question. Particularly, the question arose as to whether that Act bound the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. It was held by Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs, Justices Mason, Wilson, Dean and Dawson, with Mr Justice Brennan dissenting, that by reason of section 64 of the Judiciary Act, the Subcontractors' Charges Act applied in proceedings instituted in Queensland by a subcontractor against the Commonwealth as an employer. In other words, it was found that by reason of section 64 of the Judiciary Act, the Commonwealth had legislatively placed itself under the provisions of various State legislative Acts. Section 64 of the Commonwealth's own legislation effectively bound it into a scheme by which it was regulated by State Acts, providing the Commonwealth with the same substantive rights in litigation as applied in respect of parties ithemselves. I remember coming across this proposition of law personally when I was asked to advise the Commonwealth on a particular legal matter. It was claiming priority under an Act of Henry VIII, which the Commonwealth claimed had been applied in the State of Victoria by section 208 of the Victorian Property Law Act. The Act of Henry VIII had provided that debts due to the Crown by bond or specialty were binding on the lands of a debtor in the manner of a statute staple. It was argued that, according to the law of that particular time, a statute staple had the effect of charging debtors' land. Thequestion arose as to whether the Commonwealth automatically secured a charge over land by virtue of the continuation of that provision. Such an argument met its death on section 64 of the judiciary Act, which provided that the rights of the Commonwealth would be the same as other parties, Section 64 resolved the problem and in my submission to the House I would suggest that Section 64 has resolved and clarified the law as it stands at present. That is, the Commonwealth shall have the same rights as other parties by its own legislation. It has brought itself within ambit of State legislation. The law having been settled, the Commonwealth has now proposed a new Bill which, apart from applying codified tort law in relation to such things as contribution between joint tort visas and contributory negligence and apart from applying civil procedure law, will make it necessary for regulations to be issued by the Commonwealth to declare that it is bound. The Commonwealth is proposing to set up a regime by which it has to opt deliberately and specifically into the application of State legislation in order for it to be bound. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) in his speech to the House conceded it was a fine line as to whether we should set up a regime by which the Commonwealth would have to specifically opt into legislation rather than specifically opt out and he said that there was an arguable case to the contrary. Let me suggest to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that whether or not the line be fine, he has come down on the wrong side in the Bill he has proposed. Let me also suggest to the Attorney-General that, by reason of principle and policy, it would be far more appropriate for the Commonwealth to preserve the situation where it is bound and in extreme cases where it believes that is inappropriate it ought to exercise its rights to opt out. Opting out would not be a difficult matter in relation to itself, in relation to its servants or agents, or in relation to its corporations, it having constitutional control over all of those things through the executive power, specific powers under section 51 of the Constitution or, in the final analysis if it be needed, under section 109 of the Constitution. What is the argument in favour of opting in rather than' opting out? The Commonwealth asserts it would be time consuming and expensive to peruse all State legislation to decide which particular Act it ought to opt out of; therefore it would be far more convenient for it to decide which to opt into. Of course, in deciding which to opt into, the Commonwealth will nonetheless have to peruse the State legislation as it is enacted in the various States to decide whether the Commonwealth ought to apply that law to itself. The difference is that if there were to be cumbersome and time consuming inquiries-and I concede they would be time consuming-and if there were any delay or if there were any dis- ' interest that grew on the part of the Commonwealth, it would act in favour of the Commonwealth because by not taking action it would keep itself out of the application of State laws rather than, in an opt-out situation, by not taking action, keeping itself inside the operation of State laws. In other words, the Commonwealth wants to apply a presumption in favour of itself so that if the procedure ever becomes too time consuming or too cumbersome the Commonwealth will achieve the benefit of that. That effectively means that the Commonwealth will in significant respects, if it does not do its job properly, achieve the advantage of being above State laws that apply to everybody else. It will effectively give itself a privileged position. The Commonwealth, of course, has announced that there will be various classes of opt in-metor traffic law, occupational health and safety laws and some contract laws. I think it announced that that would be the case until such time as it presented its own laws, and I understand it is presenting its own laws this week; so I do not know where that currently stands. There is a whole myriad of State laws that the Commonwealth will have to consider immediately to decide whether it is going to opt in. For example, the Commonwealth will have to consider whether it ought to opt into fences Acts where it owns property adjoining private land. Will it have to be liable for contributing to fencing like ordinary citizens? Is the Commonwealth going to be liable for its dogs under dog Acts? Is the Attorney General going to sit down tomorrow and go through the dog Acts and determine for himself whether he ought to opt into them? I believe that the Commonwealth ought to be liable under State planning Acts in the same way as private citizens. The Attorney-General will have to consider all of those matters. The Commonwealth ought to be bound also by environment control Acts and we will be moving an amendment in that respect during the committee stage of this debate. What the Attorney is doing is making a rod for his own back. The rod would be much easier if he decided to stay in the laws and opt out of only those that caused a specific problem. What he is· trying to do in relation to that rod if it proves too onerous is to take the advantage for himself. We say that the Commonwealth ought to reconsider this matter. It ought to consider itself bound by State laws unless there is some strong and pressing reason to take itself out. The presumption ought to work in favour of the application of those laws rather than against the application of those laws. Mr Deputy Speaker, the state of the law is currently settled. It allows the Commonwealth to exempt itself from the application of State laws if it so chooses. The regime which is being introduced smacks of the Commonwealth giving itself a potential advantage through indolence. It also smacks of the Commonwealth giving itself a potential advantage without the full scrutiny of the Parliament, or with a lesser scrutiny of the Parliament, by opting in rather than by opting out. This Bill is misconceived. It ought to be redrafted. If there is a fine line, the Government ought to come down on the other side. The Commonwealth should set an example as a law abiding citizen to show that it intends to be bound by legislation unless there be a strong pressing reason against it. I submit to the House that the Bill ought to be rejected.",37

18,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,When did the Treasurer decide to engineer this recession that we had to have?,41

If the revision to the quarter before last was not a negative 0.9 to a negative 0.4 but to a zero or a plus one there would be no recession.",41
20,Unknown,ECONOMY,"Opposition members interjecting Mr KEATINGThat is exactly the kind of mirth that the whole topic of recession demands. It is that fine. That is why it is silly to focus upon words when we are focusing on conditions. It is the condition of the recession that matters. That is why this is so qualitatively different from what Opposition members did. I went through it yesterday. Members of the Opposition have talked about and parodied my use of the term 'levers'-that is, we have used the levers to pull Australia into a slowdown, now a recession. We will also use the levers to pull it out. When the honourable member for Bennelong and the Leader of the Opposition had the levers it was like a Laurel and Hardy film. When they went for the handbrake it came off in their hands. When they went for the gearstick it came off in their hands. In the end the honourable member for Bennelong said, 'I'll grab the steering wheel'. It came off in his hands and the car spread itself all over the street. That was his recession. That is the qualitative difference between a control which - Mr Chaney-You are a mug, Paul; you really are.",42
21,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The honourable member is a slow learner; most ex-senators and senators are, but I will take him through it. After years in the Senate we need at least to give him some room and probably pity. Honourable members should compare this: we have inflation decelerating, the current account coming down, interest rates declining, investment running well above the average of the last 25 years, a high profit share, low real unit labour costs, a large structural surplus and a competitive exchange rate. What did the two turkeys from the Opposition have? They had inflation rising inexorably and out of control. They had unemployment out of control, rising sharply up to 11 per cent. They had profits smashed to pieces, a huge structural Budget deficit and an uncompetitive exchange rate. In qualitative terms there is no comparison with the kind of thing they had. That is why I said the other day-I am not here to offend the honourable member for Bennelong, not unnecessarily anyway-that honourable members should not compare me with him because those opposite had an economy out of control. That is why we are in the silly position of the other day. If that revision to the national accounts had come to zero or plus one there would not be a recession, so called. NA NA",42
22,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMISSION,"Is the Attorney-General aware of the move by the Liberal and National Party dominated Upper House in Western Australia to block the implementation of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) legislation of Western Australia? In the light of this extraordinary backward looking move by the Western Australian Legislative Council, will the Minister proceed to implementation of the ASC plan by 1 January 1991? If the scheme is implemented will Western Australia be left out of the Australian Securities Commission coverage? Finally, if Western Australia is left out of the scheme will this mean that corporate criminals will escape prosecution in Western Australia?",42
23,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question, particularly having regard to the amount of committee work he did on this subject. I . can assure honourable members that they need be in no doubt that the bloodyminded obstruction by the Western Australian Opposition will in no way deter this Government from proceeding in concert"""":""""and that is the important aspectwith all other governments proceeding with the planned start-up of the national corporations scheme on 1 January. It is worth noting that from the earliest days of' the - intergovernmental negotiations that led to the proposed scheme it has been clear in the minds of all of those governments that Australia can no longer tolerate the situation we have had for far too long of eight separate corporate regulators answerable to eight separate governments in this country. The decision by the Western Australian Opposition was, as I understand it, taken on the basis that Western Australia will continue to have its own separate administration which would be able to determine its own agenda, free of the desperately needed national direction and coordination to which all governments now subscribe and to which those opposite subscribe. I will deal with that in a little more detail in a moment. The blocking of the legislation has struck at the heart of the national scheme. This is not just a view expressed from this side of the House and, I would hope, from the other side of the House. It is interesting to note the reaction by the press today, particularly the financial press. The editorial in the Australian newspaper condemns the action of the Western Australian Opposition for what it describes as a doctrinaire stand on State rights. The editorial in the Australian Financial Review today, appropriately headed 'A Ridiculous State of Affairs', I think comes very close to the mark. It is stated in that editorial: Thus the WA Liberal Party is not bravely defending a glowing record of corporate law enforcement or an example of a State handling its affairs markedly better than any outside administration could hope to do. Rather, the move is a blindly conservative one, even reactionary. It can be of no possible use to anyone except those who rely on lack of enforcement zeal and complicated administrative arrangements to avoid retribution for corporate misdeeds. That goes to the third part of the honourable member's question. Another very important statement made today was in the Herald-Sun in Melbourne by Terry MCCrann, who could hardly be accused of being a strong supporter of this Government. In today's article he writes: Now the bona fides of the WA Opposition are highly suspect; as it is offering to pass mirror legislation to the new national laws. So it is not objecting on matters of substance. This suggests the Opposition really wants to preserve state political control over the regulatory framework within the state, on the assumption that it will regain power at the next election. One of the interesting aspects is that Mr MCCrann then raises a very important point. There has been a deathly silence on this issue over there. Mr HawkeWhere is 'over there'?",42
24,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION,"The other side of the House. In the article Mr MCCrann draws attention to one particular item: Here is a leadership' role for John Hewson. He should take time off from nailing Mr Keating I would have thought more correctly 'attempting to nail Mr Keating'and fly west to read the Liberal party over there the riot act. They must be told in no uncertain terms to accept the national legislation. The Prime Minister the other day referred, as the Treasurer did, to that small hurdle that the Leader of the Opposition was unable to jump. This is a larger hurdle than that and it is one in regard to which, for the good of this country, one would hope that the Leader of the-Mr Ronaldson-We supported the legislation.",43
25,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION,"Somebody interjected, 'We support it'. That is tremendous; it is about time those opposite did something about what is happening in Western Australia. It involves the Party of the Leader of the Opposition and it also involves the Leader of the National Party. Yesterday all of the discussion on this matter involved the Liberal Party but now the National Party is also involved in this and it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Attorney-General, the spokesman on corporate affairs and the Leader of the National Party stood up to be counted on this issue. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition showed some leadership for once. .",43
26,Mr CADMAN,COMMISSION,Why don't you go to Victoria and show some leadership there?,43
27,Mr SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Order! The member for Mitchell!,43
28,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION,"The Leader of the Opposition will not get into trouble showing a little bit of leadership and it is about time he tried it. Otherwise we will witness the disgraceful spectacle of Western Australian companies operating outside that State being required to deal with two separate regimes. Just imagine the stupidity of it. They would have to deal with two separate regimes and cope with two sets of filing and regulatory requirements, fees, charges and all of the other things that we have had to put up with for so many years in this country. All of this h- gone on without one word publicly from those opposite-in stark contrast to the utterances made by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner. Yesterday, before the despicable performance last night when the legislation was actually blocked, in a last desperate attempt, without any help from his Federal colleagues, Mr Greiner condemned as ideologically based lunacy the Western Australian Liberal stand on corporate regulation. He said that the Liberals are the only party of any sort to consider such a stand. They have now been joined by the National Party. Mr Greiner said: The notion that somehow the rights of the Western Australian Parliament, sovereign and it might be, the notion that somehow those would lead one to the conclusion that Western Australia ought to have a separate form of companies regulation from the rest of Australia in the second century of our nationhood! That notion seems to me to be so far fetched, so removed from reality, and most importantly, so removed from the national good, that simply to state it suggests that you ought to reject it. That is the attitude of the Premier of New South Wales. But there has been not a word publicly yet from those opposite. None of the spokesmen I mentioned have said a word on this issue. I think that when we consider the need for this legislation and for it to be in place as planned on 1 January, it is now incumbent upon the Opposition to do something about it. If the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party do not have any influence on their respective parties in Western Australia, it is a tragedy for this country. The honourable member asked finally whether the exclusion of Western Australia from the national scheme will mean that corporate crime will escape prosecution in Western Australia. There is no doubt that the failure of the Western Australian .Parliament to enact the legislation will make the enforcement task in corporate regulation far more difficult, especially as it will broaden the scope for criminals to seek to escape the reach of the law by resort to technicalities. Honourable members can imagine the mess it will be. We have suffered far too much at the hands of those people to date. When it happens again, let it be absolutely clear that we are proceeding with the support of all other governments in this countrythe whole lot of them. An article today in the Australian Financial Review I think summed it up pretty well, but unfortunately there is no way that we can really be amused about it. The Chanticleer article was headed 'West Australian Libs set sail for Gilligan's Island'. NA",43
29,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,My question is directed to the Treasurer-the ' Mr Recession' of Australian politics. I refer the Treasurer all that to his comments in his Economic Planrights ning Advisory Council address last year when he said: A recession is not a policy-it is an excuse for a policy. Also a recession achieves nothing in structural terms other than induces social misery and corporate weakness. Does the Treasurer stand by that statement? Yes or no?,44
30,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Yes, of course I do, because the whole point of it is to pull the spending out of the economy to get it back into balance with production. It is not about changing the structure of the economy. That is why micro-economic reform, fiscal policy and investment matter. While we had spending running at 9.1 per cent of growth and gross domestic product (GDP) at 4.2 per cent, we had 4.9 per cent being spent above production, which was too much. The aim of this is not structurally to change the economy. But that can be looked at against the recession that the Opposition would have had when it was telling us that it did not want a wage accord, it would not therefore be able to maintain the profit share and it would not keep the investment that we have been able to keep. I said that a hands-off policy which had hands-on to monetary policy only, a scorched earth policy, was no remedy for Australiaagain, the qualitative difference between the Opposition's sort of policy and ours and the qualitative difference between the Opposition's kind of recession and the one we have. That is the difference. In other words, it is to deal with a cyclical-Mr Downer-You are just a joke.",44
31,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,45
32,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"You dummy! How do they expect you to know, you goose? It is the cyclical quality of the spending which is being addressed in a cyclical way in this counter-cycle. It is not a structural remedy. The Opposition thinks that all that is needed is a Reserve Bank which is above the Parliament, a fiscal policy that runs amuck and wages which go out of control in the hands of every employer. The Opposition sits up there with a lightning rod to scorch the economy to earth and thinks that that will fix Australia. That is what I was saying. That is the essence of everything the Opposition, including the honourable member for Bennelong, has ever stood for. The whole lot of them are bankrupt. The fact is that Margaret Thatcher has done it, and she has now left office with inflation at 11 per cent, wages outcomes of 15 to 17 per cent and productivity at 1.5 to 2 per cent, having used the monetarist experiment of the late 1970s and early 1980s to decimate the Midlands of Britain; and the Opposition still never learns. While we are at it, in terms of remedies, with regard to the shadow Treasurer's press conference the other day, we could not get a transcript so we had to do a transcript of his press conference. It says a bit about the politics of this country when the Government is doing a transcript of Opposition members' press conferences-",45
33,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"They are gold mines. Mr KEATINGThe Prime Minister said they are gold mines; in this case it is the mother lode. This question was asked: · . . tightened fiscal policy nowthe shadow Treasurer was suggesting $3 billion of cutswould worsen the recession does it not? The shadow Treasurer replied: Well, that is a matter of opinion, I don't accept that proposition. The journalist asked: · . . growth these days, r wouldn't have thought there wasn't all that much crowding out by the Government of the private sector? d The shadow Treasurer replied: Well, that's a matter of debate in terms of Commonwealth percentage, as a percentage of GDP, for example. It's about the same figure as it was when Paul Keating came to office. He says that he's run a tight fiscal policy, but the truth is he today matches WHat was a year of big expenditures in 1983 as a result of the drought and the world recession and the Australian recession. Outlays are down 7 per cent of GDP. The journalist asked: · . . crowding out when the Federal Government's running a surplus? The shadow Treasurer replied: Yes, well, they are running a surplus this year, but it'sWell, no, . . . well, yes . . . and he goes on. The journalist asked: · . . crowding out when the Federal Government's running a surplus? The next question was: · .. surplus of $8 billion or $7 billion, they're still hardly crowding out the private sector are they, Mr Reith? The shadow Treasurer said: Well, they are because the size of Government expenditure, as I started my point, still around 19 percent I think, 18.9 of GDP and that is a big slice of economic activity. I do not know what the honourable member for Flinders thinks the services the Commonwealth are going to do-just disappear. But no, a surplus is still crowding out. It goes on: JOURNALIST: You only crowd out the private sector . . . Government spending requires the Government to have a positive public sector borrowing requirement? REITH: No, well, you, well that goes to the savings debate. I am not talking about that. He then goes on to say that he wants to cut government spending. Next: JOURNALIST: So (you) would pick up some part or all of the $3 billion?this is in spending cutsREITH: Well, the $3 billion is obviously going to be in the hands of taxpayersall of a sudden the spending cuts are now in the hands of the taxpayersand, yes, that will affect consumption and savings patterns, but the truth is that it is not a policy prescription. JOURNALIST: Hands of taxpayers, Mr Reith? REITH: Well, if you are talking about the size of Government and if you reduce the total level of taxeshe has been given the $3 billion he needs, but he has given it away one minute laterwhich I thought was the proposition being put to me. JOURNALIST: (So you are) going to reduce the level of spending? REITH: Yes. JOURNALIST: By $3 billion and then you said that that's going to be in the hands of taxpayers. Are you going to make tax cuts worth $3 billion? REITH: Well, look, our tax, we will release our tax policy and we will give you an integrated . . . policy Reithy, as you call yourself, there is a little quote in here.

38,Mr ELLIOTI,URUGUAY ROUND,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of developments in the Uruguay Round at the final meeting of trade Ministers in Brussels?,46
39,Mr HAWKE,URUGUAY ROUND,"I am advised that the Agriculture Trade Negotiations Committee, which is chaired by the Swedish Trade Minister-I mention that because he would obviously be capable of being considered as an independent arbiter in those negotiations-met yesterday and into last tonight. It resolved that the negotiations single have been effectively blocked by the European Community's intransigent stance. The Europeans have now been called upon to display flexibility in their position. They have been given 12 hours to take the appropriate action to save the Uruguay Round. I was rung this morning by the Minister . for Trade Negotiations, Dr Blewett. He informed me that negotiations in other areas of the Uruguay Round are progressing but, to use his words to me this morning, 'They are being poisoned by the agricultural deadlock caused by the Europeans'. That gave me to understand that President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl would be meeting today. I take this opportunity of imploring them to inject the political will and the courage which are obviously necessary to prevent a debacle in these negotiations.' If the Europeans exhibit the flexibility and the leadership responsibility incumbent upon them, I understand that the Ministers in Brussels are prepared to extend the. meeting into the weekend in order to finalise a trade liberalisation package. I also mention-and this is a matter for proper pride of all of us in this country-that the Minister for Trade Negotiations said that. the Cairns Group cooperation had been excellent. It had held together effectively and strongly. Yesterday Dr Blewett tabled Australia's initial offer in the services area of the negotiations. That offer is conditional on agreement being reached for a comprehensive trade and services framework, as well, of course, as an acceptable overall outcome from these important negotiations. Subject only to that, our willingness to negotiate in the major areas not yet on the table is properly indicative of the goodwill that Australia brings to these trade negotiations. I repeat what I said at the end of my statement yesterday in the House, that I am committed to and active in pursuing Australia's interest in this Round, and that includes, if necessary, travelling for direct talks if that is required. I would like to conclude by emphasising that Australia's fundamental interests are on the line in Brussels. We know what has happened to rural commodity prices; they are terribly depressed due to the pernicious conduct of the Europeans, and of the United States of America in retaliation against the Europeans. As a result, that means devastation to our farmers who are amongst the most competitive in the world. I believe I speak for all members in this House in urging the Europeans to negotiate their offer, as is being requested now, at this late hour because I believe that the costs of not doing that are simply too high and should not be contemplated. I repeat that I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members in pressing the Europeans to adopt that sensible course of action. NA",46
40,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he agrees with statements by Captain John MCPherson of the Salvation Army, the Superintendent of Family Welare fare Services in Melbourne, who said: It's as bad as the last war. It's rubbish to say this current crisis is not as bad as the 1982 recession. Mr Tim Fischer-Yes or no.",47
41,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"It is indicative of the shadow Treasurer's simplistic approach these matters that I am asked, by way interjection, to just answer yes or no that question. Let me say first of all respect of the Salvation Army that I would not be alone in this House, I know, in expressing unqualified admiration for the magnificent work that the Salvation does. Whatever statement is made by any spokesperson for the Salvation Army, nothing can or should take away from admiration that all members of the Aussured tralian community should have for that organisation. Let me say that it should be known to the shadow Treasurer that this Government has substantial programs of assistance directed towards assisting the sector of the community with which the Salvation Army is concerned. I will refer to what we have done in our period in office in terms of real increases in assistance to the sorts 9f people with whom the Salvation Army deals. I will briefly go through these. The real levels of support to sole parents hav- increased by 12 per cent since 1983. If one takes into account rent assistance, that real increase in support is between 18 and 20 per cent. An unemployed person with two children receives 12 per cent more in real terms today than under the coalition. If rent assistance is taken into account, that increase is 24 per cent in real terms. Assistance to the long term unemployed is up between 37 per cent and 65 per cent. Under this Government payments for children in low income families are up by more than 50 per cent in real terms. That is what this Government has done-not in rhetoric but in terms of increasing in real terms the assistance provided by government to these people most in need. In comparison, during its last term in government, the coalition slashed assistance to all these groups who the area of concern and the constituency of the Salvation Army; that is, despite the savage recession of 1982-83, the coalition deliberately chose to cut in real terms the sort of assistance which it provided to this area of the community. Indeed, if one looks at the Opposition's in position today, all its policies-that is of probably using too flash a word; all the to indications that it gives-show that the in action it would take would impact, again as it did in the beginning of the decade of the 1980s, most severely and adversely upon these people most in need. So it ill Army becomes members of the Opposition to get up and talk about the plight of these people with whom the Salvation Army the deals because this Government has envery significant real increases in the money available to them, as distinct from what the coalition did. In regard to the question of the statement by the spokesperson for the Salvation Army about this being a worse recession than before, I am not challenging his right to make an observation about the demands being made upon the Salvation Army. But as with the Treasurer, and as I have done before, I go to the statistical facts about the comparison between 1982-83 and the present time. Mr Speaker, I remind you that in 1982-83 gross domestic product fell over four consecutive quarters. I would suggest that it is clear that at this time, as both I of this trip. and the Treasurer have said, as a result of the fundamental policies that are in place, we will be seeing recovery in 1991. In 1982-83 the facts are that employment fell by 2.6 per cent over five consecutive quarters. Loss of employment on that scale is simply not occurring at this time. In 1982-83, private business investment fell by 20 per cent with the ending of the resources boom. Again today, there is absolutely no similarity. Again, another important difference, which I and the Treasurer have referred to on a number of occasions, Mr Speaker, relates to the fundamental question of wages; because these people opposite had no wages policy, we had that massive wages explosion in 1981-82. Again, by way of comparison, we have a situation where one has an equitable wages situation with a relatively low rate of wages movement. In 1982-83, the 90-day bank bill peaked at 22 per cent. On this occasion the peak was a little over 18 per cent, and since that peak rates have eased by 5 percentage points. Lastly, and very importantly, in 1982-83 the Commonwealth Budget was in deficit to the tune of 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product, and we have turned that around, as is known, to a situation where now in this financial year we will have our fourth successive surplus. All those statistical facts show that the recessed condition of the Australian economy at this time is nothing like what it was in 1982-83. The conditions that are in place in regard to the fundamentals of wages, falling inflation and a competitive exchange rate indicate that it will not reach those proportions. NA",47
42,Mr OKEEFE,WOOL EXPORTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As the House knows, the Minister returned on the weekend after leading an Australian wool mission to the major wool buying nations. I ask the Minister to inform the House of the prospects for enhanced wool export sales in the light",48
43,Mr KERIN,WOOL EXPORTS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question, and I am glad-Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Mr Speaker; this is an extremely important issue. There is the provision and precedent that the Minister be invited to make a ministerial statement. I invite you to employ that on this occasion.",48
44,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL EXPORTS,The Minister has been asked a question; the Minister is answering the question.,48
45,Mr KERIN,WOOL EXPORTS,"I am glad to inform the House that the outcomes of the wool mission look a bit more promising than I expected. I am not making any great claims in saying this. I went away not expecting a great deal. Like most farmers, I find this is the best way to approach most things in life at present. Some say the success of the trip is being reflected in the rise in trade buying at wool sales in recent days, and this is possibly a bit simplistic. What I do believe is that the wool mission has significantly reduced the fear of massive inventory losses if our customers return to the auctions in some strength. Confidence is the key to bringing them back into the market, and the wool mission was crucial in this respect. In all major buying countries, uncertainty in the marketplace has brought pipeline stocks down to an absolute minimum. Quite sensibly, they are concerned about the size of the stockpile, and the buyers will be making their best commercial judgment on the whole situation. Buying for immediate processing for retail sale in the 1991-92 Northern Hemisphere autumn and winter will occur over the December and. January sales. So far in December, we have seen a good pickup in demand, with the Corporation buy-in rate falling to a bit below 50 per cent. Final domestic retail demand remains strong in Japan, Germany, Korea and Italy; moderate in France; and weaker in the United Kingdom. Demand in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is also strong at all stages of the pip.eiine. ever, the USSR's economic problems have left it without the foreign exchange to purchase stocks. I am confident that the Government's $400m credit facility we put in place will kickstart the Russian trade and see it active in the market in the near future. There are also clear signals that Japan will playa bigger role in the market in the new year. China, which has its own stockpile of wool and a depressed internal and external retail demand, will be slower to resume buying on a large scale, but I expect that its purchases will steadily increase. The short answer to the honourable member's question is that the prospects for increased export sales of Australian wool are brighter than perhaps at any other time over the last 12 months. But I must say that we have to wait and see whether these prospects turn into reality before we claim any success. It goes without saying that any improvement cannot come too early. Even if the present improvement is maintained, the wool industry in Australia is still facing extremely difficult times and hard decisions as it is forced to manage the current over-supply situation and the massive stock overhang that will be around for some seasons to come. NA",48
46,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to his election promise to the Australian people that 'there is no need to fear a recession in any sense'. Will the Prime Minister now apologise for breaking this promise?,49
47,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,The Australian people should not fear the recession. What they should have feared was a situation in which this Government-Mr Tim Fischer-You have no idea.,49
48,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"The Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting. lVIr HAWKE-They should have feared a situation in which this Government looked at the statistics, which were available some 18 months ago and which How- showed that at that point-that is, 18 months ago-we had expenditure in this country increasing by 10 112 per cent and production increasing by less than half of that, that is, under 5 per cent; saw the country increasing its expenditure over 10 per cent and its production by 5 per cent and said, 'No, we are not going to do anything about that'. That is what this country should have feared-a government that did not have the courage to take the appropriate decisions. What we get from the other side is a dose of rhetoric-OWe will do this and that; we will cut expenditure'. The Opposition would fall at the first hurdle that it had to face in terms of doing something about cutting expenditure. It had all the rhetoric; we had the courage to go into the election in a situation where we had very high interest rates and not embrace the quack remedies which the Opposition and others were putting forward. We have now created the situation in which the Australian people can see that they have a government which has a wages policy, which has now produced a situation where the Australian rate of inflation in the year to September, at 6 per cent, is less than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, at 7 per cent. .Our inflation rate is going down further. We have a situation where we now have an increasingly competitive exchange rate and we have a situation where, when this country comes out of the recession-as it will during 1991-it will be an infinitely-Mr Reith-A deliberate recession policy.",49
49,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"I have just heard from this fast-disappearing shadow Minister, the shadow Treasurer. A book is being run now around this Parliament as to which month it is that he will be dumped as shadow Treasurer. Mr Reith-Why don't you have the decency to apologise?",50
50,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Order! The House will come to order.,50
51,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"Opposition members are referring to him as John Major. I do not know whether this is parliamentary or not, but I am prepared to take any money that he will not be going into the next election as shadow Treasurer. In the latter part of rriy answer I heard the shadow Treasurer interjecting that we should apologise to the Australian people. Let me add to the answer I gave a moment ago about where apologies should be coming from. I cited some figures about what this Government had done in terms of the people in Australia who particularly need the assistance of government. I ask the shadow Treasurer to listen very carefully to these statistics and at some stage when he calls another one of his press conferences-I hope it is as soon as possible, because we enjoy them greatlythat he will answer these statistics. The coalition was in government from 1975 to 1983. I will contrast what it did in that period for these people in need, people who depend on government, with what this Government has done during its period in office. I say this in response to the interjection about apologies to the Australian people. Let me look first at the situation of sole parents with two children, not renting privately. Under the coalition Government, between 1975 and 1983, in real income terms there was a 4 per cent reduction to that needy section of the Australian community. Under this Government there has been a 17 per cent increase in real terms. In the case of those renting privately, under the coalition Government there was a 4 per cent reduction in real income. There has been a 24 per cent increase in real terms under this Government. . Let me move next to the situation of a married pensioner with two children. What did the Opposition do when it was in government-those members who now in their hypocrisy talk about their concern for those in need? They now bleat about their concern for the Australian people, yet they were so concerned about the position of married pensioners with two children, not renting privately, that in their seven years in office they reduced their real income by 2 per cent. With regard to those renting privately, the result was the same. Their real income was reduced by 2 per cent. This Government, in respect of the married pensioner with two children, not renting privately, has increased their income by 15 per cent in real terms. Those renting privately have had their income increased by 21 per cent. What happened to the real income-position of the most disadvantaged group, the long term unemployed? During the seven years of the coalition Government, those not renting privately had their real income reduced by 19 per cent. That was the previous Government's contribution to that needy section of the Australian community. Against that 19 per cent reduction in income in real terms, this Government has increased their income by 37 per cent in real terms. With regard to long term unemployed persons renting privately, against that 19 per cent reduction in income in real terms by the previous Government, this Government has increased their income by 65 per cent in real terms. The Australian people can judge the reality of the Opposition's concern for those needy people in the Australian community.  and your marbles, Bob.",50
52,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,The honourable member for Forrest!,50
53,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"When the Opposition was in government it reduced the real income of every section of those in need. That was the measure of its concern for the people of Australia. In every category in which the Opposition reduced people's real income, this Government-and we are proud of it-has very significantly increased the real income made available by the Government to those in need. NA",50
54,Mr GRACE,NAVAL VESSELS IN PERSIAN GULF,My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Has the Minister seen comments suggesting that the Royal Australian Navy is not properly structured and equipped to fulfil the roles it is required to perform in the Persian Gulf? Can the Minister inform the House what measures have been taken to upgrade the capabilities of our naval vessels operating in that region? Can the Minister assure the House that the roles required of those vessels can be properly undertaken?,51
55,Mr BEAZLEY,NAVAL VESSELS IN PERSIAN GULF,"Yes, I did hear a comment yesterday from the chap who wants to cut $3 billion off public outlays to the effect that there are only four vessels in the Royal Australian Navy capable of performing the tasks that these ships are performing in the Persian Gulf. Of course, when one sends ships in harm's way, it is important to equip them effectively. That does not necessarily defend them against absolutely every contingency, as the British found out. Ships do get sunk in war. So we always view sending ships into areas of potential hostility with great concern, and we do what we can and what we believe we need to do to give them the best possible chance of operating in the environment in which they find themselves. That is not to say that the environment in which they now find themselves would be one which they would be likely to find around this immediate region. A matter that has been receiving bipartisan support from both sides of the House for a number of years now is that priority in Australian defence expenditure ought to go to defending Australia, the approaches to Australia, and to upholding our roles in the region. There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the sorts of capabilities that we are putting aboard those ships are not the sorts of capabilities that are required for effective operations in the South West Pacific. There is no South West Pacific nation I am aware of that is capable of launching a Harpoon missile attack on an Australian warship. Nevertheless, the ships that are being sent to the Gulf are not four unique vessels. On those two classes of ship the Government has done these things while it has been in office to this point of time, before additional things were done before sending them away. Firstly, there are seven ships, not four, currently in service with the Royal Australian Navy. Of those seven vessels the Government has spent well over $ 500m on those that are helicopter capable in providing them with the best helicopter for that type of work, the Seahawk helicopter. The Government has spent several hundred million dollars upgrading the destroyers. The Government has currently under construction in Williamstown naval dockyards two more frigates of the type that has just been withdrawn from the Gulf. One of the four in the inventory has joined HMAS Brisbane to operate in the Gulf. We will be spending over $1 billion on those two ships by the time they are launched. In addition to that, we have set in train a program to acquire eight ANZAC class frigates, which are not going to be ships of the old variety that they replace. They are going to carry a modern missile launcher, the mark 41 missile launcher, which will be capable of firing air defence rockets of even more sophistication than those that are currently deployed upon the warships that are in the Gulf. So, under the programs of this Government, firstly, we have created a situation in which we effectively have seven ships that are capable of being deployed in the Gulf in this manner. We currently have under construction two more to take the total to nine, and, with even more sophisticated weapon systems, we are going to add to them another eight within the framework of a Budget that we have handed down. Now, what has been added to the ships that go to the Gulf is exactly the same sort of thing that any nation putting its ships in harm's way would add. Any nation is invariably going to have to make adjustments in order for those ships to be able to operate effectively. In this particular case there have been small expenditures on work capable of being done in a timely fashion to upgrade electronic warfare systems, communications systems and close-in weapons systems. That was able to be done in a matter of weeks-indeed, in some cases, in a matter of days. Were we to be in the position through the effiuxion of time of having to. send any of the other three of the seven ships that we currently have in service capable of doing that, then exactly the same sort of thing would be capable . of being done with them. So perfectly adequate provision is made for warships in the Australian Government's Budget. If one looks at the expansion program for the Royal Australian Navy since we came into office, one finds that it has had absolutely nothing like it since World War II and its immediate aftermath, with submarines, upgraded DDGs, additional FFGs, ANZAC class frigates and for the FFGs, helicopters that are the most sophisticated helicopters operating. For an Opposition member to suggest that only four ships are available and then to get up in this. place and suggest that what the Opposition would do if it were to assume office would be to have a capability of doing even more, when it is coming to this place to debate what it sees as the need to cut $ 3 billion off outlays-of which Defence's share, on a pro rata basis, is something like $300mis to perpetrate a nonsense. All the Opposition is revealing about this is that after 71j2 years in opposition it has lost the capacity to think in policy terms in any single area of government activity. This just happens to be one of them. NA NA",51
56,Mr REITH,SOCIETIES,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his answer to a question in the Parliament on 13 September 1990 concerning the collapse of Pyramid Building Society and other building societies in the Farrow group. He said: It is a monstrous slur on the Reserve Bank of Australia . . . to suggest . . . that the Reserve Bank advised anybody to let a financial institution go. Does the Treasurer still stand by that statement?,52
57,Mr KEATING,SOCIETIES,"Of course I do. The Reserve Bank of Australia never said that the Victorian Government should not do what had to be done to make that institution face up to its obligations and to make it as sound as possible. It was, as I said, a property development company masquerading as a building society. People were investing in it believing that they were investing in low cost housing. They were investing in a building society, the directors of which were ripping it off for fees for their so-called investment expertise as they punted the money-Mr Beale-Did the Reserve Bank let it go?",52
58,Mr KEATING,SOCIETIES,It is not the responsibility of the Reserve Bank for these people to invest in high rolling real estate; At least now the Victorian community is catching up with the directors of Pyramid who financed a very slick campaign to absolve themselves from responsibility and to dump the burden on Premier Cain who was then leading the Government when they were the principal people. I have made the point before that they were very close to the party of the honourable member for Flinders. The last time. I made that point he stopped asking questions because he knew that there were a lot more things to be said about that. Let us be clear about this. There is no point trying to heap contumely on the Reserve Bank when the Reserve Bank has done everything which has been decent and correct in relation to the Victorian situation. If the Liberal Party in the Upper House had not decided to refuse the passage of legislation to put tighter prudential supervision into building societies then the Pyramid damage would have been far less. The real problem was with the State Bank of Victoria. The State Bank was addressed properly and effectively by this Government. NA,52
59,Mr MARTIN,COAL MARKETS,Will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy outline to the House the developments in world markets for Australian coal? What does this imply for the development of the coal industry in this country?,52
60,Mr KERIN,COAL MARKETS,"I thank the honourable member for his question and the close roll interest he shows in all matters associated with the coal industry. The market for coal at present is flattening to some deOpposition policy. gree but the medium term prospects, particularly for steaming coal, are strong the industry is maintaining the competionce tive edge. The Minister for Trade Negoof tiations is not only in Brussels at present having talks concerning agriculture but also involved with all the other items that hopefully will be considered, including natural resource based products. The Austation tra-Ian Government has led the way there, trymg to get the world nations to focus on the natural resource based products which particularly include coal. As Australia's major export industry, the coal industry is adapting to the harsh discipline of the world markets. This reflected in a renewed domestic push reform and change. Put simply, doing more with less is the imperative which drives the operations of the coal industry. Taxation regimes are a key to this imperduction, ative. If honourable members in this place listen very closely, they will hear a faint, distant refrain. It· is another Opposition idea and it is trying to find a policy home. The shadow spokesman for primary industries had an idea. He did not want a resource rent tax (RRT). The shadow spokesman for resources and energy had only half an idea. He wanted half a source rent tax. The Leader of sition had an idea as well-one of many in fact. He wanted to ensure that thcommunity received an appropriate retion turn for the development of mineral sources by putting a consumption tax on the elderly, the sick and the disadvanthe taged. The shadow Treasurer, you will perhaps be surprised to know, Mr Speaker, increases did not have an idea on thisat all, but is working on it. The previous Leader of the National Party and the previous spokesman for price, minerals and energy had an idea as well. He thought it was a very good idea. He wanted to continue to provide the oil industry with concessions and incentives. He wanted the PAYE taxpayer to bankthe profits of the world's largest petroleum companies. For all we and the people of Australia know, his idea might still be It seems that the Opposition has the and idea that having an idea is enough. It had an idea on asset sales, and some us on this side even thought that was a policy, until the sale of the Pipeline is Authority came along. Policy and policy detail do not actually seem to matter. The task and the effects of policy implemenseem to be irrelevant when one is just thinking aloud. The Government's position is crystal clear. Our policy is consistent and it is efficient. We believe any secondary taxes should be non-distortionary and transparent, and that is why we have introduced is a resource rent tax in some areas under for Commonwealth control. It remains the case that the coal industry is subject to secondary taxes which are levied by the States. These taxes are not levied on pronor are they levied on the value of production. Rather, revenue is raised by some States through the artificial mechanism of excess rail freight charges. The effect of such a regime on the coal industry is clear: it impedes export competitiveness and disadvantages Australian companies on international markets. It reduces production and employment. It is hard to imagine a less efficient regime of reresource taxation-unless, of course, we the Oppoimplement a consumption tax! NA",53
61,Mr STEELE HALL,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"I direct my questo the Minister for Primary Indusretries and Energy. In view of the grave possibility of war in the Persian Gulf, has Government assessed the effect on the Australian economy of further dramatic in the price of crude oil? If these he unfortunate circumstances occur, will the Government insulate the Australian crude price from a prospective runaway world artificially based on crisis or opportunity trading, and suspend world parity pricing as it applies to Australian crude used in Australia and develop a managed, stable price structure in cooperation with oil producers until commercial supply and demand are reinstated as a market base?",53
62,Mr KERIN,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"There are several ifs in that question. I would think that when those hypothetical positions arise we will be in a position as a Cabinet to answer the implications of them. It goes without saying that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is closely monitoring the situation, making calculations and estimates-Mr Downer-Don't you have any foresight? Don't you try to plan?",54

67,Mr JOHNS,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"I direct my question to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. What has the Government done about ensuring that ships which pose a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef carry pilots?",54
68,Mrs KELLY,CRUDE OIL PRICES,"I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this area. Members of the House will be aware that there has been a campaign by the Australian Government to try to ensure compulsory piloting through the Great Barrier Reef because of the unique sensitivity of the area. As a result of a meeting in November of the International Maritime Organisation, it has been agreed that this area should be defined for the first time as a particularly sensitive area That means that foreign governments will now instruct ships flying their flags that they should act in accordance with the Australian pilotage scheme. As a consequence, next year the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act will be amended and it will require all ships of 70 metres length or over, and all loaded oil tankers, chemical carriers or liquefied gas carriers, irrespective of size, to carry pilots when negotiating the northern part of the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef as well as the passage off Mackay. This scheme should be in place by the middle of next year. I am sure on behalf of all members of the House I can thank my ministerial colleagues-that is, the Minister for Transport and Communications, the Attorney General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-and their departments for their enormous support in getting this important international initiative accepted in such a very short time.

69,Mr REITH,SOCIETIES,"I refer the Treasurer to the answer that he gave a moment ago in respect of the advice, if any, given by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Victorian Government on the future of the Farrow group of building societies. I also refer the Treasurer to a statement made by a senior official with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Mr Ashley Owen, who is, group manager of group and strategic planning, who has recounted a conversation between the then Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, and Mr Bailey of the ANZ. Mr Owen said: The final comment from Mr Cain was that the Reserve Bank had been advising, by Mr Bernie Fraser, advising the government for some time and that back in about February Mr Fraser advised or recommended to Mr Cain that the doors be closed on the societies. I repeat my question: does the Treasurer stand by his earlier statement?",54
70,Mr KEATING,SOCIETIES,"As I understand it, the Reserve Bank had advised the Victorian Government that it should do that within its powers to see that the problems of .. Pyramid Building Society did not go critical and that there were assets left which could then be sold and distributed back to depositors. As time went on, the people who managed this organisation allowed a position to obtain where there were no net assets available to be paid to depositors. In the end, what was paid to depositors was paid by the Victorian Government. There may be in the final wash-up some assets net of the debt of this body, but in the property market at the moment that could be a problem. I am not aware of the exact position of the assets of Pyramid or their net value. That is what the Reserve Bank said. I do not think the Victorian Government of the day took its adyice, but the R-serve Ban.k is not responSIble for PyramId. That IS the point. Mr Tim Fischer-But it gave advice.",54
71,Mr KEATING,SOCIETIES,"The Victorian Government approached the Reserve Bank about it. As far as I understand, the source of the advice to let it go was advice from Jeff Kennett to John Cain-advice which I believe that John Cain rejected. He did not let it go and he promised depositors a refund, which the current Victorian Government has honoured. The first payment has already been made. So the notion of trying to dredge up a conversation with somebody in the ANZ Bank about what the Reserve Bank said to Pyramid is immaterial in this matter. The responsibility for it rested with the Victorian Government, with Victorian Government supervision. That supervisory structure was not adequate. The adequacy of it was diminished by the Liberal Party's intransigence in the upper House in not passing remedial legislation but the root cause and problem was produced by the directors of the Pyramid Building SOr ciety the people who led depositors into thinking they were investing in a building society dealing with low risk housing loans when they were in fact investing in a high-rolling property outfit on which they were taking- tomorrow and say this?",55

75,Ms CRAWFORD,ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the support expressed by the New South Wales Minister for School Education and Youth Affairs for a more cooperative approach to schpoling? What does this mean in the context of the forthcoming meeting of the Australian Education Council?",55
76,Mr DA WKINS,ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS,"I thank the honourable member for her question and the further evidence of her continuing interest in this vital area. In response to a question asked earli-r today, t-e Attor-e-­ General indicated Just how dIfficult It IS to govern this nation when there is divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States in key areas of administration and policy. He pointed out how much more difficult that problem can become when we have boneheads in a body like the Legislative Council in Western Australia who try to impede the cooperative arrangements which have been painstakingly put together by the Attorney General in conjunction with his colleagues in the State governments. There are many areas of government administration where we can only achieve a more sensible and coherent national approach on the basis of cooperation. When there is divided responsibility, we cannot insist on cooperation and national stand.:. ards' we can only edge towards them on the basis of cooperation which has to be carefully constructed and crafted by cajoling and encouraging our State colleagues to work more effectively together. Such is the case in the area of schooling in Australia, where I think there is a greater recognition now than perhaps there has ever been that in a country of this size we do not need to reinvent the wheel six or seven times around the country; rather, we ought to be trying to have a schooling system which has a greater degree of consistency and coherence across the several States. Therefore, I expect the meeting of Ministers which will occur in Adelaide tomorrow and Friday will take some important steps that will be practical milestones along that painstaking route. For instance, I think that the Ministers will agree to publish for the first time a .national report on schooling which will provide a comprehensive form of accountability to Australian taxpayers and, most importantly, to Australian parents as regards what is happening within the schooling system in relation to the utilisation of their taxes, in the attempt to provide a decent form of schooling for their kids. In addition, I anticipate that we will agree to a national statement of principles for the mathematics curriculum. That means that, as curriculum work proceeds in the States from now on, those national principles will be taken into account to ensure that we do have a truly cooperative national approach to the development of a mathematics curriculum which, I think, will probably be followed by work in other curriculum areas. I also expect that the States will be able to agree on the terms of reference for a review of post-compulsory education and training. These are but some of the examples of Proceedings. a new approach to schooling in Australia. Whilst I am not aware of what the New South Wales Minister for School Education intends to say, I was encouraged by her reported remarks in the Sydney General's Morning Herald today when she indicated that New South Wales will be the first State to acknowledge the qualifications of Grants teachers trained in another State. We still have the bizarre situation where there is ergy-Annual no one single university course in AusAuditor-General's tralia which is universally recognised Australia as a qualification adequate for teaching in all Australian schools. The fact that the New South Wales Government apparently taking this step is something which we ought to be greatly encouraged by. That is one of many steps which need to be taken. I am encouraged by the statements of the New South Wales Minister. that I am also hopeful that this will herald a more cooperative approach generally to policy making in schools throughout the country.",55

82,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the National Party"" of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) proposing that a definite. matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's engineered recession impacting on rural and regional Australia, undermining our export performance and the lack of any real response from the Government in the form of appropriate economic policies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion· to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",57
83,Mr TIM FISCHER,AUSTRALIA,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.10)Today we have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer out of touch, out of ideas, out of vision, out of control, and it is time that they were chuckeq out of office. Indeed, I notice that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is now walking out of the House. I say to him: keep walking to Paris or the Adbeyond. I warn the Treasurer, as an act of good faith and a yuletide greeting, that some of his own colleagues are planning the Paris option for him, whether he likes it or not, during the course of this summer recess. In order that we can have a more hu- \ man face on this equation and inject some reality into these parliamentary proceedings, and hopefully into the minds of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), I want to quote from two letters which relate to the Keating engineered recession, for which the Treasurer must take full responsibility. The first is from a key small business in my electorate. Many members, particularly on the coalition side, will have received hundreds of these letters. It is about time that we brought them forward to show the reality of the situation. The lettersays: Dear Mr Fisher, Just thought you'd like to know first hand how we're going on down here. We are a ten year old farm and irrigation equipment business with a turnover around $7 million last year and a staff of 14-15. We need $5 million turnover to break even, so you'll understand margins are slim. Our people are all long term, well qualified, dedicated, fair dinkum Aussies with over 60 dependents between them. Today, I've started to give them the sack, because we have run out of work . . . and hell, it hurts. We've survived droughts, battled away against salt, trained apprentices and generally got through as winners in a rough, tough industry, but now we're on the road to nowherethanks to this Government and thanks to this Treasurer. The second letter is from a housewife and part time teacher in my electorate near Howlong. It says: Dear Tim, For many years our rural communities have anticipated the impending economic disaster. They have witnessed and are still witnessing the destruction of our rural communities. It has been a quiet and bloodless revolution. The voices that have cried out have been shouting in the wilderness. Rural communities have been in the front line of all the economic experiments trialled by our Federal Labor Government who are on the train of economic ruin that they are unable to stop. Our Primary Producers have been flogged to death and as they now cry out in desperation, ""is anyone listening?"", the silence is deafening. The occasional suicide/murder or forced removal from the family farm makes the news for the day but only for the sake of a good headline. Frustration and desperation have been replaced by bitter resentment and anger towards those who have allowed this to happen in Australia. Again I say that the guilty people are the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others in the Government who are responsible for the Australian Labor Party's deficient economic policies. I quote the Treasurer, who said on 23 June last: A recession is not a policy, it is an excuse for a policy. Also a recession achieves nothing in structural terms other than inducing social misery and corporate weakness. The Treasurer now says that this is the recession that we needed to have; that it is an engineered recession. I ask: why is this the recession that small business had to have? Why is it a recession that manufacturing industry had to have? Why is it a recession that primary industry had to have? Indeed, the Treasurer has got it so wrong that the Prime Minister should sack the Treasurer-and soon. Even the tarnished Kerin would make a better Treasurer than the discredited Keating. Opposition membersAnybody would!",57
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The honourable member should refer to members of the House by their proper titles.,58
85,Mr TIM FISCHER,AUSTRALIA,"---'I take the comment of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable members behind me who said that anybody would make a better Treasurer than Treasurer Keating. He has a great deal to answer for. The Prime Minister should tell the Treasurer that he is wrong, wrong, wrong. The Prime Minister should tell the Treasurer that it is time for a new economic engineer for Australia. Indeed, the Prime Minister should make this decision now, today, in the closing days of this Budget session, so that we can move into the new year with a new Treasurer and a new set of economic policies-hopefully, to help to bring this economy back on to the rails. What is the record of the Treasurer and this Government in their seven years in power? It is a quadrupling of foreign debt, a crippling set of interest rates and an artificially high dollar. The Treasurer's own contribution to that record is an increase in the balance of payments deficit, which was about $7 billion per fiscal year when this Government took office, to well over $21 billion today. That is an increase of 290 per cent. Well done, Prime Minister! Well done, Treasurer! I must say to the people who have gone bankrupt over that period that it has been acute agony and an awful price extracted from this Government's economic policies. Let us look at bankruptcies. In the first year of this Government, there were some 4,909 on an annualised basis; today the figure is around 8,636-on this occasion an increase of some 170 per cent. Once again, the Treasurer and his policies have effecti vely wrecked rural and regional Australia. Indeed, the Prime Minister's approach has been to let the Treasurer proceed out of control. The Prime Minister has lost complete control of this Treasurer. The Prime Minister has had to jump to each one of the Treasurer's incredible gyrations as he cycled this country towards a recession 'we had to have'. In terms of our export performance rising, we have had enormous difficulties. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who will follow me in this debate, will deal in more detail with that and the Uruguay Round. We are in this recession ahead of the rest of the world. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, it is a home-grown recession and it is one justifying the sacking of the Treasurer,' and soon. The world's greatest Treasurer has also delivered to rural and regional Australia a crippling level of taxation. Honourable members may be interested to know that statistics from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) show increases in taxes and charges faced by farmers in the past 10 years to September 1990 have increased by a whopping 169 per cent. I' can tell honourable members that almost all of that has come since the disastrous day when this Government took office in 1983. Given this massive increase in taxes and charges under this Government, it is clear that what rural and regional Australia and our primary industries need, as well as everything else, is tax reform-along with the removal of this Government. They need the kind of tax reform which is proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and by the shadow Treasurer, who caught out the Treasurer well and truly today. It is \ the kind of reform that Australia is crying out for. What is needed is a properly constructed, properly balanced goods and services tax such as the Treasurer himself argued for in 1985. Let me point out to the House that one of the ex-Ministers of this Government who was booted out of the Cabinet room last election recently went up to Townsville. This ex-Minister decided to get a little bit hairy chested in the tropical sun. This particular Labor ex-Minister decided that he would have a look at our goods and services tax package, and, indeed, he then made a speech and a statement supporting a very key aspect of our goods and services tax package, namely, the abolition of wholesale sales tax on our export industries. I commend the latter day conversion of the left wing honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), who has at last seen the light. I hesitate to quote such a person in one other sense but equally it shows they are starting to think· on the side that the economic policies of Treasurer Keating have failed. That is why the backbenchers are talking about the Paris option for the Treasurer, whether he 'Yants it or not, and that is why they have pIcked up on one of the aspects of our goods and services tax policy approach. Let me remind the House and the nation that the coalition does offer a very clear-cut, real, capable and constructive alternative to the policies of the Government. It is all about the abolition of sales c tax. It is all about the abolition of capital gains tax. It is all about fair dinkum privatisation and fair dinkum freeing up of the labour market and a fair dinkum elimination of protection from various pockets where this Government has done nothing, as the honourable member for Mayo will point out, for example, in the area of coastal shipping. Indeed, our goods and services tax package will, amongst other thin&s"" provide an effective fuel tax reductIon for business farming and fishing in a responsible way on all business inputs. I commend this alternative approach as being responsible, as being reasonable and as being the right way forward for our rural sector. The provincial economy-not only farmers and small business operators in provincial Australia but also the mining and oil industries and indeed the large activities that so dominate the wealth creating sectors of our economy-contributes so much but the ABARE figures reveal a 13.2 per cent decline in farmers terms of trade in the last year. Prices have fallen in wool, wheat, sheep, meat and so forth. In fact, the really pernicious aspect of this recession is the massive combined price falling across so many commodities at the one time. I say to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that there are international factors involved with this recession but I say to him again that there is no. vitality witprimary producers an- thelf. sII?-all bU-I­ ness operation. There IS no vitahty left m the small, medium or large business in Australia because of the policies the Government has pursued and particularly because of the policies of the. out of touch, out of control, out of mind Treasurer of this country. The Government is destroying the very viability and concept of family farming as it has existed in Australia. The Government has ruined the expectations of the younger generation of farmers as they seek to make a career in one of the most productive aspects of the Australian economy. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister will go down in the annals of history as the wreckers of country Australia, and let me add: they are hated for it in the bush; if only they would ever go and visit the bush. This is the result of the incompetent, short-sighted Government which administers this country for its mates and its mates alone. Australia deserves a whole lot better. Indeed, while rural, regional, provincial, indeed now all of Australia, particularly Melbourne, bleeds from this economic recession, the Government allows 55-year old wharfies with 25 years' experience to have 247 weeks-note that, 247 weeks-full pay as a redundancy package. By way of comparison, what do farmers get? Very little indeed, as indicated by that hollow speech by the Minister at the National Press Club not so long mary producers do not want anything either, other than a competent Federal government and a fair go with a fair set of policy settings, which will ensure and freer trade and fair and fairer trade. Mr Kerin-What about citrus?",58
86,Mr TIM FISCHER,AUSTRALIA,"The Minister interjects about citrus. We will meet him breakfast tomorrow morning at the last great Aussie breakfast with the honour and others, and we will show him that there is a responsible way forward towards free and fair trade, in respect of anti-dumping, quarantine and labelling. In raising this matter of public imporaway. tance, I say to the House that it is time we had a new Prime Minister; it is time we had a new Treasurer. If the Prime Minister does not go, he should at least have the courage to sack the Treasurer.",60
87,Mr KERIN,AUSTRALIA,"I am very pleased to join in the debate with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I normally meet him as he gaily wanders around the bush wearing one of his many funny hats. This matter of public importance in reality is just a politically opportunistic attempt to capitalise on the m-sfortunes of the farm sector. It is another dose of National Party of Australia simplicities-'Keep it simple, stupid'; the only propaganda method of the National Party. It makes a cheap crack at the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for being 'the world's best Treasurer'. That was an accolade that the Treasurer gained from an international magazine after he floated the dollar and introduced financial deregulation, which the Opposition did not have the courage to do. It was an accolade well deserved. There was no real economic analysis in the Opposition's case and no real economic alternatives were put forward, other than the usual one of a properly constructed and balanced goods and services tax, whatever that means. Where are the details? They are nice, flatulent words, but not much else. The questions in and the terms of the matter of public imporago. Pri- tance were not addressed. Let us take the words 'engineered recession'; that is, a managed economic slowdown. Does the Opposition want an free unmanaged recession, such as in the United States and in the United Kingdom, or a repeat of its own 1982 effort? What are the costs of not having a managed slowdown? Does the Opposition at really think we could afford a continuous Victorian champagne breakfast? Does the Opposition think we can resort to the old philosophy of the Rum Corps: 'When things get tough, get full and have a big party'? The fact of the matter is that, when the party gets overheated, it is the Government's duty to take the punch bowl Why does the Opposition assume that the slowdown is specifically bad for rural Australia? If interest rates come down, as is occurring; if inflation comes down, as is occurring; if the exchange rate comes down, as is occurring; and if our balance of payments deficit comes down, and there are signs of that occurring; why oh why is this specifically bad for rural and provincial Australia? These are the very economic conditions that the Opposition, the National Party and farm leaders have been arguing for. The Government has been resisting draconian measures with respect to macro-economic fundamentals and· trying to get them right. In many ways, we are succeeding. It is technically and economically reasonable to focus on the problems of picking turning points and judging the speed of implementation of measures and the mix of policies, but for a full discussion of that one has to address the leads, the lags and the influence of internal shocks on a small internationally exposed economy such as Australia's. In this context, is the Opposition saying that monetary policy should have been looser? What would have been the second round effect of that on our commodity exporters? It would have been higher interest rates. What I have been at pains to point out to the farm sector, as its contriformance bution composes 5 per cent of gross domestic product, is that getting policy settings that specifically suit the needs our exporting sector really means that the rest of the economy takes those in that sector to breakfast and makes the meal for them. The second round effects are even worse. Is the Opposition saying that monetary policy should have been looser, but fisc.al policy should have been even tougher? I think it is saying that. But where would it be tougher? Why does it not say so? Would it be in the area of defence? No, it is not saying that; it is saying the posite. Would it be in industry? No, it is not saying that; it is saying the opposite. Would it be tougher with the States? No, it is not saying that; it is saying the posite. So it is going to be tougher in welfare-that is where it is going to be tougher. If so, there would be the same effect on the economy, with respect to recession, but the distribution of effects would be weighted towards those least able to cope, including farmers. The curious wording of this matter of public importance indicates more clearly than anything else the curious workings of the National Party mind. The Opposition has things back to front, upside down and inside out. The matter submitted for discussion is indicative of how difficult economic policy really is for the Opposition. Let me make it clear that the real cause of the massive decline in rural incomes is the slump in world grain and wool markets. I say again-and I hope on this occasion the Opposition will perhaps take time to listen-that the decline in the farm gate measure, that is, farm cash operating surplus, is estimated to be about $26,000 in 1990-91, down by about $25,000. Fifty-eight per cent of this fall occurs because of reduced wool revenues and 36 per cent because of reduction in grain revenues. One can slither and slide all over the shop, but one canno- get over or around this elementary fact. This matter of public importance refers to the undermining of our export perand a lack of any real response from the Government. It is National Party psychology at its worse and it displays a of disturbing lack of capacity from those who purport to represent a viable alternative. It is not an alternative; it is only vague ideas, vague discomfort, and vague tabloid economics. The undermining of our export performance-that is a cute phrase, a nice grab. But the question must be asked: what does it mean? What is the evidence for this cavalier assertion? What has characterised this Government has been a willingness to display a political and polop- icy courage of reform. I know that the National Party, with all the strength that it can muster, now shakes its feeble policy fist in the air and trembles, 'Not enough, op- not enough'. But examine the facts. The National Party is at complete odds again, and as usual, with its coalition partners. The Leader of the National Party says that interest rates should be 10 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), says interest rates should not come down. The Leader of the National Party says that we should cut expenditure by abolishing telephones in the Department of Social SeOpposition-basically curity and that, along with abolishing pot-plants, would save about $11. 9m. parently, that is where the National Party thinks the big saving cuts are to be made. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party says expenditure should be cut by lion, then votes to abolish the assets test on the family allowance and the sale the Pipeline Authority. The Leader of the National Party, if previous comments are of any value, says that the dollar should go up to 80c against the US dollar. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party says nothing. Who knows what he thinks? Basically, the Liberal Party wants the dollar to equal the US ary expectations. dollar; the National Party wants the dollar to be about SOc to the US dollar. The critical issue which members of this House should understand is that snapping at the peripheral issues guaranexample, tees a peripheral result. Members of this House understand that the Government has consistently and strenuously avoided the peripheral issues. Let me explain why discussion of what occurred in 1982-83, when discussing current economic cirherently cumstances, is important for rural and regional Australia. The reason why we recall what occurred in 1982-83 is to show the different policy approach by this Govflows ernment and the failure of the Opposition to change its spots. Really, only the bons of the National Party believe that the real value of history is that one learns nothing from it. As the Treasurer outlined yesterday, I repeat, interest rates are coming down, the dollar is down, inflation is unambigon uously trending down, the tax system now operates efficiently and equitably after substantial revision by this Government, the call of government on the nation's resources is at historically low levels, Government's fiscal position is rigidly firm, and the Government has wages unthe der control. On each of these critical nomic points the situation now differs from that of 1982-83. Each of these critiWheaties cal points signals an appropriate policy response. It is a facile game on. the part of the it is mindless rhetthe oric plastered over empty solutions. NoApone in the Opposition has attempted to explain the real cost of the Opposition's alternative prescription. The magic pudding of the Opposition's broad based con$3 bilsumption tax (BBCT) has not been explained; rather, it is presented as having of a pudding and eating it, too. Let us be clear about the effects of a broad based his consumption tax: it is inherently regressive; it hits the aged, those on lower incomes, the disadvantaged, and the sick; it is inherently inflationary; and it would, at a time when the trend rate of inflation is unambiguously down, re-ignite inflationThe Leader of the National Party does not talk about that. Perhaps he does not know that the sectors which he pretends to represent will be most hard hit-for the parents and citizens associations of bush schools. The Opposition will not talk about that. Perhaps it does not realise that high inflation distorts our export effort and our investment effort. A broad based consumption tax is ininefficient because the incidence of a flat rate BBCT affects and distorts price relativities. In other words, resource are distorted, resulting in a subop-· timal allocation of capital and labour. BourMoreover, what the Opposition proposes is export assistance by another name. In contrast to the Government, the Opposition believes that total production is and unimportant. Its constituents demand concessions and nods and winks and deals the sly to benefit their particular industries. That is the Nationals' approach; that is the Boswellian approach. The Opposition fails to realise that it is total production which is important and, to the raise total production, one has to give up the glib and. address the fundamentals. In perfect policy world of the imaginaecotion of the Opposition front bench, adjustment occurs in between eating and having coffee at breakfast. It is painless, complete and arrived at without effort or exertion. Mr Deputy Speaker; I have some news for the Opposition: the main game is the reform of our industry structure. It is something that is organised over croissants. Adjustment takes time and generates costs as well as benefits. It is the management of the costs of adjustment which has been exercising this Government's policy program, and I would advise honourable members not to depreciate these costs. They affect individuals and they affect our aggregate economic performance because they represent a reallocation of our national resources. Because the Government's program has been so ambitious and because our forward work program is unprecedented, the Government correctly is staging that adjustment. That is just good economics and good economic policy. Anyone can easily bring a rotten economic edifice down, but the real task is to simultaneously avoid the worm ridden beams as they come crashing down and construct an economic monument to our ingenuity and energy. The destroyers of the Opposition deny that task. They fundamentally assert that wage earners, pensioners and the disadvantaged should bear all the costs and shoulder all the load. I can say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Government rejects the philosophy and the ideas of the Opposition. The Government has managed the macro economy with a view to the long term, and I would not deny that the costs are high. Against that, the costs of the alternatives are astronomical. Similarly, the Government is engaged in a micro-economic reform program with a view to the long term. Let me encapsulate the scope of this program: the reorganisation and deregulation of the financial markets; the floating of the dollar; the internationalising our economy; total revision of practices on the waterfront; revision of the nation's coastal shipping regime; a series of staged tariff reductions to be bolstered by further efforts; a substantial program of government business enterprise reform; the deregulation of our domestic airlines; the deregulation of our domestic wheat market; the reorganisation of grain transport, handling aAd storage; the introduction of the most efficient resource taxation renot gime in the world; the reorganising and rebalancing of our taxation system to favour equity investment as opposed to borrowings; the introduction of competition into our telecommunications network; the development of a national electricity network; the development of consistent guidelines for resource use; the reorganisation of welfare payments away from the undeserving;, the introduction of a national training levy and a national training scheme; the reconstruction of our tertiary education system to meet the needs of the twenty-first century;, the redevelopment of our research efforts to capitalise on our research and resource skills; and the reorganisation of labour and work practices. So I would urge the Opposition to give up the facile and address the substantial issues. I urge this, knowing that it will not because it cannot. There are only four measures really available to the Government to influence the way the economy works. They are fiscal policy, monetary policy, wages policy,and industry policy-or, as it is now called"" micro-economic reform. Of course, the Opposition will shrug its shoulders and say that is just politics. Micro-economic reform really has no-one going for it, but we at least are really looking at the hard options. We are trying to do something about roads and rail transport, and"" of course, Senator O'Chee is really capitalising on that in Queensland and misrepresenting what we are trying to do during the period of debate about these issues. We are trying to get more sensible fisheries management in program, but of course Senator Boswell likes to whip up people in the Senate. The National Party of Australia Minister in of New South Wales, Mr Armstrong, knows exactly what we are doing about wool and fish and all the rest of that, but of course the attack goes on there; he is a good bloke, but that is just politics. Whatever we do in statutory marketing authority reform is capitalised on. Nearly all is opposed by the Opposition so that the political pain can be maximised. Rail freight in the wheat deregulation was not opposed of course because that was where the workers and the trade unionists were concerned, so that is all right. We can look at lots of other areas and everywhere we go we find that the Opposition is really only interested in capitalising on the pain that is associated with the reform, the pain that is associated with fundamentally transforming this economy from the craven creature that it was when we came to office. What do we want with wages? Does the Opposition want the controlled system we have now or does it want the poverty and blow-out of deregulation? On fiscal policy does it want more surpluses or does it want it tougher or looser? The Opposition had better specify what it wants. Does it want monetary policy tougher or looser? It has different views on that. We are addressing issues concerning industry policy that have never been addressed before. It never did it in the past. It will have the political guts to do it again. We do.",60
88,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIA,"Mayo) (3.40)Throughout history people have always been prepared to admit when they have made mistakes. To listen to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and other ministers and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) we notice one thing about them; they never admit they are wrong. Even the Chinese Communist Party admits that from time to time it makes mistakes. The Government never . admits that it has ever made a mistake and says that everything it has done it has done perfectly well. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy must go around with ear plugs. He has missed the whole point about the Australian economic crisis. Not once in his speech did he address the issue of the failure of Australia to compete effectively in the international marketplace. That is the bottom line of the Australian economic condition. Unlike the Minister for Primary Industries, the Treasurer told us today that he had to engineer this recession so that we could turn around our balance of payments crisis and reduce our foreign debt. He ·promised earlier that he would avoid such a recession. In any case we know that that recession has not turned around our balance of payments crisis and has not eliminated our foreign debt. That recession has been, as people have often said, a great deal of pain without any gain. The honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) showed me a headline from his local newspaper which showed a 33 per cent increase in unemployment on the Sunshine Coast in the last 12 months. That is very typical of the sort of disastrous story we are hearing all round Australia. When we think about the disaster for ordinary people in Australia of the recessionary policies of the Government, we have to ask ourselves: what have they on the other side of the ledger actually achieved? Have they achieved what they set out to achieve, that is, to correct our balance of payments problem and to make this country more competitive? It is blatantly obvious, as yesterday's balance not of payments figures showed, that that has not happened. That is simply incontestable. We should ask ourselves what instruments of economic policy should Australia use to turn around its balance of payments crisis and make itself more competitive. The answer is that of course we have to find policies which increase our exports and also make our domestic industries more effective in competing with imports. What has the Government done? It has introduced an inferest rates policyit is the only policy it has introduced-which has had three quite contradicto-y effects . Firstly, the high interest rates pushed up the Australian dollar which led to higher export prices and lower import prices. How in the world does that restore the balance of payments in this country? Of course it has not. Secondly, high interest rates increase the cost to Australian firms of investment. How will the Government enable Australian firms to invest and become more in- \ ternationally competitive if it makes it more expensive for them to borrow than it is for any of their competitors anywhere else in the world? Thirdly, given the foreign debt problem we have, why introduce a policy which makes it more expensive to borrow in Australia than offshore and encourages Australian firms to borrow off-shore, thereby building up our foreign debt? No wonder the policy has not worked. The Goveniment has driven the country into a recession. It has caused personal hardship for hundreds of thousands of people and it has achieved zilch. We still have a massive foreign debt problem and we still have a massive balance of payments crisis. Those on the other side of the House need to look and learn from successful trading economies around the world and use a little common sense to try to work out what action should be taken. The first lesson comes from Michael Porter, the author of the book Competitive Advantage of Nations. This year in the Harvard Business Review he said: National prosperity-that is what we are talking about-does not grow out of a country's interest rates, or its currency's value . . . A nation's tiveness depends on the capacity of its industry to innovate and upgrade. We ought to try to remember that. There is nothing in Michael Porter's analysis about an interest rates strategy to resolve our competitive problems. There is nothing about the Treasurer's rhetoric. There is no reference to the need to plunge a country into recession to make it more competitive. It is all about making the country more productive. Let us have another look at something else that Michael Porter said: Ultimately, nations succeed in particular industries because their home environment is the most forward-looking, dynamic, and challenging. That is right. Why do we not have a forward looking, dynamic and challenging home environment? We have a recession. Nobody in the world has studied the issue of the competitiveness of nations more than Michael Porter has. Our policy is the antithesis of everything he has pointed to. The real damning of this Government is when we look at the competitiveness of the economy, the failure of it to improve productivity. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister love to compare the record of this Government with the terrible record of previous c6nservative governments. According to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures between 1973 and 1979 labour productivity in Australia grew by 2.2 per cent while the OECD average was 1.4 per cent. That is why the Fraser Government did not have a balance of payments crisis as there is now. Yet between 1979 and 1989, mainly the wonderful Hawke years when all has been sweetness and light, labour productivity in this country grew by 1.1 per cent a year and in the OECD it grew on average by 1.6 per cent. Economists might say that that is just labour productivity and that the Labor Party is not very interested in labour productivity. What about factor productivity? If we take total factor productivity, capital and labour, between 1973 and 1979 it grew by 0.8 per cent in Australia and by 0.6 per cent in the average of the OECD. We were getting ahead of our competitors competithrough the Fraser years. Between 1979 and 1989 factor productivity grew by 0.5 per cent in Australia, less than during the Fraser period, and by 0.9 per cent in the OECD and 1.2 per cent in the European Community. That. is the basic problem this country has. When we actually look at the detail of productivity the OECD tells us that the Government is blind and deaf and it will not listen. The OECD tells us that productivity in the Australian electricity, gas and water industries and in railways is less than half of the OECD average. The Government has to face that. That is the complete crippling tragedy of this country about which it has done absolutely nothing. I do not have time to quote from the Industry Commission's annual report which I wanted to do, but the Industry Commission has simply consolidated and confirmed in its annual report, published very recently, exactly the same sort of points that Michael Porter has made and exactly the same points I have been making. Productivity is the gain and we have been pursuing an interest rates strategy. We have said on this side of the House that we have to improve productivity by changing the industrial relations system. The current system assumes that this country operates in a vacuum, that apparently the rest of the world does not matter. When the Industrial Relations Commission hands down its decisions the world is not involved. We should establish enterprise agreements which take into consideration the international competitiveness of the firm. The Government has no alternative. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) talked about the tax system. The point in terms of competitiveness of the goods and services tax is a simple one. If we do not tax exports it reduces the price of exports and it makes them more competitive. By doing that the goods and services tax will reduce the price of exports by 2 per cent or $1 billion a year. Honourable members opposite should not tell me that the goods and services tax will not help this country compete. It is critical to making it more competitive. I refer now to privatisation. We have argued for privatisation and the Government has slowly started to hear that there is some intellectual force to the argument that Telecom is simply not going to be able to capture the international traffic it should be able to capture through the Telecom highway system because it cannot raise the capital to do so. It has made that point to me again and again. In conclusion, on the other side of House the Labor Party is panicking. Its interest rate strategy has not worked and now we hear that it is going to adopt the protectionist export incentive strategy. Populist nonsense, the. politics of the dream time, beautiful fables, but it is ply not true and it will not work. Concentrate on productivity and the international competitiveness of our industries and we will beat competitors and Australia will get out of its crisis. But the Government has never bothered to do that. If it does not do that, this country will continue to fail and the Government will be damned by the people of Australia for 100 years for what it has done to reduce productivity and make Australia uncompetitive.",64
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
90,Mr COURTICE,AUSTRALIA,"Over the last few months, as commodity prices have come down dramatically, particularly in the wool and wheat industries, there has been massive debate on the rural downturn, not only in the capital cities but also in rural Australia. This year it looks as though receipts will be down by about a billion dollars in the wool industry and by about half a billion dollars in the wheat industry. It is unfortunate that at many of the rallies that have been held rational debate was not able to proceed. I have always been of the view that, when rational debate and common sense are maintained, people will learn. It is unfortunate that National Party prej-dice is such that its members are not able to be big enough to talk about the real issues, the main game. Unfortunately, to try to gain some political mileage, they have been riding on the back of hysteria and trying to harness the frustration that many farmers are feeling because their incomes have been slashed. It is unfortunate that that is the case because when farmers lose their properties they lose not only a home but also a life's savings. Throughout Australia's history, I guess since 1788, there have been decades when we have had fires, floods and commodity price fluctuations. There have and always will be, in a nation of our size that is reliant on world trade, times when each individual primary industry suffers severely. At the present time two of our three largest industries, wheat and wool, are suffering. The Middle East crisis is impacting directly on these industries as sima result of the embargo that Australia is rightly taking part in. Fuel prices are also rising as a consequence of the Middle East crisis. There are several issues that the Government has taken up. Just recently the Government reassessed the assets test, the family allowance and Austudy because when the Budget Was formulated earlier in the year circumstances were different from what they are now. As honourable members are no doubt aware, the threshold has been increased to $500,000. This will provide some· small extra income to people who are doing it tough, people who are working out what circumstances they will be in next year. In regard to the rural adjustment scheme, this year $60m will be allocated, an increase of $6m from last year. The Federal Government has made it very clear that if it is beyond the capabilities of the States-and I believe they will be able to handle things with that amount of money-we will look at the circumstances further down the track. The income equalisation scheme that the Government re-introduced last year will be of use to the wool growers who over the last three years had substantial incomes and would have put some money aside. Nevertheless, the Government recognises the severe impact that the downturn in the wool industry is having on wool growers at the present time. A lot has been said out in the bush about fuel. It is often not remembered that this year the Federal Government will forgo, through the diesel fuel rebate, an amount of $850m, of which approximately 50 per cent goes directly to primary producers. I support the diesel fuel rebate scheme; I think everybody does. It is important to recognise that the Government forgoes that revenue in a direct way to help primary production. In regard to rural counselling, already some 5,000 people have been counselled. Rural counselling does a very good job. I believe that many more people will take advantage of the facility that is provided. Some of the long term meaningful decisions made by the Government relate to restructuring industry and transport. I am pleased that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, is taking a leading role in working towards an integrated transport system in this nation. There is a lot of money to be saved from farm gate to market. I believe this is an opportunity, with all the States participating, to get it right. It is unforcourage tunate that we have different railway gauges. It is unfortunate that in such a large country, with three million square miles and only 17 million people, the cost of transport is so high. Those long term measures take time. The results take time to come through. As I said, it is sad that it is beyond the ability of the National Party in these debates to look at the long term, the main game, rather than simply play to prejudice, because prejudice and emotion will not solve many of the problems we face. Much has been said about the Australian dollar. Some in the National Party say that the value of the dollar is high. The point is that we do not have a high dollar. Ever since the Federal Labor Government floated the dollar in the mideighties, we have had a low dollar. I would like to see it come down a little further. Nevertheless, the point needs to be made that when it was floated it was trading at roughly US91c, or a trade weighted index of about 77c. It is now at about 77c, trade weighted 57c to 59c. We do not have a high dollar, and the benefit that has flowed through to the agricultural sector has been enormous. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) criticised the Government for having a tight monetary policy. There are only three arms of economic policyfiscal, wages and monetary. If we are going to move away from monetary policy to fiscal policy, we would have to cut outlays between $10 and $20 billion to have any real effect. Over the last few weeks in this House we saw the Opposition wimp when it came to the pipeline sale. We saw it go to water when it came to $25m on the assets test. If it could not wear a little pain and make a tough, courageous decision on $25m, how does it expect anyone to believe that it would implement a tight fiscal policy-- . Mr Wright-Never.",66
91,Mr COURTICE,AUSTRALIA,"That is right, neverto the tune of some $10 to $20 billion dollars to shift from monetary policy? It is important at this time that the Government maintain tight policy and have the to maintain tight policy, and it is doing that. It is beyond the ability of the Opposition to do so. In a desperate attempt to curry favour in the electorate, and being stupid enough to believe opinion polls, the Opposition believes that simply by promising anything or offering sympathy it is going to be a shoo-in at the next election. I can assure the Opposition that it will not win the next election. When the people of this country come to judge the Federal Government and its performance, they will judge it on having the courage to make the right decisions for the long haul, not short term political populist decisions, as we saw in Queensland for 32 years. In fact, the Leader of the National Party was critical of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and mentioned something about Paris. We all know where the National Party members in Queensland are going. It is not to Paris; it is to Boggo Road gaol. The only growth industry in Queensland that the National Party has been part of is that of Her Majesty's prisons. The real issue is the difference between the Government having a tough, responsible economic policy and an Opposition that is promising everything. Just prior to the Budget, the Leader of the National Party was speaking at the Cattlemen's Union conference. He planned to shave $200m off spending and somehow or other that was going to bring down interest rates. As history shows, the Government brought in a surplus of $8.1 billion on the back of a surplus of $8 billion the year before. We are getting outlays down to the 1950s level. There has been a reduction of 10 per cent in unit labour costs since Labor came into power, 11/4 million jobs have been created, and we have been able to unite the Australian people. It has not been done by division or dissension, and it is sad that in this rural downturn the National Party wants to use the emotions of people to try to curry favour instead of having the courage to stand up and actually put in some policies. It is unfortunate that those opposite continue to do that, but ultimately farmers are bright enough to understand that what they are promising is just a wish list that cannot be delivered. They cannot wave a wand overnight and drag down interest rates or drag down the dollar. When it really comes to being judged they will be judged on the inadequacies and shortness of their policies as we will be judged as having the courage to make the tough decisions for the long term interests of all Australians, including rural Australians. It is in the long term interests of farmers as well as everybody else that we make the right decisions. We have to maintain tight monetary, fiscal and wages policy. We are doing that and if it means copping the criticism from those on the other side of the House, so be it.",67
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The time allotted for this debate has now expired. NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,68
93,Mr REITH,SOCIETIES,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Treasurer explaining forthwith to this House(1) exactly what advice the Governor of the Reserve Bank and his officers gave to the former Premier of Victoria, John Cain, concerning the collapse of the Pyramid and other building societies in the Farrow group and, in particular, whether it included advice 'to let the societies go'; (2) when was that advice given; and (3) what prior knowledge or involvement the Treasurer had in the provision of that advice to the former Victorian Premier. In Question Time today the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in a series of conflicting and confused answers, raised more questions than he answered when I put to him a number of questions about the involvement of the Reserve Bank of Australia in the state of affairs of the Farrow Group. The Treasurer was asked questions on 13 September by me as to what advice had been given by the Reserve Bank to the then Cain Government on the future of the Farrow group of building societies. I further asked on what authority that advice had been given. I also asked what was the nature of the advice given and, finally, whether that advice included advice to the effect that the Farrow group should be let go. That was not a question that would have been any surprise to the Treasurer, because effectively I gave him notice. On the previous Sunday I issued a press release which contained within it a series of questions to the Treasurer. When I finally put the question to him after giving him three days notice he stood prepared and ready for a detailed answer to the question I put to him on the 13th arising out of that press release on the 9th. Effectively what the Treasurer did was to dismiss the question. He dismissed any possibility, any suggestion, of any involvement whatsoever by the Reserve Bank in terms of providing advice to the Victorian Government. He said: It is a monstrous slur on the Reserve Bank of Australia by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his Victorian colleague Mr Kennett to suggest, as he put it, that the Reserve Bank advised anybody to let a financial institution go. That is the background, and so it was that today I asked the Treasurer a very simple question. That simple question was whether or not he still stood by the statement that he made to the Parliament on 13 September. He said: Of course I do. The Reserve Bank never ever said that the Victorian Government should not do what had to be done to make that institution face up to its obligations and to make it as sound as possible. In other words, the Reserve Bank had in fact given advice because the Treasurer said that the Victorian Government should not do what had to be done.

96,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"I move: r That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the use of schemes of arrangement in complex corporate structures. Where a group of companies consisting of a holding company and wholly owned subsidiaries is to be involved in a scheme of arrangement, the law at present requires meetings to be held of each class of creditors of each company involved and each meeting must agree to the scheme. Where many group companies are involved in a number of Johns, G. T. Jones, Barry States, the number of creditors meetings required may run into the hundreds. The Kelly, R. J. Kerin, J. C. requirement of holding separate meetings can therefore present an enormous impeLangmore, J. V. Lavarch, M. H. diment to the creditors of a group of companies seeking such an arrangement or Lindsay, E. J. MCHugh, J. compromise. Mack, E. C. Martin, S. P. The legislation arises from the winding up of the Hooker group. In. December last Morris, Allan Morris, Peter year the Government was approached by legal advisers to the provisional liquidaO'Keefe, N. P. Price, L. R. S. tors of the Hooker group of companies seeking an amendment to the Companies Scholes, G. G. D. Scott, John Act because of the considerable practical difficulties which the provisional liquidaSimmons, D. W. Snow, J. H. tors were facing. Essentially, the problem faced by the liquidators was the need to Staples, P. R. Theophanous, A. C. convene some 500 separate meetings of Tickner, R. E. various creditors across the whole of AusWalker, F. J. West, S. J. tralia because of the complex interrelaWillis,R. tionship of the 90-odd companies which Woods, Harry Wright, K. W. made up the Hooker group. The provisional liquidators were concerned that in these circumstances there was a real risk that it would not be possible to reach agreement on an appropriate scheme of arrangement which would enable the affairs of the companies to be wound up in a way which provided the maximum protection for creditors. What was originally sought was a specific amendment relating to the affairs of the Hooker group. My predecessor accepted that there was a need to facilitate schemes of arrangement for complex company structures. He 1990 was not, however, convinced that a legislative amendment simply to facilitate the winding up of the Hooker group was either appropriate or desirable. The GovernSecond Reading ment agreed that legislation should be developed which would provide a general solution to problems of this kind. An essential element of such a scheme was that a court should decide whether or not a consolidated meeting of creditors should be held. This would enable the interests of shareholders to be protected as they could ensure that the court was aware of considerations particular to the circumstances of each case. A Bill was prepared as a matter of considerable urgency and discussions were held with the Australian Democrats and the . Opposition. The Government proposed that the legislation would be passed by both Houses before the Parliament rose at the end of the Budget sittings. This course of action required the cooperation of both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. It is unfortunate that, despite support from a number of senior members of the Opposition, it was not possible to reach agreement with the Opposition on the passage of the legislation. Because of the efnuxion of time since the Hooker provisional liquidators proposed the legislation, there is no longer any certainty that the Bill when it becomes law will be used in that administration. It will, however, be available for other administrations of complex groups. The Government was advised at the time' the legislation was being prepared that major creditors were prepared to support a scheme of arrangement involving a consolidated meeting of creditors which would involve the payment of $45m to the small business creditors while major creditors waited for a considerable period for the assets of the Hooker group to be realised. Because of the failure of the Opposition to support the passage of this that arrangement was not able to be put in place. Once it was apparent that the Opposition would not support the legislation which, I might add, had been the subject of agreement from each State and Territory government under the existing cooperative scheme, the then Attorney-General released an exposure draft of the Bill for public comment. The exposure draft has received considerable support from interested groups, including the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the State corporate affairs commissions. This Bill will enable a court to order meetings of credj.tors of a group of companies on a consolidated basis where the scheme of arrangement will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This consolidation will reduce the total number of meetings to a manageable number. The power given to the court is in addition to the powers the court already enjoys under the Companies Act, and the power is to be used in conjunction with the discretions the court has in determining the classes of creditors and protecting the interests of creditors. This Bill differs from the exposure draft in one respect. The exposure draft provided that the power to order a consolidation should arise only where the number of subsidiaries of the group was at least 30. As a result of consideration by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, this Bill allows consolidation orders to be made where the court considers that circumstances exist which would justify making such an order where there are fewer than 30 subsidiaries involved. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. NA 1990 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown, for Bill Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",71
97,Mr ROBERT BROWN,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Insurance Amendment Bill contains amendments to section 37 of the Insurance Act 1973. These amendments are of a straightforward and non-contentious nature, .and are required to avoid potential difficulties which may arise as a consequence of the monetary limit currently specified in that section. Section 37 of the Insurance Act provides that insurers whose activities are confined to conducting insurance business with limited classes of persons-generally only members or employees of a company or a particular trade, industry or profession-and whose annual premiums do not exceed $500,000 may be exempted from certain provisions of the Act. Such exemptions are principally concerned with a reduced statutory reporting requirement and, consequently, less resources are required by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to supervise these companies. The specified limit on annual premiums was increased to $500,000 with effect from 19 January 1984. Since then, the real value of this amount has been gradually eroded to the extent that one of the insurers operating with a restricted authority under section 37 may shortly exceed the limit. Accordingly, this amendment proposes an increase in the limit on annual premiums these insurers may receive, from $500,000 to $750,000. The exemption granted to the insurer currently approaching the limit is due for review at the end of this year, and passage of the amendment will enable the Treasurer to give consideration to granting a further exemption. To facilitate further routine adjustments that may need to be effected to this limit, the Bill also provides that any future increases in the limit on annual premiums specified in section 37 may be effected by regulation. Financial Impact The amendments to the Insurance Act will result in minor indirect administraway tive savings. There will be no increased costs to the Commonwealth. I commend the Insurance Amendment Bill 1990 to the House, and, on behalf of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), I present the explanatory randum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) journed. NA NA NA (APPLICATION OF LAWS) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.",72
98,Mr KERR,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"--,This is the second occasion on which a Bill in this form has come before the House and the second occasion on which I have had an opportunity to debate it. When it was last before the House it came forward under the title Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill. Whilst retitled, the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill is essentially in identical form to its previous incarnation, which was before the Parliament before the last general election. When I spoke on the previous Bill, I said that this legislation was somewhat like the curate's egg-good in parts. I maintain that view. The legislation has two very important benefits: firstly, it clarifies an area of law over which there was some doubt in the past, and in particular, with respect to Commonwealth government instrumentalities which have a commercial aspect, it subjects them to the general law of Australia so that they must behave in the scheme of things as must any other person subject to the legal regime in the country. Those two developments are much to be commended and I congratulate the Government for them. But, when we turn to the third aspectthe question which we have spent ml,lch time debating in the past day, that is, the in which the Commonwealth itself will be bound-there is very grave concern amongst a range of members. My view is that the basic principle that we should operate under is that the Commonwealth ought to enjoy no general immemomunity from the application of the ordinary law and should be exempt from the application of the ordinary law only adwhere the Parliament expressly so provides. That seems to me to be a result which flows from very basic principles of justice. The principle is supported by the views of the judges in the High Court in the Evans Deakin case where the Court said, referring to the case of Maguire v. Simpson decided in 1977: That case establishes that in every suit to which the Commonwealth is a party Section 64 requires the rights of the parties to be ascertained, as nearly as possible, by the same rules of law, substantive and procedural, statutory and otherwise, as would apply if the CommOliwealth were a subject instead of being the Crown. The Court then said, and these are words which I emphasise: That result seems certainly just; the Commonand wealth acquires no special privilege except it is not possible to give it the same rights subject it to the same liabilities as an ordinary subject. If one starts from the basic principle that the Commonwealth ought attract to itself no special benefits by its nature as the Crown then one has to be extremely concerned about the method which is being employed in this Bill with respect to State laws. Clause 5 (3) subjects the Commonfore wealth only to very limited specified classes of the written laws of a State, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island sets out those classes, including a codified tort law, laws concerning procedure and civil litigation and laws declared by the regulations as applicable to the Commonand wealth. So there are three classes of laws which will apply. The first of those three classes is the codified tort law, but that is a very narrow range of law which would otherwise apply to the Commonwealth from State jurissome dictions. Laws concerning procedure civil litigation are obviously important not in a substantive way, and then there is the third class, laws declared by lations to be applicable. This scheme essentially will work so that the Commonwealth will decide which State laws apply to it and will therefore have to review the whole body of law generated from each of the six States, two Territories and the legislature of Norfolk Island to determine which of the varthe ious measures it will subject itself to to what extent. The view that has been put forward the Government in the second reading speech is that it will take a very broad attitude on which measures will be cluded within regulations to give effect State laws and to so bind the Commonwealth wealth. I welcome the undertakings given by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in the second reading speech from page 7 ondoes. wards, which provide that regulations will be made to apply, for example, to the general motor traffic laws, including the licensing of vehicles; occupational health safety laws, until such time as the where Commonwealth so provides its own legand islation; a large body of contract law; and, very importantly, State laws which relate to the securing of the payment of moneys payable to subcontractors, the very matter which gave rise to the Evans Deakin case. I want to congratulate the present Attorney-General because that express undertaking was not included in the undertakings made by the former Attorney General when this matter came last be the House. I then expressed concern that that particular matter had not been the so included, and obviously the current and Attorney-General has ensured that the concerns that I expressed have been addressed. But it still seems to me an inapt inelegant solution to the way in which State the Commonwealth will be subjected to the general legal regime that we have this 'opt-in' situation. It has been pointed out by speakers on both sides of the House that this provides reason for concern. The honourable' and member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) exbut pressed some reservations about this matter and very strong statements have been regumade by honourable members opposite. It is somewhat unrealistic to expect that the Commonwealth will comb avidly over each piece of State legislation and then pass regulations to make sure that the Commonwealth remains generally subject the to the law of the land as it evolves. Let us even assume that the best will in world is applied to this task. Firstly, and we will have a plethora of subordinate legislation necessitated by each change of by the law by State governments, which would affect the general framework of the law in areas'such as town planning, enviinronment law, laws relating to consumer to protection and_ the like. If the Commonwas to keep up in these important areas, it would need to make much more subordinate legislation than it currently However, it does not require too much cynicism to suspect that ultimately the Commonwealth may, simply through inertia, if no more, fall behind the task of making sure that its law and its regulation making processes keep up with the six States, the two Territories and the legislature of Norfolk Island. The problem I foresee in this piecemeal, patt by part approach is that the very fabric of the law as it applies across Australia is likely to become quite moth holed with respect to the way in which the Commonwealth subjects itself to a part of State law here and a part of State law there and does. not pick up State law as a coherent whole. That is important because in a complex Federal system such as Australia where the law making authority is devolved between a variety of different parliaments, it is not only the Commonwealth which makes much of the important law we are ordinarily subject to but also the States. So if we have this piecemeal approach then the ordinary citizen is going to be presented with a grave dilemma because to ascertain whether in his dealings with the Commonwealth he will be satisfied the Commonwealth is bound by the ordinary laws that apply to him, he will have to ascertain through a vast body of delegated legislation precisely which rules of State law do so apply, and then will have to refer back to the text of those State laws in some detail to ascertain which parts, if any, have been excepted out. So I see it that it has to be a particularly complex and herculean task the Commonwealth has set itself. It would be far better if the Commonwealth were to respond to the suggestion of the New South Wales Bar Association which is that instead of having an opt-in system where the Commonwealth picks and chooses between particular State laws which are made on a regular, daily basis, the Commonwealth applies the general body of State law but with the right to take itself out of the reach of any particular State law by regulation. This is the proposal that was put to the Government by the New South Wales Bar Association and other law societies and I believe it has much to commend it. The Bar Association makes the point when it says: . . . The natural hesitation of bureaucrats and policy makers to extend the liabilities of the Commonwealth will often mean that no good reason for extensionof State laws to the Commonwealthwill be found. Every new State or Commonwealth law if it is decided to make it apply to the Commonwealth will always involve potential and unforeseeable liabilities for the Commonwealth. There will always be therefore a strong argument in the mind of the policy maker and regulator against the application of such laws to the Commonwealth. Arguments against application will therefore always win the day. The Bar Association argues: The only effective counterweight is to bring before policy makers and regulators a reminder of the inherent justness and public benefit in equality before the law for the Commonwealth as well as for its citizens. This fundamental principle of the public interest is likely to be forgotten unless it is enshrined in the draft bill. It therefore argues that the Commonwealth should approach the task of determining which State laws apply to it by starting with the general premise that all State laws will so apply and then using its resources to decide whether there are any particular legislative steps that the States adopt which they wish to withdraw from. That would be a course I would very strenuously commend to the Attorney General for his future attention. Notwithstanding these very grave reservations which I have, I return-because it is appropriate to say this-to the point that the Bill does represent a very important step forward in practical terms for citizens dealing with Commonwealth commercial enterprises. It is in that area where the citizen will probably have the most direct dealings with the Commonwealth in any case, and in that area the new provisions in the Bill are entirely appropriate. They make sure that corporations which are Commonwealth corporations are not only subjected to the ordinary law which applies to any individual in trade but also ensure such corporations are not· singled out by the States in any punitive or damaging way. In so far as this legislation does .clarify the legal position of the Commonwealth commercial corporations, it is landmark legislation. It will be successful, it will achieve precisely what it is intended to do, and it will make sure that citizens having dealings with Commonwealth corporations can confidently deal with them on the same footing as if they were ordinary corporations bound by the same laws that apply with respect to all other corporations trading or doing business within the jurisdiction in which that corporation operates. One is always faced with dilemmas, as a member of this House. The dilemma here is that this Bill does significantly improve and clarify the law in the area of citizens having dealings with the commercial arms of the Commonwealth. I believe that that is a very important plus. Like my colleague the honourable member for Fisher, I have very grave reservations about the way in which the Commonwealth, in its non-commercial aspect, will be subject to the law. Those are matters which I have previously expressed views upon and which I do trust that the Attorney-General will note.",73
99,Mr DUFFY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"in reply-There are some committee stage amendments which have been foreshadowed by the Opposition, .but in closing the second reading debate I would like just to cover some of the matters raised by the honourable member for  able member for Higgins (Mr Costello) from the Opposition side and by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) from this side of the House. I think that initially almost all of the speakers canvassed the reason for this legan islation whilst expressing different views on it. They went back to the Evans Deakin Industries Ltd decision. It is probably common ground that it was the view that, in the interests of the community, the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, the legal position should be clarito fied after the Evans Deakin decision. I think the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Higgins-I do not think I misrepresent their position-and certainly the honourable member for Fisher indicated that it was a fairly finely balanced decision as to which way the Government went. I have a suspicion that, in the event of those members opposite having been returned to the treasury bench in the last election, they would in fact be putting forward the same legislation as we are today, despite the concerns they have expressed. Having said that, I think it is reasonable to take up the point made by those three honourable members and then reinforced by the honourable member for Denison in the final contribution to the debate, that it is, I suppose, a fairly fine balance. We as a Government examined the various alternative solutions. Of course, one of the approaches was the one that has been canvassed to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation that should or should not apply. However, that approach would have been impracticable. Very considerable resources would have been needed to monitor existing and new Acts, the self governing Territory Acts and subordinate legislation, as was referred to by the honourable member for Denison; inevitably, there would have been delays pending the enactment of Commonwealth legislation; and, in light of the sorts of problems that various members have put forward in criticism of the legislation and whilst acknowledging that it is finely balanced as to which way a government should go, the Commonwealth would incur obligations, liabilities and, for that matter, rights. I think it would have been undesirable situation. That is the reason that we decided to go the way we did. The basic approach of the Bill is to make clear what State and Territory legislation does apply to the Commonwealth and to Commonwealth instrumentalities. The Commonwealth will be subject only State and self-governing Territories legislation-that is, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island-if it opts in. I think that that was the main argument put forward by people who contributed to this debate. One of the points made was that there was some view that people were not being treated equally. I would like honourable members to have a think about the fact that, if the opting-out approach were adopted, it would be far worse because the States and Commonwealth in that situation would not be in an equal position. If we examine the opting-out position, we find that the States, when enacting their laws, would consider whether they should be bound by their own laws, but the Commonwealth would be automatically bound without prior consideration of the merits of being bound and would subsequently have to make regulations. Under the optout approach, the States would be in a privileged position. I think that if we analyse the opt-in and opt-out options, there is no question that the way we have gone in a difficult situation is certainly the best way to go. The State and self-governing Territory legislation which will apply automatically to the Commonwealth-I want to deal with some matters which we will be considering in addition to that-is, under section 5 (3) (a), tort law legislation codifying, modifying or extending the application of the common law with respect to liability in tort, for example, a law with respect to proceedings against or contributions between joint tortfeasors, and contributory negligence. The Commonwealth may opt out of these laws by regulations. The civil procedure legislation under section 5 (3) (b) concerns procedure in civil litigation. That is a different matter. As far as that is concerned, if we look at the section we see that there is no provision in civil procedure for regulations in relation to that. So there is no opt-in provision in respect of civil procedures I do not think it is as easy a matter as some people who have spoken in the debate have indicated. If one thinks about the opting-in approach, one sees that it is justified. The question of the resources involved has been noted but tb-11 dismissed a little. The resources involved would be very substantial if one had to monitor all existing andl new State Acts and subordinate legislation, including local government legislation, to determine which ones were excluded. Although people have said that it is balanced whichever way one goes, the task involved would have been enormous. It is inappropriate for some kinds of State laws to apply to the Commonwealth, such as laws imposing mil1imum charges for the provision of goods and services. Then, for example, there is the Tasmanian legislation fixing minimum taxi charges-and I do not refer to Tasmania because the honourable member for Denison was necessarily involved in the debate. The impact of particular State laws might be overlooked or not fully appreciated until after the Commonwealth had incurred inappropriate obligations, liabilities or rights. I think people have tended to spend too much time on the question of what liability may flow to the Commonwealth. There is also the question of rights which may accrue as a result of this legislation. Under the opting-in approach, the States could notify the Commonwealth of each law that the States wanted to apply to the Commonwealth. It is going to be a lot easier if it is to be done in that way; they can notify the Commonwealth and the merits of applying those laws can then be considered by the Commonwealth on a case by case basis. The honourable member for Denison picked up some of the other matters on the question of what laws will apply when he referred to the rules of the road, road traffic laws other than those providing for the licensing of vehicles, general criminal laws, except in so far as they purport to apply to the Crown, and occupational health and safety legislation. The law for securing payment for moneys payable to subcontractors was another matter mentioned. Some examples of State laws that the Commonwealth would consider declaring to be applicable to the Commonwealth are as follows: zoning and planning laws and building regulations; laws regulating the keeping of and dealing with animals, including wildlife; weights and mea.sures laws; dangerous goods laws; regulatIon of storage; transport; importation' sale; laws regulating the installation and operation of machinery to secure the safety. of persons and property; scaffolding and. hft- laws; a.nd laws concerning the notIficatIon of dIseases. The decision as to whether a particular State law should apply to the Commonwealth would need to be made in consultation with other interested Ministers and then ultimately dealt with by the Government as a whole. In the past Government legislation has always been drafted on the basis that State legislation cannot apply to the Commonwealth. Any decision to apply State hiw would therefore have important consequences for a wide range of Commonwealth activities. I think these consequences need to be identified and considered before a decision is made on whether the State law should apply to the Commonwealth. I think it can be handled that way in a reasonably satisfactory manner, whilst taking on board the fact that in all of the contributions that have been made by those who accept the legislation t-ey ha-e po-nted 0!lt that they have some dIfficultIes wIth vanous aspects of it. But, on balance, I am convinced that this is the best way to go. . The Opposition - as exercised its right m opposmg the legIslation and proposes to move amendments in the committee stage. As some of the previous speakers have said, it may be a matter of balance. On considering all of the issues involved I am satisfied that we have come dowon the right side of the argument put forward as to whether it is opting in or o.ut. - think. we came to the right concluSIon m movmg for the opting-in proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 5.",76
100,Mr COSTELLO,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"I move: Clause 5, page 3, before paragraph (3) (a) the following paragraph: (aa) any law that discloses (expressly or otherwise) an intention that the State and the Commonwealth should be bound by it unless it is declared by the regulations to be a law to which this subsection does not apply; The amendment was foreshadowed by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  mg the second reading debate. I now give a brief explanation as to what the amendment is about. It proposes to add a new paragraph (aa) to clause 5 (3). Currently, clause 5 (3) provides that the Commonwealth is subject to the following written laws of a S!ate, that is, statutory laws, namely, codIfied tort law, any law with respect to civil procedure, and any law declared by the regulations to be so applied. Paragraph (c) of clause 5 (3) represents the thrust of the Government's opting-in approach that underlines the Bill. In other words, with the exception of laws relating to tort and civil procedure, which are mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b), the Commonwealth is not subject to State laws unless it chooses to opt into the jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (c). In his speech, the shadow Attorney General explained the concerns which the coalition has in relation to this proposal. In my speech on the matter I also outlined why we consider the scheme of the Bill to be defective in this respect. Although the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) concedes it is a fine line, he has come down on the wrong side of the line. The amendment which we seek to introduce will enable the Attorney-General to come down on the right side of the line. I theref?re - ppeal to the Attorney-General, in hstemng to the persuasive arguments that we have advanced in the course of this debate, to reconsider his fine line approach, to take this opportunity to accept the amendment and to come down on the better side with the better view. Let me briefly explain the intent of this amendment. One of the concerns of the present state of law relating to section 64 of the Judiciary Act is that the Commoninsert wealth may, by virtue of the commencement of a suit, become subject to State legislation that would not ordinarily be binding upon the Commonwealth. The amendment would overcome this concern and would also be consistent with the reasoning underlining the High Court's decision in Bropho's case. The laws that would be picked up and made applicable to the Commonwealth under this amendment would be those laws which, because of their general application, would be binding upon the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or the State. As a matter of principle, this approach is consistent with recent developments in the area of Crown immunity. The form of the amendment also allows the Commonwealth at a future date to opt out in specific situations where it is believed the Commonwealth should not be subject to such laws of general application. The amendment also complements the amendments that clause 15 of this Bill makes to section 64 of the Judiciary Act. By virtue of the changes that clause 15 will make, the Commonwealth, when involved in litigation, will not be liable by reason of any statutory law to which the Commonwealth is not ordinarily subject. The amendment moved by the Opposition will have the effect of restoring the presumption of equality, but only where, by reason of the general nature of the relevant legislation, the Commonwealth would, regardless of section 64 in its present state, be bound by such legislation. Furthermore, the amendment would place the Commonwealth in the same position vis-a-vis State laws as it is in with respect to Commonwealth laws under subclause 5 (2) of the Bill. With the passing of this amendment, the features of the Commonwealth Act which implement .its scheme for opting in rather than opting out would be transformed. We would then get back to a position where the Commonwealth would not be able to take advantage of the situation by not acting quickly and efficiently to opt in and thereby conferring on itself an advantage which it ought not to have. This is a very important amendment and I urge the Government to accept it.",78
101,Mr CHANEY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"1 want to speak briefly in support of the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The reason I want to speak now is that I thought that if I raised a couple of points the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) may be able to respond to both of us at the same time. As I think the Attorney General knows, I propose, if this amendment is not successful, to move a further amendment that' was mentioned in the second' reading debate by the honourable  the matter which I wanted the Attorney General to address is the application of State pollution laws to the Commonwealth. I wanted some guidance for the Committee from the Attorney-General on whether he is aware-as his Government is certainly aware, because it has been a matter of discussion which has involved the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)-that there are some pollution problems with respect to the operation of Commonwealth authorities which are of course operating within the States; that some of those problems have been of a rather long standing nature; and that this has been a matter of concern at the State level and indeed at the ministerial council level. I must say I listened to most of the debate and thought it was a most learned and highly legal debate. There were a few slips of standards, but I will not inform the honourable member for Higgins on whose part. It was in fact a debate on the very important legal principles which were involved. I noted that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), for example, was making it very clear that he thought the arguments were very much on balance. I thought that the Attorney General in his response actually attributed to both the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Higgins the view which had actually been expressed by the honourable member for Fisher. I thought the honourable member for Fisher was most equivocal in his defence of the Government position and I think he could, in the delicate balance that he was describing, very easily and I suspect much more happily have slipped into the Opposition position. Indeed, would venture the view that, if we had more flexible approach to committee dethis bate in this place-something that I hope to live to see-the honourable member for Fisher would have been with the Opamendment position with respect to this amendment; but I understand that that is not the way this chamber operates and I think that something that is true of honourable I members on both sides of the chamber. just think it is a pity. I did not hear the totality of the Attorney-General's response when he was listing the areas where the Commonto wealth might expect provision to be made for the application of State laws and I may have missed some reference to envithe ronmentalcontrols, to pollution controls and things of that nature. If I did, ogise to the Attorney-General, but appreciate if he could-",79
102,Mr DUFFY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,I didn't refer to that.,80
103,Mr CHANEY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,I would appreciate some indication at this stage of the Attorney-General's state of knowledge as to whether this is in fact a current probthat lem and one which is regarded as worthy of consideration by his Government.,80
104,Mr DUFFY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"With respect to the first amendment moved by the honourable member for. Higgins (Mr Costello), I think a sense we really have covered that debate previously, because the amendment has been moved by the honourable memfor ber for Higgins attempts to introduce what is really-certainly, on my reading of itthat a modified opt-out approach. That is a situation in which State laws would apply if they disclosed the intention to bind both the State and' the Commonwealth, unless regulations declared that the do not apply. As I indicated in closing the second reading debate and repeat briefly now, that amendment does not commend itself to the Government for the reasons I have already outlined. Although I accept it is pretty finely balanced, as I said lier and as has been said by the various speakers, I also said earlier that I think it depends which side of the chamber one is I on. I think the Opposition member would a take a different view if he had been on side. I do not think that that amendment in fact meets what we want to do with this legislation. I did not get the quite as early as I would have liked. Nevertheless, with the time. I have had to look at it, I did not dismiss it. On is balance, upon thinking about the matter, believe it is an attempt, as I have said, I to introduce a modified opt-out approach which does not appeal to me at all. It in fact flies against the fundamental thrust of the legislation that we have introduced attempt to overcome the problems that we are faced with. Whilst that is not accepted by everyone, I still say that it is best way to go.

105,Mr DUFFY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I am sorry. I thought the honourable member had attended to that. I will deal with one later. In respect of the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Kooyong and which was addressed-Mr Costello-No, it was mine.",80

107,Mr COSTELLO,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"We have heard the reply of the Attorneylaws General (Mr Duffy) in relation to the amendment which is being proposed. I would just like to disclose to the Attorney General that the amendment which is being proposed is in fact supported by the Attorney-General for the State of New that South Wales, Mr John Dowd, who has eardiscussed this matter with the Opposition. The Federal Attorney-General has not at any stage, either in his reply or in his speech, indicated what the position of the States is on the particular scheme. He keeps reinforcing to us that it is a fine balance and one would have thought that, in a fine balancing act like this, there would have been serious negotiations with the States concerning the matter; but he has not in fact referred to that. The Attorney-General has not indicated to the chamber that there has been any agreement· with the Steering Committee of Solicitors-General or any agreement to the proposal which the Commonwealth is putting forward from the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and, from the information that we have had and from the request which has been put forward to us from the Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales, that State at least-a State which I might say the Commonwealth admires greatly when it comes to constitutional reform-has requested this particular amendment. There is a lot of force in that request. This in fact is an amendment which goes to the heart of the federal balance. We say that the provision which is made, whilst it preserves the .rights of the Commonwealth, by this mechanism would be a much fairer and equitable resolution of this particular question and would give proper meaning to federalism.

108,Mr CHANEY,PAIRS,"The Baldwin, P. J. Beazley, K. C. Government having rejected the amendment moved by the honourable member Brereton, L. J. Brown, Robert for. Higgins (Mr Costello), I therefore move: Clause 5, page 3, after paragraph (3) (b) insert the following paragraph: ""(ba) any law with respect to standards relating to pollution and waste disposal unless it is declared by the regulations be a law to which this subsection does not apply;"". The amendment which was just rejected by the Committee on the votes of the Australian Labor Party members was an amendment that put down a general requirement that would have meant that the law applied unless it was declared not to apply. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) made the point that this went against the thrust of the on-balance decision that had been taken by the Government and underlies this Bill. This amendment is much narrower. It relates only to those laws with respect to standards relating to pollution and waste disposal. Even so, the Opposition is not saying that laws relating to pollution and waste disposal apply to the Commonwealth whatever. We are still suggesting that there can be a power by regulation to exempt the Commonwealth, although we hope that that would be an exceptional circumstance. We moved that amendment in the context of the Government and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who I am glad is in the chamber, having made very powerful statements about the Government's intention to ensure that Australia has the most rigorous possible pollution standards. It is interesting to see what Minister Kelly has had to say. On 5 May this year she said, I will certainly seek to implement the strongest pollution standards in the world. By that that we expect industry not to undervalue country . . . I would respectfully say that, while those are very fine words, it is all very well to vironment. be reading lectures to industry, but there is a very substantial slice of activity this country which is governed not by industry but by government. I would have thought that the premier responsibility the Commonwealth Government was to ensure that its own instrumentalities met the very high standards the Minister is demanding of industry and, indeed, of of us. This is a very simple test of good faith, in my view. We have here a situation to which is not seen by the Opposition as complicated or difficult. Indeed, we have a very long-standing commitment to the measure I am putting forward in this amendment. We have a Government which, for its part, is claiming that it wants the very best and most stringent standards in the world. Again, I am quoting the Minister for the environment, who is at the table now with the Attorney General and who, I am sure, would regard it as a moral obligation to meet the pollution standards that have been laid down. After all, how can the Minister say on the one hand that she wants the toughest pollution standards in the world and then on the other hand say that the pollution standards that already exist in Australia and that are laid down by the Stat\!s under their legislation should not bind the Commonwealth? This is not a matter I raise in the absence of some long term commitment from the Opposition. In the policy that was adopted and published by the Opposition earlier this year we said: We will ensure that the Commonwealth adheres to relevant State legislation in this areaand I interpolate that this is under the heading 'Pollution and Waste Disposal'by waiving any relevant claims to Commonwealth Crown immunity. In other words, it is not some new point. We made the point early that we see it as inappropriate that the Commonwealth should claim to be exempt from the polI mean lution standards that are properly imour posed upon the citizens, companies, corporations and businesses that have been lectured by the Minister for the enThis is not an abstract matter we raise in without any factual base. This matter has been the subject of discussion by Commonwealth and State Ministers because of the Commonwealth does not always meet the standards that are required. The unhappy reality in Australia in 1990 is that, notwithstanding the very clear statements all by the Minister for the environment, Commonwealth instrumentalities continue to pollute and to do things that would not be acceptable if done by corporations or by private citizens. Indeed, we find that in New South Wales our defence forces, for example-the Army, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force-have problems with respect to sewage treatment, land degradation and noise complaints. We are not in the first flush of a new government seeking to remedy the ills left behind by a tired government. This is, think, the eighth year of the Hawke Govest ernment. Whilst it is interesting to come into this place and listen to the historical reminiscences of Ministers about the sins of the past, I was pleased that my colfurther league the shadow Treasurer, able member for Flinders (Mr Reith), made the point that in the last 15 or years we have had a lot of Labor governcerned ment; but for the last eight years we have had a Labor Government that has made a great deal of political capital out of environment debate. It has made a lot of its purity and of its intentions, in the words of the present Minister, to be the toughest in the world. When is the Government going to get tough on the fact that even its own sciGovernment entific organisation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organparticular isation, has caused some problems that have concerned the Victorian Environrespect ment Protection Authority? When is Government going to do something about the Tasrail oil discharge problems that have been a concern to the Tasmanian Environment and Planning Department? When is the Government going to meet the concerns of the Northern Territory Administration, which has been conernment. cerned about some of the failures of our defence forces to meet sewage treatment requirements, to meet noise requirements, and to meet problems of soil erosion? I have said before in this place that, unless we are engaged in some sort of expensive charade in here, we are supcloselysorts posed to be looking, in the committee stage, at the detail of this Bill, which will shortly become law. We know that it will get further examination in the Senate. hope that if this amendment is not suplution ported here it will get the support Australian Democrats in the Senate so that the position can be made quite clear. I say to the Minister at the table that this is an area where, on the Government's clear public statements, it is totally illogical and wrong to suggest that the Commonwealth should be exempt from the pollution standards that apply to other Australians. The official position of the I Government is that it supports the toughpollution standards in the world. There can be no justification for it saying, 'I am sorry; we will not be bound by State pollution standards unless, as a separate and act of government, we pass reguthe honourlations to that effect.' We have had notice from the Attorney20 General that the Government is conabout the administrative complexity, the cost, the expense of having to trek through this great mass of State legislathe tion, and indicating what it wants to opt out of. I would have thought, on the statements of Minister Kelly, that that should be a totally inexpensive exercise as far as pollution control is concerned. It is totally inconsistent with the suggestion that the supports the toughest standards in the world to say that of course a standard imposed by, let us say, the authorities in New South Wales with to sewage, noise, soil or whatever the is too tough for the Commonwealth. I ask the Attorney-General to take seriously the words of his fellow Minister, Minister Kelly, to regard them as being words of literal truth, and to ensure that this Bill, shortly to be an Act, actually reflects the position claimed by the GovThere is a widespread view in the community that this Government says one thing about the environment before an election and does another thing after the election. Before the election it says things about the south-east forests and the Gippsland forests. It says things about all of issues that do not seem to reflect what happens after an election. I am now asking the Government to be bound by a post-election statement that it I supports the most stringent, toughest polstandards in the world, and I ask of the it to support this amendment.",81

I hesitated to stand, for I had hoped that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the vironment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) would speak on the subject matter which the honourable member for Pearce discussed, and I was disappointed that she did not. I do not want to go too into it but I re-endorse what the honourand able member for Pearce had to say: the concern for Commonwealth responsibility in the control of pollution around Auslation tralia has been a very long term policy the coalition parties.

I gather it is very non-legal of me to announce that I will be talking for a brief period. I listened to the speech Attorney-General with great interest and I too was impressed, as a layman, by the complexities in the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Applicalution tion of Laws) Bill 1990. The thing that has prompted me to stand is the fact that I did not hear the Attorney-General tion pollution in the list of legislation mentioned. I hope-and I am sure-it was only an oversight on his part. I see the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories nodan amendment. ding to the Attorney, so I think we will have the benefit of her joining in the bate. I will not even begin to talk about optthinglayman ins and opt-outs; that is beyond my comwhom I respect petence. We on this side of the chamber the Government very are very concerned about pollution ters where Commonwealth authoritiesand I do not blame anyone political party in this regard-have not maintained the strict pollution rules that have been laid on them by the States. We could go through a whole list of people and a whole list of activities which we know are offenfor sive to State legislation around Australia. I merely take the advice of such learned honourable members as the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr and the honourable member for Pearce that the delicate balance should be such that issues such as pollution do not Enallow the Commonwealth to have an out. I am not doubting the sincerity of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for one moment, but it strikes me as strange that, far in the statements she has been makingI have supported her statements all along-she has not been able to make this an issue when this very significant legisis before this chamber. I sincerely of hope that, should this fine amendment by the honourable member for Pearce be not nonadopted by the chamber-and I have the I faint suspicion it may not be-the Government will look into these situations and before the legislation goes through the other chamber. In saying that, I hope that we see some definite change in whatever time it takes for this Bill to go to the of the Senate and be considered there. I shall not go against Standing Orders and go into a total environmental discussion during debate on this Bill, but polis of such significance to me and to the Liberal Party-and has been for the long period of time.

I am glad to have been the of this advocate here to put someilk to the Attorney-General, will deeply. I hope that do something about matthis in the intervening period.",84
110,Mrs KELLY,PAIRS,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (5.44)-First of all, I would like to thank the Opposition for this amendment. It is a problem of timing us. I first became aware of this amendment when I came into the chamber today; I was in here because I have a sports Bill, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill, coming up as the next item on today's agenda. I have no problem with this amendment in principle, but it is not appropriate at this stage for the Government to agree to it because it is an issue that I must raise with my colleagues. I think the raising of the amendment says something about the processes of this chamber. If we had time to raise this issue in a more informal way prior to the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Applications of Laws) Bill coming into the chamber, there may have been the opportunity to deal with it before it was actually discussed here. Nevertheless, I think it is a very important issue and I will follow it through. Frankly, I think it is an issue that must be addressed even in the context of the new partnership with the States. One of the great progresses in the area of the environment emerged from the Premiers Conference held recently in Brisbane, because emerging from that was a memorandum of understanding on the environment. We are now trying to get agreed standards and agreed legislation throughout this country to deal with issues like pollution. As an essential part of that, the Commonwealth must play its role. I think that is essential and it will be an issue that the Government can address through its own processes. I thank the Opposition for raising it.",84
111,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"1 thank the honourable member for Canberra, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), for her intervention, but I would like to raise a couple of matters. When the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) moved his amendment, he said that it was a narrow amendment. Mr Chaney-Narrower than the first.",85
112,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"Sure, and I think that in a sense the fact that it is a lot narrower amendment, and therefore very specific, is one of the problems in the context of this discussion. At the moment clause 5 (3) (a) of the Bill says: . . . a codified tort law other than any declared by the regulations not to be a law to which this subsection applies So it is a very general area the honourable member for Pearce is talking about-the whole of the codified tort law. Clause 5(2) (c) refers to 'any law with respect to procedure in civil litigation'. Again, that is a very wide area. I do not propose to spend any time on the opt-in approach, but that is not one of the opt-in provisions-with apologies to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Mr Chaney-We will excuse you.",85
113,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Pearce. The provision in respect of procedure in civil litigation, which will apply to the Commonwealth in any event, is not one of the opt-in provisions. The honourable member for Cook raised a question of some concern', saying that in the response in th- second reading debate I did not mention pollution laws as an example of State laws that the Commonwealth would certainly consider declaring to be applicable to the Commonwealth. The very first category on the list of such laws in my speaking notes was 'Pollution laws (air, noise, water, radiation),; the second was 'Zoning and planning laws (building regulations, laws regulating keeping and dealing with animals .. .'. I dealt with those in the second reading speech. The reason that I did not deal with pollution laws at the end of the second reading speech was that I had a reasonable anticipation that I would have a lecture from the honourable member for Pearce in any event and therefore I thought we could deal with that at the committee stage. I am quite happy to table the speaking notes if the honourable member for Cook 1)0 desires, because there was no intention to not mention the pollution laws. In fact, it was saving the best wine till last in a sense because I knew that this matter would arise in the committee stage. However, the Minister for Arts, Sport the Environment, Tourism and Territories mentioned the problems in timing, and she is right. The amendment moved such law by the honourable member for Pearce starts off, 'Any law with respect .. .'. We do not know what the contents of these laws are and we do not want to accept them sight unseen. We can apply these laws, after we have looked at them, by using regulations. It is one of the opt-in provisions. That is, it is precisely the kind of law that we would certainly consider. . There is no question about that. As 1 said· in closing the second reading debate, the decision as to whether a particular State law should apply to the Commonwealth would need to be made in consultation with other interested Ministers and perhaps by Cabinet. 1 referred there to those specific items. 1 think 1 dealt with all the others. 1 now add pollution laws to that list. In respect of those, I think that the environment Minister has quite clearly indicated that she will take this matter on board. It may well be that before the matter gets to the Senate. the honourable member for Pearce will have drawn our attention-having sufficiently humbled us by his dissertation in this area-to how outrageously we were behaving when in fact it is one of the areas that we would certainly consider including anyway. 1 think the timing is wrong.· I am not in a position, nor do I consider that the environment Minister is in a position, to consider whether a particular State law does apply. That decision needs to be made in consultation with other interested Ministers and perhaps by Cabinet. It is for those reasons, and only for those reasons, that the principle proposed by the honourable member for Pearce is not opposed but the substance is, because I think it leaves us in a difficult position at this stage.",85
114,Mr CHANEY,PAIRS,"1 welcome two things: first, that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) thanked the Opposition for the amendment; and, secondly, that her comments were in line with the concluding comment of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and they have no problem in principle with what is proposed. They are very nice statements and underline the validity of the position which the Opposition has adopted. However, with the greatest respect to the Attorney-General, who shares a profession with me, it is understandable why both politicians and lawyers are terribly unpopular. It really was amazing to listen to what the Attorney-General had to say in response. It was all very well for him to say that we have this great mass of laws in the States governing pollution of the environment; that we expect the citizenry of this country to obey those laws; and that ignorance of the law is no excuse-even the non-lawyers in this chamber are aware of that. The Government says that it wants the highest pollution standards in the world to apply, yet the complexity of these laws is such that the Commonwealth cannot make up its mind that it ought to be bound by them. It is not as though the Opposition was saying that in no circumstances should the Government be able to exempt itself. In the perilous strategic situation that we face, it may be, although one would hope not, that our defence forces will be forced to do things quickly in a way which would involve their ignoring some planning laws and so on in a defence emergency. One would always expect the Commonwealth to have the power to exempt itself even from environmental requirements in the interests of national security. No-one is trying to diminish the capacity of the Commonwealth to do that. All that we are saying is that, in the absence of some specific need to exempt the Commonwealth, those standards should apply. It may well be that this debate simply demonstrates the extent to which Parliament as an institution is hog-tied and rendered a formality by the party processes which dominate this place and the iron grip of the Executive on the parliamentaryprocess. The truth is that what we are putting forward is utterly consistent with a principle that the Government is quite happy to accept, and with the Government's rhetoric with which it has purchased votes in this community, yet it is all too hard, when one actually gets down to making a decision, that the law should reflect the comments of the environment Minister. If I had a tongue which was considerably more silver than the tongue that I possess, I do not think that I would be able to shift the Attorney, who has heard many a plea. Indeed, I sometimes hear my Deputy Leader, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), referred to as a person who practised in the police court. I often think of the Attorney-General as a person who would have made an excellent magistrate. But I suspect that as an excellent magistrate he would have been deaf to the silver-tongued pleas of shyster lawyers about their awful clients and would have put them in gaol anyway. In this case, I expect him to be deaf to my pleas as well. I conclude my comments by saying that we are not talking about a matter which is abstract. In New South Wales there is sider this matter. worry about the fact that the sea is continually polluted, in a very unpleasant for the people of New South Wales, sewage. It is a pity that, with respect the Commonwealth's own establishments, we should find a State commission trying to have sewerage effluent disposed of satisfactory way and an agency of the Commonwealth simply refusing the comriously mission's approaches and stating its inIn tention to continue discharging sewerage effluent as it has been doing in the past. I do not know how one makes that sort of behaviour compatible with the Governa ment's rhetoric on the environment. Inat deed, one cannot do it. That is why the Minister comes in here and says that is pleased that the amendment was moved and that she accepts it in principle. this legislation is being passed in a form which does not reflect what the Governshe ment's public position is claimed to be. Another New South Wales example a Commonwealth authority relates to conwhich tamination in the soil. Another relates Cockatoo Island, of all places, where the sewage treatment works require considertralia in 1990. able upgrading. During my 15 years in Parliament I have listened to lectures the Australian Labor Party about the treatment of Aboriginal Australia, and find that at Wreck Bay the plant does not meet New South Wales-",86

116,Mr CHANEY,PAIRS,"The Minister chides me and says that I have given a few myself, ) and I accept that. I think that is a very fair response. At Wreck Bay we find that the sewage treatment plant does not meet the New South Wales criteria with respect to bypass and disinfection performance. I understand that it is of concern to the Australian Capital Territory Health Authority. Again, there is a gap between the Government's stated position and the reality, and it is that gap which is permitted by the form of law that the Government is putting in place in this chamber today. I hope that the Minister, in light of the comments of the environment Minister and his own comments, will reconIn terms of the environment Minister's way view-that if a little more time had been by given the Government might have acto cepted this amendment-I suppose that I have been a little. discouraged by the procedures in this chamber from adopting in a the sort of approach that she has suggested, and I will take her suggestion sewith respect to future amendments. the other place, with Senator Walsh in particular, it was often possible to negotiate most sensible changes to legislation long before it hit the chamber, and if the environment Minister is prepared to take similarly rational approach to looking the quality of legislation and to trying to see that sensible suggestions from the she Opposition can be accommodated by the Government, then I will very much welBut come that. I am very happy to have a trial run with regard to the approach that has suggested. But I think it is a pity from the point of view of this chamber of that we cannot deal with an amendment is perfectly in line with what the to Government claims its policy to be and is certainly in line with the needs of Aus",87
117,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"The from Government over a period of time has submitted to the Australian public that it we has very good credentials on the environment because it has been prepared to cut through accepted understandings of the Constitution and use powers which it has gained for itself under international treaties to override State legislation. The Government got for itself a great reputation by stopping the Tasmanian dam when it was prepared to use the external affairs powers to override State legislation. A similar situation occurred in Queensland. The Government paraded itself before the Australian people on the basis that, 'We are prepared to cut through the niceties of constitutional doctrine to achieve substantive result. We won't be fettered by any rule, even though it be a Constitution, or any orderly approach to the law constitutionally, because we are interested in results'. When an amendment is moved by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) that says, 'Let us look at results in terms of protecting the environment and let us make the Commonwealth subject to anti-pollution laws and anti-waste disposallaws', what is the defence? The defence is 'That would not be an orderly approach to the law', not even 'That would not be an orderly approach to the interpretation of the Constitution' or 'That would not be an orderly approach to our system of regulating Commonwealth-State application of laws through this Bill'. It really is a classic bureaucratic defence. Then the Minister comes in and says, 'Well, maybe it is a good idea, but I have not been to Cabinet. It would have to go· back to Cabinet and it would have to consider it'. What is the reality of this amendment? The amendment simply means that the Commonwealth will be bound by laws in relation to pollution and waste disposal. What is the problem with the Minister standing up here in the chamber and saying, 'Yes, if those laws on waste disposal and pollution are good for everybody else, they are good enough for the Commonwealth'? By defeating this amendment, the Commonwealth is not even returning to the law as it currently stands; it is changing the laws as it currently stands. If proceedought ingswere taken under some of these Acts against the Commonwealth as it currently stands, by virtue of section 64 of the Judiciary Act its rights would be the same as those of any other party. So the current legislation could be enforced in litigation under section 64, but the Commonwealth says, 'As from the time this Act comes into effect, we will be giving ourselves a privilege'-that is, advancing the privilege it has under the current state of the law. It is not just the Commonwealth, either; it is Commonwealth corporations and Commonwealth servants and agents. So the Commonwealth driver who goes out the day after this Bill comes into effect, and before any consideration has been given to opting in, can blow a huge amount of exhaust out of his exhaust pipe, and when he is picked up by the New South Wales inspector under the noise pollution law, he can say, 'I claim Commonwealth privilege. I am a servant or agent of the Commonwealth. The New South Wales law relating to pollution standards does not apply to me because the Commonwealth Government has not opted in'. So immediately, by virtue of this Act and the refusal to pass this amendment, he has carte blanche to go polluting in his Commonwealth car around the State of New South Wales. The same would happen in relation to toxic waste. It is not a question of preserving for the Commonwealth wartime rights to infringe against environmental standards. Even that would not stand up because the Commonwealth, of course, has the Geneva Conventions Bill in this place, one of the provisions of which-and the Commonwealth supports it-is that in times of war one has to protect places of environmental importance. Apparently when it comes to the Geneva Convention, the Government even thinks that in time of war environmental standards ought to be preserved. What it apparently does not think is that, when its servants or agents get in their cars and start dumping their waste in the State of New South Wales or the State of Victoria in a time of peace in the ordinary execution of their duties, it not to be subject to standards relating to pollution and waste. What this really demonstrates is that, firstly, the Commonwealth has not thought seriously about this Bill-the Bill is flawed at the outset and that is a point we have made quite consistently in debate-and, secondly, its position on the environment, which has been trumpeted on the basis that it is prepared to cut through constito tutional doctrine, stands for nought, cause it is not even prepared to cut through this system, which involves no constitutional provision, to get The result is that the Commonwealth, as much as anybody else, ought to be commember plying with environmental standards. In that respect we see, in a concrete case, the misguided nature of the whole of the Bill, the relative unimportance that the Government attaches to the environmenjudged accordingly. tal case and a willingness on the part of the Government to give itself a privileged position, at least in the interim until it has considered bureaucratically whether to. or not to opt into particular laws. People in Australia do not agree with that kind of position. They do not believe that the Commonwealth can go around lecturing companies and decide that it will not be subject to the regime it wants everybody else to subject themselves to.

AGENCY BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November, on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the Bill be now read a second time.",89
119,Mr JULL,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"The Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill 1990 comes about as a result of the report of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into drugs in sport which, of course, was issued in May of 1989. Let me say at the outset that this study by the Senate was one of the most far reaching and, I suppose in many respects, controversial and one of the most meaningful reports that has ever come out of the Senate. I would like to pay tribute at this stage Morris, Peter to former Senator John Black and to other Newell, N. J. members of the Committee-Senator Noel Price, L. R. S. Crichton.;.Browne, Senator Coates, SenaPunch, G. F. tor Collins, Senator Coulter, Senator Scott, John MCGauran, Senator Panizza and Senator Scott, Les Zakharov-for all their efforts in compilSnow, 1. H. ing that report which, apart from the conSnowdon, W. E. troversy that it at some times generated, Theophanous, A. C. was a very difficult one to undertake and Tickner, R. E. one that met with a lot of opposition from a number of quarters in the Australian sporting and general community. Wright, K. W. The Opposition welcomes this legislation and, I suppose in a bipartisan way, Andrew, J. N. Cobb, M. R. we join with the Government, and I trust with every member of this House, in supSullivan, K. 1. Riggall, J. P. porting what is going on in this respect. Both of the Opposition parties completely Connolly, D. M. Peacock, A. S. oppose the use of drugs in sport and believe that it is the responsibility of sporting organisations to ensure that they regulate their individual sports correctly. This is probably one of the few areas where this Bill causes us some difficulties because on this side of the House we are rather averse to establishing yet another government statutory authority. But we recognise that in this case this has to be done because what has happened is that Third Reading there has been a failure over the years in self-regulation by Australian amateur sporting bodies. It is fair to say that in many respects they have failed to prevent the wide use of performance enhancing drugs. . While this particular subject has received a great deal of publicity over the years, it is also true to say that there has indeed been a very great change in the sporting culture of not only Australia but the world. However, if we are to be absolutely certain that we do absolutely everything we possibly can to eliminate the scourge of drugs from the sporting community then this Bill must go through and we must see the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. In commending honourable senators for the work they did, one thing was evident: the whole world was looking for some sort of lead in trying to overcome the problem of drugs in sport. To a very great extent it was the contribution of this Commonwealth Parliament that led the way and received due recognition from quite a number of international sporting bodies on the work it has undertaken and the reaction and the resultant action by the Government in getting this Agencyestablished. This is probably just the start, while some 2,000 samples will be taken on behalf of the Government every year to try to eliminate the scourge of drugs in sport and another 2,000 or 2,400 will be undertaken by the professional sports in .conjunction with this measure, I do not believe anyone could really say that we will see the elimination of all performance enhancing drugs as a result of the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. There will continue to be an ongoing battle as chemists and scientists more and more use their various wiles to develop new substances. It is absolutely important that here in Australia and through this Agency we realise that the fight must continue. We cannot let the activities of this Agency remain dormant; we must stay ahead of the world in trying to combat this particular scourge. While the emphasis has been very much on things like steroids, there have been other developments. If an athlete is prepared to spend something like $15,000 or $20,000 for hormone injections, he or she can probably get them, and over a fair distance an athlete can probably pick up another five seconds in time. But that is expensive and these tests apparently would not pick up that situation. So it is important that we see this as just a beginning, an ongoing struggle, to make sure that we eliminate drugs in sport. While the Opposition does not like the establishment of even more statutory corporations, in another place we will move an amendment to this legislation for the provision of a sunset clause to operate after three years so that we can examine exactly what the Agency is doing, how far it has advanced, how successful it has been in its present form and whether or not there is the opportunity for the private and amateur sporting organisations to take over a greater responsibility in the role of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. While the privacy conditions have been met, we do have another difficulty with one aspect of the Bill. Should an athlete return a positive test, that information and will be covered by the secrecy provisions. In many respects that is all very well and good but the Opposition is concerned about whether or not some publicity is needed should an athlete be caught out. Perhaps I could give as an example, although it might seem a little extreme: what happens if the Canberra Raidersand the rugby league people, very wisely, are going through these tests-undertake a series of tests in one week and half .the team proves positive? What happens the next weekend when the Canberra Raiders run out to get belted by the Brisbane Broncos and half the regulars of the team are not there and there has been no indication why they are not there, no indication of the real reason for their absence? While one could see in some cases it is important to protect privacy and to maintain the secrecy provisions, there is a reverse effect as well. If some information cannot be provided and if, for a genuine reason, an athlete did not turn up for an event, one can imagine what the rumour mills might say within the politics of sport on why that particular participant might not be attending on that particular day. While I realise it is d-fficult, we must look towards trying to get some sort of balance on how strictly we control those particular secrecy provisions. While the Government has provided $1,097 ,000 to the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories for this coming financial year for testing of amateur athletes, I believe the Agency does have a very real prospect of being able to claw back some of those funds the Government is allocating for drug testing. While I respect the fact that the professional sporting organisations are taking part in this program, Australia does have an opportunity as one of only 17 centres in the world to continue to promote Australia as one of the centres that is totally dedicated to the elimination of drugs in sport. We have been recognised by the International Olympic Committee as one of the official testing centres. I should hope that in some respects there will be a promotion by the people involved in the Agency to play a very real part in the world of athletics and in the world of sport in general to make sure that we encourage our near neighbours and other countries overseas to use our facilities. Australia has prepared to be a pacemaker in trying to eliminate drugs from sport. I would see it not in any cynical sense but as a great way of not only promoting Australia as a drug free society but also as a way of getting back some of those costs that may be involved in providing these particular tests. I do not think we should delude ourselves about the difficulties the Agency will face. While the Bill contains provisions to ensure that random sampling does go on-it is more than just the invention of new drugs to enhance athletic performance-we must make sure that the Agency has a capacity to really go into all ends and all the highways and byways of the sporting world to try to get rid of the drug menace. Honourable members who read the final report of that Committee were horrified by some of the accusations and the findings. It was alleged there are unscrupulous people in our community who are prepared to feed drugs to even pre-pubescent boys. If one has young people who are entering the sporting community and who have this culture of winning at all costs instilled in them and they are exposed to the world of performance enhancing drugs then it is a bad reflection on our community if we have not made our best effort to stamp this out. It is interesting to read the reports, example, that are now coming out of the Eastern bloc countries and in particular from the former East Germany on what went on there in the provision of drugs and all sorts of facilities to ensure maximum and winning performances from the athletes in that country. But what is even more frightening is what those drugs have done to some of the people who took them. I forget at the moment the name of the particular report but when a number of those European athletes were questioned on their taking of performance enhancing drugs and asked whether, if they were faced with a situation of winning a gold medal by using those drugs, knowing that it may ultimately result in death, they were still prepared to take those drugs, in many cases the answer was yes, winning was so terribly important to them. That psyche is a very scary one because as my friend the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) knows, once one enters international competition, the whole game becomes a very serious one indeed. There are people in the sporting community who are prepared to undertake those actions to win at all costs, and that is part of the thing that we must get rid of from the culture of Australia. That is why in that respect the Opposition welcomes, with some reservations, the establishment of another statutory authority through the provisions of the Bill. We will not oppose the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill.",90
120,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,92
121,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Perth) (8.00)The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is leaving the chamber. I know that he has a deep interest in this Australian Sports Drug Agency legislation, but he has many other pressing rural matters to deal with. This is landmark legislation. It is brought into this House in response to many of the concerns which were raised, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which was released early this year. It goes for a large part of the way towards dealing with some of the problems that exist in this particular area. There are some concerns that I will endeavour to raise in the debate about the legislation and the way in which the Agency operates. Principally, the Australian Sports Drug Agency will deal with the testing and education issues related to the problem of drugs in sport. It is a serious problem. It is one that has increasingly been the focus of media attention over the last decade. Probably the difficulties and problems have existed much longer than that. Indeed, if one reads the archives of sport, one would find stories over many decades, indeed throughout the century, of the use of substances by sports people to enhance their performance. But a number of questions need to be. asked about the mechanics of the Agency and how it will operate. As I have already said, I will endeavour to raise some concerns within this debate. There were also one or two issues raised by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Fadden. Perhaps I can lay to rest his concerns and maybe also disagree with one or two of the points that he made in his contribution. If we are going to have what is called an Australian Sports Drug Agency, one of the difficulties is what is actually meant by 'drugs' and how 'drugs' will be defined. There are a number of ways in which one can approach that. If we just pick up the Oxford Dictionary, it talks about an original medicinal substance. Of course, there are more contemporary ways in which we look at drugs and those substances that are abused in society, rather than those that are used for medicinal purposes. But this is one of the problems that the Agency will meet. Indeed, when one looks at the list of substances which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses to consider this issue, one finds on the list a large number of substances which are used by athletes for medicinal purposes. This is one of the difficulties that we find in international competition. For sports people at all levels, there is the possibility of unintentionacceptable, ally taking drugs and being seen as a drug user. Indeed, one story goes back to the 1968 Olympics when an Australian swimmer was eliminated from an Olympic competition because of a medicinal substance which he was using. When we talk about competition at the international level, at the cutting edge, we have to be certain about the sorts of judgments we are making about what is drug abuse and usage and what is unintentional and what is intentional. Indeed, the inadvertent use of drugs which takes one over the limit in international competition is something that we have to guard against. Ha ving some experience in this area, I can say that one who is competing at the Olympics is constantly reminded of the fact that there are a number of substances that one must be careful not to use because they can impinge on one's drug free status. It is a difficult problem and it is one that this Agency, with its present position within the Australian Sports Commission and as a statutory body, will have to deal with in a continuing wayover a long period of time. It is hoped that it will be able to sort out some of the ambiguities that are presently within the system. I can give some examples of that. We would all be aware that in the 1988 Olympics an Australian pentathlete, Alex Watson, was found guilty of having a caffeine level above what was considered acceptable. His defence at the time was that, in fact, he had drunk a number of cups of coffee before his competition. In his competition it was necessary to be alert and competing throughout the whole day. By taking in caffeine through coffee and Coca-Cola, he moved above the acceptable level. It is interesting to note that the level at which he was determined to be ineligible would have been acceptable had the acceptable level at the previous Olympics been applied, but an arbitrary judgment made by the IOC changed the level which was acceptable for that particular substance. So what at a previous Olympics would have been acceptable was no longer and an Australian athlete's career was tarnished perhaps forever as a result of that judgment. We need to be very careful about the way in which the testing of athletes is undertaken. It is also important to note that perhaps the more important job of the Agency will be of an educational nature. The job of the Agency is, firstly, to reach community groups; secondly, to reach the population in general and sporting groups; and, thirdly, to reach those elite athletes who are competing at an international level. The . requirements for each of those groups are different, and I am pleased to note that the Agency is presently in the process of making the issue of drugs in sport part of the school curriculum. Whether it fits within science, health education or physical education, it is an appropriate thing that we should be addressing, and it is an appropriate role for this Agency to undertake. For that reason alone, I believe that the establishment of the Agency can be justified. I have mentioned just one or two issues in respect of testing, so I will move away from the education role of the Agency because I do not believe that there is any conflict between ourselves and the Opposition in respect of that role. But the troversial area is that of testing. There many myths within the athletics world and within sport about the efficacy of certain drugs and whether or not they in fact do make a difference to one's sporting performance. I mentioned some of the substances which are listed as stimulants. I have already made the point about caffeine and its efficacy. Of course, the other principal stimulant that people talk about is amphetamines. It has long been the case that in sport it is understood that amphetamines have a role to play in some sports and have played a significant role for a long time. Cycling in Europe is a sport in which we would say that the lack of testing is one thing that indicates that amphetamines are probably still being used in that sport. It is clear that it would be appropriate for professional cyclists in the European theatre to be subject to testing. In many other areas, there is debate about whether or not amphetamines offer any advantage. In skilled sports, it appears that in fact there can be a significant amount of incoordination and difficulty in performing skilled tasks under the effect of amphetamines. The educational process will hopefully playa role in educating athletes as to the efficacy of those drugs, even if they want to use them. There is concern about a number of other substances, and I have already mentioned caffeine. I refer to the area in which there is least dispute in the medical fraternity-anabolic steroids. One finds clear evidence over a considerable period that these drugs do enhance performance. Anabolic steroids are drugs which are an analogue of the naturally occurring hormom: testosterone which is used for building muscle bulk and repairing injured muscle. It is clear that the use of these substances increases one's power and strength, so it is very important for sprinters and those involved in power events where strength and power are important. It is very clear that a number of athletes over a long period have been using these con- substances. Ben Johnson is perhaps the are best example of one who was caught using such substances. But it would be interesting to know whether or not other performers in the 100 metres final in 1988 had, in the past, used these substances as part of their training. Recent reports about the career of Darren Clarke indicate his considerable frustration with his athletics career because he believed he was running against athletes using these substances. It is clear that some of those athletes subsequently have tested positive to using these substances. It is appropriate that this Agency should be stamping out the use of those anabolic steroids which certainly enhance performance and certainly, in the long term, can be disadvantageous to the health of the people and athletes who use them. I do not think there is any dispute about the efficacy of those substances and the fact that they make a difference. As I mentioned earlier with regard to some of the stimulants, the evidence is that they are not of advantage to one's performance. It is very clear that the level at which testing has to be positive is something that would be disputed by many scientific reports. Whatever happens in respect of those substances that are in dispute, we need to be very careful about how we proceed. My concern about the legislation is not with the way in which testing will be undertaken or that testing will be undertaken; those are things that I endorse wholeheartedly. I also endorse the fact that many of the sporting bodies are going to take up the cudgel to try to clean up the use of substances in their sports; that is an appropriate action and something that is important. My concern relates to how the information will be used once it has been determined by the Agency that a person is a user. I will use the example given by the honourable member for Fadden, although I think it is a pretty poor one. He said that if half the Canberra Raiders could not make the field one week-and he suggested they might be playing against the Broncos and be beaten, but I doubt thatbecause they had been tested, the public had a right to know why they were not on the field. My view would be somewhat different from his because the· matter of one's substance abuse surely needs to be very carefully protected. Any athlete who submits himself to continual testing needs some protection against the sort of witchhunt that we saw occurring in the Senate Committee hearings during the last year, and the media hysteria that can be released by these types of reports. It is made very clear by the information that I have already provided that already, unintentionally, we have seen examples of athletes being eliminated from sporting competitions for levels of drug use which would now be considered acceptable, or are arbitrarily determined. We need to be very clear about those criteria. I turn to the classes of drugs which are subject to c-rtain restrictions within the IOC list. We see there substances such as alcohol. I suggest that perhaps even the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), when he played first class cricket, which he did extremely well for a while, probably had a drink from time to time after the game.",92
122,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Before, not after.",95
123,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Before the game. As a result, he may have eliminated himself from the team. But substances like alcohol and marijuana are mentioned in this list. There is no established case to show whether marijuana improves one's performance in sport. I think the scientific evidence in respect of that was very questionable. So the evidence of the use of this substance which is illegal in some places and which is subject to considerable dispute as to whether it is a performance enhancing agent needs to be very carefully considered before the press is informed or before the information is made available publicly. What concerns me is not that the Agency will be efficient in its testing; I am concerned about the sort of information that sporting administrators may ask for. My experience of sporting administrators is that many of them may be well-meaning, but many of them are inflexible and neanderthal in their thinking. It is my concern that this information, if made available, could affect the sporting careers of people who are gaining no advantage from what may be their habits. When one moves into the areas of alcohol and marijuana, one must ask specific questions about whether it is appropriate for sporting administrators to ask for testing for these substances. I believe the Agency understands this difficulty and is aware of it. My concern is that some of the sporting bodies may not share that concern. The other issue that was raised by the honourable member for Fadden related to the fact that there should be some mechanism whereby this information could become available. I suggest to him that within the legislation it is possible for the Minister to obtain the information and, if it is thought appropriate and indeed considered prudent, the Minister has the discretion to release information that is made available about substance abuse by any particular athlete. I have raised a number of issues. The last issue I raise is this: the big difficulty that faces the Agency is the difficulty in keeping up to date, because of the changes that have occurred over time in chemistry and in sports medicine. This legislation will make this statutory agency part of international agreements. The legislation will give it access to international research, technology, and information about drug use. One of the big problems that existed in the past was the inventiondetection gap. The time between someone coming up with a new. substance which may enhance performance and the ability of scientists to detect it as a substance being used by an athlete has been perhaps 18 months, or even longer. There are all sorts of scientific ways in which substance abuse can be masked. So the inventiondetection gap has allowed athletes over a period to have an unfair advantage which has not been available to others. It is our hope that this legislation allow our agency to become pre-eminent in the fight against drugs in sport to make competitions fairer and to eliminate some of the difficulties that have arisen before. I hope that sports administrators will be aware, and I understand from speaking to them that they are aware, of the difficulties that relate to some of the substances which are on the testing list, and I would hope that they will make allowances for some of these substances. I do not think it is appropriate, as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) mentioned, that we hand this back to the sporting agencies in three years time. What is appropriate is that this Agency be reviewed for its performance over time, and this legislation ·allows that to happen. It is not necessary for us to put a sunset clause into the legislation. It is necessary for to support it.",95
124,Mr MARTIN,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"it is indeed an honour to speak in the House this evening following my friend and colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) on a very important piece of legislation. It goes without saying that somebody with that honourable member's qualifications in medicine and sport is certainly well equipped to talk about this very important issue. I might also say that he and I together served on a parliamentary committee which addressed the issue of sports and sports funding in this country during the last 12 or 18 months. That committee touched on this very issue of drugs in sport, although it was a Senate committee which was responsible for publishing a document on this major issue and which received a great deal of publicity. I might just say that, whilst that particular inquiry in the Senate was the catalyst for the legislation before us this evening and the putting in place of an independent body to conduct comprehensive drug testing and educational programs for Australian sport-that is, the Australian Sports Drug Agency-I share his view about the conduct of that particular Senate inquiry. I would have to say that those of us who chair committees in the House of Representatives, and indeed those of will us who participate on those committees at various times, expressed alarm at the manner in which people could come before a Senate committee and make unsubstantiated allegations about some of Australia's leading athletes, and yet those allegations went unchallenged. In fact, I would go so far as to say that many of the reputations of Australia's leading sports men and women were sullied by some of those unsubstantiated allegations made at that inquiry. Notwithstanding my reservations about that, I would have to say that, coming out of the inquiry itself, the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency by this legislation is indeed timely. Over a lengthy period in this country, as the honourable member for Perth clearly demonstrated, there has been conus cern about the use of illicit substances to enhance people's performance in sport, and it is a sad reflection on sport worldwide that people have resorted to the use of unnatural substances to improve their athletic prowess. It seems to be a human trait to compete, and that trait should be encouraged; but that trait should be to compete fairly. People should be able to compete on the so-called level playing field. They should do so with their own natural talents, their own natural abilities-not through the injection of some particular substance or through the ingestion of some particular substance, not simply because people have been given illicit drugs of various forms or disguised substances that have been developed long before testing agencies can get on to them and so on. That is not what competition is all about and it is not what sport is all about. I am pleased, as the honourable member for Perth has pointed out, that the relevant bodies in the sporting community in this country at least are 100 per cent behind the efforts of this Government, 100 per cent behind the efforts to establish the Australian Sports Drug Agency and, of - ourse, behind the Government's efforts in the drug offensive program. I might just say that, for several years since the drug offensive program was put in place, there have been Opposition concerns expressed about tangible results coming from that program. Here is one. Here is a significant tangible result. Here is the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Here is a body which will be available to sport in this country to ensure that we compete fairly in a drug-free environment. It is going to let our athletes know that in this country at least they are competing fairly against people of equal calibre, not assisted by drugs. If there is one thing that is therefore so significant about this legislation, is that very fact. The other thing that the honourable member for Perth also alluded to was of course the educational issue associated with the proposal to establish the Australian Sports Drug Agency. In this respect, I must commend the Agency for the publication of a number of documents already. I would certainly say to people who are involved at national, State or indeed local sporting levels that they should avail themselves of this information. A drugs and sport hotline has been established, and we have a number of documents that have been prepared, such as Selected for a Drug Test and The Permitted Use of Medicines in Sport. There are medicines that sports people take. There are asthmatics, for example, who compete in sport. Many of Australia's greatest sports men and women are sufferers, and medication is used by them; Of course it is ludicrous to suggest that anything they might take to alleviate their condition that would stop them competing should be banned in any way. There are a number of other documents that have been prepared, such as the booklet The Doping Game. There are some publications which have been prepared in the past, and I am pleased to see that a magazine published by the Australian Sports Commission as far back as October-December 1988, Sports Coach, dealt with the subject of drugs in sport. Of course, there is another document entitled Drugs in Sport published by the Australian Sports Commission. It is clear that the concern that this Government has had in the past and will continue to have in the future, while administered by the Australian Sports Commission, was probably not appropriate. It is appropriate, on the other hand, to have this independent body established, and this legislation seeks to do just that. One only has to look back over recent history in the world' to see the effect that drugs in sport have had. We have seen the famous in the world brought down to mediocrity, not because of their achievements and the fact that they may have it won Olympic pold or Commonwealth Games gold, but because they proved positive in terms of drugs and had to give it all back. In their own countries they were humiliated. Ben Johnson is a case in point. He is only now rehabilitating himself, and only now trying to come back into the athletics world. Yet as an athlete he would probably rate amongst the best, except for the fact that many of his performances have come simply supported by drugs and illegal substances. We look at the case of a sport that is very near and dear to my heart-that is, rugby league-and the revelations that have been made in New South Wales in the Winfield Cup. The millions of people who support that sport in Australia and internationally, I am sure, would have been shocked to see some of the information that has come out about players who have been involved particularly with cocaine. Mr Deputy Speaker, you come from the Illawarra and, along with myself, support the Steelers, and you know for a fact that in rugby league there have been isolated cases of people involved in drug taking. There have been cases of people walking around before and after the game with joints in their hand, the old marijuana, supposedly to give them the boost. I have to say that, through the leading efforts of the New South Wales and Australian Rugby League, that is fast becoming a thing of the past, fast becoming part of history. Through the efforts of people such as John Quayle and Ken Arthurson, we have seen administrators of a sport that has national significance, that attracts television audiences as no other sport in this country can, and that attracts interest from children as no other sport does, taking positive steps to ensure that it is drug free. What do they get for their trouble? Quite often they get criticised. They get criticised because on the list of drugs that they are testing, there are these so-called social drugs, and the question is raised, 'Well, I mean, should you really be testing for cocaine; should you really be testing for marijuana? They're only social drugs after all'. I reject that view out of hand. As far as the Steelers are concerned, as a member of the board of directors of that club, we reject that out of hand. We are fully supportive of what New South Wales Rugby League has done to date. We will be 100 per cent behind it in the future. There is a need to provide the opportunity for our young people and the players of today to know that they are competing fairly against teams that 'have built themselves up legitimately in the gymnasium two or three times a week, if not more, and carried out sprint training and so on to be bigger, better and faster but by legitimate means. It disturbs me greatly to learn that seas, where our victorious Kangaroos are presently on a tour through Great Britain and France, the French coach is saying that he is frightened of the Australians because they are all on drugs and that is why they are so big. That is absolute nonsense. If somebody like Paul Sironen, Steve Roach, Mark Sargeant, Mark Geyer and so on was coming at me I would be a bit frightened too. The size of their frames is not because they are on drugs. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that because a team is bigger, faster and better, because of its natural attributes, it has been drug induced. As far as the great sport of Rugby League is concerned, I have nothing but praise for what the New South Wales and Australian Rugby League have done for that sport. They have worked very closely with the formative body under the Australian Sports Drug Agency. There is an ongoing discussion about these matters. That typifies what is necessary in other sports as well. There must be ongoing rapport between the agency and Australian sporting organisations. I wish to consider some concerns that have been raised, particularly since the changes that have occurred in eastern Europe. It disturbed me greatly to see that many of the sporting coaches over there are now freely admitting that many of their great athletes have been drug users over a long period of time and their success has been attributed to that. What must it mean to basic Australians, in the main sports loving people, to find out that heroes of the past, those whom they have watched on television and have read about in newspapers and have tried to imitate, attributed their success to drugs? It must be fairly devastating for people who support sport. If for no other reason at all it is important that there is legislation such as this, which goes to the very fabric of our society, because it is only a reflection of a much wider problem in our community. It is interesting when we talk to people about drugs in sport that the sorts of drugs they often refer to are cocaine, oversteroids and so on. People conveniently forget about cigarettes, alcohol-which the honourable member for Perth referred to-and so on. They are all part of the system as well. People's performance in sport is obviously affected if they are using those sorts of drugs. Interestingly, many people could probably point to superb sports men and women who have probably not minded having a quiet snort either before or after a game of cricket, rugby league or something else. There are a few famous cases in rugby league. For example, people reckon the best games Johnny Raper ever played were after a hard night out. But they were super freaks. The average sportsperson and those who want to compete must be aware of the dangers associated with those drugs. I· think that the Australian Sports Drug Agency,' through the resources that I have mentioned already, through the publicity that goes with the fact that the Agency is available, is testing for drugs in sport and so on, must clearly demonstrate through educational programs in schools that dangers are associated with all of these forms of drugs, not just the ones that people immediately consider. I could put it no better than by referring to a number of editorials which appeared when the whole issue of drugs in . sport was raging and when the Senate inquiry was under way. 'Athletes, not zombies' was the headline in one such editorial. That is what we are on about. We are on about making sport fairer, with level playing fields for people to compete in in terms of their physical prowess and their talent. We want to ensure that people have the opportunity to reach their peaks but in a totally drug free environment. . I conclude where I started. This legislation is timely; it protects people's privacy in the ways which have been outlined. It ensures that we develop drug free sport in this country. I hope it is emulated by overseas countries. I hope that people in the Olympic Federation, in the Commonwealth Games Association and so on take the models that we are developing here, again as world leaders, to those countries and ensure that the same processes are put in place. If they are then in Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Pan Pacific Games or whatever might be on-world swimming championships and so on-everyone knows that they are competing with an equal chance. Darren Clark said it all. He has decided to give up his professional running career for Australia. We all remember the great success he had in the Commonwealth Games. He has now decided to turn his hand to rugby league with the Balmain club in Sydney. He said that as far as he was concerned he is sick and tired of trying to compete against people who were doped up all the time. It was not fair on him and it was not fair on his competitors in Australia; he had just had enough. It is sad to think that Australia has lost such a great competitor in one field of sport because of drugs. I wish him every success with Balmain, although not when they are playing the Steelers. The legislation is tim.ely. It is supported by both sides of the House and I wish it a speedy passage.",96
125,Mrs KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (8.38)-in reply-I thank everyone who has made a contribution to this debate. One of the unfortunate things about this chamber is that we do not have more discussions like the one we have had tonight. It has.been very constructive and deals with an issue which is very dear to the hearts of all Australians. Yet how often do we discuss the issue of sport in this House? Never. I think that is a great shaine. We basically just give out money through the Australian Sports Commission. It is hands off. It would be very welcome in this chamber at some stage to take the opportunity to talk about the main issues in the sports area. The issue that I am confronted with looking at now is smoking and sport and whether we should allow advertising of cigarettes during sporting events. It really is a community issue. It should be discussed in this House. There are many other matters relating to sport that need to be aired. One is the balance in funding between the elite and the general sporting community. I think we probably have it right now. We always have to be cautious . to make sure that we get that balance right. I have the view that the only way we are going to get kids, in particular, to participate, enjoy and love their sport is to see champions. We can use the encouragement of the elite to get young people involved. But then we need. to have all the facilities. In this portfolio I have been trying to put a lot of emphasis towards coaching. I know that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has been very involved in coaching. I think that is a key to the success of sport. One of the other areas that I am most concerned about relates to the issue of discrimination in sport. Are there various sectors of the community that do not get a fair chance? What about the kids from the Northern Territory? Do they have the same opportunities as those from Sydney? We need to look at the opportunities that young women have compared with young men. These are issues that I hope will be discussed in more detail next year. With the support of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) we will have a round table to look at some of these issues of discrimination in sport. I want to congratulate him and his Committee for raising this very important issue. One of the reasons we have been able to get this legislation so well accepted by all sections of this House is the great cooperation we have had with the States. This issue has been raised with the State Ministers. They are cooperating and they will be introducing legislation into their own Houses which will be compatible with this Federal legislation. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Macarthur and other speakers, it is essential that we put all international competitions on a level playing field. I am very anxious to get international agreements on anti-doping; I think that is absolutely essential if our athletes are going to get a fair go overseas. The philosophic basis of this legislation is the concept of a fair go, to give our champions the opportunity to compete equally without the use of performance-distorting drugs. That is one of the reasons I tried to get the balance right on the issue of privacy, which was raised by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I thought quite hard about this issue of privacy and about how we would deal with the problem, which was obviously why we were establishing this agency, how we would relate this information and give the athlete the due process of law but also try to ensure that we did not have a public crucifixion of an athlete before he was actually tried and dealt with by his own sport. Too often in the. past we have seen the media jump on the bandwagon and make a big issue and raise names. when there really was no justification for it. We saw a classic case of that in the way Jane Flemming was treated. That led me to try to protect the innocent and to ensure that the due process was followed. I have worked very closely with the Privacy Commission and the Human Rights Commission to ensure that that balance is kept. The underlying principle is to ensure that only those who need to know will have access to information about test results. When a competitor's name is entered on the register of defaulting competitors, clause 17 of the legislation requires the agency to notify only the competitor concerned, his or her national sporting organisation, and the Australian Sports Commission, but only if the competitor or his or her sporting organisation receives Commonwealth assistance. The names on the register will not be publicly disclosed. As I said, that has arisen because of my concern not to publicly crucify these people. We want to solve the problem; we do not want to destroy an athlete's name and credibility in the process. This is really a matter that should be resolved by the sporting organisation. The problem is that if we let this sort of information out we cannot really legislate to ensure that it is dealt with in a fair way. I apologise for arriving late into the House, but I did hear the debate. I understand that the honourable member for Fadden raised a particular example where he thought there may be an element of . public interest in being aware of the background of the performance of, say, my own football· team, the Raiders. In the event that there is media speculation about a particular athlete or team, there is a safeguard in the legislation to enable the issue to be raised in the Parliament. There is a provision for the Minister responsible, which would be me in this case, to request the agency to notify him or her whether a competitor's name had been entered on the register. Then it would be the prerogative of the Minister to raise that in the House or in any other forum if he or she thought it was appropriate. If that information were requested by a parliamentary committee, the Minister responsible could then request it from the drug agency and pass on that information. I think that provision has to be .handled in a very sensitive way. Not only are .we in this Parliament interested in sport, the media is also very interested, and it does lead to a public crucifixion at times when it may not be appropriate. I frankly think it is essential to get the balance right. Obviously, we want to move in where action is required. The agency will be doing the drug testing, but I think this issue should be dealt with between the sports organisation and the athlete. We would get involved only if money from the Commonwealth through the Sports Commission were involved. I think that is a fair balance. I think the appeals provisions are reasonable. I thank all honourable members for their contribution to this debate, not only in this House but also in the Senate. It is an issue that was initiated by a Senate committee. I think the committee should be very proud of taking on this issue and dealing with it in such an appropriate way. I thank all honourable members for their contribution to this very important issue in sport. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"Mr Hollis)I understand it is the wish of the House to debate the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill concurrently with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",101
127,Mr LLOYD,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"The purpose of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill and cognate Bills is to enable the Government to provide a framework for more cost efficient collection of the many levies that are imposed, generally at the request of agricultural industries, on the commodities that are produced by those industries. The majority of them are through the rural industry research funds. There are over 20 differ- , ent agricultural industries which have these arrangements. They work on the basis of $1 for $1 government and industry up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. In total it means that primary industry, in good years and bad, provides a very substantial amount for research and development in those industries. One of the reasons why agriculture is one of the few world competitive or world efficient industries in this country is that it provides a significant contribution on its own behalf to ensure that it is productive, efficient and all the other things that are necessary to be successful in this difficult trading world. Unfortunately, because of the very depressed returns for most of the major agricultural commodities, it will be difficult for that research and development and also for promotion effort for some industries to be maintained in real terms. To return to the main point of the Bill, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in 1988 commenced charging for the collection of those levies. It became apparent that it was not a particularly cost-efficient form of collection and, for that matter, some of it is still not. I believe of what? one of the priorities the coalition will have on election to government will be to ensure that there is the most efficient collection possible of those levies so that those farmers who are providing the money for research and development or whatever it may be will know that as small a percentage as possible is retained by the collection agency. I am told that over 30 Acts have been brought together in these three Bills so that in future we will not have all of these bits and pieces every time there is a new piece of legislation. The Bills will give greater flexibility so a whole range of different collection agencies-the States, et cetera-and different methods can be used so that greater flexibility and efficiency are obtained. One of the most significant of these levies is the export inspection levy. Some $112m is to be levied in this financial year, according to the Budget Papers. There was a decision by the Government in that Bridget to increase from 60 per cent to 100 per cent the cost recovery for those charges. The charges apply mainly to meat, but also to grain, horticulture and the dairy industry. There could not have been a worse time for the Government to have made that announcement. The governments of most of our competitor countries pay the total amount of the inspection charge, either for public health or for export assistance reasons. The"" levy comes at a time of dramatically reduced, and reducing, income for farmers in the cut-throat world of export competition. The various industry bodies and the coalition called for the deferment by 12 months of the increase in those levies from 60 to 100 per cent to provide some time for some accountability and efficiency to be brought into the whole export inspection system on the very equitable basis that if the user pays, the user should also say; in other words, the user should have control of the structure, employment in and the efficiency of the operation. We are facing an intolerable situation where there will be a 100 per cent cost recovery-but 100 per cent The Victorian public review committee-a Victorian parliamentary committee-has just reported to the State Parliament that in its view the Federal meat inspection service is damaging the meat production. and processing industry of this country. It lists four options to produce a more independent and more efficient operation: to give the operation to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation; to establish a private company; to have some other industry based arrangement; or to have some non-profit accreditation. The committee acknowledged that it needs to be a national operation-and we certainly acknowledge that-but it must be accountable. That is what we certainly will be demanding on our return to government. The meat inspection system in particular has a lot to answer for-overmanning, rorts and high charges. For example, with the move to 100 per cent cost recovery, for an abattoir employing one of these meat inspectors-and they are not highly trained people-the charge will be $64,686 per year. The charge for a veterinarian will be $92,428 for a five-day week, 7.30 to 3.30. Grain is another example. The charge will rise from $24 per half hour to $43 per half hour. These people have permanent employment. Sometimes that permanent employment continues long after the abattoir has closed. Gosford was quite a good example of that situation. Yet, in spite of this permanent employment, these people have the arrogance to pursue industrial actionas they are in various parts of Australia at the present time-when we need all of these export dollars and the beef producers of this country need a fair return. These permanent employees cannot have it both ways. Sooner or later not only they but others in this country have to learn the reality that if people have permanent employment they are providing an essential service and should not be going on strike; otherwise they should be on a hire and fire basis. To be really realistic in world and to get Australia· competitive again, we should have both-an essential service basis and a hire and fire basis. There is tremendous pressure on abattoir operators not to report rorts because of the pressure that is then applied to them. But one small abattoir had had enough a few days ago and rang to say it was required to employ four meat inspectors though it was known that only two were needed. The meat inspectors themselves acknowledge that, because quite often two of them do not turn up-and they never turn up when there is a race meeting. Meat processing is one of the major value adding primary industries for this country. Governments keep talking about the need to value add to our primary products-our agricultural products-to give employment and to get more dollars for this country. The reality is that we are going backwards with value adding through food processing. The increasing imports of processed foods indicate that the added cost rather than the added value of processing is not competitive with that of other countries. It is mainly due to low productivity. I will give one example of total costs compared with output in this countrythe canneries in the Goulburn Valley. The labour costs there are 50 per cent more than in similar canneries in California. We are not talking about canneries in Third World countries like Thailand or the Philippines. To come back to meat inspection and the levies that we are talking about, a combination of the high charges that I have just referred to and the work practices inspired by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU), particularly in Victoria, are having a devastating effect on this industry. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) will give far more detail of this devastating situation. I want to make several general points about the AMIEU and what it is doing to meat processing in Victoria. There has been no investment in an abattoir in Victhis toria for 12 years. Seventeen abattoirs have closed in Victoria in the last seven years, thousands of AM lEU workers have lost their jobs, $100m of exports have been lost, and prices to producers in Victoria are lower than in any other State because of the uncertainty of the situation, the industrial trouble-and there is plenty of that at the present time in Victoria-or the additional cost of transport to have stock slaughtered in another State. This all adds up to a situation where in the United States the cost of processing beef is 10c per kilogram. In Australia it is 45c per kilogram. Our producers are expected to compete in the world with that sort of situation. If people give away a sheep it will still cost a minimum of $13 to have it slaughtered. The Opposition parties support the legislation, but it is time that governments supported those industries which are fighting so hard to keep this country afloat.",101
128,Mr COURTICE,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"Tonight we are debating the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill and cognate Bills. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has covered quite comprehensively the basis of these mechanical Bills. The desire has been to have in place a more cost effective and efficient levy collection system. The idea has also been to reduce the burden to industry since initially the effect was to increase costs and in some cases this caused hardship. The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill and the complementary Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill have been designed basically to deal with this matter. Some of the other aims are to allow the taking of the option of making larger accumulated payments over longer periods of time, to allow for regulations, as nomwhich inated by industry bodies, which provide for various optional collection methods, and to obtain a consistency of approach to procedural matters currently in more than 30 Acts. Of course, many require updating because some of these Acts have not been updated since 1962. The legislation also provides one Act which will deal with all primary industries levy and charge collection, thus enabling more uniformity of collection procedures, which was not previously possible. Most of the levies and charges are payable the producer or grower of produce. In order to reduce the cost of collection, legislation provides for a better securing of payinent of levy or charges, and montural eys may be collected through intermedidevelopment. aries such as agents, exporters, et cetera, on behalf of producers. In addition, the Commonwealth may now enter into collection arrangements with States and Territories and other lection organisations, subject to full coneties, sultation with industry groups, which believe is important. Such agreements will assist in meeting the goal to keep costs an absolute minimum by significantly ducing the number of collection points. Some of the revised provisions for impossearch ing penalty for late payment of levy or charges have been included, reflecting front foot. changes in debt collection techniques. The Bill also allows for an authorised person to publish certain information to (GATT) round does specified bodies, permitting· proper will be successful. Although administration of each levy or charge tinue to make sure that everywe scheme, but these provisions are subject to the Privacy Act. The Commonwealth is now recovers all costs of collection, and wellare there are no net financial implications arising from this or the associated conseseen in civilisation through quential provisions Bill. The purpose of the National Cattle ease Eradication Trust Account Bill is simply to provide for the continued existdevelopment ence of the national cattle disease eradijust cation trust account. As a result of the former Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collecprotection, tion Act being repealed through the Priciency mary Industries Levies and Charges on Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill, was presented earlier, the trust account facilitates the financial operations of the national program for cattle disease eradication. No financial implications arise embodied from this Bill either. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray, mentioned in regard to research and development, it is important that we continue to make sure that people are aware that we can no longer be called the lucky country and that we have to be the smart country. Research and development is also important in agby riculture. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that up to 0.5 of 1 per cent is the now matched dollar for dollar across the board. So we are encouraging our agriculindustries to expand research and Of course, a lot of work is already being done through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation with regard to the grains industry. If we colare able to produce better hybrid variwe will be able to increase producI tion by something like 25 per cent. There would be a massive benefit in that case, to because one's costs are the same and more reis being produced on the same hectares that are being farmed. That sort of reand development is necessary and important if we are going to stay on the One of the sad things that appear to be happening eral Agreement at the moment is that the Genon Tariffs and Trade not look as though it will conopportunity explored, it is unfortunate that, while we facing the vagaries of climate as of one of the most ruthless and harshness as the corrupted trade practices ever the European Community, our farmers, who are the best Disin the world, will have to continue to expand every avenue through research and and top quality production to hold the line. The European countries are being cowardly by hiding behind creating subsidies and ineffithat in the long term will impact them. By creating those subsidies, the European Community is giving incentive to gross inefficiencies within its own agricultural member countries. I have said on many other occasions, and I say it again tonight, given that the GATT round is not looking too good, that thousands of Australians are laid to rest in war cemeteries right across Europe, and it is unfortunate that those countries, with much greater power and wealth than we possess, are cowards when it comes to decency and freer trade. Those same people take for granted the sacrifices that we willingly made to create a better world and a democracy. Most wars have occurred because of protection and trade barriers. We need only look at the 1930s and the 1890s to see that. These same people who have been at the centre of holocausts have not learnt the lessons of the past and are actually exacerbating a situation about which they should know better. I do believe that the position that we have taken on the Cairns Group is a milestone. I think that we will be seen and judged by the courage that we have shown in fighting for freer trade. It is unfortunate that at the present time the Europeans lack the courage, decency and integrity to do the right thing. Surely, they will be judged, as everyone else is, by their actions in time to come. I commend these cognate Bills to the House.",103
129,Mr HAWKER,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"ln considering these cognate Bills-the Primary Industry Levies and Charges Collection Bill, the Primary Industry Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill-I would like to talk about some of the problems facing farmers, particularly those who will be affected by some of these Bills, and about some of the problems that are facing farmers and the abattoirs in Victoria. Firstly, I would like to reinforce the views of my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). He said that, when it comes to increasing cost recovery, the Government coutd not have picked a worse time for trying to do this than right now. If we look at the figures that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has put forward or if we happen to get out of this place and travel around the countryside and see what is happening in rural Australia, we realise that to be putting up the charges on farmers right now could not have come at a worse time. I want to talk a little more about what has been going on in some of the export abattoirs in Victoria, because I think it is a salutary lesson and may reflect some of the problems that have been in Victoria now for some time with the malaise of the present State Government. I think it probably goes further and shows how the sheer bloody-mindedness of a union can not only almost destroy an industry but also destroy so many jobs of the people who actually belong to that union. Of course, I am talking about the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU). . I would like to start by citing some figures about what has happened to the meat works industry in Victoria, what has happened to the throughput, what has happened to the export potential, and what is happening and has happened to the number of jobs that are available. In 1975 there were 20 export works in Victoria. Today, there are only 10, and I think only nine of those are operating. Worse than that, if we look at the annual export throughput-and I am leaving aside the domestic industry for the moment-we find that in 1975 there were 2.278 million cattle and calves slaughtered for export, while today, in 1990, just 15 years later, that figure has fallen to 882,000. In other words, it has dropped to almost a third. In the case of sheep and lambs, we find the same sort of picture. In 1975, Victoria was slaughtering for export 7.8 million sheep and lambs. Today, it is 2.5 million. It is almost unbelievable to think that this could happen in a short space of time, and it is not to suggest that the actual numbers of stock in Victoria have declined by that amount because it would be quite wrong to believe that. What the union has done to its own membership is the even more staggering thing. In 1972 the AMIEU, amongst just the export works in Victoria, had over 7,000 members. By 1990, that had dropped to 2,441. It is almost unbelievable to think that a union could just systematically set about to destroy its own members' jobs, not to mention the number of meat works that have gone out of business at the same time. We might wonder what has happened in the meantime. Of course, what has happened is that over that period we have seen the most incredible sustained era of industrial disputation. Between 1978 and 1983, the export works-particularly the one in my electorate at Portland, which is one of the bigger ones-used to lose, on average, one day a week because of industrial disputes. From 1983 to 1988, that had increased to two days a week. It is little wonder that eventually Borthwicks, the owner of that works, found that, as the company could not make any money out of it, it was forced to sell it. Subsequently, the meat works was taken over by Elders. There was a protracted dispute and the performance of the Federal Government left a lot to be desired, particularly in the provision of meat inspectors. Eventually it required a sixmonth sustained effort by those who wanted to work in that meat works and by the owners of that meat works to defy a picket line, which they did. Eventually, the union was forced, after suffering a number of setbacks, to withdraw that picket line and realise that that works would continue to operate, but that it would in fact operate under a system which allowed those who wanted to work there to actually work and allowed the works to operate effectively. Of course, that was not until the company had to take out an injunction against the Federal Government because it would not prov.ide meat inspectors when the works was trying to get operating, after having been closed for some time, and it was not before a very protracted dispute was taken through the Industrial Relations Commission. If we look at what has been happening in Victoria over the last financial year, find that the efforts of this union, led by Mr Wally Curran, a well known and close supporter of the current Premier in Victoria, and the industrial disputes that went on in that export works, other than the one at Portland, were really nothing short of scandalous. In 1989-90, 137,000 man days were lost in export works in Victoria as a direct result of industrial action by the AMIEU. The cost in loss of export earnings alone, not to mention in other ways, was $85m. Of course, the loss in export opportunities was incalculable. In fact, we saw this occurring at a time when beef exports for Australia increased by 24 per cent while at the same time beef exports from Victoria increased by only 7 per cent. In other words, while exports around the rest of Australia were increasing by nearly 25 per cent, in Victoria the increase was less than one third. Worse than that, a lot of stock from Victoria were being killed from interstate. In fact, last year 33,000 bullocks were killed interstate, which is three times the number in 1988. If one stops to think about it, many of those bullocks had to be trucked all the way from Victoria to Queensland to be killed. The reason that was occurring was that it was cheaper to pay the cost of the freight to send all the cattle to Queensland and have them killed there than to put up with the nonsense that was going on in the export works in Victoria because of the recalcitrant union and the sheer bloodymindedness that was going on and had been going on for all these years under the leadership of one W. Curran. Mr Bruce Scott-That is when we had a National Party government in Queensland.",105
130,Mr HAWKER,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"Certainly there is little doubt that Queensland knew how to organise its industrial relations so that those who wanted to work had the opportunity to work and those who wanted to make a business work could do so also. If we look further at what was happening in 1989-90 in Victoria, we find that the statistics yet again show us lost opportunities. Over that period lamb exwe ports increased in Australia only slightly, by 1 per cent, while in Victoria lamb exports declined by 9 per cent. If we look at mutton, the situation is even more staggering. Mutton exports in Australia increased by 37 per cent in 1989-90 while in Victoria they increased by only 3 per cent. Comparing the situation with what happened 10 years ago in 1979-80, 72,000 man days were lost owing to industrial problems. I draw the attention of the House back to the figure I quoted earlier of 137,000 in 1989-90. If we look at the number of people working in meat works in that period, in 1978 the figure was 5,500. Of course, as I have said earlier, by 1990 that figure had dropped to 2,441. So compared with the people actually employed, the number of days lost owing to industrial action had proportionately increased far more dramatically than just in straight man days. It is not just the question of the lost man days and lost exports; it is also a question of the lost capacity that is now available in the Victorian export works. As I have said, in the period from 1972 to 1990, the number of export works has. dropped from 20 to the 10 that are currently in operation. The capacity has dropped from 1980 to 1990 as follows: 2,951,000 was the available capacity for cattle and calves in 1980 and, by 1990, that had dropped to just over one million, a decline of 40 per cent. In the case of sheep and lambs, the drop has been from 9,655,000 annually to 6,800,000, or a drop of 30 per cent. . In other words, Victoria has paid a very high price for a recalcitrant union which not only has destroyed so much of the export capacity of the Victorian meat works but also has destroyed so many jobs of workers in the union. It never ceases to amaze me how a union could put up with leadership that is literally taking its members straight over the cliff like lemmings. Let us look at some of the specific kets, particularly those where there is sidered to be a lot of potential and opportunities for growth. We s(!e that the decline in Victoria's share has been even more dramatic. For example, over the past year in regard to exports of beef from Australia to Japan we find that Australia wide there has been an increase of 14 per cent to 184,000 tonnes. But in regard to Victoria, instead of an increase of 14 per cent there has been a staggering decline of 30 per cent to just under 12,000 tonnes. In other words, in the case of Japan which has always been considered to be one of the best export opportunities for our beef, a market in which there has always been a great opportunity for exporters to earn top money, Victoria has lost nearly a third of the market while Australia as a whole has been increasing its share' by 14 per cent. Regrettably, the figures for Korea again show the same stark, dismal picture. Under a government that has lost interest in people who live outside Melbourne, a government that does not seem to care too much about what happens outside the city limits, we have seen what has happened to the export capacity of beef from Victoria to Korea. In that same period we find that beef exports Australia-wide to Korea increased by a massive 66 per cent but in Victoria there was a decline of 14 per cent. It is a horrifying picture of which many people would be totally unaware. It is a sad reflection not only on the union but also on the State Government of Victoria. As I said earlier, the leadership of this union has a close association with the current State Government. In regard to mutton, we see the same problem yet again. We find that over that same period of last year mutton exports Australia-wide to Japan declined by 19 per centnot a pretty picture; it shows that we lost a little ground, but not a lot. However, in Victoria the decline was a staggering 44 per cent. The picture is even worse in terms of the Middle East. Mutton exports from Australia to the Middle East over the past year declined by 3 per cent, but from Victoria they declined by 58 per cent. mar- Further, although exports of mutton to conthe Common Market may not be large, it is still significant to note that over that same period mutton exports from Australia declined by 3 per cent and mutton exports from Victoria declined by 80 per cent. I have taken some time to explain at length what is really happening in the' meat industry of Victoria because I believe that it is a rather sad story of which many honollrable members will not be aware. I Nonetheless, what has happened over these years is nothing short of a national scandal. During the whole of that time this union has been led by the same individual and during that time the meat producers and the workers have suffered enormously because of the sheer stupidity of the policies that have been foisted on them by this union. For the benefit of all honourable members. I will come back to look at the number of people employed in exports works in Victoria. Back in 1972 it was over 7,000 and by 1990 it has dropped to 2,441. If ever there was a case of sheer stupidity, this is it. It is more than sheer stupidity because the cost in lost opportunities, the cost to all the meat producers in Victoria and the cost to the State of Victoria has been nothing short of enorn;lOUS. Given the problems facing Victoria now, it is something that we can ill afford to put up with.",106
131,Mr SNOW,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"The Bill covers a number of amendments relating to the primary industries and energy portfolio. I want to touch on three of them, the first being the amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949. Just recently I went to see the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) about the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I told the Minister that I have been worried about the uncertainty that exists in Cooma and district about the future direction of the thority. The Minister has acknowledged that there are problems in the area as the Authority looks to a range of options for restructuring. There is disillusionment, dissatisfaction, demoralisation and depression in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and I believe this will lead to a drop in productivity. I welcome the fact that the Minister has acknowledged that there are these problems. I have to acknowledge, the people of Cooma have to acknowledge and the work force has to acknowledge that drastic changes are taking place in power authorities all over Australia. For instance, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has reduced staffing levels to approximately one quarter of their original levels in some areas. This is happening all over Australia. We have a choice: we can tackle it in the way that the former Queensland Government tackled it, with bludgeoning and strong-arm tactics, or we can do it more delicately as is happening in other areas of Australia. Whichever way it goes, the electricity authorities throughout Australia are changing. Their role is changing. There is more emphasis on the work that has to be done and there is a movement away from other areas, and perhaps an increase in consultancies. Certainly, with the micro-economic reforms that are taking place throughout Australia, we cannot exempt the electricity authorities. Naturally, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority is being looked at. The MCKinsey report indicated a direction. A review is taking place at the moment. This follows a long term strategic report prepared by Keith Montague, the former executive engineer of the Authority. This report indicated the need for replacement and rehabilitation of the Authority's plant and equipment. The State and Federal governments are looking seriously at. that report and they are looking at replacement and rehabilitation along the lines recommended. While that is going on, a review is taking place within the work force. There certainly needs to be· a review. The Au- arrangements at the moment are quite cumbersome. The Snowy Mountains Council consists of the State and Federal governments and it determines the overall engineering policy and operation of the Authority. In addition, the administration of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority operates in conjunction with the Snowy Mountains Council. Of course, we need to look at whether this is efficient and whether there should be people from three governments in one operating area. We probably do need one board. I note that the New South Wales Government is interested in gaining equity in the electricity operation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Perhaps Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory are also interested. whatever happens, I believe that we need one board. It would be quite wrong for us to consider breaking up the great Snowy Mountains scheme at a time when the Government is looking at a national grid for electricity operation right through eastern States. This was part of the recent communique from the Premiers. It would be quite stupid to give the Hydro-electric Authority to the States and the Territory when the Premiers agree that there is some point in a national grid for the whole of Australia. I believe that we have to do something about those cumbersome arrangements, but we have to do it in a sensitive waya way which people will understand. So I have pushed. I have asked the Minister for Resources to complete the review as 'soon as possible. It is extremely important that that happen so that people know where they stand. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority results from the vision of some great Australians:' William MCKell, Ben Chifley, William Hudson and Nelson Lemmon. All these people made a great contribution to power in Australia through the Hydro-electric Authority. While people say that it may be impossible to get that sort of development in Australia today, none of us can deny that hydro-electric power is clean power. The Snowy Mountains scheme, because of Sir William Hudson's great leadership, developed a very important atmosphere of cooperation, hard work and higher productivity. One has to pay tribute not only to him but also to the work force, because that atmosphere has lasted until just recently. Now we have people who are genuinely worried about the future of the Authority. People who have done great and loyal work over many years are starting to feel some ingratitude for that. They are told they must be more efficient. There is nothing wrong with that, and inevitably with restructuring there is some hurt, but let us have that review as quickly as possible and let us show people that we do appreciate the great work that has been done by the work force-by the engineers and by the workers right through the But, scheme. Those associated with the Victorian and New South Wales electricity authorities have also been working hard, very often under duress, particularly in the winter, on those schemes. I want to mention very briefly the the amendments that relate to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. They are fairly simple amendments which collect levies from the pig and laying chicken industries for payment into the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account. I convened two conferences in the Snowy Mountains where people ranging from farmers to animal liberationists were invited. One conference was held in 1984 and the other in 1985. These led to some very important proposals being put to government and this contributed, I believe, to a desire by the Minister for, Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to have an exotic disease control program in Australia, and to have a feral animal control program which worked in conjunction with it. It is to the credit of people in the Department, such as Dr George Wilson and his colleagues. It is also to the credit of people in a wide range of industriespeople from government, people like Col  farmers-because they all had the vision to realise that we had to have only one attack of foot and mouth disease in mainland Australia or one attack of proven bluetongue disease, and it would devastate our meat exports. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications-the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon)-knows full well that there have been one or two exotic disease scares in the Northern Territory. Fortunately, they proved to be false alarms but there were harmless variations. Australia is close to countries where there are diseases such as rabies and it has frequent contact with tourists and others from places where there are diseases. People complain that our Customs and quarantine services are far too strict. Nevertheless, it is extremely important that that strictness be maintained because rural communities and export industries would be devastated, and primary industry incomes would be drastically reduced, if exotic diseases got away from us. The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act amendments provide the framework for the Government's support of research and development in horticultural industries and establish the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation to administer research and development funds. The amendments establish independent selection committees to nominate persons for appointment to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. Horticultural research and development is extremely important. I refer to recent controversy when people have asked me, 'Why are we allowing the importation of orange concentrate, for instance, from other countries into Australia when we have farmers going broke because they cannot meet these overseas prices?'. There are a number of important points to make, and one of them relates to the matters referred to in the legislation: the importance of research and development. I have spoken with people involved in the industry at Berrivale in Berri, South Australia. For approximately 15 years I lived in the Wimmera and Mallee in Victoria and was associated with people in the citrus industry. When one talks to the people on the ground, one finds that things are not quite as simple as others think they are. For instance, looking at the total production tonnage in Australia, of approximately 330,000 tonnes of orange juice, 50,000 tonnes comes from fresh fruitmuch of it grown close to the cities-and approximately 280,000 tonnes from concentrate. So we need concentrate and we need to find markets, but we need such markets to exist for 12 months a year. Producers and cooperatives tell me that they cannot produce for 12 months a year and that they need to blend profiles to ensure they have an acceptable product. Sometimes the valencia oranges grown in Australia are acidic and sometimes concentrate has to be imported from overseas. I have been told by people who visited the processors in Brazil that over there they have much better, year-round production and they have excellent processing standards. So research and development is particularly important in that industry. Our problem is the low price of imported concentrate. I believe the citrus industries have a case when they suggest that we ought to move to underwriting in an attempt to even out prices. There have been dramatic changes in prices. What they are really saying is that we do not need to go as high as the prices have been going; we do not need to go as low as the prices have been going, but we ought to be able to even out those wild fluctuations by removing them. We can do that by using concentrate to maintain year-round production. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy told me yesterday that Australia has enough concentrate to last for a full year. It is extremely important that we look at the industry objectively and not become too hasty.  the Chief Executive of Berrivale Orchards Limited, in 'Viewpoint' in the Murray Pioneer of Friday, 23 November 1990: Actions based on limited or misunderstanding may well hurt the grower himselfor herself, I might addmore than any other party. Later he says: . . . there are certain parties advocating specific actions who appear to have little knowledge of all factors involved, and the possible damage those actions will cause growers. Mr Wood criticised one proposal put to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy: . . . the sales tax on all products manufactured from juice concentrate be increased to allow preferential treatment for fresh juice. Berrivale, which has a fresh fruit juice operation in every state, could receive considerable benefit from the . . . sales tax proposal. But the Riverland grower most certainly would not. Perhaps it is time growers questioned the ity and level of knowledge, and in some cases the motive, of some of their grower leaders' proposals. He continued: Berrivale does not use imported concentrate in place of the produce of shareholders' and other Australian growers' fruit. It uses imported when local Australian materials are inadequate to meet our market place commitments. An important point is being made by those industries to those who will listen. I welcome the decision by the Government, which was announced by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that State and Commonwealth governments will ensure that compulsory labelling regulations announced for orange juice and also for apple, pineapple and other fruit juices and fruit juice products will come into effect. The majority of recent complaints have related to orange juice, as I mentioned, but clearly the same concern applies to other fruit juices and fruit juice products. In particular there have been concerns from Tasmania about imported apple extract, and from Queensland and northern New South Wales about imported pineapple juice. Both have a significant impact on Australian producers. A change in the regulations will make it compulsory to have a declaration on the package of any juice or juice product identifying the country or countries of origin of the ingredients. If there is a mixture of local and imported ingredients, this must be declared. The recommendation concerning the orange juice regulation, as well as the separate regulation for all other fruit juices and fruit juice products, was adopted by the Australian Food Standards Committee meeting in Perth in the last week of November. The code is expected to be gazetted early next year, which gives ample time for importers and distributors to make the necessary changes to their packaging. The decision represents an important advance for Australian growers of apples, pineapples, oranges al1d other juice fruits. Growers will be encouraged to promote their all-Australian product, confident in abilthe knowledge that any imported competitors will have to make full disclosure. I am pleased to support the amending legislation.",108
132,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,I rise to speak in this debate on the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990 and cognate Bills.,111
133,Mr CADMAN,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"Are you going to vote agains t the Bill? Mr Bruce SCOTTNo, I will not vote against the Bill, but I am not particularly happy with one or two points in the legislation. Firstly, the legislation has some very good objects. It seeks to rationalise the collection of levies and charges, and we must commend that. It also makes provision for the efficient and effective collection of primary industry levies and charges. There will never be a better time than now to ensure that we have efficiency in the collection of levies, particularly for primary industries. The legislation will provide a single Act which will deal with all the levy and export charge collections. This will enable uniformity of collection methods and will permit a consistent approach to procedural matters previously embodied in more than 30 Acts. Even though 30 Acts have been brought into one-I am sure that it required a lot of time-there are some areas that I am still not happy with. The Government introduced full cost recovery for the collection of levies in 1988. In fact, the Commonwealth is reimbursed for expenses incurred. Consequently, there will be no effect on revenue with the implementation of this legislation. I have acknowledged that there ate some very good points in this legislation, but one area that I have reservations about is that of the warrant to enter powers. But, firstly, let me deal with the provisions in the Bill. They certainly allow more flexibility, and they certainly allow more flexibility in the due date. Of course, that has to be a good thing. Only recently we have seen that the wool industry has had to alter wool tax levy due dates. That may go on for some Jime. There are also elements in the Bill which allow for a late payment penalty. Of course, if anyone is late in payment, that is a cost borne by someone else; it is a cost borne by the producer. So those people who are not paying their levies by the due date should be charged a penalty. In some cases, the Bill also allows for the States to be the collection agency for the Commonwealth and the industry. The wool and meat industries largely have broking agents acting as collecting agencies. I say that that is a good thing because the Government is not collecting levies; rather, private enterprise is collectlation ing them. I think one of the problems with the Government collecting levies is that the industry has very little control over the cost and the cost rises that would inevitably take place if collection was not allowed to be let out to private enterprises and agencies. Certainly, the Bill is designed to minimise costs to the industry. After all, It is the industry that has put up this money, so it is certainly entitled to have ,some input and to ensure that the levies are collected in the most cost efficient way. But, whilst we are talking about cost efficiencies and levies, I would like to use this opportunity tonight to bring to the attention· of the House again the fact that in the recent Budget the Treasurer (Mr Keating) introduced full cost collection for the inspection services. Tonight I would like to say once again that the Government should look again at that, because we certainly have a very much worsening situation in the economy of Australia. The balance of trade figures announced only yesterday were much worse. I believe that we should be encouraging rather than discouraging industries by levies and taxes. Mr Braithwaite-They don't realise that there is a crisis.",111
134,Mr BRUCE SCOIT,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,As the honourable member for Dawson points out! the Government has only just admitted to a recession. It has not realised that there is a crisis out there in rural Australia.,112
135,Mr CADMAN,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,They never go into the bush.,112
136,Mr BRUCE SCOIT,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"That is so. It is not just rural Australia; it is the whole of Australia. It has been admitted by the Treasurer only this week that we have a recession-that Or' word. But let me touch on the area of warrant to enter a property. Clauses 19 and 20 in the Bill reflect a standard provision of the levy collection legislation of the last five years. Prior to 1987, the powers of authorised persons in relation to premises and warrants to enter premises were combined in one provision. A minor difference between post-1987 and pre-1987 levy collection legislation in reto obtaining a warrant to enter a premise is that modern legislation requires a warrant to be obtained from a magistrate, whereas pre-1987 levy collection legislation provided that a warrant was to be obtained from a justice of the peace (IP). However, a 'magistrate' is defined in these Bills to include a justice of the peace. In fact, there has been no modernisation at all in the provisions of these Bills. I have the highest regard for justices of the peace, but if one looks at what really constitutes a justice of the peace-and I am sure we have plenty of them in this House and among our staff membersone can see that they are usually non-professional people who are very upstanding members of the community. In fact, under current law two IPs will constitute a court. However, right now in Queensland the Act which governs their admission as IPs is under review. I am told by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) that Victoria is trying to do away with justices of the peace. To qualify to be a magistrate today one has to be a professional person or, in other words, a qualified solicitor or barrister. Mr Braithwaite-Or a good accountant.",112
137,Mr BRUCE SCOIT,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"I am told a qualified solicitor or barrister under modern law, but I stand corrected on that point. Under the old system a person could qualify through an interdepartmental exam, but this is no longer the case. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Senate Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Bills, which has touched on this point very strongly. The Committee noted that clause 13 (1) of the Bill, if enacted, would allow a magistrate to issue search warrants in certain circumstances. A 'magistrate' is defined in clause 4 (1) of the Bill to include a justice of peace. The Senate Committee has consistently drawn attention to provisions which allow for the issue of search warrants by non-judicial officers. Accordingly, the Committee drew the Senate's attention to this clause as possibly trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties in breach of principle. If it is necessary to issue a warrant to enter, I think we should be insisting that a magistrate be the person to issue that warrant. In some cases it may take longer. The Minister has seen fit to allow justices of the peace to still be the persons who could issue those warrants· because, in some cases, it may take longer to issue a warrant as there is no magistrate in a particular town. If the Goss Labor Government stays in office for much longer in Queensland-and it is set for a couple of years now-perhaps we will need justices of the peace, because it is hell bent on removing all magistrates west of the dividing range. I know that it is going to remove the magistrate from my home town of Roma, which has a population of 7,000 people. It may take longer to get a warrant to enter a building, but if it is important enough to enter it should be important enough to spend a little more time in getting that warrant. In this modern day and age, with fax machines, modern communications and better roads and courier services, I believe a search warrant could quite easily be in the hands of an officer wanting to enter within hours if it was absolutely necessary and if no magistrate was available. Why, when the Government is legislating in the 1990s, would it leave this provision in the Bill when in most modern legislation it has been removed? I find it a rather ridiculous contradiction to leave that provision in the Bill. One could ask: have there been any warrants issued to enter? The Minister· says that in the last three years there have in fact been only three warrants issued in Australia. That may not be many, but I think that is a good thing because it means that most people are complying with the law. In fact, there have been three warrants issued. Warrants are issued, and I think the that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) should look at th-t again. I am sure he will agree that the legislation is not as modern as it could be and needs to be updated in line with other legislation. I now touch on the importance of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round which is currently under discussion in Brussels. It is important that I raise this matter in the debate because these Bills are seeking to minimise costs to the collection of levies for primary industries. It is against the backdrop of probably the worse economic circumstances that our farming communities have suffered in history. That is borne out by the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures. I wish to record a few more points and statistics because the index of farmers terms of trade, that is, the ratio of farm costs to commodity prices, shows that they have plummeted to 70 points in the September quarter. Farm input prices have outstripped farm gate returns from commodities by 150 per cent in the last 10 years. Prices paid on inputs have risen by 103 per cent over the past 10 years, while prices received for agricultural commodities have increased by a mere 41 per cent. No wonder they are described as the most efficient farmers in the world. When we look at the sharpest falls in the three months to September for commodities we see that there is a decline of 16.6 per cent in wheat prices and a 55 per cent crash in sheep values. The wool industry's current position is well documented right across Australia through the media and in this House and I do not need to dwell on that. The Bureau analysis shows that Government related factors have also contributed to the worsening crisis in the bush and have inflicted the most severe cost pressures on primary producers. Government taxes have risen 14 per cent faster than wheat prices and wheat prices are still sliding away. There was a 12 per cent increase in Government rates and taxes in 1990-91 alone, almost double the overall inflation rate. So it is against the backdrop of the Uruguay Round and the GATT talks in Brussels that I bring those statistics to attention of the House. The failure of the GATT talks will leave many Australian farmers in a position where they have no alternative but to walk off the land because the trade war that will follow will be the worse that we have seen in the history of the traded commodities. I know that the support of this House and of all Australians is behind our negotiators in the Cairns Group to see that some sense prevails. They have a resolution which will ensure freer and fairer trading for agricultural commodities-in fact all commodities-in the world. These Bills will minimise costs. They will rationalise 30 Bills, and they do have the support of the House. I have pointed out that I am unhappy with the area of the warrant to enter provisions. While I believe that a justice of the peace is fit and able to do the job, I believe it should be done by a magistrate, someone with judicial knowledge. It is important and I would urge the Minister to look at that once again.",112
138,Mr STAPLES,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,1 was hoping to give my orange juice speech; it would have been appropriate in the case of the previous Bill.,114
139,Mr CADMAN,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"Where are your moleskins? Mr STAPLESI have worn moleskins in my day. I was involved, before entering this House, in these areas. I worked for about 14 years for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in the Division of Animal Health. Mr Bruce Scott-Did you get mud on your boots? Mr STAPLESI got a lot of mud on my boots. I got right up to my shoulders in various things because I worked in a lot of areas to do with infertility in cattle and sheep. So I do have some appreciation of the rural areas, particularly of the work that is done in research and the cooperation between the research establishments in Australia such as the CSIRO Division of Animal Health, the livestock the industries, the Government and the various corporations and boards that are involved within the industry. I just want to take this opportunitywhich I do not have very often-to commend those who have worked so diligently over many decades in Australia in various forms of research in agriculture and livestock industries to bring Australia's agriculture and livestock industries to a point of excellence in terms of diseasefree stock and quality of production that is probably unrivalled anywhere else in the world. I am glad to see the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in the chamber. As Minister for Trade Negotiations, I am sure that as he travelled around the world he talked to people and impressed upon them the quality of our production which has been achieved principally by the linkage of scientific endeavour, farmers, State and Commonwealth instrumentalities, industry and departments of agriculture. People both in the cities and the rural areas right throughout Australia have worked to improve our productivity to the point that not only do we produce the best products at the best prices but certainly, considering the harshness of the conditions that most of it is grown under, the cleanest and most disease-free stock probably anywhere in the world. I have risen basically to take this opportunity to congratulate the people who I worked with for so many years for the work that they carried out in programs such as bovine pleuropneumonia. This debate embraces issues of tuberculosis and brucellosis. I worked in the brucellosis area. Certainly things like foot and mouth disease and many other common day-today problems, which were greater problems in the past, would not have been resolved if it had not been for the tremendous cooperation that has existed over many decades between farmers, government and, of course, the scientific organisations, both State and Federal. That is all I wanted to say. I particularly want to congratulate people for that degree of cooperation. I also congratulate and thank all those people who participated in this debate.

PRIVACY AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 December, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.",114
140,Mr COSTELLO,ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT,"The Privacy Amendment Bill 1990 had a very long and chequered career in the Senate before it came to this place. In the Senate the Opposition moved over 50 amendments; the Government accepted 10 of them. The Government moved about 40 of its own amendments. The Government's amendments, together with those of the Opposition which were accepted, improved the Privacy Amendment Bill but it is still fundamentally flawed. Let me make it clear at the outset that the Opposition supports the protection of individual privacy. It supports bars on the collection of personal information such as provided for in proposed new section 18E (2) of this Bill, prohibiting credit reporting agencies from keeping on file personal information as to political and religious beliefs, medical history, race or ethnic origins, sexual practices and the like. The Opposition supports regulation of privacy which would expunge records of default after particular periods, as is provided for in proposed new section 18F. The Opposition supports individuals having rights to compensation where they are denied credit on the basis of false credit information files. They are principles that have our full and total support. But this Bill, notwithstanding the many amendments to it, is still chronically and fundamentally flawed. I will move as a result that the House decline to give the Bill a second reading. The reason why the Bill is fundamentally flawed can be summarised in approximately eight points. I will indicate the Opposition's major objections and then I will elaborate on all of those reasons in an effort to persuade the House that this Bill is fundamentally flawed and that it should decline, in accordance with the amendment I propose to move, to give it a second reading. In the first place, it is inappropriate to regulate the collection of information in relation to consumer credit by tacking these provisions into the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act was introduced to protect citizens against the state, particularly in relation to the tax file number. The regulation of consumer credit is a separate matter. It relates to private organisations. It ought to be the subject of a separate Bill, and I in fact have moved for the introduction of a separate Bill in that respect, a private member's Bill, the Financial Information (Privacy) Bill. Secondly, this amendment Bill relies upon artificial constitutional mechanisms. Indeed, it may be unconstitutional in certain respects. It will certainly be the subject of constitutional challenge. Thirdly, the constitutional responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit reporting resides with the States, which certainly do have constitutional authority and, by and large, the States are opposed to this amendment Bill. Fourthly, the Bill proposes enormous costs to industry which will reflect upon business generally, those who keep records of consumer credit and, ultimately, those who take consumer credit who will have to pay the cost of the burdens that this Bill introduces. Fifthly, this Bill proposes substantial costs to revenue which the Government may, in fact, have not come clean about. I will establish that in due course. Sixthly, this Bill regulates consumer credit only, which means it leaves unregulated commercial credit, lease defaults, information contained in public records-all of those· areas-open to the kind of abuse that we . are opposed to. We would say that if we are going to protect privacy it ought to be protected in wider spheres than proposed by this amendment Bill. Seventhly, it denies access to consumer credit information to important sectors of the business and financial community. In particular, I will dwell upon real estate agents, general insurers and mercantile agents who, we say, have a legitimate interest in knowing credit information. Eighthly, this Bill will be an enormous imposition on small business. Yet again the Government, with misguided legislation, will introduce laws into this country which will impact severely and badly on a sector of the Australian economy which is already experiencing horrendous Limes. Let me go through each of these propositions and establish them one by one. Firstly, it is inappropriate to regulate keeping of consumer credit information in the Privacy Act which was introduced to protect citizens against the state. We say that this will lead to a confusion within the Act; it will lead to additional responsibilities by the Privacy Commission. The onerous obligations imposed upon the Privacy Commissioner under this Act will have the tendency, we say, to detract from what should be his real and primary obligation; namely, to protect citizens against the state. When I introduced a separate Bill to regulate financial reporting, there was a wave of support from the business community. The Australian Institute of Credit Management, in a statement issued shortly afterwards, said: The A.I.C.M. (WA. Division) whose members are responsible for managing the receivables of business at all levels in West Australia endorses  ister for Corporate Law Reform and Consumer Affairs in introducing alternative legislation to regulate financial reporting and protect privacy. The alternative legislation proposed by the Federal Member for Higgins has support from a wide range of industry groups who have always supported the need for balanced legislation in this area. The Credit Reporting Forum put out a pr.ess release on 18 October headed, 'Forum Supports Opposition's Privacy Bill'. It read as follows: Credit Reporting Forum, representing 42 industry and .business groups, strongly supports the alternative privacy legislation [Financial Information (Privacy) Bill] introduced by Peter Costello, Shadow Minister for Corporate Law Reform and Consumer Affairs. The Costello Bill is a balanced and effective alternative to the flawed and complicated Privacy Amendment Bill, introduced into the Senate last year . . . Despite its many amendments the Government's Bill continues to be opposed by a wide range of business groups, who believe it will lead to increased bad debt and fraud. Forum accepts the need for sensible, balanced privacy legislation. The Costello Bill answers all the objections raised by Professor Jack Richardson, ex Commonwealth Ombudsman, in his critical report on the Privacy Amendment Bill and has adopted many of the drafting proposals contained in that report. Who comprises the Credit. Reporting Forum-the Forum that supports my Bill and opposes the Government Bill? It comprises the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, the Australian Institute of Credit Management, the Australian Retailers Association, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Insurance Council of Australia· Ltd, the Retail Traders Association of New South Wales, and so on. In other words, all business supports the initiative that I have taken and opposes that of the Government, yet the Government proceeds in a foolhardy way. The Australian Finance Conference put out a press release on 17 October 1990 headed, 'AFC Endorses Costello Privacy Initiatives' which stated: The Australian Finance Conference, the national association of finance companies, has welcomed  Costello, Federal Member for Higgins and Shadow Minister for Corporate Law Reform and Consumer Affairs. The Costello initiative takes a fresh and open approach to the application of privacy principles to the use of necessary personal information data . . . The Privacy Amendment Bill, which was proposed by the then Consumer Affairs Minister, Senator Nick Bolkus, and is presently being considered by the Senate, was narrow and ill-informed in its preparation and ambit; all of the subsequent amendments have served only to highlight its flawed structure and complexity. The Real Estate Institute of Australia put out a press release on 18 October 1990 which stated: The Real Estate Institute of Australia rejects the Government's Privacy Amendment Bill and supports alternative privacy legislation introduced the Opposition in a Private Member's Bill today. ""The Government's Privacy Amendment Bill is conceptually flawed as it fails to meet the tive of enhancing privacy . . . The Privacy Amendment Bill if enacted will stop many legitimate businesses from accessing central credit reporting files. The Australian Credit Forum put out a media release to the same effect. In other words, this Bill is opposed by nearly the whole of Australian industry. Nearly the whole of Australian industry has taken a stand in support of the private member's Bill that I have introduced. This Bill is supported by few people, if anybody. It is fundamentally flawed, as anybody in the industry, anybody with an interest, knows. This House ought to decline to give it a second reading. Secondly, this Bill relies on artificial constitutional mechanisms. Proposed new section 18c of the Bill states that a person must not use an eligible communications services in the course of carrying on a credit reporting business unless the person is a corporation. Why is that the case? The reason that is the case is that the Commonwealth has sought to use its powers in relation to telegraphic and telephonic services to prohibit individuals carrying on credit reporting business unless they are corporations. If it can turn them into corporations, of course, it can regulate them under the corporations power, placitum 51 (xx). There are barriers on individuals in the course of trade or commerce carrying on credit reporting businesses, again to try to force individuals to become corporations so that the Commonwealth can get its tentacles into them. This Bill is not about regulating financial or trading corporations; it is about regulating credit reporting. Credit reporting is not a head of Commonwealth power under section 51 of the Constitution. This Bill is directed to using artificial and doubtful constitutional mechanisms in an attempt to bring this matter within the province of the Commonwealth Parliament. This should come as no surprise to the Government. I have obtained under freeby dom of information a letter from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the First Assistant Secreobjec- tary, Defence and Government Division, Department of Finance, dated 15 November 1989. It complains about the time that was given to the Human Rights Commission to assess the costs that would be incurred by the Human Rights Commission, and the Privacy Commissioner in particular, in administering this particular Bill. I will come to that in due course. The letter states: In that extremely short space of time we made a number of observations about the proposed legislation-including the fact that one of the clauses was unconstitutional . . . That is the Government's own advicethat it is unconstitutional legislation. It is doing it again. This will be the subject of constitutional challenge and members of the Government will have nobody but themselves to blame. Of course, this is within the constitutional province of the State governments. Why does not the Commonwealth Government leave it to the States to introduce a Bill such as this? Because it knows the States are opposed to this kind of regulation. Let me inform the House of some of the statements that have been made by State Ministers for consumer affairs. In a press release on 2 November, Chris Sumner said: I support the need to ensure that safeguards for positive reporting exist, but this should not be the expense of overturning the balance between consumer rights to privacy and industry rights to information. A press release on 22 October 1989 by Tom Roper stated: The Federal Privacy Bill will not help to stop people becoming financially overcommitted. On 25 October 1989, Mr Justice Charles Sheahan, the Chairman of the Queensland Privacy Committee, said: There is little point in introducing legislation which doe$ not significantly contribute to protecting individual privacy if it also introduces barriers to long established business huge costs to the Australian community. On 20 September 1989, Gerry Peacocke, the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, said: I strongly opposed the legislation and requested Senator Bolkus to withdraw it. Senator Bolkus would not withdraw it. Senator Tate, the new Minister, is far sensible to really believe in this kind legislation, but he is hamstrung as much as anybody by this misguided attempt by Senator Bolkus to introduce this legislation. I have also, for the information of the House, statements by other Ministers for consumer affairs in more recent times. Barbara Weise, the South Australian Minister for Consumer Affairs, on 13 August 1990 wrote 1'0 Senator Tate and said: The Commonwealth's Privacy Amendment Bill will, if it proceeds in its current form, significantly affect the capacity of credit providers to assess a consumer's capacity to repay . . . I also believe that it is important to balance the rights of consumers, particularly those to privacy and freedom from adverse effects of information, with the rights of credit providers, particularly that to sufficient information to make informed commercial decisions .. .1 would be grateful if you would set up a mechanism for detailed consultations with the States and Territories in this area. Gerry Peacocke wrote to Senator Tate on 16 August 1990 and as-ed: In accordance with the SCOCAM resolution . . . reconsider proceeding with this Bill in its current form, and to take part in detailed discussions with the States and Territories . . . My concerns, which I have· previously expressed, relate to the Bill's failure to balance the legitimate needs of business with the genuine needs of privacy. This becomes particularly imat portant in the context of the proposed uniform Credit legislation, and the increased obligations being placed on lenders to ensure that borrowers are reasonably capable of repaying loans . . . I understand that an alternative proposal for credit reporting legislation has been prepared by industry. I again urge you to consult with the States and Territories, and to consider the alternative legislation and all other legitimate concerns before proceeding with the Privacy Amendment Bill. So we could go on. This is a Bill that does not have the support of the responsible State Ministers. I also have a letter here from Jeff Carr, MLA, Minister for Small Business in Western Australia, dated practices and 3 September, which says: I am concerned that the Bill excludes legitimate businesses such as debt collecting agencies, real estate property managers and general insurance companies, from accessing credit information. Arguments for their exclusion have not convinced me of the merits of such exclusion. There you go. The State Ministers do not support it, business does not support too it and I do not think even Senator Tate of supports it. I wonder who does support it, for whoever does support it is bringing legislation into effect here in Australia which will have a dramatic effect on the way business does business, which will not adequately protect privacy, which is misguided and misconceived. I appeal to the Minister responsible, 'Do not feel, for the sake of pride, that you have to proceed with this misguided legislation. Stop, , think again, consult your State colleagues and come up with a better proposal'. A better proposal is, in fact, in this Parliament at the very moment. Fourthly, this proposal has enormous costs to industry. A report on the impact of these amendments on business and consumers was prepared by the Business Planning Group. The Business Planning Group had, among those supporting it, numbers of business groups-the Australian Retailers Association, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Insurance Council of Australia and everybody. It concluded as follows: The proposed amendments to the Privacy Act will have a substantial cost impact on both consumer and commercial lending. Additionally the legislation will have widespread impacts on nominally 'non-financial' sectors such as insurance, real estate, retailing, manufacturing, wholesaling and the public utilities. It must be assumed that these impacts were not foreseen or intended by Government. Extensive assessments by the principal industry sectors affected by this legislation, and outlined in this report, indicatewait for itan aggregate economic impact at a mmlmum annual level of $1275 million. Conservative possible estimates of the economic impacts range up to $2350 million per year. That is from the Business Planning Group. That is the effect of the legislation that the Government is proposing to introduce. The Government cannot dismissively wave it away and say, 'We will proceed with this nonetheless because we have commitments to whoever'. This is significant legislation with an enormous financial impact. We do not even know what the financial impact is going to be. There will be enormous cost to industry and, of course, industry will pass that on to consumers. That cost will be paid for by the whole of the community, with this misguided piece of legislation. Fifthly, there will be substantial costs to the revenue. I was very interested to see that, when the Minister introduced this Bill, he tendered an explanatory memorandum-and I presume he stands by it; he has not told us that he does not-which said under the heading 'Financial Impact Statement': The amendments will have a limited impact on Commonwealth expenditure. Additional staff for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be required. This is estimated to cost the Government in the order of $365,000 in the first full year of operation. This figure contains an establishment component. It is expected that the figure would drop to around $250,000 for a full year of operation. Does the Minister still stand by that? He sighs; I presume he does. One interesting piece of information that came out when I received the benefits of a freedom of information search was that the Government has been given very different information from that contained in the financial impact statement by the agencies concerned. When the matter first came up on 14 April 1989; an original cost estimate was made to Senator Bolkus that the financial impact would be $668,000 in 1989-90. There were then various revisions, but the last revision I have is a revision which came from the which are Privacy Commissioner on 9 May 1990. A brief was provided on the current status of the legislation, developments in relation to the legislation, resource implications for the privacy branch of the credit reporting legislation, and revised resource estimates. That said in May 1990 that there would be set-up costs in the first six months of $449,000, in subsequent sixmonth periods there would be costs of $279,000, and for the 1991-92 financial year the cost estimate was $558,000. That was the advice on 9 May 1990 from the Privacy Commissioner, the person who is going to administer this legislation. Yet the Government comes into this House with a financial impact statement which contains a cost estimate of $250,000 in a full 12-month period. The advice tendered to it was that for 1991-92 it would be double that amount. The Government has not come clean in its financial impact study. The Government has come into this Parliament and has made sure that· it has put forward a financial impact statement which does not disclose the whole of the truth, and it is about time that the Government came clean on that particular issue. Sixthly, this Bill is flawed because it regulates only consumer credit. That means that information about commercial credit falls outside the ambit of this Bill. We can keep records of commercial credit which contain things such as sexual characteristics of persons who have taken out credit or racial characteristics or all sorts of other characteristics because this Bill makes no attempt to regulate this field. It makes no attempt to get into other fields where effectively there will be a carte blanche for all of those practices that the Government ought to be opposed to. Nor will the Bill regulate the keeping of public information. If people can get material off public files, they can keep with that material anything they like. The Government has not sought to go into that area at all. This means that in the narrow area the regulation is strong, hard and fast but in the wider area, where it really counts, it does not exist. The Government has just let that go. It has made no attempt to protect privacy in those other areas. Yes, there are lots of attempts in the credit consumer area where all sorts of things that are· necessary for business will be prohibited but, in the other areas, no .attempt has been made to protect privacy. The Government's bona fides on that issue are very much suspect. Seventhly, this Bill denies access for people who have legitimate reasons for knowing where credit default has occurred and, in particular, consumer credit default. There has been a large debate in the course of this legislation as to whether or not real estate agents ought to have access to records of consumer credit and credit default. Of course it is material for agents who are letting out houses to know whether prospective tenants have records of significant credit failure; That is in interests of lessors and probably in the interests of lessees as well. But taking an ideological mindset against real estate agents, the Government says that the real estate agents are not allowed to have access to the information under this Bill. There is nothing to prevent the agents from setting up their own credit scheme, totally unregulated with all the information they want. The Government only wants to cut them out of the respectable credit reporting and leave them to go at large in relation to unrespectable credit reporting. People are not protected in that system; it only cuts out people with legitimate rights to know. General insurers also have no legitimate right to access credit information. General insurers do not use credit information to assess prima facie each and every insurance claim that comes along. If an insurance claim looks doubtful for one reason or another, it is relevant to know whether there is a history of credit default. Credit default can provide motive in cases of insurance fraud. Where there is a prima facie reason. to have a suspicion about a particular claim, insurers access credit information. They use it to protect against fraudulent claims, and stopping fraudulent claims protects honest policyholders whose premiums will go up to cover fraud if that does not occur. I refer also to mercantile agents. The Government has said that credit providers can have access to credit information. They can pass it on to a mercantile agent so that an agent can find out where the person is and sue for a debt. But the mercantile agent cannot have direct access to credit information. The Government is saying that all small business people, who use mercantile agents to collect debts, have to join a credit reporting system and have to pay their premiums so that they can get the information from the system and pass it on to the mercantile agent. In the past the mercantile agent joined up, paid a premium and the small businesses could go to the mercantile agent, take the advantage of that paid premium, and get the debt collection agency's services at a reduced rate. There the are economies of scale but the Government will not have a bar of that, either. This Bill means that there will be a large imposition on small businesses that currently use the services of mercantile agents to collect debts for them. It will not worry big companies as they have their pwn inhouse debt collection services. They will join the system and will still be able to operate. This is just another imposition on small business. The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is writing reports, responses to reports and all sorts of things about what he will do for small business. What has he to say about this particular proposal? Will he go to all of those small businesses and say, 'The way you keep your credit files has to be regulated by this incredibly complex Act.'? Will he say to them, 'You can no longer use mercantile agents to collect your debts. We do not agree with that kind of thing. Here is a nice bit of social engineering to cut you out of that particular market. We are the Government that is pledged to help you.'? This Government does not care about small business and this is just another indication. I will move an amendment to this particular Bill to ensure that this House recognises all of those matters and declines to give it a second reading. Debated interrupted. NA",115

142,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (10.31)It is my great pleasure and privilege tonight to read out two essays. I asked all the primary and secondary students in my electorate to write an essay on 'The Environment-the Challenge of the Future'. Indeed, I was inundated with responses, which was very gratifying, and in the short time available to me tonight I will endeavour to read both those winning essays. In the senior section the winner was Beth Mitchell from Ballarat and Clarendon College. She is in year 10. Her essay on 'The Environment-the Challenge of the Future' is as follows: The environment is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of our future. We face a growing problem with the Greenhouse Effect, ozone depletion, rapid over-population and the extinction of native flora and fauna. If we are to conserve the environment, we must find solutions or less damaging alternatives to our problems, for, while it is essential to protect our environment, it is also imp ott ant that we are practical. A compromise between total conservation· and economic and social realities must be met. The Greenhouse Effect is currently being tackled. Targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have been set at twenty per cent. Scientists have warned that the continued production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, could result in a one degree warming of the earth by 2025. Although a one degree temperature rise does not sound significant, it will lead. to drastic changes in the environment throughout the world. Ideally, we would .ban the consumption of greenhouse gases, but realistically we can only phase out the use of carbon dioxide and chlorofluoroc!lrbons. One way to do this would be to conserve energy by replacing fossil fuels, such as coal, wood, petroleum and natural gas, which produce carbon, with renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. Conservation of energy is the most important thing we can do to help reduce the Greenhouse Effect. The use of chlorofluorocarbons in some aerosol sprays, airconditioners, refrigerators, plastic foam packaging and some cleaning substances, is posing an enormous threat to our environment and ourselves. The release of CFCs into theatmosphere is causing the depletion of ozone, a gas which is found mainly in the stratosphere, a region of the atmosphere extending from the poles to the equator, to about fifty kilometres above the surface of the earth. Ozone absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. It is believed that a mere one per cent decline in the amount of ozone in the atmosphere could lead to a four to six per cent increase in some skin cancers. Already great reductions in the production of CFCs have taken place. By 1999, the amount of CFCs produced will have decreased by fifty per cent. The use of CFCs for aerosols and packaging will be banned soon, and their use in refrigeration and air conditioning will be phased out over a long period of time, which will also greatly reduce the Greenhouse Effect. It would be ideal but impractical to ban the use of CFCs today, for it would result in the collapses of industries. Although only present in small quantities, ozone is essential to the environment, and therefore should be preserved. Unless over-population is controlled, we are faced with an environmental disaster. The world's population, which is already 5.1 billion, increased by an amazing ninety million people last year. If population growth continues at the same rate, the world will add another billion by the year 2000. Population pressures are destroying the ment. As the population increases, Greenhouse Effect, ozone depletion, air and water pollution, loss of soils and, more importantly, loss of forests. A larger population puts on the world's resources, and requires the expansion of industries and cities. Therefore forestseek covered land is cleared for industrial and domestic use. The population growth is greater poorer nations of the developing world. not tell people to stop having children, but we can educate them to have smaller families. If we can give women greater economic and social opportunities in these nations, the birth rates drop. Our over-population problem is also affecting our wildlife, for the major human impact on the environment has been the destruction of habitats for wildlife. Millions upon millions of hectares forests are being cleared for industrial or tural needs. As a result, thousands of native and animal species have become extinct dangered throughout the world. Perhaps as aging as the loss of species is the introduction non-native species to an area. These newly introreport. duced species often take over the habitat and destroy native species. Sadly, even farmland is not being cared for properly and our challenge with the environment is even more difficult. Again it would be impractical to stop the world's of timber, but we should compromise, to achieve a balance with our incredible flora and fauna, that we can protect and preserve it. The environment may be the greatest challenge of the future, but it is one which must be fronted. If we are to meet this challenge, ever, we must educate our children. From early age, we should be aware of ways to and protect our environment. It is important to realise that each small effort is an important contribution to the preservation of our world's environment. We cannot expect Governments take all the initiatives, for it is every person's responsibility to make a healthy environment reality rather than an ideal. I publicly acknowledge the primary and secondary school children who contributed to this. I also thank my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the shadow Minister for the environment, who has made a great contribution and, indeed, looked at all these essays. After an extremely difficult decision, Beth Mitchell won the secondary. school prize. Adam Jackson, who is .in year 6 of the Smeaton primary school, won the primary school prize, and 1 hope to be able to read his essay tonight.",121

The degradation of one . of Australia's most environmentally and conculturally significant rivers because of howthese inconsistent management practices an is a matter of concern for all Australians conserve in the south-east of the continent. The report of the New South Wales Ombudsman reveals singularly unacceptto able behaviour by the Yass Shire Council, a the New South Wales Department of Water Resources and a company known as Tharwa Sands Pty Ltd, whose complicity has meant 15 years of sheer vandalism along the Murrumbidgee. Tharwa Sands is owned by the Ryles family, who have strong links with the National Party of Australia and espouse many of the environmental values of that Party. Mr John Ryles Snr was founding director of the notorious Nat Contributions Pty Ltd , the National Party slush fund for New South Wales. Mr John Ryles Jnr proved himself equally notorious two years ago when he took a bulldozer on a 6 112 kilometre joyride through Namadgi National Park. On the Murrumbidgee, the Hyles company has mined without licences, erected one low-level bridge without permission and attempted to erect another, and realigned shire roads without permission. The company removed the entire bank of one section of the river to sell as loam and was given Yass Council's consent after the deed was done. Yass Council's view of the miners is epitomised by the Shire Clerk's attitude to them. The Shire Clerk calls them 'pioneers'. Former Liberal senator David Hamer put it more accurately when he described them as 'wanton despoilers' at Senate committee hearings on the river in 1981. Now the Ombudsman has found the Hyles family guilty of 'many instances of blatant illegal activity' and of the nation. 'quite blatantly exploiting the deficiencies in the system'. The Yass Council and the New South Wales Department of Water Resources emerge guilty of a plethora of misfeasances and nonfeasances, the most damning perhaps being the Shire Clerk's attempt to extend in a telephone conversation the company's right to mine the river. The agreement to mine recorded a resolution which the Shire Clerk and the company lawyer had agreed to over the phone but which was not the same as that which had been before the Council. Furthermore, Yass. ratepayers will be pleased to know that the company paid an average of $25 a month-a quite miserable amount; in fact, a peppercorn rent-for the massive damage inflicted by its trucks on shire roads for the past 15 years. Tharwa Sands set up its operation on the river 15 years ago to supply Boral Besser. Boral Besser broke its contract with Tharwa in 1980. If Tharwa Sands had not been closed down because of its illegal activity by then, its operations should certainly have been stopped when the need was no longer present. But it still has not been stopped. This is a sorry saga of appalling behaviour on a major Australian river. In view of the damage done to the river by this. and other mine sites on the Murrumbidgee, I will be recommending that the Commonwealth Government ensures that Murrumbidgee sand is not used on Commonwealth projects or Commonwealth funded projects in future. Proceedings of the Parliament",122
146,Mr BEALE,ADJOURNMENT,"There were some extraordinary comments in the print media this moming following the conduct of the business in the House yesterday. However, the most extraordinary article of all came from Mike Seccombe of the Sydney Morning Herald. To start with, the report compared the events in our national Parliament with some form of mythical cricket match. It should be understood that in this chamber we are concerned not with that form of flippant comparison but with the serious affairs of This is not in any way to downplay the role of cricket in our society and certainly not to downplay the great achievements of our national cricket team. However, the first recession that the economy has had for eight years is certainly a matter of real importance for this Parliament. The depth of that recession is not yet fully known, although it is clear that the worse is yet to come and that some organisations, such as the Salvation Army, think that the economic downturn will be the worse since the Second World War. We are dealing here with the great social strains that arise from recessions; namely, unemployment, declining asset values, housing difficulties, welfare problems, and all the human misery that goes with those strains. The article seemed to suggest that we should have commenced proceedings by asking a series of questions that might embarrass the Government. The result of that would have been the usual abuse of Question Time by the Government and a failure by it to come to terms with the economic disaster that it has perpetrated on the Australian community. As it was, our tactics did provoke an admission from the Government that it had deliberately planned the recession. The article says of that, 'big deal'. Despite that sarcastic comment, that is a big deal, because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have stated consistently over many months that there would be no recession. What we chose to do was to take the unusual and important step of immediately moving a censure' motion against the Government forJ..ts"" economic policies: This is a most serious matter and it was treated as such. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) clearly and incisively exposed the failure of the Government's policies and proposed alternatives. But, in response, all the Prime Minister could do was tip a bucket on the. Opposition without addressing the real issues facing Australia. To use a Mike Seccombe analogy, 'Hewson bowled out Hawke'. The article said that 'Peter Reith's speech is best forgotten'. I have not forgotten the Deputy Leader's speech, which was a measured, sombre and effective analysis of how badly this Government has failed our country. It was a presentation consistent with our difficult times. The article goes on to praise John Howard's vision and speaking capabilities and then refers to him as 'the hapless Mr Howard'. This is an appalling and inconsistent reporting effort, as was the stupid speculation about changes amongst senior members of our front bench. On the most important issue facing Australia at present, our economic crisis, what could be more relevant than putting forward our Leader and Deputy Leader as the speakers before the inevitable guillotine fell? that is the best that Mike Seccombe can do, he should depart as a political commentator and become a cricket writer. Blue Nursing Service",123
147,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"1 take the opportunity that has been provided to me this evening to talk about a very imMoreton portant organisation in my electorate which services the needs of the whole Queensland-that is, the Blue Nursing Service. I am proud to have within the electorate of Moreton a number of facilihalf ties that are provided by the Blue Nursing Service and would like to give particular praise to the people involved in that ganisation and the care and compassion that they provide to the people in my electorate. , I know that many honourable members will be aware of the fact that the Blue Nursing Service does provide a diverse range of services to people and that it is not simply, as its name may suggest, a nursing service, although it does that work very well, But the Service does provide a range of other facilities as well. We are all aware, of course, of the home care role of the Blue Nursing Service where nurses regularly visit people in their homes and provide medication and other services to those people who are in need of care. In my electorate and in other places throughout the State, and indeed the country, it also provides services such as day therapy centres, nursing homes and hostels. The Brisbane central division of the Blue Nursing Service is led by a very capable man-the general manager, Trevor Owens. I have had many dealings with Trevor Owens in the last few months since my election. I am proud to say that I can call him a friend and a person who I am pleased to have working very hard in my electorate because he is a man of great compassion, who cares for and is concerned about the aged and the infirm. Of particular note is a lady whom I am also pleased to have working in my electorate, Dawn Moorhead. Dawn is the director of nursing at the Salvin Park Complex in my electorate of Moreton. The Salvin Park Complex has about 170 If people in its care, incorporating both a hostel and a nursing home. I do not think that one could find a facility anywhere in Australia which cares better for the needs of our aged people than the Salvin Park Complex. It is certainly a credit to the Blue Nursing Service and to Queensland. I also have within the electorate of a number of other facilities provided by the Blue Nursing Service. Within of the Salvin Park Complex is the Harold Mann Day Therapy Centre, which I had the great honour to declare open on beof the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) a few weeks ago. It was named after Harold Mann, orwho is the former chairman of the Blue Nursing Service and who is unfortunately battling severe ill health at present. Our best wishes go to Harold. Also in the electorate is the Mount Gravatt Day Therapy Centre, run by the Blue Nursing Service, which also plays an important role in our community by caring for the aged and the infirm. It is certainly a pleasure to have in the House today the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services because I would like to address a couple of comments to him. Without doubt the Minister is one of the most outstanding Ministers in this House. For that reason, I address my last comments to the Minister and remind him of the great work that the Blue Nursing Service provides to the electorate of Moreton and to the area of Brisbane, and to also commend him for his decision to provide $355,000 for the construction of a dementia care unit in the Salvin Park Complex. There is one small problem with this unit and it is that which I would like to talk about briefly this evening. The Blue Nursing Service, in its'nursing home at Salvin Park, provides 104 nursing home beds. When the admirable decision was made by the Government to provide funding for the dementia care unit, it unfortunately decided that the 12 beds that would be provided would have to be taken out of the nursing home allocation. I fully support the Government's policy that we need to have more beds in hostels and nursing homes around Australia, in areas that are not currently iced. It is very important that areas such as Moreton do not lose beds, so I ask the Minister to consider granting those beds to the dementia care unit.",124

I wish to express my support for the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) yesterday on the Gulf crisis and the involvement of our forces in the Gulf region in support of the great principles that are at stake. There can be only one solution to this crisis, and that is for Iraq to withdraw' from Kuwait. That is what United Nations resolution 678 is all about, and that is why we support it in words and in actions. I wish also to endorse the call of my colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) for a greater engagement in prayer. As he said, more things are wrought by prayer in this world than we dream. I join with him in calling on our leaders, the leaders of the churches and all God-fearing Australians for a concerted program of prayer for the peaceful resolution of the crisis, with the focus of that prayer that the initial aggressor withdraw from Kuwait. The Gulf situation is very grave, fraught with an awful potential for loss of life, but it has momentous consequences for the future of the world, freedom, justice, resistance to tyranny and terror and the pursuit of order in the world. Literacy Achievement Awards",125
150,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I do not intend to ask the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is now at the table, for extra funding for dementia care in the electorate of Throsby. I will do that tomorrow when I have a deputation here from Mayflower Retirement Village at Gerringong. Tonight I wish to share with the House the honour I had today of attending in the Mural Hall, Parliament House, the servliteracy achievement awards for 1990. Honourable members will be aware that 1990 has been International Literacy Year and I hope, in ,common with other members of this House, that what has been achieved both nationally and internationally in this most important year will be only the beginning. We hope that from this beginning we can go on with the quest to make literacy the achievable goal that all of us should be striving for. I was particularly pleased on a couple of counts. I am a member of the National Consultative Council for International Literacy Year and have been in that position for over a year. One of my constituents received one of the 18 national awards that were given today. The award was made to Margrit Stocker of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) for an innovative workplace program. I congratulate Margrit Stocker, a person whom I have known for many years. I followed her career when she worked at the Wollongong College of Technical and Further Education in the literacy field until the time she took her position at BHP. I have had many discussions with her on the work that she has been doing there. I was delighted when today she achieved a national award for innovation in the workplace. I also congratulate BHP, which I rarely do in this place, on the support the company has given to this important year and to programs such as that followed by Margrit Stocker. A wide range of people from diverse backgrounds won awards today. We all know that it is not always the toilers in the field who gain awards. Personally, I did not envy the judges who had to make these very difficult decisions. I commend all those who have worked so hard this past year in the area of literacy. I refer to people such as Val Dolan from Cringila Primary School, who has developed a series of four books in a very innovative program. The Cringila area has a diverse ethnic background. I also refer to Hazel Brown of Albion Park Rail School, and to Ursula Stephens of Goulburn. I am familiar with the work of these people and commend them for their efforts. I also commend the secretariat of the International Literacy Year, and Margaret Whitlam, who has ably chaired the committee throughout the year. I also pay tribute to Julian Disney, who took the chair when unfortunately Mrs Whitlam was ill. Literacy does concern us all, be it literacy in the work force, in schools, amongst those with disabilities or amongst new settlers to Australia. Illiteracy, whiCh this country many millions of dollars each year, is too high a price. We hear a lot about the clever country,' how we should be striving to be the clever country and whether we are the lucky country, but if we are going to achieve any of those goals we should be becoming the literate country. Illiteracy is a problem not only in Australia but' in many of the countries around us. I was very pleased that, of the money provided by the Federal Government for this ,important year, some of it went to some of the nations around us. Again, I congratulate all the award winners and all those who have toiled so hard during the past year in the field of literacy. Army Reserve",125
151,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I rise to speak in the adjournment debate to highlight the crisis currently affecting the Army Reserve. Despite the fact that the Government has not as yet considered the Wrigley report and despite the fact that a committee of this Parliament is currently examining the role and function of the Reserve, the Government and the Regular Army appear hell-bent on gutting the Army Reserve.",126
152,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,It is a shame.,126
153,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a shame. I have spoken on this subject previously, labelling the proposed cuts 'Operation Chaos'. Chaos, I regret to say, continues and has entered a phase which will mean cutbacks throl.Jghout Australia. The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, has said that these cuts are necessary to allow for expenditure in other higher priority areas. The simple fact, Mr Speaker, is that the Regular Army has led the Government up the garden path into a quagmire. The savings proposed are as mythical as the fairies at the bottom of that garden. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the objective of these cuts is to reduce the operational capability of the Army Reserve. The reorganisation planned by the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Major General Mike Jeffrey, will actually result in increased costs. As a part of the procosts posed cost cutting, the 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment is being amalgamated with the 8/13 Victorian Mounted Rifles. As a result, it will command two depots in New South Wales, three depots in Gippsland, one in Kyneton and two in Melbourne-a logistic and command impossibility. It has to be asked: to what extent will costs rise due to the need to command, from Sydney, 4 Brigade' and 6 Engineer Group in Victoria, plus 9 Brigade in South Australia? Has the Government placed an estimate on the costs of transporting personnel to and from Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney for conferences, supervision and training? How do those estimates compare with those associated with the current system? The Government, in a subtle move, is having a second attempt at these mythical savings. Having butchered its way through the Reserves in Land Command, it has now drawn up proposals to gut Training Command as well. The cuts are primarily targeted against the Reserve Command and Staff College, and the university regiments. The Government has decided to remove from the Command 600 positions, commencing in March 1991. Mr Ronaldson-Not good enough.",126
154,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is not good enough; it is a disgrace. Victoria will once again bear the brunt of these cuts, and will lose up to 200 of the 1,000 Training Command positions that it has. These cuts are being made across the board. The Regular Army has not bothered to calculate the savings made by dispensing with colonels as against privates. It wants 600 heads and appears to have no interest in the financial costs involved. The Army Reserve in fact offered to reduce costs by reducing the man day entitlement of each member by two days per year. This would have produced a cost saving equal to the proposed cuts. The Government would, of course, be aware that this is an increasingly common cost saving measure in industry today because of the Government induced recession. The Regular Army responded bluntly that it was not interested in this saving.' It said that the cuts are not an economy move, but in fact are a 'capability reduction'. Is it now Government policy to reduce the capability of the Reserve, or is it in fact the secret agenda of the regulars? It is a sad comment that there are three factors working against the Army Reserve in Australia. The first is the appearance of the civil and military bureaucrat who has no understanding of the quality of the citizen soldier. The second is the constant search for economies. The third is growing defence centralism which is justified by simple arithmetic, but without any accountability for its deadening, destructive impact. Mr Speaker, the Army Reserve is being gutted by a short sighted Labor government which has been promised savings which will not eventuate, and by elements of the Regular Army unable to recognise the lessons of Australian military history. Environment",127
155,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (10.59)Mr Speaker, earlier this evening I spoke about a primary and secondary school environment essay competition. I now seek to read the winning essay by Adam Jackson, a year 6 student at Smeaton Primary School: In the world today, there is new technology which is achieving more each day, countries are getting bigger and stronger and the poor countries are being provided with a number of trades and also medical aid and food, but out of all these expanding topics, the environment is one of the most least beneficial areas. The growing population of the world is using up most of the world's minerals, fauna and vegetation. Now what we have is a polluted, dying world and there are also cracks forming in the ozone layer which is something that should not be ignored. We are losing the beauty of the world and turning it into skyscrapers and concrete slabs. The world has already lost many of it's beautiful species of animals-",127

The following answers to questions were circulated: Food Irradiation (Question No. 124) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 21 August 1990: (1) Is the CSIRO laboratory at Cannon Hill, Qld, carrying out research on food irradiation; if so, (a) what is the nature of the research, (b) when is the research project expected to be completed, (c) how is the research funded, (d) how much was spent on the research in (i) 1986-87, (ii) 1987-88, (iii) 1988-89 and (iv) 1989-90, and (e) if there are any reports of the results of the research, are they available; if not, why not. (2) If the research is being carried out, is it directly involved with investigating the health implications of food irradiation; if not, is propriate for CSIRO to be. conducting research to advance the cause of food irradiation in view of the Government's announced moratorium on food irradiation in Australia. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (1) (a) The research is part of a program aimed at extending the storage life and improving the quality, shelf-life and safety of fresh and processed meats. A variety of meats have been subject to low doses of irradiation, with the actual procedure being done at Lucas Heights. (1) (b) This work will be terminated by 30 June 1991. (1) (c) Funding has been from both appropriation and rural industry sources. (1) (d) It is difficult to determine the amount spent on irradiation research because it was not a separate program but a minor component of a larger series of experiments. (1) (e) There are reports of the results of the research. These take the form of research publications, items in the divisional report, and reports submitted to the Rural Industry Research Fund. All except the latter are available. (2) The research is not involved with investigating the health implications of food irradiation. The questioner assumes that conducting research in this area advances the cause of food irradiation-this is not necessarily the case. The ability to use this technology would faciliKazak, tate export of certain products. Having the information from these experiments available means that Australia will be in a position to take advantage of this technology on export markets should NA appropriate opportumtles arise. Because of the Government's moratorium, the Laboratory Management had previously decided that it would be appropriate to close the program when the current series of experiments are completed; ie. by July 1991. This decision should not be seen iiS implying any judgement as to the safety of food irradiation since the experiments are unrelated to the health implications of this technology. It reflects the realities of the likelihood of implementation in the near future. Visas: Palestine Liberation Organisation (Question No. 238) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs it ap- and Trade, upon notice, on 19 September 1990: Is the issue of visas to staff of the Palestine Liberation Organisation office in Australia being delayed; if so, (a) what are the main factors contributing to the delay and (b) what measures will be taken to overcome the delay.",127
157,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b) The Palestine Liberation Organisation has requested Australia's in-principle agreement to the issue of visas to PLO officials to staff the PLO Office in Canberra. The PLO has not yet sought visas for specific PLO officials pending this in-principle agreement. The Government is still considering the PLO request. But it is relevant that I said in a news release on 21 June this year concerning the I;lttempted raid on Israel by the Palestine Liberation Front that the Government would avoid any new gesture for the immediate future which would detract from the seriousness with which we view the PLF's action. This situation has been reinforced by the PLO's attitude to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, on which the Prime Minister commented in Parliament on 22 August. The PLO Representative in Australia, Mr Ali is an Australian citizen. While the matter of visas remains under consideration, there is nothing to prevent Mr Kazak from employing other Australian citizens in his office, including of course those of Palestinian descent. Industry, Technology and Commerce: Access and Equity Plan (Question No. 244)",130
158,Mr RUDDOCK,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Indus'try, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 19 September 1990: With respect to each of the Departments and agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, (a) when (i) was the first round Access and Equity Plan published and (ii) will the second round Access and Equity Plan be published, (b) what mechanisms have been set up, including at the regional level, to ensure ongoing consultation on access and equity with community organisations, (c) which community organisations or representatives are involved in such mechanisms, (d) which officer has major responsibilities for access and equity in the Department or agency and what is the officer's position and (e) what are the names and contact telephone numbers of the access and equity officers in each region.

159,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the associa- honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (1) Between 1987 and March 1989, Telecom's national policy was to charge all developers for any external lead-in or reticulation cabling which extended greatet than 300 metres from the point where the cabling entered the property development. On 1 March 1989 Telecom introduced new policy arrangements. For normal residential subdivisions which were contiguous to existing Telecom public network infrastructure, Telecom waived all charges for external cable reticulation where the developer provided a suitable shared trench and co-ordination of works. For all other types of development Telecom charged the develfor all external lead-in or reticulation cabling provided at the development stage. On 11 October 1989 a concession was introduced, with charging only applying to cabling extending beyond 30 metres of the point where the cable entered the development or the first external point of distribution on the development whichever was the lesser distance. From 23 July 1990, Telecom extended to all residential end use developments the concession of not charging for lead-in or reticulation cabling in return for use of a suitable shared trench and co-ordination of works. (a) Refer to above. (b) Charging should have been in line with the national policies outlined above. It is not practicable however for Telecom to state categorically that these policies were followed at all times. (c) Prior'to 1 July 1989: Telecommunications Act 1975, Section 106, and Telecommunications (General) By-Law 33. From 1 July 1989: Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989, Sections 19 & 29. (d) Not applicable. Country Telephone Directories (Question No. 313)  Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 20 September 1990: (1) With respect to the Western Australian country telephone directories for (a) 1988, (b) 1989 and (c) 1990, (i) what did it cost to print, produce and deliver the directories, (ii) how many directories, in total, were distributed and (iii) how many pages did each individual directory contain. (2) Did Telecom formally consult with any business organisations, such as the Chamber of Commerce or the Australian Small Business Association, before deciding to change from one Western Australian country telephone directory to three.",132
160,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (1) (i) The cost information associated with the phone. printing, production and distribution of the directories is subject to tenders and is considered by Telecom to be commercial-in-confidence. (ii) The following table shows the number of books ordered and distributed: 1988 1989 1990 WI 131,464 129,000 126,038 W2 102,184 113,850 108,004 170,180 188,400 W3 185,984 (iii) The following table lists the number of pages in each telephone book: 1988 1989 1990 WI 636 704 774 W2 612 688 736 W3 822 896 960 (2) Yes. Telecom formally consulted a number of Chambers of Commerce including Bunbury, Albany, Kalgoorlie and Geraldton, as well as the Country Shire Councils Association. Telephone Lines for Fax Machines (Question No. 315)  Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 20 September 1990: (1) Did Telecom, prior to his predecessor's statement of 25 May 1988, charge small business people who applied for an additional telephone line for the installation of a fax machine for a line upgrade at up to four times the normal telephone connection fee; if so (a) was the charge imposed legally, (b) with respect to businesses in the south-west of Western Australia, (i) on how many occasions was the charge levied and (ii) what total sum was collected and (c) if the charge was not imposed legally, will he direct Telecom to refund the money collected.",133
161,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (1) Telecom has advised that between September 1987 and April 1988, its national policy was to apply a commercial charge where additional cabling work was required for provision of a second or subsequent service on a property at which the applicant already had a telephone service. The commercially-assessed charge related to all cabling work beyond the customer's property entry point and was applied in addition to the appropriate standard connection fee.
