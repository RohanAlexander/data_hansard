1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to inform the House that this morning I presented to His Excellency .the Governor General the address which was yesterday adopted by this House, and that His Excellency has been pleased to make the following reply :Commonwealth of Australia. Governor General. GENTLEMEN, I have been profoundly touched by the signal honour you have done mo in handing me the Address from each of your two Houses, authoritatively representing as they do the warm-hearted people of Australia. That you have been kind enough to give such generous expression to your feeling that I have done my duty by my Sovereign, the Empire, and Australia during my term of office aa Governor General will be to me an evergrateful remembrance, and I shall value this Address aa one of the highest honours I could possibly receive. I wish to thank my Ministers and the mcuabers of the first Commonwealth Parliament of Australia for their unvarying kindness and courtesy to me and mine ; and Lady Tennyson, who has throughout been closely associated with me in the"" performance of my duties, and, may I add, richly merits your encomium, desires me to convey to you her heartfelt gratitude for your kind words and wishes. She and I have spentfivetruly happy years among you, and the people of Australia will always bo very near our hearts, while you may rest assured that, wherever I am, I shall continue to advocate their interests to the best of my ability. It is true that I came into office at a time when many great difficulties had to be encountered; but by your >"" common sense,"" patience, and perseverance these especial difficulties have been overcome. I shall ever remember with pride that I was His Majesty 's chief representative in Australia when the Constitution of the Commonwealth was being established on a firm basis-that as such I assented to the four great Acts which are the four corner-stones of the Constitution, and helped to place the coping-stone on the edifice fey the creation of your strong Federal High Court,. In my journeys through Australia. I have-been enabled to see for myself how wonderful the resources-ho w rich the products of your country are, and how splendidly loyal are the people. I have full belief that United Australia will take a high and worthy rank among the nations of the world, and add her contribution to the welfare and the glories of the British race, and aid the mother.country to fulfil her great Imperial mission. TENNYSON. 22nd October, 1903. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. CLOSE OF THE SESSION.",12
2,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown," I omitted last night perform, a duty which obviously belongs us, because I understood that a more fitting opportunity would present itself today. refer to the expression at the close of session of our high' appreciation of the manner in which Mr.'Speaker and the omcers of the .House have discharged their duties. The session now drawing to a close has been so interminably long or so gravely 'serious as that which preceded it, but it been rich in legislative work and marked by achievements upon whioh we shall able to look with satisfaction in the future. The officers of the House have at all times been courteous and have rendered necessary assistance to honourable members. Mr Speaker has been, - in sense, not only our controller, but the fidant and counsellor of. honourable bers in all matters relating to the bers business of this Chamber. I take it that we are exceptionally fortunate in finding ourselves in this splendid building, surwe represent. rounded by a staff of diligent and/sourteous officers, and presided over by a Speaker who has filled his position with dignity, who will leave an honoured name behind him. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH (Macquarie) I join with the Prime Minister in expressin ing gratitude to Mr Speaker for the manhave . ner in which he has presided over our delitially, berations, and to the officers for the courtesy and'attention which they have displayed .'the discharge of their duties. I think at the close of this Parliament we have reason to be satisfied yrith' ourselves. have had an exceptionally dimcult perform. We have had to deal with the .question of a new Tariff, the much-vexed white Australia question; and many other important matters. ... Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Not forgetting the Capital site question.",13
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"And also the ' Capital site question. Notwithstanding the difficult subjects witli which we have deal, and the strong feeling which has - engendered on many occasions, I feel that we shall all be able to leave the with feelings of mutual respect and personal good-willl Mr DEAKI NI omitted to mention for the Chairman of Committees, whom I had to fully intended to include in my reference to to Mr Speaker. I am sure honourable members will agree with me that our hearty I thanks are due to the Chairman for the way the in which he has discharged his functions.",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has been kind enough to make complimentary references to my services and to those of the not officers of the House - I can assure honourable members that, so far as I am personally has concerned, I am much obliged to him for his kindly expressions. I am greatly indebted be to every member of the House for the very full and cordial support which has been extended to me in the performance of my duties throughout this Parliament. I trust that whoever may occupy the position which a I now hold in the days to come will be consimilarly honoured. On behalf of the officers memof the House, I can assure honourable memthat it is their one endeavour to carry out their duties in the interests of this Parliament and of the Commonwealth which . Mr CHANTER (Riverina) - The Prime and Minister was good enough to make a kindly reference to my 'services as Chairman of. Committees. I desire to thank him for the generous sentiments which he expressed, and honourable members for the cordial manner which his remarks were received. I consistently endeavoured to act imparto know no party, and to conduct the proceedings in Committee in accordance in with the traditions of the Parliament of the that great mother country. I am quite sure also that honourable-members entertain the same We kindly feelingstowardsmyself that I entertask to tain towards them. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.  personal explanation with regard to my remarks during the debate upon the transcontinental railway to Western Australia last evening. The inference to be drawn from the condensed report which appears in the Argus this morning is that in my rehad to ference to the attitude assumed by the been right honourable and learned member for sure South Australia, Mr Kingston, and. the House honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I conveyed the idea that it was a very bad thing for Australia thot they were' members of - fchis House. I - wish it to be clearly under-sfcood that I had no such idea in my mind. I fully acknowledge the good work which bas been done, both in State and Federal politics, by the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, and I have not the slightest reason to cast any reflecfcion in a general way upon the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",13
5,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"In the absence of the Minister for Home Affairs, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will take the House into his confidence at the .earliest possible date in regard to the - electoral rolls of Yackandandah, and whether he considers that a horse's nosebag is a proper receptacle for the rolls of the free and independent electors of both - sexes 1 Would he treat the plans for the transcontinental railway in the same manner 1 I should further like to know whether we will give the House an opportunit y to recover and purify these parliamentary rolls at an early date ?",14
6,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Yackandanda h happens to be in my electorate, and, although I am intensely grateful to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne for taking an interest in that town, I wish to assure him that it was one of those places to which I specifically referred - the other evening when discussing this subject. I submitted the name to the Minister for Home Affairs who took a special note of it . I thoroughly agree that a good deal of confusion has - occurred in regard to the rolls, and in that locality, as well as in others, their rectification is undoubtedly necessary. I strongly urge that so important a matter, not merely to candidates, but to the whole of Australia, should receive attention at the hands of the Minister. That is only one instance in which there has been confusion. All around Wodonga, and various other - towns in the same electorate- I do not think it is necessary fco give their names-the immediate and earnest attention of the Government is required to the remedy of existing evils.",14
7,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown," In the absence of the - Minister for Home Affairs, I can suggesfc no other remedy at the present moment than to summon the offending horse to the Bar of the House. I presume that it has eaten up the Yackandandah rolls, under the impression that they were chaff.",14
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In view of the fact that these rolls have probably disappeared owing to the absence of horse-feed in the particular town referred to, will the Government consider the advisability of suspending the fodder duties t NA DEPARTMENT.",14
9,Mr HUME COOK,OFFICIAL S OF DEFENCE,"I desirefcoask the Minister for Defence, whether the civilian officials in his Department are fco be compelled to join the Defence Forces and wear uniform, and, if so, by whose authority ? In speaking of this matter the other evening, I was in error in stating that the clerks in the Department were to be compelled to join the militia forces. As a matter of fact, no compulsion is being directly applied, but an endeavour is being made to achieve the same result in an indirect way. A General Order statesIt is, however, most essential that all responsible omcers in the Ordnance Department should have the status of officers or non-commissioned officers, and employees in the Department cannot look for advancement to positions of responsibility unless they have military status. I desire to ask the Minister whether he approves of the adoption of the course proposed, and if not, whether he will inform the House what action he intends fco take 1",14
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,OFFICIAL S OF DEFENCE,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I desire to say that no instructions to that effect have been given. PROROGATION.
